off I mean they are some strange and sloppy drunks they really are\nAll you have to do is go down the K Street and I both Democrats and Republicans are sharing the same bar near there and that's the thing\nThat I think a lot of people are starting to understand about some of our you know that when people call up and they say there's really not much of a difference between the two sides of the aisle you're kind a write in a sense\nIn that it it's kinda like pro wrestling\nYou donate where these guys are are ... at the mouth and their hatred for each other and I go to the director US military you out you know that after the match they go and they you know kill a couple of twelve packs a beer together it's kind of the same thing with your with your politicians are senators and congressmen\nAnd even the media journalists you know\nThey act like they hate each other state in God's meanwhile you know they're the they're buddy buddy behind the scenes they're they're working

this for a fact a lot of your politicians you know who they party with you know who they're hitting the bars with\nFreaking press corps they all go to the same places man it's unbelievable\nSo now I think if you if you you put that ... that magnifying glass on our on our politicians on our congresspeople\n[laughter] barrel ... very few of them would\nSurvive such scrutiny as a Brett Kavanaugh has endured not only are in this confirmation process but also a in his life or as a as a justice or at various levels with the federal government he said six of these FBI background checks which are a
