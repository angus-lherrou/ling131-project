Jersey that was my ... I was in a small area in a way that will show\nThat it was ... and I wouldn't give them the ... nations and they were ... so that's just so there I'm sure that our clients\nSo let me ask you this and all because one of the things that I talked about the school allows for the last number of weeks\nIs is about the the relatively than a a slow that there is it a lot of these crypto currency and you know there's a\nNumber of people out there that are just they trade the snot out of it and they're they trade the snot out of it was somebody else it today take Jay trade to start out of it and then there's actually some pretty large flows tried to get their way up\nAnd in fact we we know of of some some big blocks that are trying to trade privately so that they could actually get the size that they needed and the other haggling over what kind of discount they get or so on and so forth what do you believe that I certainly kind of believe that one of the things that will really help crypto\nIs is a little bit more standard as they should in regards to to the trading platforms of where you can actually access the securities for access the coins\nSo this is a problem uh I I was shown on ...\nI don't know how that will be able to regulate this I mean there were two thousand names right now on the market account and many of them only ... hundred thousand dollars a day ... million dollars a day which means you go in my now ... ... dollars cello hundred thousand dollars without him\nWithout um limit rocket and not on the other side I think the next and that creates a Honda issue elation and it has its Kurdish relating to come in and I've asked you return was I'm just saw less than well when you buy\nTwo or three times load is all happening on the dollar I'm In my mind has five channels that seemed Alison\nShareholders online orders it only takes a few bad apples cause chaos or are they\nIn these names and you really know how to recognize when a name was manipulative and we used to run those letters long candles analysts tell you there's so much time on someone's attempt to manipulate\n[noise] so so very arid folks said that that they are running the contrary and there's a link to you know what I Love red candle there's a bias and not a cell by any stretch imagination especially if you're committed to the space in the long term and unfortunately you know that they talk about the hurdles\nWell you know I'm part of the problem I think is is that there are a lot of people that have tried to come in with technical analysis and do day training and a federally trained at market and are really count it probably just chewing themselves up where they take a little bit longer view\nAnd and look at things kind of what some of the houses that are there Ronnie gives you\nA and look at it over a span of several years you're gonna do yourself a lot a lot better yeah I'm In a way the way that you slice it so I'm just wondering why is all you that are out there that are involved in the crypto space\nYou know you might want to link that out your time arrives at a little bit and relax because the block changes for real or running about why is this for real and and basically the coins that you're at the all the lessons\nAre what are you going like this one of the goings will they will be All right\nWell thank you my name's last more than ... I was younger than I Am since January I Know that is really are I mean Ninety five hours for these names are scams ... there's no way ... show the wild west okay\nAnd I'm you know I'm a [noise] I I tell you all\nDon't try to be a hero in just focus on the names that are twenty five or ... which is the way if you are making money in the non stop Twenty years ago the markets and stave off during the not all going by Johnny ... and and\nEven not calm my sister in the Amazon Microsoft and you don't have an ... on the top twenty in ... now don't go into court or trying to make a million dollars over and I was when I was among many\nWell I'll tell you what ladies and gentlemen I couldn't solve it up better that kind of that's kind of a sudden the bumper sticker although it might be a little bit longer to good bumper sticker for the school how segment running I Want to thank you so much for your time look forward to getting to meet you personally\nThat hopefully we'll get your back into the wild west crypto show ... or ... or by some estimates running wild west group do so you can find a everywhere\nTo yeah they have and morals in one local regional national world by bringing use atmosphere [noise]\nFrom ABC News ...
