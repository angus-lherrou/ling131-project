dot com\nBust right where you\nBut they are smart dog fight welcome\nBack to the Lars Larson show it's a busy Monday\nA lot of things going on tonight and uh we've\nWell we've talked from time to time about the powers that were put in the hands of government power is derived from the people of the United states and the founders actually built a really brilliant structure they plan for a fairly weak president even though\nA lot of us give a lot of deference to the president to president as an office is actually a a very weak office um they get most of the power to the Congress and they gave a certain amount of power to do do do Sheree\nBut right now the Congress acts as though it doesn't decide much of anything uh in fact they're they're they almost act as the um the veto that is there the place where a lot of good ideas go to die\nFortunately there are a lot of bad ideas that go to Congress that also died a wall is alive so bad he knows I'm sure you're followed the American Enterprise Institute and the author of traditional ... the last chance to rein in the administrator in ministry upstate the books actually out tomorrow are doing better\nI'm doing well how about you\nI'm doing fine if you tell me that I got all of that right this is all about generally true\nAbsolutely actually it's a very very good summary of the problem\nI mean because people always think of the president's most and I said from time to time the single most powerful individual in the world and he is on some very specific things and he's not powerful at all a whole bunch of things he can spend a dime without Congress telling them to or he can't declare war that's done by the Congress\nHe can send the military somewhere but\nWhat do we need to do to get the Congress back to doing it to actual job\n[noise] well you know that the framers of our constitution and thought that Congress it was going to be the most powerful of the three agencies that is the president said Congress and the judiciary they thought the problem was going to be to control the Congress because it was so powerful but in fact\nCongress over time has given up its authority to the executive branch and part of the book explains why this happened and what what ideas caused this to occur but my view is that it's principally the responsibility of the judiciary [noise] um I think\nThat the framers expected\nThat judiciary would police the separation of powers and as you know Lars separation of powers requires all legislation to be done by Congress no legislation can be done by the executive branch\nBut if Congress is going to be giving the executive branch legislative power as they seem to have been doing over time not only are they violating the constitution\nBut they're they're doing something that is terrible for our democracy because the regulatory agencies the administrative agencies that are part of what I call the administrative state\nUm all made up of people live around Washington DC and they are making decisions now for the entire country that should be made in a democracy as we are we are a democracy\nOr Democratic Republic these decisions should be made\nAnd representative body like Congress\nThat because then that representative body can be answerable to the people but every two years on the house side and every six years on the Senate side\nAnd if some administrative bureaucrats buried deep in the bowels of the federal government who's been there for ten or Fifteen or Twenty years and will be there for another decade or two or three depending on how long have you been there\nAnd Americans don't know who this is they don't know why what rules they wrote for the most part\nBecause even when we see a cabinet secretary who heads a BPA are heads up ... heads up some other agency\nThe person who actually write to the rule maybe six or eight levels below that person and when that person makes a changing the rules on\nI don't know how section eight housing is regulated you know in theory this the cabinet secretary above and the president above the cabinet secretary responsible for it but it was actually written by a civil service lifer who can't be fired am I wrong\nYeah no you are not long at all um the amazing fact is that in the last twenty five years in every year\nThe federal government's administrative agencies and regulatory agencies have put out three thousand rules wild and that's over a hundred thousand rules over the last twenty five years now they haven't it hasn't been that that much legislation\nThat would require all these rules so what we have is these agencies using legislation that was made years ago\nTo write new rules now and the question is\nHow would they really empowered by Congress many years ago to be writing the rules if they're writing today and that's one of the things that I think the the court system the judiciary has to look into and stuff\nLet me let me try one example I knew there was a law or there was a an a a rule called title nine and as I remember the the central purpose of it was we got all these schools public schools and colleges\nThat don't sports programs that are mostly aimed at benefiting young men uh football basketball baseball Gulf whatever and that you know young ladies\nI'm getting the opportunities you write a rule and in general people said no it's probably fair if you're going to have a football team you should probably have the equivalent so that a young ladies can get some opportunities as well not a bad so odd but ... and not bad in practice until you find out a couple of decades later\nBy the way it's going to regulate which bathrooms are used by transgender individuals in communities and you don't have anything to say about it because Obama crap say letter of guidance or his department of education does\nAnd all of a sudden you're you're ... your your daughter comes home and says hey there was a boy who is using the lady the girls restroom now at school well how'd that happen well it has something to do with title line\nWhile I thought that was about sports no it's been used to rewrite the bathroom rules is that a good example where where they've taken a union is used it\nThat is an excellent example and it's something even more pervasive in the bathroom little of that is part of that and although you're entirely correct that what what Congress authorized was for any school that accept\nFederal money it has to make have a educational resources available\nWithout a correction or without any connection to sex that is women should have the same educational resources is mad yep what\nHas happened to that now is that is that legislation has been turned into a question of sexual harassment at ... although it was it was directed at schools\nSchools were the ones who that was supposed to comply all of a sudden as a result of that language the education department has created a whole system\nFor sexual harassment of student to student\nUm and so not only what sexual harassment is but then what the punishment should be and how the person who was accused of sexual harassment should be tried none of that would ever had been considered by Congress back windows that statute was passed in Nineteen Seventy two\nOn ... on Saturday and they were they were and they were this was not your group this was the other group so they were deliberately deliberately engaging in provocative actions as well because for a lot of us you shut a flag on fire we don't take kindly to that and uh and I do I say that it justifies assaulting somebody no\nBut one of your members actually ran out and grab one of the flags and saved it from being burned did they not\nHe did he did he did he ran in quit fat guy Iran and grab it ran out um so there is no physical confrontation\nI'm so and they yeah they do that for the attention they always are and that's why I just I've probably seen over a hundred flag burning all over the country and they do it just to upset us um but uh yeah I mean it's it's really common these days\nSo what do you think should happen that would bring the streets back to the point where people on US law abiding citizens could drive through a town without having their car attacked in without having to people inside the car field but their their lives and their safety or threaten what do you think would have to happen\nThat's easy you you make a statement every single time there illegally blocked in the street you're sending the police declare them an arrest them\nIt's only going to take a couple of times consistently what people are like going to be like okay we can't do this anymore I mean the perfect example is Seattle Seattle you can't get away with it\nIf you or try to commit any acts of violence or if you try to block the streets you will get arrested it didn't used to be that way you know they used to have your anarchy in Seattle every single year\nBut now they find that officials got up together and enforce the law\nJust like the world Trade Organization had said you know what I had the WTO riots and the local citizens said enough this has got an end but at this point you've got a mayor who as of this morning is still saying he stands by his order to stand down\nAnd as much as I admired achieved ... Daniel outlaw or when she was in to do an interview I actually liked her top attitude toward dealing with occupy eyes\nBut then I see her saying well we have to take every one case by case in sometimes the presidents of police will actually riled things up well I Would think that's that that's exactly what you need the police if you if this is a crowd that actually becomes more violent when the police show up\nThan all the more reason for the police to show up until people get the attitude like you said in Seattle that we can't get away with this stuff anymore they knock it off altogether\nYeah absolutely so they don't even ... I made a anymore in Seattle they used to write every single year so that's a perfect example\nAnd you know in terms of chief outlaw obviously her boss just ... wheelers so and that's the other thing that's the other problem I don't like how the ... as the police commissioner because I think that's a conflict of interest you're going to have the police do will help him get reelected and that's not okay I think those two things need to be separated\nAnd them and I actually believe the police commissioner should be elected Ishmael elected official who has no ties to making any decisions politically at all\nWhile I that's not a bad idea then you'd have to have somebody run his police commissioner well Joey I've had people say to me well why does Gibson even bring his people here and you told me your point of view here's my point of view\nIf you cede the streets that is say OK antifa owns the streets and chief gets to say who can engage in First Amendment free speech and only ... and ... doesn't like it\nThen they'll come out and they'll start a fight and the police will stand by and do nothing you've effectively said only one group gets free speech rights and they have the power to shut down any one else and that's wrong so when folks have told me well\nYou know Joey should stay away and every other group should stay away and every conservative should stay away and you have to take your bumper stickers often take your red maggot hat off\nBecause if you showed the way you believe and they don't like it they'll kick your ass\nAnd if you don't do what they tell you to do while the police are standing by watching they'll drag you out of your car and do a Reginald Denny on you or that that cannot be the way of city runs I think Ted Wheeler is coming this close to having people start to demand his removal from office and it will be ... I mean I could say it all day long\nBut when the local businesses start to say you're making people afraid to even come to the city\nAnd they're going to stop coming to our businesses when the business owners start to realize that they may just tell Ted either straighten it up and fix this or you're gonna have to find a new job\nAnd will find a new mayor that's Joey Gibson from patriot

and even when Mr Allen was in there you'd often see his mother at the bowl games sitting at one end of the court you know in the grapes each right near the basket\nAnd the story goes that as she was leaving one night it was raining like it does so often in Portland, Oregon and that she slipped and fell and he determined that mom was not going to have to go through that again so in the same sports

talk about for a Monday including but not limited to focus on to the shore Pocahontas or Senator Elizabeth Warren whichever you'd like to call her you know that there's been a controversy over about the last half dozen years in about twenty twelve or her claim that she is Native American\nThat she has a ties to a Native American tribes she made that claim while she had to defend declined because she'd actually made it big in ... the ... of about Thirty years ago\nAnd she was a introduced as a member of the Harvard faculty who had Native American status and I believe that she may decline because it advanced or both financially and professionally with dinner profession will now she's the United states senator\nShe may in fact be a a hot prospect for the Democratic party to run as a presidential candidate and a couple of beers and twenty twenty\nAnd now it seems that she believes the DNA could prove that she does deserve to be called Native American well William Jacobson is a clinical professor of law and director of securities law at Cornell University Cornell law school I should say and the founder of legal interaction which by the way professor\nHappy ten years anniversary and legal interaction and congratulations for all the legal inside a lot of us have been able to get out of legal interaction\nWell thank you very much for that and thank you for having me on again\nYou'd think that in the case of Elizabeth Warren it's fairly easy to call the truth of this she's she Native American\nNo she's not Native American under any of the standards that Native American tribes legitimate tribes years she not Native American she cannot trace\nOr name any ancestor of hers who was Native American and in fact Cherokee genealogist when this first\nBecame a controversy in two thousand and twelve went back and traced her lineage going back to the early Eighteen hundreds essentially as far as there were records and there is a hero evidence\nThat she has any Native American ancestry yet she claimed to be Native American when she was in her late thirties for in a law directory that was used for hiring and she got herself the status of being a minority law professor and a woman of color in legal academia\nBy claiming to be Native American and we all know that in the eighties any and even today that sort of status can be beneficial to people in the hiring process so the question became issue actual Native American and she has never provided any proof\nSo she finally after years of dodging she arranged for some DNA tests not doing normal service that you or I Would would you she found a professor at Stanford to analyze the DNA and he says that there is a strong possibility he doesn't have said that it's a definite that there's strong evidence that going back\nSix to ten generations\nThere might be a single Native American ancestor in her lineage but of course we don't know who that is we don't know if it even exists and the database of DNA he used to care hers to wasn't even Native American it was Central American\nSo this whole thing is ludicrous and she's out there with the Boston Globe you know but\nEssentially promoting her explanation saying aha look I'm Native American because they might be anywhere from one sixty fourth one one thousand\nAnd twenty four believe it or not one one thousand Native American if you go back ... generations it's it's preposterous you or I were in that situation never claimed that they put the status\nYou know under the law to based on some sleazy excuse like that and I think she's got she's got problems\nDo you think the Boston Globe who's in her corner they originally reported that it was one five twelve at the foreign and then they had to issue a correction today and says you said it's it may not be one five twelve to maybe one one thousand and twenty fourth I'm well why are they willing to play along with this game when they know that\nAs you pointed out for employment law and\nEEOC you know the equal Employment Opportunity commission\nThat none of this stuff even matters because it wouldn't hold up for those standards which are the standards of government a government that she may wanna you know someday be president of that government\nThat's right and the Boston Globe dating back to two thousand and twelve has essentially served\nAs Elizabeth Warren's press office they did this package of two thousand and twelve what she does she gives them exclusive access to family members exclusive access\nTo documents and they run with her story light and they get it back in two thousand and twelve and they've done it multiple times in the last three to four months as she's getting ready to run so what the Boston Globe didn't do here is ...\nThey responsible news organization would do they would have first of all reviewed her actual DNA gate and not just the court someone she hired\nConcluded they would have taken that data to another genealogist to another scientist who familiar with DNA and whatever verified this person's finding there's no indication they did that they simply took off the shelf\nThe court she commissioned and she obtained which even on its face is almost laughable that she might be one one thousand Native American based on a DNA database\nWhich doesn't even include Native Americans in it and this is is really for pastors in the in the issue becomes why did she do this and we know the reason she did it she didn't claim to be Native American when she was a child she didn't claim to be Native American when she applied to college or law school it was only\nIn her mid to late thirties when she was climbing the law professor ladder\nFrom University of Texas all the way up to Harvard law school that she\nListed herself as being Native American it was known she lifted herself for each Yossi filing purposes that way and lo and behold when she finally get tenure at Harvard law school essentially the top lung on a ladder you can't go any higher than that uh she stopped supporting herself as Native American\nAs I should get high right there at that point well now\nDo you see this creating a real problem for her because as much as I think she's been a punchline nachos for conservatives but even for the president of the United states um and now having dumped this additional piece of data is no well I can show there's one one thousand but now you have to believe me\nIt almost seems to me that there's going to make her more of a punch line there appear from George who just humid Donald Trump would promised a million dollars if you could prove Jews Native American ought to send one one thousand and twenty fourth of a million dollars to Elizabeth Warren and say OK bet settled\nAnd the Cherokee Nation issued a statement late today\nComplaining and blamed fasting car and saying quote Senator Warren is undermining tribal interests with her continued claims of tribal heritage close quote and they then go on to say that you cannot use DNA as a test\nIt's demeaning to Native Americans there's a lot more to tribal membership in tribal\nInclusion than DNA and the DNA is totally inappropriate to use for their purposes and they don't use it and so what she has done is she has created to think she thought she was going to settle this problem instead she'd make made herself laughing stock\nAnd two she is actually forced Native American and this is this an official tribal statement from the Cherokee Nation saying that she is undermining their interest by or teaching you continued claims of tribal heritage so I think she made her situation a lot worse than it was the question I've always had for her\nAnd learned hand the judge even said it is not patriotic to over pay your taxes\nSo it's smart to arrange to pay as little as possible to the government because they'll just waste your money and leave as much as possible to your family now he did that larger old on older not done yet I'll let you know when I'm done so Donald Trump father\nThat so there is no I'm not trying to burn a time but listen to this this is important so his father went out and arrange every way he ... he wanted to have a conversation\nI I Do let me finish because you didn't get the short course cause you weren't listening to the show so he did exactly that now where did that pass muster it pass muster the IRS that looked at it and said hold on what are you doing here\nAnd apparently the tax accountants and lawyers said to the IRS this is what we're doing this is why it's legal who approved it the IRS approved it three decades ago\nAnd now suddenly the New York times thinks it's a story\nThat an estate remember the state pays the tax is not the recipients the recipients do not pay the taxes if I die tomorrow my airs will get whatever teen and I have a teen and I died together God Forbid\nThat my airs would get whatever I've got house you know belongings guns things like that and I would hope that\nWe have a conversation that all are\nWe are eventually I Would hope that the folks who work on my behalf the executor and the lawyers I don't have that big a mistake but if if I leave some money I Hope the maximum goes to my kids are grandkids or whatever and the minimum goes to the government now tell me what your response to that is\nWho Lars he received probably received a cause he received two hundred thousand dollars a year from the age of two years old now I Know that ... old on he received ... million that he claimed was the only thing he got\nIll and we've already dealt with it received a million dollars and he really paid it but at the time he was ... was the lovely received a million dollars ... billion dollars that he's\nLike but I'm not sure what your pointed Donald Trump bused my Donald you said that Elizabeth Warren's a bit players shame and be the Democratic party's nominee in ... he is not a bit\nPlayer but come on and you are part of the ...\nI'm not part of the con every everybody read that story and I read the entire story looked at it now when when ... hundred and twelve million dollar and he is from the million dollar when his dad figured out I can pay my son two hundred thousand dollars a year so that he can\nHe can be on the books as an employee who had\nTo pass on that and agree to it the IRA here all day or two hundred thousand dollars I don't know but obviously valuable to dad but if if all of that was now I Want you to agree to something the IRS said it was okay didn't die\nI don't know that that's\nTrue they knew that way you know the IRS tells you it's not a halo on you you said you don't know I'm going to educate you how do you know how do you know how the IRA tells you if you do you not how the iris tells you hey you can just keep repeating yourself and then eventually I'll cut off and also that the IRS will always humbling\nYou is when the IRS takes your taxes and they look hard at them and I guarantee you the IRS looks hard at the taxes of anybody as wealthy as the Trump family if they find something amiss they'll bring it up and they'll say\nWell this isn't kosher and that is in kosher so they will come back to I occasionally get notices and the IRS say we think you miss calculators\nThat can we bring this back to Elizabeth Warren at her out banging around us stumbling around the fact that she lied about or whatever\nYou know she's still try as long as you yeah yeah it is not a small issue there he's alive if ally you lie about who you are and you're running for about ... really is well perhaps he did the old I lied about who will say it said a third time of makes you happy\nBut I'm going to tell you something if if the American people the American people heard all of what you just said\nThey heard it in the news for months before they voted and then they said I still want to vote for the guy now that's the ultimate litmus test if you hear every bad nasty slower

President Obama\nAnd under President Trump we've seen more than ten times the number of manufacturing jobs created in that Twenty one month period compared to the same amount of time a new Obama\nNow one of the things I've been asking people to do and that is I'm going to ask you whether or not this would be appropriate to do\nAnd that is to suggest that we could have come out of that recession in a much more uh I guess vigorous fashion the recession actually technically ended in June of ... about four or five months into the Obama administration's time and you had eight years went by\nAnd we had a kind of a lackluster recovery they can always say well it's the longest period of\nAn old job adding jobs or that we've ever seen but we're adding them at such an anemic great\nIt'd be like the guy who gets the ten cent raise twice a year from his boss ten cents an hour\nAnd he tells his wife why I've been getting this these raises longer than anybody the boss has been given me ten cents an hour and more every six months for the last ten years his wife and laugh at him because of course ten cents an hour increase or twice a year doesn't add up to anything\nAnd and that's I think the way the Obama economy look to me and non economists that\nYeah you were adding things but the economy was growing up I think the average rate for the IRS was one point six and in the last year of Obama that actually dropped closer to one percent and now all of a sudden we're we're growing up maybe three and a half pushing up toward four percent growth rates that were declared impossible\nCould we have seen these same kinds of job gains and growth in the economy under Obama at some point during those eight years and had its happen sooner had we've chosen to ride policies\nWell I think that that's exactly the if the case you have to look at monetary policy like steady flooded the trillions of dollars you had all this shape cash that had been sitting a you know being put to work for eight years and now it's finally starting to come off the table\nOr what I think it's remarkable is that the experts told us that this was the new law that this one to one and a half percent annual growth was what we'll is going to have to resign to live with as a\nTool for western advanced economies and then along comes Trump and it ... it was amazing to me it is it wasn't even just the new policies the deregulation of cutting of red tape and eventually the X. cut it was the expectation\nNo longer would you have that little government\nPiling regulation upon regulation on American business things like the clean Power Plan and so you see this manufacturing boom\nStart this very moment that Trump won election in November of two thousand sixteen because the economy the business people knew that it was going to be a different day uh and I believe that to your point\nAt these policies been pursued earlier we have a much larger and more vibrant economy today\nYou know it's funny I'm Talking to attractive or who's vice president of the national of national initiative for the Texas Public policy foundation\nAll of that Keynesian economics gee if we just pile a bunch of money out there will prime the pump and get the engine of the economy going again\nDo the folks who push those kinds of policies now see\nThat they didn't work that having all that cheap money out there didn't mean anything if somebody wasn't taking advantage of it and the reason they weren't taking advantage of it is that they had the expectation that they're going to have more regulations and limitations piled on top of them and the minute Trump came into office as you say\nBusiness began to react so there were folks out there in the economy who knew\nThe moment he was elected that this was going to be the result and yet all the reporters who covered the race did not seem to know which kind of suggests to a disconnect on on factual information that apparently the reporters\nYou know we're so focused on the election they didn't go out and said a business it's this kind of actually gets in what's going to happen instead they heard the scare headlines that you know Wall Street was gonna go upside down\nThat the economy was going to go into a giant depression that all these bad things were I Would have happened and they were all Parenthood in these stories while apparently all the business owners knew if he gets in a we're going to be off to the races\nI think you're correct it isn't just recorders I mean there's people like Paul Krugman those the New York times who is supposedly an economist he\nWas filled with a forecast of doom and gloom because of President Trump's election and we see the opposite you know I don't think a lot of people are going to come out with a vehicle admit that they all along they have too much invested this is about a world do you think\nThat the federal government is equipped to tell us how to live our lives to tell business how to operate a layer regulation of regulation written by an elected bureaucrats\nOr do we think that liberty that freedom\nThat that ... the dynamism that is the American economy and ingenuity do we think that the better way to go and if you think a lot if you think that freedom is really the the answer\nA then you're going to come up with a completely different a solution than someone who thinks that centralized control and more regulations telling business what to do and what to do is the answer\nI guess truck to the thing that frustrates me as a couple of things number one is not that I Want to go back and re debate the Obama administration but it's it's like one of those situations where somebody comes and says I can help you out which I thought you said well where were you two years ago or ten minutes ago or whatever was why didn't you come to me sooner well we could have had the solution sooner\nAnd I think in particular about those people who are perhaps in their late fifties\nAs we had oh seven or no wait where the time when most workers make the greatest paychecks they've ever made their lives\nThirty four thirty four to ten six six four thirty four thirty four for rhino she'll
