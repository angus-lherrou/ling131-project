kind of geopolitical introduction ah they're this way they lined up the ducks against China\nThere's actually a provision in the ... with U.S Mexico Canada agreement that says you know die that Mexico or Canada or for that matter the u._s. can sign an agreement with a non market a condom any country what they call the China without notifying and and and conversing went the other two\nThat plus the fact that the U.S and not settled its trade difficulties with with Mexico and Canada and as for the uh a difficulty with Europe on ice\nMeans that the battle ahead is with China and it will be a big

them\nOkay well there are some big a big things in the agreement which from a free traders perspective that's may are negatives and there are a lot of things which are smaller\nBut are very positive which are really just now that we're trying to go back in Nineteen Ninety two you know you into the twenty first century so let me to start with the positives\nThere is a chapter on digital a flow is and that's that's a big thing for the U.S and for other countries as well um all the source code the algorithms so forth the shoulders location\nThis was all lake ... in Canada or Mexico just

... there's a chapter on small that you load values sales across borders\nDishes online shopping or there's this of course this is Amazon and many many other companies\nThis is big stuff and Canada had only a twenty dollar limit you know it was it was about twenty dollar if you had to pay taxes tariffs that complicated customs clumps she didn't shop online and Kevin up from the U.S [noise] they they boosted that now but not to have great but it's forty dollars and so that's twice as large\nSo that's that's a that's a good that you know the chapter on currency\nCountries are supposed to leave

countries as well so there there's a lot of you know these are what I Would call\nA quite a quite good in positive steps or you're going to go to the negative\nWell before we get to the negatives I Want to know you mentioned China and I want to know whether or not this is going to have a side benefit of sending a message to China that when we come to do business with them and renegotiate our deals with China\nBecause they're not involved in this that that they will get a message of how the United states wants to do business\nIs that going to have the desired result\nWell it certainly

the Chinese economy is slowing down partly because of the trade\nFor all but a ... other countries for sure they will take it very seriously\nThey used to that template this new agreement my knowledge you know it's a very long a thousand pages lotta actually a lot of details but there should now the template for any trade agreement that the uh ...\nAny other country and became a provision where they they know that they want to go forward they will recognize them so that you talked with Japan wherever we talked with Japan which of the object\nWell professor now let's go to the negative what's the downside to us and two year\nOkay there you know it does not want to emphasize each other in my ... my mind that the ...\nBut they're really small compared to the huge before we let it was you know completed on Sunday night closely I'm not a fan of managed trade it she says that if you like managed trade\nYou liked disagreement sure they're big\nBig like each managed trade in the automotive

the technology of voting by smartphone now I Know this is going to scare a lot of people\nBut I frankly think that we're heading toward this kind of technology inevitably it would allow overseas residents including the military to vote by ap\nIn November's general election as part of the effort to simplify the absentee ballot process and reduce the risk of votes not being counted\nWest Virginia secretary of state Mac\nWarner approved the electoral innovation which is meant for West Virginians living abroad or serving in the military the program\nWhich is currently available to overseas residents from twenty four of the state's fifty five counties is the first in the United states it has drawn praise and warnings amid persistence cyber security concerns\nIncluding the threat of election meddling from Russia and other countries but\nIf you don't think that we're going to head that direction at some point I Would be very surprised if we do not\nTom writes in by email talk at Lars Larson dot com\nLars I Can't believe that Senator Jeff flake and other Republican members of the Judiciary Committee or such a lousy poker players when the Dems demanded a one week delay for the FBI why didn't the Republicans simply asked\nIf we give you this one week delayed does that mean you'll vote in favor of confirmation call their bluff make counter demands rather than just rolling over I couldn't get rich playing poker with these guys signed Tom tom thanks very much let me go to some of your calls first and we'll get on to some other issues cliff\nIs on the line and Colorado cliff thanks for wedding what's on your mind tonight\n... longtime listener yeah thank you what the what\nThe what what uh well America look like if the Democrats win and the ... or as if the Democrats where it all started on\nOh I think I I but I but I\nI Know I Know it's got to ask it well it's going to be a disaster I've I'm at the risk of repeating myself um I said a week ago\nIf the Democrats get their ... and that is to push the confirmation of cabinet off to the election and if they pick up a seat or two in the Senate\nThan they have already vowed that they will not approve of single not one more justice for Donald Trump Trump will get this pick and he could get a second pick I mean of Ruth Bader Ginsburg leaves the court for some reason the next two years that would give Trump not just this pick\nThe pick of judge Kavanaugh but another pet gone top that would set the courts ideological direction I Believe to say we're going to follow the constitution or for the next forty years or so given the age of\nThe current justices if they do if the Republicans do not confirm Kavanaugh by the end of this week two things are going to happen one cabinet I won't be seated too there isn't enough time to pick a replacement and running through the vetting process\nAnd a lot of Republican voters will look at the cave in by the Republicans and say I may not show up in November\nOr to vote and when they do that likely we will not get another conservative justice on the court and we will not to ... and we may lose the Senate or the house or a little bit of both and if that happens then America changes\nForever probably and if we do get them on then we have a court that will follow the constitution instead of following ideology\nAnd I think the Republicans are voters a head of the mid term election will be invigorated if for lack of a better word by saying oh the Republicans actually followed through and did what they were supposed to do\nAnd that will reflect in their votes in November So ... we really are at a big divide right now if Kavanaugh gets on gets in great things are going to happen if he does not I think America we ... we may lose the Republican Congress\nAnd Donald Trump won't get another thing done for the next two years and they will set themselves the Democrats will set themselves up well for twenty twenty\nLook what's been starting to me a lot in regards to that is the Democrat that seems like they they pick and choose\nWhat they want to follow up to date a lot of all of that by the way around it or by the way to reword it\nLooked like this year as we all have no immigration since ... as open border and there'll be a systematic disarming the citizenry of this\nI think you're absolutely right and and and and consider that\nThat not only do the Democrats invent invite a oh boy we just got word cliff I'd mentioned to Frank ... the James Mattis at the Pentagon received a letter didn't go all the way to him but they intercepted at containing rice and\nA judge my producers just alert me that we just got word that Trump also received a letter have they confirmed that there was rice and are they saying just white powder at this point or Ted Ted Cruz's office got a letter was or two letters with white powder and apparently President Trump's office also received a letter with white powder in it\nWhich is designed to at least frightened and terrorize or if not actually do damage will have to find out what the white powder is but\nI wanted to work that in but think about what's going to happen\nIf if we go this direction we want people on the poor and who will follow the constitution the Democrats actually invent things that were never in the constitution for example it might surprise people to know that\nThat privacy is not mentioned anywhere in the constitution\nBut there had been Supreme Court decisions\nThat had been triple A. rated privacy end of the constitution marriage is not mentioned by the constitution so now we have a famous Supreme Court decision recently did found a right to marriage\nAnd a right to gay marriage in the constitution if the Democrats are allowed to gain control and put people on the court who would say we can invent things that are not in the constitution\nIt offer a premium service and you go into a hardware store and you have someone who's knowledgeable help you pick out exactly the product that you need\nA Amazon has a competitive advantage and a wide array of products and getting reviews from other customers so each one is it's specializing in its area but if they raise the cost of doing business for the mom and pop stores too much\nActually customers won't choose them at all and we'll have less choice in the economy as a result\nDr ... the Mercator center George Mason now about the automation side of this in some ways\nIf Amazon can as a PR move say we're raising wages to Fifteen but if they're looking more than a few quarters down the line uh the boss or you know the folks who are running the company can say don't worry about what raising the wages because we're going to cut our workforce down dramatically is just the workers don't know it yet\nBecause when we go to Fifteen bucks an hour thirty thousand dollars a year\n... per worker plus Social Security and taxes and everything else that has to come out of that uh the real costs that employee goes up dramatically it makes automation\nA much more sensible economically to do because the company can say well you know we're paying this person twelve dollars an hour or eleven dollars an hour we can't really a competitive we put in automation and turn that job into one done by a robot but it Fifteen bucks an hour it might just pencil\nAnd then Amazon can get the good publicity for having raised wages and then a void\nBecause you won't see a over ... on an awful lot of the you know the the drop in the number of workers if over the next five or ten years Amazon puts in a lot of automation and just slowly through attrition or small layoffs gets rid of a lot of their workers they end up with maybe the same labor costs and much more efficient operation\nThat's exactly true and one of the things for the headlines recently that you might remember was a pet since that Amazon had a godsend but never actually use\nWhich are people said a was Amazon putting workers in cages would it actually was is a a something that an Amazon workers could travel through a a warehouse floor filled with robots moving around and there was a protective cage around\nThis vehicle that the worker was traveling and uh that is a clear indication that Amazon is going to be using much more automation and the future this kind of a regulation wage regulation would hurt Amazon much less especially as Amazon automate more\nBut it's going to hurt its competitors much much more\nYeah because the competitors have all those other costs that they don't have so should we say yes then I mean I I've been against minimum wages period not because I made minimum wage in\nMy career at one point but I've always thought that the workers should be hired based on their skills and talent and not based on the government which I don't think is very good at anything trying to define what their labor is worth but allowing Amazon to use the minimum wage in this way doubles my objection to the idea of the minimum wage going up\nAbsolutely I Would agree that the minimum wage is uh the wrong way to solve a problem that a lot of people understand ... understandably are worried about low wage workers and whether or not they can make ends meet\nBut there is much more effective policies that are much more closely targeted to helping the people that really need help rather than the minimum wage minimum wage is a sledgehammer way of trying to appeal in orange\nWell and let me ask you for your project in the last ... less than a minute we've got if Wal Mart and target have all these fixed costs and and bricks and mortar costs and Amazon does not is this just going to have send the demise literally the demise of some bigger retailers like that\nIt's absolutely going to have their demise but who who is going to be affected in decimated even faster as the small mom mom and pop stores\nSo it'll clean it all up and the big guys will win big and the little guys will simply go away and you'll find that in your neighborhood you can't get anything at a local mom and pop shop a doctor fair and it's always a pleasure thanks for the work you do at George Mason\nSecular slide to have you on that Dr

violations of that agreement now they're facing sanctioned so\nShould President Trump do even more to try to get them back into a line well rush he'll Roger joins me now the ... project advisory board member and a founding member of the Muslim or former movement welcome to the program or hill\nThank you so much so what should the president do to try to bring up more pressure on the mullahs of Tehran\nWhile you're doing that I case he pledged to sanctions he has consistently spoken about the violations of human rights by the regime and when I speak on I ... between the people of it on the ones who are suffering and ... which is of course corrupt and next to me is I have\nA a a a danger to game on the face of this that today I can call ... ... um I just like ... about a woman who had been ... was killed tortured and killed\nAnd every day there's a you know ... they are ... and then on the ... anyone who speaks out\nAgainst a gay dictatorship against ... and against the regime so ah what President Trump has done is a step that shows that tells them that uh the the word and some of the debt itself 'cause he was not all\nUh what did not do business as usual or those who are oppressive and those who are in violation of a universal charter a ...\nShow or the mullahs doing anything different because I mean\nI guess you could argue that the value of sanctions is when you bring them and you get some kind of cooperation or at least a move in that direction that was I thought the point of going against North Korea was sanctions and then when they said we can talk then we say we're glad to talk to you stay under the sanctions until we get real change\nIs there any sign that the mullahs might start to reform things within their country or\nEase up a bit in response to this or they just sticking to the same wine they've always taken\nWell speaking to the same line because they are struggling and they're extremely powerful and extremely wealthy tanks to President Obama who\nUh you know ... ... billions of dollars to them none of which filtered down to the people that are the people uh has all this suffered in ... and ... and they still are\nBut I'm the ayatollah as an entity is Regina in the ... on\nA extremely stubborn stubborn people they will God to abuse the United states and call it the great Satan as they have always done but over the period of time if and this and that again that the leaders of the western was a lot of that somewhat not do business as usual and\nUh we hope that they get the message but the bigger ... is the move by the people you know we don't get this news because it's just that\nYou're a structural placed on the news getting out of it on but I work with the dissidents and those who are uh you know we're battling against this regime living outside and supporting it and he knows that there are rallies taking place and it\nHas a very small and large uh down in city in it on a\nBy all the way down from ... ... drivers to have it is to students to ordinary people in the streets and this has been going on for quite some time now and the best change and the best revolution garbage lay people rise up against an oppressive regime\nOr those of us on the outside can only support them\nBy saying that you know we are with you and of course as I said a\nDoes western countries European countries are still continuing to do business with Iran\nShould also think twice about a continuing to do business with a country that had such a ... not because I say so because it's always been documented in ... thoughts and buy a those people who watch and monitor\n... across them go\nSee because that's the part where he'll that's perhaps the hardest for a lot of us to understand and that is the United states says Iran is a major state sponsor of terrorism the biggest state sponsor of terrorism on the globe and we say we should we should bring these people in the line\nOr as members of the world community I mean I I'm not for global movement or anything like that but I\nI think that when there are potential threat to the United states and when they have this kind of record with their own people end up sponsoring terrorist acts in their own region which are potential threats to the United states uh when when you know if you get disruption in that region it could cause problems all over the world\nWhy are the Europeans not climbing on board that and saying you're right these people are bad people are they just so focused these countries that want to do business with Iran on saying well but they got they got dollars because Obama gave as you said getting the dollars and we'd like to sell them stuff\nYes and they've got dollars and they've got all\nYeah so you know that relationship is a very incest just relationship and the bottom of the mind when you think about this and that you also mentioned that they don't sponsor terrorism just within their own country for a sponsor the Hamas and has a lot of site if they find a militia\nOutside of it on and that is why they're so dangerous so the money that filter down he went into the coffers of the ayatollah ... used\nTo sponsor than the other shows on broad owned two\nUs one said that it isn't so uh\nYou know I I I also have this question and it just boggles the mind why are some Western European country as we continue to ...\nBut it has to do business with them but then as I said this is a whole other ball game you know it's about money about oil it's about a lot of money that comes\nTo the real issue here and that you know the amount of money we're talking about those soda sold for it so they they put aside the idea that down violations taking place a way to gauge countries are part of the human rights council\nThey go there they know that the violation steak place because it's all\nA documented in black and white but I'm a credited with the United Nations Human rights council for five years as his dad and I left\nThe victims I met the dissidents and he knows that he's probably still exist and so do the PIN leaders but uh you know this is how the word books and it's unfortunate I mean it does if it wasn't enough pressure\nThat would be a change for\nMe because you know for instance one of the conditions of leadership of membership in the ... you use it you drop the death penalty domestically so all the European countries while there is support for the death penalty among the population of Western European countries the countries themselves have given up on the death penalty\nI'm good man how are you pretty good man what's on your brain there\nYeah you know in ten years ago if you'd asked me that question I might have said yes but uh nowadays I'm\nYou know I find that I'm a conservative I can be open minded about things and I'll keep my opinion and myself to a degree but I Know\nToo many liberals who go I mean they just do nuts and they got to get rid of you it's not it's not just in my opinion it's never conservatives cutting off liberals they just can't handle the fact they can't I don't say brainwash but they can't slip you over right\nTo their to their opinions that they're using they're the ones you know ... friends you stop talking to you\nYou know disconnect when you set up there don't you think as I think in a sense social media has really made this problem a thousand times worse\nUh and I mean I can agree with that but see here here's my thing when it comes to politics\nIt's it's like anything else I mean if you have a friend that you just agree on something if they're willing to hold a grudge against you even after the fact\nAre they really a friend you know not holding on to some years you know what I mean\nIt depends ... just from my my personal experience okay I I can honestly say that I lost\nA ...\nAt least one friend who was a long term friend that I'd known for many many years from the east\nCoast who was just freaking unrelenting\nA it was just it it it came in ... every conversation that was ... do you just I just could not get away from it and it extended beyond politics into personal criticism of me that just never stopped and I cut his ass loose I just it was like life is to freaking short\nI Do have dozens upon not that I have dozens\nAnd dozens of friends or long term friends people I went to school where people I went to college with people I worked with who we are complete political opposites and there are some of my best friends in the world and we just don't talk about it's not something we ... it may come up on social freaking media\nBut not to the extent to where I'm not going to be your friend you know and I if somebody can't handle being your friend because of your politics your right they're not a friend\nI think it's the ... the the saddest thing I see is when it affects family members when people get kicked out of their own families because of it that's disgusting it really has no and I\nI understand that well I was going to go there next because I've got family that lives in California they I wouldn't say yeah I'm married into that family disowned me but boy they they do not like what I post\n[laughter] had no problem at\nTimes when my wife know about it but I'm like you know what yeah I'm part of the family if you don't like what's on my Facebook page\nGet rid of it doesn't it's not that social media plays that big of a role in our lives I that to me is absurd\nThat social media has come to means so much in our freaking lives that it basalt friendships and stuff in families it's ... it's ... it's ridiculous [noise]\nWell I think it goes beyond that do because like my my father in law he's on disability in this thing on ... used to be die hard conservative\nNow he's he's lost his mind 'cause he honestly believed that all conservatives or Republicans want to do is find a way to take away benefits will take them away you know things that support him he's he's led based so I think it's it's deeper those social media thing I mean it relates to people in different ways but yeah there's there's no doubt social\nI I think I think social media 'cause look I I've got friends that I've had for years and years and I never even knew what their politics were until social media came along um I got to run man I'm just out of time and thank you so much for the call Nick\nRock and roll ... no more phones on I'm darn right Chris I'm done as a time to go uh we'll be back tomorrow at four O. five and email me is Shawna cage
