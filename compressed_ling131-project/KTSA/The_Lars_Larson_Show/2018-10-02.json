the one year that has gone by since October the first job last year when a high stakes gambler living in about um this is the way the New York times describes it climbed to the thirty second floor\nOf the Mandalay Bay resort in casino in Las Vegas\nHe had an arsenal of firearms there including some a semi automatic rifles that he was using a bump stock with to simulate the action of a fully automatic firearm he opened fire on thousands of people gathered at the route Ninety One harvest festival which was a country music band\nFifty eight people died the event became the deadliest shooting in modern American history well for a lot of us a long time has passed but I'm\nMarla mailers who's on the phone with me right now who is a self employed Republican who was at the Vegas shooting one year ago today ms ... thank you very much for taking the time and and tell us what was what were you doing that evening with your husband\n... um well it was my husband and I in a very close friend of ours and we were at the festival I'll Try to do the short story um we were there that particular evening\nUm my husband really wanted to be up against front row because um he really wanted to be that close for Jason alley and um we'd been waiting ... then going three or four years to this and we weren't even supposed to be there\nThis year that year is that the whole another set of that have details but anyway we were there we are right against the front and um actually my friends are friends she heard the\nThe forest shot that they have reported prior to the actual\nRapid fire starting um but you know we didn't put it together she did she was sure that she heard shot and I didn't hear him and that we were there just at a concert and just like it's been reported a it took everybody by surprise nobody realized what was happening\nWhen it first started happening when the shots came out everybody thought it was something else\nTo your friend Harry Robin shouldn't spot or identified them as shots right away ah what do the three of you do when she convinced you this really was something going on that could affect you there on the ground\nOK well when the when the shot when they uh\nAutomatic weapons or semi automatic shot started then we all knew it was the first four shots that she heard that they've reported that with any prior to the actual mass shooting beginning but when when when the shot started bringing out and and we all realize\nThere were people around us that were shot and taking down and we helped um\nWe help people around us get him over the rail to safety\nAnd then my husband just made us get down he said just sit down because we're again we were trapped we were against the front rail we had no option other than to get down because we thought the shooter was inside the venue\nWe had no reason that we had no idea that it was made him and people other people are just they turn around and ran but my husband he kept a clear head and just made us get downstate down\nModel argument from where you're speaking this is tough for you to talk about even a year later isn't\nYeah I I had quite a lot of anxiety that they've ... upcoming you know we all do I mean and all three of us where they're saying the exact same thing and we each have a different take on it which\nRemember things differently each are have been affected differently through this year but um we we have continued to move on we we go to country music outdoor festival all year long we continue to do it\nWe've been back to Vegas we we're not going to stop living\nBut it's still true to the back of your head\nOh it's your solar suffer until\nJust a few weeks ago I was still afraid of my own shadow loud noises we can't stand the Terry and I are really affected by failing claustrophobic first somewhere and you can't and it feels like you can't get away we just we can't we we should\nThe moves location we you know and you don't sign on an airplane\nAnd I'm a traveler it was really really tough for me this last year because when they shut those doors if something happened to you can't get out what are you going to do or you're going to go\nIt almost sounds like more a little more geared you're giving the best testimony for what we always yours the you know the the advice folks will we get from some of the folks who talk about these things is when you walk into any place doesn't matter where it is look for the ways to get out before you happen to a lot\nAnd my father my father was always an advocate of growing up I mean he he taught us to be very aware of our surroundings at all times\nAnd you know I think I think that really helped and again my husband kept the whole head and we just followed is follow his lead and um\nBut we were we're some of the very last group to leave we were there during the entire gunfire\nYour husband do some good advice didn't even\nOr ... back to get down and ...\nYes\nYes and then again there were just random people who were who said that you know there were two police officers on the other side of the rail\nThey'd been there all all evening long just standard for the call a concert you know you have ... or you know you have ... percent are scared to come and lie and think well I got down to what my husband told us to do but I Want to do with that well I wanted to get behind them because it felt like\nThey see me to be in between all kind of a structure and at least be behind police officers had weapon\nMarlowe and others of the capital did you have you stayed in touch with any of the people you met that neither the officers or the other folks that you encountered after this horrible tragedy\nThere is a picture of circumstance there's white gentleman a DJ\nDown in Medford mhm that coincidentally when we were coming in the first evening of the of the harvest festival friday he waved way like called us out and\nSaid hey you know Brownsville because that's one of the festivals that we attend yeah he recognized he recognized my husband and they had had a brief conversation at\nThe previous just like a month before at Brownsville\nBut we didn't connect you know take big crowd and all the people we didn't connect to the guy was it\nBecause there was actually other people that like flagged as down\nWhen we were when we were there and we didn't connect it\nThat long long story short we didn't know who he with we reconnected with him in Medford in July by chance Iran and music festival and just by chance talking about Vegas we ... it was connected he was the person that reached out to us that night and mice and cherry she\nShe just really concerned who were those people and and they make it out because I think I can speak above that I carry it here she's got it on speaker\nYou have to either say yes to this or we have to have your signature on a no so that everybody knows we've offered to everybody the opportunity yes or no and that we haven't treated anybody the opportunity\nSo this is not something that employers including states in cities and counties don't do all the time right now when some big change comes along says your your insurance must offer this\nThat you say we've offered to every one we have a signature on a piece of paper a yes or no to that this is something they do all the time yeah\nAbsolutely large in your view us especially can appreciate the fact that labor policies an anomaly and America's ... I mean frankly\nThe idea that if we want to contract with each other ours we have to have a meeting of the minds you asked me consideration there should be no rash and asked me legal those incredibly federation for the non lawyers has money exactly yeah that's true but in labor policy we have to I can bind you simply if I can get the two producers behind the glass or to vote for me\nNow I speak for you without your consent without consideration without any meeting the minds and frankly under dress so we can't contract law standing\nIt's had applied to labor policy and because that's been an anomaly bureaucracy of grown up around it political parties have grown up around it and I think you know who I'm Talking about and they can't afford to let this thing\nGo well and in fact the number I saw today is for example the state of California it's estimated\nCollects on behalf of unions nine hundred ... nine tenths of a billion dollars a year so obviously if they had the same reaction Wisconsin did where it went from\nA drop by about a third the number of people who chose to be represented by union so one third of the members simply went away if one third of that almost a billion dollars goes way in California of the Democratic party is going to get hurt\nThey're real trouble in fact we had a case out there right now fully briefed at the nicer to called ... which actually is now converted into a class action we have a forty thousand member class has already been certified we're going to go back after the money now post Janice is he wouldn't get the union to pay all these government employees back as a hundred million dollars just in that one unit Lars I'm\nTalking to mark next who's president of the national right to work legal defense foundation the national release a right to work foundation a committee\nOne's twenty eight states now recognize the right to work which means a minority of states in America still say we're going to back the union and force you to join a union if you're coming to you and your workplace I Want to ask you about an odd thing that I\nHadn't thought about the last time you and I talk and that is a category of employees it's kind of in the middle and here's the category home healthcare workers so\nGovernments medicate often and other government programs will fund\nA home health care raid the employer is actually the individual person typically an older person who's infirm and need some assistance sometimes it's\nJust a little help with laundry or getting out of ... in a better taking a shower or whatever but they actually employ the person and they can say oh I'm not happy with this person they can let them go they don't get these people from the state agency but\nIn some states all of those people were forced into unionization\nSo I'm Wondering they're not a state employee officially but they're being paid with taxpayer dollars they're not a private sector employee completely although they are to some extent because\nThey decided to do this kind of work and they're hired by an individual person who needs help where do they stand do they count as government employees covered by Janice or private sector employees not covered by Janet well the good news is\nOurs has already won that case in two thousand fourteen we brought a case through the seventh circuit to the United States Supreme court called Harris V. Quinn okay and that case was right on point and basically these these home health care providers\nThat we're getting a statement for Medicare because the state had a plan to help people that were there were a\nIncome adjusted to it but he was ... and so what happened was the governor of of Illinois who still in public housing by the way Robert Ley that scientists executive order that says the FBI you can collect eight hundred dollars a year from these people are their Medicaid payments in order for them to take care of their own children and their own home\nWe filed suit on behalf of eight mothers three of whom were being forced to pay the fee we got in spring court and they agreed with us they said they can't be forced to pay because they're not going to fight state employees and therefore they're protected from this scam\nAnd scheme slow they're protected in a right to work state or they're trying to stay and now they're protected in all ... states so they are absolutely\nSo that means that in places where there is this law that forces the unionization of\nHome health care workers what do they have to do the exercise that they have to resign union membership or they shouldn't vote for you to membership that's mark mix who's the president of the national right to work legal defense foundation and the national right to work committee will be back in just a moment we'll take your emails or talk Lars Larson dot com [noise]\nLaws losses show [noise]\n\nNothing compared to stepping on beautiful hardwood floors Hi I'm Matt Damon and we own river city flooring we love hardwood floors we sell the highest quality floors that the lowest prices in town\nAnd most popular ... with the industry vest worn when we started river city flooring years ago we sit out with the missions provide premium hardwood flooring great service at a wholesale price we keep our prices low because we ordered directly from the manufacturer stock all their own products and cut out the middleman\nThis allows us to charge less than the competition and pass the savings on to you with river city flooring you don't pay a dime for your hardwood floors until your job is one hundred percent complete absolutely no payment until you're floors are done just go to our CIA hardwood dot com to see her selection of beautiful wood floors or stop our show are amongst our road near what more\nCan see why Dave Ramsey says where the best in the business on that and I'm Damon Cole is a two one zero five nine three three three five eight were reversed any foreign and we do hardwood flooring right\n... ...

you believe this Michael Jordan ... who's a lawyer in Sedona, Arizona been their provides legal advice to inmates at the cocoa Chino county detention facility in his personal life he avoids buying from companies that are tied to Israel\nI can agree with that choice but he does have that right however in his professional life\nThis is from the Washington Post he's bound by an Arizona law that requires any business that has a state contract\nTo certify that it's not boycotting Israel\nI don't disagree with that law either he challenged the directive in court claiming it violates his First Amendment rights and us district judge Diane whom a tower issued an injunction last week blocking enforcement of the law and again we've got judges legislating from the bench at issue in the case is\nA specific obligation imposed in Arizona the ruling cast doubt on the constitutionality of government efforts to regulate boycott activity by private companies even those that do business with the state\nNow imagine this an awful lot of people who do business with the state or told if you end up being associated with what we consider as a society it'd be unsavory ideas let's say that at one point you had boycotted South Africa\nWhen it was a white dominated government people might have applauded what you did\nA if you boycott the current South African government I'll bet there are people who would say than we don't want you doing business with the state in this case\nThere is an organized effort to try to boycott it's called the B. B. S.\nBoycott disinvestment in sanctions against the state of Israel\nSimply because there are people out there anti Semite who don't like what the state of Israel does all the state of Israel really does is defend its own borders which were established a long time ago in the same way that our borders of our country where his tablets\nSo if you agree with her to trying to hurt Israel because it has borders like the United States Europe an entirely different political group but I agree with let's go to Jerry in Florida hey Jerry welcome to Lars Larson Joe what's on your mind tonight\nLars I had\nA couple of things in the water is both of them or something I haven't heard anybody on TV or radio really addressing one is\nWhy is it that there's any credence given to Dr for she has a doctorate two masters a bachelor's degree but she can't remember much was crap you know that was required to pass the testing a thought to get all those degrees you can't remember jak but\nShe can read ... al ... or the specifics for the most devastating has she ever had in our lifetime she can't remember how she got there or how she got whole I mean it's like there's a lot of holes in this woman's case that anything I can ever imagine I Can't help but feel\nThat I think if you ate that's gate\n... the series of how she probably was coached going into last everything this find out that this was completely uh scammed by the Democrats which leads to my second point why are they not help this civil a critical criminal penalties force marrying\nThe good name a judge\nKavanaugh well first of all there is no criminal penalty for smearing somebody that I Know of although I guess you could say the so called hate crimes are eight an effort to do it at a very low level where if you use certain kinds of words you could be charged with a crime on the civil side\nSomebody could suit Dianne Feinstein or Feinstein is the president likes to color or they could sewer for defamation the problem is\nWhen you were suing somebody who's a public figure and if you happen to be a public figure as well and I think that Christine forwarded this point would be judged a public figure it becomes exceedingly hard to bring any kind of a lawsuit you'd have to prove that a sort of Brett Kavanaugh I wanted to bring a suit against Dianne Feinstein he'd have to prove\nThat what she said was untrue number one number two that she knew it was untrue when she said that\nBecause he is a public figure and number three that she had actual malice that she said I'm going to get this guy with even if I have to lie about it and I'm going to say things that aren't true\nAnd I think you'd also lose out because in most defamation law that I'm aware of because as a reporter I've had to deal with lawyers for for like Thirty years on defamation laws when it comes to a public figure you have to show that you've actually suffered some dollar damages not just that you lost out on being a Supreme Court member\nWhich you know usually pays less than what the private sector would ... I don't think you'd be able to show dollar damages you wouldn't be able to prove that she knew it was on true when she said it uh and in fact how would you even go about saying that what Christine Ford\nIs proven bully on true and and that means provable in court by a preponderance of the evidence first of all one of the biggest problems is proving something didn't happen because\nYou know I could I could say to you I could prove various things that I Do but how do I approve the things I never did or disprove the idea that I did them that that it's hard in almost all cases so they're almost used in a civil or criminal solution to that\nAnd so and the Democrats know that they're using it to full advantage let's go to Debbie Debbie welcome to the Lars Larson ... what's on your mind\n[noise] hey Laurie I'm I just wanted to talk about the um [noise] I cannot I guess my main concern is that um people are saying that he's not fit to be on the court because of his demeanor and\nUh I think that is so wrong because they are dealing with some personal I'm\nA attacks on him to personally and of course he shouldn't be angry especially if they're untrue who wouldn't stick up for themselves when you have\nA false statements and found that the whole country said about you are less awful thing and uh but there is no way but I think he was very light to stick up for himself if you don't do it will\nAnd just in the last couple of weeks I saw and I'm ...\nYou're aware of them studies out of a I think MIT was one and it might have been harbored was the other one saying well no come to think of it and look at the data it's actually a number about twice as big as that\nSo we haven't even been honest with ourselves about how many people are in this country illegally not necessarily counting the ones coming and legally\nYeah and of course the complaint my complaint I don't think any of our complaint should be a guess people wanting to come in legally or who do come in legally they're\nThey're doing it the right way you up with a complaint really is on the legal immigration numbers like this is something that Congress decides we don't have to take a million new immigrants every year it's just something that was decided by some laws back in Nineteen Ninety when they basically doubled the size of immigration every year\nThey don't they never go back and really a recalculate although we did have votes this year there was a vote in a set it in February and where they were there were votes in that house this summer in each case\nOr in each case or do we could have had major reductions illegal immigration if if the Republicans even if the Republicans would have stuck with it but they're\nThey're not for Republicans around the country that are in it you know in the hold on to to cheap labor industries and uh they keep it come and of course the Democrats are unanimous right now in Congress unanimous\nAbout flooding the labor markets with people that they are almost year and they're basically right will eventually vote democratic that the fact that we had folks this year was a major\nVictory really and I got to tell you that the votes in the house a hundred and Ninety three votes ... and all chain migration\nThat's the highest vote that we've ever got a two two at the Deuce even reduce chain migration we weren't we fell about twenty votes short but you know we've gotta we've gotta fight and people need to ask there that the candidates right now either running for office or will you pledge to reduce the legal immigration Evers\nWhich by the way if you're concerned about illegal immigration\nMost studies were fine that basically illegal immigration goes up with legal immigration more more legal immigration half more illegal you have it sounds ... but it's because\nIt's the legal ... provide basically the legal pools for the illegal relatives to swim in a so we we obviously have to we've got to work on both fronts\nWere working very hard right now to keep in front of people the fact that we've got this auto pilot program that's just flooding roads flooding our schools flooding our cities flooding our job markets with with foreign nationals that maybe find people\nBut it's not something that's helped it's helpful to our quality of life\nYou know lately Roy what I've been asking\nPeople is um you want to be generous and as a society I think this country's very generous both its government is private charities\nBut how generous do you want to be if you tell your wife I might bring a buddy home for dinner tonight she's probably throw grade that'll be fun if you show up with ten people instead\nA and you say well my buddy invited his wife and his kids and laws and your wife says hey don't do that again\nTen you know one person as a guest is great maybe two but bringing ten is outrageous well if during the Reagan years there were maybe three hundred thousand per year legal legally allowed to the United states and then it went to six hundred thousand or and Clinton and now lately a million a year which numbers the right number\nAnd and you say well let's take all the people who want to come well then we want to boost to do what two or three million a year crossing the border\nOr that will be and then ask people are the ... are the roads and streets in your place in your you know the town you live in crowded are is housing in short supply or your kids are grandkids sitting in a classroom it's overcrowded and are there enough teachers and cops and jails and everything else and if the answer to all that is\nYes all those things are crowded saying now imagine what they'll be if we have a dramatic increase or even continue the same level of people coming that we have right now to keep up the good work will you please Roy we appreciate what numbers usa usa does to advocate for\nLegal immigration but within the kind of constraints federal actually make it not overwhelmed this great country we've got

get remarried all of a sudden that became very foreign to her\nWell I don't drink I don't smoke marijuana beat people so evidently she may have been advised by her attorney to go after me for

don't I'm not personally familiar with it but I'm more of it but I guess how does this relate to what judge Kavanaugh is going through today\nWell because many and the media all you know just believe her or just leave her many of the female people who have been victimized in the past or just believe her and I'm Sorry but I Can't I Can't endorse out as a blanket statement\nI don't either I and I told you may not have heard of the last week my take on it was a young women and probably young men as well who make an accusation should be taken seriously there are others have said they should be believed well to be to believe an accusation means\nYou're already without having her did\nSay I believe that the accusation is true and I believe that the person who's defending himself or herself\nIs automatically done a liar and I think starting with that kind of biased point of view is the wrong way to start you should take them seriously you shouldn't necessarily believe it because prejudices yourself pre judging the case like that is a mistake in any situation\nAnd I would hope that our society would take that seriously as well Joan prejudged the case and say that if an

Johnson who's president of the black conservative federation and beyond to welcome to program and why are the lip so angry at ...\nWell when ...\nWhen our lives and create any [laughter] that's that's the question death or they you know they they got away with Kavanaugh so now they have to be angry economy um\nYou know they're upset because it's becoming clear now it's becoming clear now that black Americans are no longer um they they no longer have to the stick to that\nDemocratic plantation they no longer has to be you know married to one party\nIn ... is outlining was that he's outlining that he's basically telling people that you don't have to um do ... ... you don't have to do with people say you must do you don't have to vote where they said you've always will just because of your skin color\nAs I always tell people is that when I look at my birth certificate there's nothing that says that I'm supposed to be a there's nothing that says I'm supposed to be a Democrat\nAnd so what happens is that the left tends to be able to make all these assumptions that black sludge vote ... Democrats are the way for the Democrats have done anything for a for black Americans Democrats hasn't that anything because if you look at look at the seven city Chicago Detroit um Washington DC LA San\nFrancisco service and all of those are the lack of our cities that Iran's by Democrats and nothing has been lifted black Americans but also that's what the highest crimes are\nAnd in fact an awful lot of black Americans die in places like Chicago and many of them are innocent victims of the kind of crime not tolerated by democratic politicians\nUnder Democrat leadership yup\nYup so I mean I looked at this and I thought you know this takes some guts for a guy who's in the entertainment business like ... is\nTo say I'm going to say and do some things he could he could quietly support the president and people might be aware of it I'm sure there are plenty of people in Hollywood and plenty of people in other parts of the entertainment business\nWho have their own political point of view but they don't put it on full display because they realize this might cost me you know uh you know ten thousand songs sales on\nOn a comment on Spotify or whatever\nHe's not afraid and that's something that we like about him that he's not afraid to say I stand with the president I stand with the lead the party and I stand for what the president is saying and he talked about how many people bashed\nJust bash the president I don't even know what they're bashing they bashed president they passionate they bash every lady does because that's what it's been\nIt's normal to do in that community and so when he decides to do something different it then become this whole different ballgame\nWell for instance one of the quotes that stuck out at me and this is why I maybe I should have been watching Saturday Night live I was up past midnight\nOn the west coast on Saturday Night I just didn't watch it I had to hear about it the next day but he said quote you know it's like the plan the Democrats plan to take fathers out of the home and promote welfare does anybody know about that that's the Democratic plan\nAnd I thought I think he's right it's in the same kind of thing I said that you're really playing a trick on a whole generation or two when you say to young ladies if you have a baby you can have a ... as long as you don't get married and and provided father for that trial lawyers the government will send you a check\nAnd I just incentivize is marriage and cohesive families um the w._b. ... boys uh you know back back in the day was the guy who pointed out that you you had a largely intact black family structure in the early part of the Nineteen hundreds Nineteen hundreds of Nineteen twenty or thirty and it was largely intact\nAnd then in the sixties came along and the great society under Lyndon Johnson and they dismantled all of that I think for political reasons under ...\nAre a lot of these policies have been in place for so long these policies these is Lyndon Johnson that says that he's going to have the N. word loading a Democrat for the rest of the for the rest of the live do you think that\nThese are the things that that that that the left is not a black a black people on the left on looking at that not that no one is educating them that she has an doctor in the colleges were there and doctoring where they're pushing all of the Democrat policies but then you have\nYou know people who are generational ... of all my payments voted democratic grandparents Democrats I'm a Democrat and what happens is Kanye West is saying that are not as of now if you don't have\nTo vote with your parents that you don't have to go for what people for what a for what they knew what the society says you must go you can be an individual huge a hard\nLook don't fool with your heart both but with your heart says don't just vote because it's popular vote Democrat\nAnd actually I think it'd be great if every group of voters instead of voting based on as you say skin color age or gender or whatever if every group played a little bit hard to get so if I'm going to vote for you the Democrat or you the Republican what are you going to do to make my family and my country better off\nAnd whichever party gives you the you know the the kind of policy that will actually produced that result you vote for them and he voted along for a couple of cycles and they don't deliver you say hey I voted for you you didn't deliver I'm going somewhere else\nOr large my organization currently is\nWhat we're doing a national day of action for black conservatives all around the country but one thing that the only thing is we're telling people is to make politicians who worked for your vote and I guarantee once we start list that starts to sit in the Democrats were not no longer have the power back because they haven't done anything I was in Chicago and I was met with people [noise] um\nI met with representatives on Fort and some other individual I said well our representatives only ... followed our ultimate already answered the phone I said because that's because they already have your vote because you've already given it to them you won't voting thing they'll send you have been married to them and so they feel they don't have to work with like a marriage\nIt's like a marriage when you've had that honeymoon period and then added a honeymoon period they distribute it can just do whatever they want to do because you're not going to get a divorce that's how it is\nAnd and you know id onto that applies to men and women look I my wife does not take me for granted and I don't take her for granted we've been together for almost twenty five years and married for almost twenty three years now but we understand the minute you start to take the other one for granted\nYou're really you're you're casting them the worst kind of insult you can throw it him which has beer here you're going to stick around I don't have to work hard and and my work hard I mean what can I Do today that will be good for my wife and good for my family and if she she should be thinking the same kind of thing\nAh politically motivated and uh just um very strange and I I ... I I you know I Hope it works out there saying possibly that this uh FBI investigation may be wrapping up much sooner than anybody\nExpected and again you know my my thought at least that's what we're hearing from I Believe the wall Street Journal and a\nA NBC is that it could be over as soon as tonight or tomorrow and\nConsidering they were asking for a week and it's already concluded my initial reaction is that well obviously\nThey they haven't found anything you know so um we'll see how it goes but uh I think it's really it ... this has been horrible for bread cabin on his family that put them through this and I think he's handled himself magnificently through this entire process\nYeah I like I Hope they putting in you\nKnow we'll see mandate Spencer appreciate the call man\nYes sir thank you Iranian are but I enjoy the program\n[laughter] thank you I'm Glad you do manage a crazy little program pays you a little from\nTwo one zero five nine nine thirty five eighty five zero five nine nine thirty five thirty five again or whatever's on your brain you want to talk about the Kavanaugh hearings you want to talk about\nUh the uh the now there are what are they I\nGuess they're going with the ... you know after a you'll be forty concert and I don't know if I'd admit to that in and out itself\nAfter [laughter]\nAfter a you'll be forty a concert there now saying that uh uh uh Brett Kavanaugh\nApparently through some ice someone a in a bar after you be forty concert well you know how those you be\nForty concerts go man I mean there's ... people get into ... beat out of them naked people having sex orgies it's just crazy so you can't blame the man for anything he did after you be forty concert\nTwo one zero five nine Ninety five eighty five two one zero five nine nine thirty five fifty by again the uh the opening line portion of the show then I'll be back to ...\nUh at four O. five you can email me Shawna cagey essay doc I'm going to mention that or not they can email me is Shawna K TSA dot com or if you want to tell me how much I suck you have my stinking God's uh it's up\nTo you one more quick call here is Robert Robert how you doing [noise]\nHey Sean hey we're talking about that though and water [laughter] Dr oily and her Coca Cola or\nSomebody mentioned that that she angle the the label towards the camera a couple of times\nYeah it's pretty nice [laughter] think about it every\nEvery broadcaster in the United states [noise] I just wonder I Wonder how much she got the\nCourage to go well see we already know that people have just handed her nine hundred thousand dollars these go fund me account so it's a\nLittle weird right there\nAnd I appreciate the call man they just want to see what they're up I'm not naive I Believe five um\n[noise] uh I Know a lot of you were or sending messages of Detroit and jak about the ... that I was out last night wasn't on the show and then a lot of you were asking if it was about my stepdaughter\nA transplant my stepdaughter is doing great uh she's going to be in the hospital for just a couple of more days and then she's going to be released a which were were very looking forward to I did receive some very bad news\nOver the weekend a in that uh there was a a fire at my mother's house and a while my mother did escape ah my older brother Roger was killed in that fire and uh I heard about that uh\n[noise] heard about that on a Saturday Night so I'm I'm probably not going to be here again next week um and I know a lot of you were on who are on Facebook or already know about this and I just wanted to say that everybody here at the station has been\nJust amazing I you know this has been a hell of a year for my family and uh uh I have two families ah actually it's all one big family but I I had my family outside of this\nAnd then I have my family inside the building and everybody has just been fun", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Lars Larson Show", "city": "San Antonio", "day": "02"}
