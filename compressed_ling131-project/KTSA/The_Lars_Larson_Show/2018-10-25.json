TSA NF\nThey connected [noise] welcome\nBack to the largest Lawrence and show it's a pleasure to be with you on a Wednesday evening you know we've been talking I'm\nPretty much the whole day about the bombs that arrived at sites like the CNN headquarters in New York City they arrived at the home of bill and Hillary Clinton arrived at the home of Michelle in rock Obama\nHave now we are told tonight or a package bomb has been identified in South LA at the home or off as a Maxine Waters and we thought it was you know what I I don't know what happened to Gary burned but he's not on the phone right now is going to jump into Gary Byrne who's a former air marshal Secret Service officer\nAnd the New York times best selling author of secrets of the secret service\nAnd crisis of character we'll see if we can get back on the line because I wanted to get his take\nOn exactly why he thinks might be going on with these bomb incidents who might be behind them and of course how we protect against them as well let me go to AJ first aid Jay welcome to the Lars Larson show what's your take on this bomb situation who do you think's behind it and what do you think they were intending to do said quick\nAny large thank you for having me on the show um\nI think it's a I think it's a left all on the left I think that this is supposed to trade it so you don't think sympathy all radicalized you know the ... the groups like al ...\nI think you're probably right about that but I'm going to get Gary burns take on this Gary welcome to the program sorry for the little a technical crew bar there uh the author of secrets of the secret service and crisis of character it's good to have you back on the program\nThank you so much here\nI've talked about this most of the evening but what do you think is going on here where they have and just let me throw these elements out\nYou have we've now been told that the device at the New York times I sorry at the CNN headquarters has now been identified is not an actual explosive device but we were told earlier today that some of these devices appear to be real although none went off\nAnd some of them may have been made so that they would not go off they were delivered in packages they made them fairly readily identifiable enemy in manila envelope with a pipe and had a I think it would set off anybody's alarm bells shut or what do you think it was going on what what\nWell there's a couple of possibilities I when I take it it's just some days it can get ... and ... and trying to draw attention to themselves or\nOr to give you the impression that you know ... they're anti democratic or their anti Trump or possibly ... and this is a little bit of a stretch but it could be that it's two different people just coincidentally doing it at the same time\nFor that one can quite a coincidence wouldn't it and you're thinking maybe one of them would be one of them like you know send a package to us arose in upstate New York and somebody else in the package to uh to see an end to the Obamas to the Clintons et cetera\nRight right and you know the that that when it comes to a president or former president like I talk about my book secret to the cigarettes are as everything that they get a screen at a remote site before\nThey're protected to actually get the mail now private person\nDoesn't get that protects you normally let's say for like I Would imagine Mr SARS has some kind of security apparatus but you know the details once the FBI releases more details will know exactly what happened but the ideal that somebody mellow mellow bombed purposely did work does not\nRelease them from from the look out at you know it's just like walk yeah it's just I walked in the world bank is sticking your hand in your coat pocket and saying I have a gun in the money um they treat you just look at the same but it's still a terrorist ...\nI've had that conversation with the age of the years and they said hey if you pretend that if you simulate a gun in a way that the bank teller believes is a gun it is still armed robbery under the law whether you had a gun or not so\nIt's just as I say just I'm not trying to minimize it but if it's attention seeking behavior\nAre we likely to see more of this kind of thing because\nYou know this is this does terrorize people\nYeah I I Do think we might see more and then you might see also the dreaded copy cats and they were supposed to look all is that when there is the FBI ... little um you know all all ...\nStates future behavior you know the the wherever that says I'm going to say well I'm not surprised or they're going to have a history of either mellow that\nAre committing folks to call for all of their means motive out the guinea and um you know those little eat those will be ... months up on it or do something like this before or said they were you know I always go back to the bottom of the way the Unabomber he ran for years and nobody can figure out what he was\nWell Tilly credit they put it in his manifesto and as soon as his brother read it they knew he knew exactly what was it was his brother\nBecause you recognize a lot of the uh what did you go right that that line of crazy that that that's my brother he talks like that he writes like that right and and he was he did a tremendous service and I guess I Wonder I Wonder did the time out loud\nWould you have the courage to say my brother is doing something really terrible that's taking people's lives I'm going to turn him in and I know\nThe results are my turning him is going to send him to prison I I don't have any doubt in my mind I Would do that if a family member was doing such a down but I Wonder if there are other people who would say no I just don't want to know about it and I and I don't want to be responsible for sending my\nMy brother to prison for the rest of his life yeah well you look at the circumstances\nDon't forget how many people were named and injured on ... when they realized too was that was on his brother's mind his brother talked about that but yet you know he felt so guilty but it took so long to figure out who it was but as soon as he saw the manifesto he took tournament\nWell and here's here's the other question I Know that let's say we find out I'd I'd put up a few possibilities on our Twitter pulled tonight is uh the left is it the ride is it because of the election is it a garden variety nut case or is it a foreign factor it is beginning to sound like a garden variety nut case based on the way they are because\nGary for what little we know about it right I'm Talking to Gary burn is the author of secrets of the secret service in crisis of character 'em up a piece of pipe in manila envelope that doesn't even you know conceal his weight or its size word shape\nSeems almost designed to be identified easily and now that we're finding out the or the CNN device was not even a real explosive device I'll do some of these were they at least had the components to go off but none of them did go off\nSo desert ... if if this was a garden variety nut case who said I'm going to make something that looks enough like a bomb it'll scare people have to death or but I don't want it to go off I don't want it to maim or kill people and I wanted to be fairly quickly and readily identified\nAnd the amount of tape you used on those bombs in the packages I'm willing to bet the FBI is going to find fingerprints DNA and all kinds of things is is somebody who's saying I Want to be caught and I want to be identified\nYeah the the and also something else or you just pointed out um you know it it did he used it that's a that's a sign of a mental condition [noise]\nI'm ... years as an issue and it's almost like being compulsive where they put so much take on it that's that's not a real bombed though that's somebody who's got a lot of this and uh for one reason or the other they're angry there detach and again when they figure out who this is\nEx gaping political or otherwise uh issues um and so there's reticence or a a towards public officials law enforcement and otherwise and\nAnd I think we're confusing this issue and it's unfortunate because we can at the same time be open to what we have been as a country of uh for refugees and immigration\nUm but I think we're we're\nCausing more ... more a sensitivity to the issue rather than being very clear where a country of laws and that's\nWhere people have immigrated to because they want to be in a country of laws Dave uh they seek to a refugee status and asylum because they want to be in a in a in a country of laws and and individual rights and in this case um uh this has been addressed that the federal level and I've I've often thought\nTo keep local things local uh and and the way of course\nThese are issues that need to be debated at the federal level often I Believe some of these are passed so that we can get into the court systems\nAre because perhaps we believe the law should be changed but they want to do it through the courts\nIt's a rather than the legislative civil and tell me this does the city council ordinance have the authority to overrule the access of the of the customs and border protection agency\nOr the legal review I've seen on it uh I Believe no uh it's clear at stated in a in a a the a far there is a court case was quoted by one of our city council members um Virginia versus call and those are called her sister junior\nI'm actually Virginia ... actually it would be and um and that was referencing a person's home at their own garage a they make the inference that is what this looks like because of course our\nOur bus companies go in an underpass where people\nLogically get off out of the weather go and use the restroom get back onto the bus and continue on or get off um and I think that's a stretch personally\nA man and a and I'm not going to put myself in the position as a an oath to office both federal state and local laws that are impeding a federal agent is also against uh uh the law so this is and\nAnd it really is interesting because they do not need to ask permission and the way the law was written was it gave the authority to the mayor or to give permission well the federal agencies don't ask for permission\nBecause they don't have to they have the authority and these locations to do this\nUm and uh so that's that's the reality is so it's not an authority I have a ... and so there would be no expectation that border patrol or any other federal agencies would call me to to be granted this permission\nSo that's where I was in ... I'm Sorry Mary that's where I was headed with the next question which is\nThe law says that the border patrol has to come to you hand in hand and say Mr Mayor do we have permission to go search and then you're supposed to give them written permission if this is all just window dressing PR by the liberals on the city council saying\nYou have to answer the mayor's permission maybe you should answer was window dressing Pete are your own and write a letter saying this is my granted permission to the U.S customs and border protection to do whatever they need to do on city property in public areas are not from now till the end of my term\nWell uh that's the statement I put out yesterday and the executive or a direct order I gave to our police chief was just that\nAh which is we will I'm a grant or the authority that they already have so I don't have the authority to grant them but uh\nUh to to quote the law that they have this uh thirty other worry I have is is we grapple with things like human trafficking and and guns and arm you know those sorts of traffic and if you start going down this path people then exploit that and we have\nAmazing task forces that we're on with our federal and state partners\nUh to work for the issues of either interstate I'm a criminal activity or or international criminal activity\nAnd by putting us in this position um it doesn't allow our law enforcement colleagues to work together\nOr to really combat things where the criminal activities exploiting just is the difference is between law the differences are maybe confusion among law enforcement so we have a great is as a country as a city that is within that hundred miles we have great working\nRelationships with all of our federal agencies Mayor Khan and it's a pleasure as always thanks very much for the time thank you that's mayor David Condon from the mayor from the city of Spokane we'll be back in just a moment of your phone calls and emails are welcome on the Lars Larson show [noise]\nLaura's Law says show [noise]\n\nAnd I sort of how the hardware\nUp and said this ball at your neighborhood when you're taking care of the everyday products around your house races you're one stop shop to find exactly what you're looking for a great deal now through October twenty nine\nMight buy one get one free on how the light bulbs by one get one free on east basic housekeeping and by to get one free on east furnished filters pony up here locally ... offers out participating stores exclusions him and this may ...\nTwenty four seven three sixty five Europe and had an every day so you don't want something like Medicare part D to slow you down\nAt Walgreens will take care of your Medicare part D prescription seating you time and money make a switch to ... today and get more earning a hundred dollars or more points up to five dollars on each Medicare part D prescription\nWalgreens is preferred pharmacy long green tested since Nineteen oh one prescription pain in the past year engineers when he thought I prefer to have an opera for farmers can select plants ... here in New York or here I can apply\nAs a homeowner you know how much of the the maintenance is involved rely on just anyone when it comes to your room called the most trusted roping business in Texas roof there as\nA business owner the last thing you need is building issues depend on the company with a plus for the better Business Bureau roof fix owners Wayne sharpening\nAnd his crew for your satisfaction at the top of their list fulltime installers who are certified in fact retrained will beyond sites delivering the highest standards in the industry don't handle every job\nFrom a free inspections to a totally new roof from start to finish school even worked with your insurance company so that you get everything you have coming to you from single this late pile of metal even concrete roofs the offer is zero percent interest payments as low as one hundred and twenty nine dollars per month called today for free roof inspection\nShe's had four or five for twenty four hundred suits and four or five for twenty four hundred for reach them online at R.

Medicare for all idea which as you know you know almost all the Democrats are running for Congress or this year I'm running out of this whole idea of Medicare for all and what's not well known about that proposal\nIs that unlike Obamacare when at least black Obama when he was selling that plan you know rent you remember what he said last year if you like you're outside if you're like her doctor if you're like you're a shortage\nCompany you can eat but we all know that was a bit of a lie but now the Democrat whether or not health care it's become much more ...\nThey don't even let your like your helps you get to eat but I don't know how to care for all under Bernie Sanders and are so many of these data ... on everybody's out in the pool but if you're like you're ... you can keep it you left the ... district right healthcare system a hundred and fifty\nMillion Americans that's virtually everyone who was washed up the Mississippi River um\nEvery American without ... what do you like or that is thrown into a government system I think that's a killer\nWell and I almost I ... I guess at the risk there is a chance when I criticize the way the VA has a has done medical care for veterans\nInvariably I'll get at least a few veterans who say I love the VA they've always delivered for me they tend to be the healthy or one of the ones who have any kind of problems at all they're going to say oh no the VA as this gigantic massive bureaucracy they're terrible to deal with\nAnd they very rarely deliver what I really need in a timely fashion and I would think if you ask most of the people on Medicare do you like this plan\nWell if they have a doctor who was willing to take Medicare which is the first hurdle to John\nUh ... they'll say well it's okay but it's certainly not like the healthcare you had when you were working and had a a paid for plan\nAnd then if you ask the doctors do you like a plan that delivers lower rates of compensation so I don't know if you're getting sixty sixty five cents on the dollar ... that I Know a lot of doctors myself who said well you know I have some Medicare patients that's okay they effectively under charge them by taking lower rage\nAnd in effect have to transfer that cost two they're paid patients if it was all Medicare\nCan you imagine going to a doctor or a nurse\nAnd saying how would you like to get sixty five percent of what you use to earn so you're not only going to have to cut your paycheck but you're going to have to cut the pay checks of all the medical professionals who work with and for you and I think most doctors\nWould tell you that would be a disaster and I'd end up leaving the practice of medicine and we'd like to be a lot to do a Great Britain seems to have and that is basically government employee doctors who approached their job sort of the way most of the people at the DMV approach their job I don't want to be subject to that and I don't want anybody else to be subject to either\nYeah the problem I think Democrats have with Medicare flaw is that um you know there's a reason that black Obama said if you like you're out there you can keep it because it turns out Seventy percent of us who have I have an employer health plan through all my uh\nFoundation of lawyer um I like it\nYou know I like it it's pretty good it's not\nPerfect but it's it's good or I don't want to give it up flowers\nBut I don't want the government coming in to tell me I have to give up my plan and told me that oh this will be better for you a Bernie Sanders says I don't trust per se but I got and you know what most Americans I ... I\nBelieve that it would be a good thing to cover you know Americans should every American citizen depending and don't you know regardless of their income for health for health expenditures or\nYou know major or health problems that they might have learned that most Americans believe that but ... and ... we have a system to provide the benefits to them but Americans don't want to give up their own health insurance you know Ninety percent of the health insurance we all want to you know wouldn't Arnold plant\nYou know show that ... percent who don't have health care getting just getting in the healthcare voucher and let them go out and shop for health care yeah that's the way I feel that the interests of you know you mentioned the veterans plant you I experienced the same thing some of the veterans say to me\nYou know I get good health coverage from the DAS but all\nWe have Walter Reed right down the street from where I live that's one of the finest hospitals in the world\nBut other veterans say I I you know I get lousy care so why not give every veteran a an opportunity if they don't want to go to the VA hospital they go to another hospital well I'm a choice guy that the Democrats don't believe in choice they believe that forcing you enter the health care that they want to give you\nYou know what I'd like to do I want to make a proposal I Want to I Want the government is far out of health care as we can possibly do whilst eliminate now here's what I Do in place\nSteve to pieces first of all let's deal with a preexisting condition crowd which is about somewhere between two hundred thousand maybe a high end of four hundred thousand people because we know those numbers because of the people who signed up for Obamacare was ... when they wiped out all the risk bowls\nSo those two hundred thousand people could be covered as I understand the numbers for maybe ten Fifteen billion dollars out of eight hour thousand\nBillion dollar federal budget I like saying four thousand billion while they were saying if you made four thousand bucks a month could you afford Fifteen bucks for this black people would say or for the you know forty thousand bucks a year could you afford a hundred and fifty dollars for this just to make them out to easy\nThen I go sure so that's part one just cover everybody with a preexisting condition that who has ... let's say wealth blow up a million bucks for half a million bucks and ... below ... a hundred thousand dollars yeah if you're over a hundred thousand you got to take care of yourself second\nWhat I'd like to do is have the government say we will ... define what a good catastrophic plan is because this is the second group does all of us you have to realize I get hit by a truck\nAnd or you know I get hit by heart attack and I need a hundred and fifty thousand dollar operation if I don't have health care and I do um then I Need to have that bypass covered or the trans fat uncovered or whatever your kid needs a new kidney okay we'll take care of it\nBut we'll take care of it by saying we will offer a catastrophic plan for those people who want to go up to practically bear they're not going to have any insurance except catastrophic and they say it's like you know vote having having a a collusion insurance\nOn normal yeah total owner's insurance homeowners centers are trying to think ... hours burns down I don't want to see even on homeowners I bumped\nMy deductible from a thousand five thousand because they said why my wife said well why are you well for house burned down then we have to cover the first five thousand not not a big deal if your house burned down you know five thousand bucks but the the chance of that is very low and the savings by going to that it gives you a really low premium so\nYou do those two things but you don't have the government provided you say to the insurance industry developed this product and if you meet the criteria so we can tell people it has the good housekeeping that Donald Trump seal of approval on and then\nPick from one of the news and the and all of these companies will compete with each other saying we have a better one and it's only forty dollars a month and literally where I could get to premiums like that couldn't way\nYes I mean let's think about it this way but at least that you know McDonalds is the best restaurants in the you know fast food restaurant so we don't need all these other\nOh well I'm going to have an eight year old grandma\n[laughter] there you go no one will ever recognizes [laughter] begging Carolyn thank\nGod Bless you too and run by [laughter]\n\nAnybody out there under the age of twenty five no with papier-mache is an old man well maybe masks and stuff with papier-mache once when Star Wars came out my old man made me a Darth Vader helmet the mask from paper freaking ... man\nAnd a you know so I I don't know what I use my wife my wife wants to give out candy on Halloween ... you know you don't really do that and apartment complexes\nSo this is the ... well because we never have anybody who shows up almost like when you're when you're when you're trick or treating it they are giving out can be an apartment complex\nYou like Nineteen and twenty two year old to show up you know they're not even we're in freaking costumes and usually they're heavily armed so this is my wife's first time in a long time to actually be in a neighborhood with a house\nAnd we can give out Halloween candy and so she expects us all to dress up as something\nWhat is it something look like a crash see\nHow you are I'm going to go with something I'm going to give us a tub of max salad um [laughter]\n\nI don't know it's our first year in the neighborhood so I don't know if I Want to go to creepy because ... going to come back\n... would do a God see how you are\nI'm Still ... my wife also said I Want to give away their best candy in the cul de sac if I Want to have the coolest candy to give away literally you know what the hell that means I mean it's a full size Mars but good die but chocolate dessert worry\nYou've ...\nYou've been a little shots of gold longer I mean is it what what are you going to get those orange chocolate orange is the cost me a whole freaking paychecks to buy the candy to give away the kids in the call design there'll be back next year yeah but see how she is she's already into that whole\nYou know what do you call that you know trying to outdo the neighbors thing you know what I mean the one that being the one ...\nGod Christmas rolls around our our our house is going to look like a used car lot man will say at least for Halloween passing up a good candy keeps the kids from toilet paper in your house this is true or just although I could also use the toilet paper so maybe I could resign politically\nYou know wrap that tree in the front yard babies free toilet paper\nAnd and and\nHere is Steve Steve you're on your start five fifty K.
