gun welcome back\nTo Lars Larson shows you know tonight's Twitter ... concerns a caravan of refugees\nFrom Honduras coming toward the United states border and\nOf course the demand from the president of the United states that Honduras rain in this effort and if they don't a hundred and Seventy five million dollars in American foreign aid to ... is very much at stake well should some of the asylum loopholes be closed\nTo try to stop some of the illegal aliens like the caravan of aliens from on doors from trying to enter our country illegally and let's make a clear distinction if you come to the country legally if you seek to enter\nIn the legal way I have no problem with that\nWe may change some of those laws at some point if the Congress decides to get busy with his actual job\nBut uh but it's the illegal entrance that I'm concerned with Chris ... is the deputy director for numbers usa Chris I wanted to get your perspective on the situation that caravans now grown from about a thousand to Thirteen hundred now roughly sixteen hundred people and the president's new threat to Honduras\nPulled them back or you lose your foreign aid\n[noise] yeah this is talk of the ... um we we care in the past but this is the first time that we've seen a caravan start at a court so that if states holes\nIn what's called the political your standard that was put into effect by the other the homeland security to\nCalmer and changed the way that ... when they when they approached the U.S all the costs of auto parts that solves that tree and they try to claim a file up you know the United states or they're going to have to have they're going to have three\nOr order to get a trade show off his anger across the face but actually what\nWell and tell me this can you put this in laypeople late persons terms for both me and for my audience when somebody comes from Honduras if they present themselves legally at a port of injuries you say and they say I have a credible fear of persecution if I go back to my country do they have a leg to stand on is is there\nIs there a case to be made that some of the legitimately do have a fear or just that\nEconomic conditions in such are not nearly as good in Honduras as they are and the good old USA Today\n[noise] [noise] yeah well well the first part you know both us off pretty clearly define quiet or eat the rats status style\nThe status of basically those words are absolutely bullet just a pet is where the person is as to which which part of our lives that now but essentially what what the law says that if you you know ...\nBy your government because of that what you believe whether it's religious beliefs political beliefs social groups that you you are in or race religion\nThan that then you can get\nAsylum or rack status about what's happening as you say is that it being so coming up from Honduras or trying to claim asylum in fact because there's a lot of criminal violence to our country and there's no jobs that we want to claim asylum status in the United states\nSo before again that's all that I that that that department of homeland security implement that after a ruling that was made by attorney general Jeff Sessions which sexually redefine what credible here is\nUm on new moved it more in line with what the federal law is\nThat one statement that tweak a prior to that um folks could gain entry as asylum seekers in the United states by ... say well I have a fear of criminal violence in my country now they won't be able to do so again this is the first time that creek is going to be passed that\nWell a new tracked look I feel for people who are stuck in one of these countries where the government doesn't seem to address the prime ... there were problems and crime and violence\nBut that's an issue that needs to be resolved by each country or if your government is persecuting you because you're gay or because you're a different religion or whenever I understand that but even then\nIf the standard was uh the economy stinks and there are a lot of there's a lot of criminal activity how many of the seven billion people on planet earth might be able to credibly say you know those things are lousy back home I'd like to go somewhere else I Would imagine it'd be a very large number\n[noise] yeah and and that's the key point that set that of course that's missing from the higher and higher ... or whatever we talk about these care of the press never seem to seem to consider the fact that there were a lot you have about five million people I'm sure all above to come to the United states\nAnd we let them all at a ... we could I mean it would completely over on the United states simply allow that to happen\nAnd we have to quit the laws in place that we have to enforce a so so you know ... and you mentioned the seven billion people around the world without you know thirty to fifty percent of what I also love to cover the United states but that the best probably has always helped people back in their home countries try to help their\nEconomy improves try to help the government get control of a criminal activity that happens to be taking place there\nAnd that's what President Trump seems to be threatening right now I he he is apparently told the president of hot Doris hey work out all all federal funding if you guys don't stop this caravan heading up to the United states or the if the house and the fact\nChris ... is deputy director of numbers usa which does great work on immigration issues because by that standard I Would imagine that if\nThe current victims of criminal gangs you know of all of them could get together in a caravan it'd probably be tens or even hundreds of thousands of people and if they laughed I'm sure the criminal gangs don't go out of business they just turn to the next set of victims until one until you've emptied the country\nSo so it's really not a ... it's not a solution and I think\nI'd even make the case Christian you told me what you think of his argument that if you take some of the pressure off for country by having some of the people in the worst situation leave knowing that there are still nine million people that those criminal gangs can pick on and steal from because that's what they do for a you know for a living to get them get their money\nThat ... in some ways you may actually put the solution farther away because the folks who are most drug go most willing to pick up and pack up and leave and go somewhere else\nOr they aren't going to get rid of the the folks who are actually doing the bad acts but they will they may take the pressure off the government to try to fix the reforms and and make the change is necessary to get rid of the problem altogether\n[noise] right right I mean there are certainly people that are that are using to fight off now call and we'll probably use the caravan of we've seen it after that there are some bad\nFolks that will jump in and and and try to take advantage of of the fact that you\nKnow this caravan of coming up they're going to get some are going to get for protection they're going to have the benefit of food and water that's going to ...\nMake that make the track through through Mexico to the U.S Mexico border but but\nUh the the vast majority of them are as you sat there are good people there are people that are willing to work you know they're willing to how how a ... a prosperous country it's just the ... that that's happening out there\nAnd and a lot of it is is the responsibility of the government the government down and it has done it stops I take a bite him out of us said that that ... down there you got these folks leaving the country it's going to benefit the country in the long run you\nThe way at least till we at least acknowledge we've got a rip roaring economy and and yeah you know you're going to have your ups and downs in the economy but you know you think about the Eighteen hundreds of rock bottom at trying to climb out of the worst recession most of us have ever seen and being in the lecture that\nAmerica couldn't do more than one pointed to two percent GDP Growth and the Trump would need a magic wand up to three\nFor over that now because our policies are philosophies are yours and mine about letting people keep more what they are taking the dead and the government overregulation off the throats of America's off an entrepreneur and enterprise or the innovators and they will create and we will grow the economy actually work couldn't put into place let's keep that going\nWell I agree with you but Congress and I think maybe the Republicans are missing about I think Republicans in general even though you've got a background and media like me or that we're terrible at telling her own story and I think one of the one of the ramps on Obama shouldn't just to have been well you had a lousy economy she could have had\nThis economy couldn't eat right he could only added ... three years in because usually and I've talked to a bunch of economists about this the harder we go into an ... in a recession\nA and that was a hard one usually the faster\nYou come back out the other side because the economy once to recover people want to work instead we took a lot of people in what I feel sorry for those people who are in their late fifties when we get away and they they had the last ten years usually some of the best working years you've got stolen away from them they were sidelined\nBy the time the economy came back under Trump\nOnce the ... what's the opportunity for eight now sixty eight sixty nine year old man or woman\nWell beyond that large your exactly right don't leave out the fact that the fact that their four O. one K. became a two point five you know we lost half you evaluate forty percent of the value of one of the ... retirement account in the market that come back and again markets are always going to the Dow it's always going to go up and down but\nYou say to the to the stability there the growth there the recoveries there for your retirement so I look at it you're right he could have a much better economy he didn't believe in it he never did believe in America's on it'll spirit remembered the line about you didn't built this yeah you know an small business and\nAnd so it he just never got it because he'd never signed the front of a payroll check my wife like small business owners are Twenty one year you get this stuff pretty instinctively what you've done that for two decades\nAnd he literally never had been an employer up to that point and and even as a president technically he employees all those federal employees and the whole military but he didn't really know the the reality of saying the revenue has to come in for me to be able to make those tracks the way you and your wife did so\nYou know you know the are the hardest thing about being a government employer will overspend what you know you're already going to get I mean at AT T All right here's your budget for the year the biggest challenge you have is don't spend more than you were given that how do you go early\nAnd so I look we we can do so much more and and we will but I'll tell you this is a three weeks from tomorrow we're going to know which direction the country goes which direction by seat goes uh we got to be all in in this fight\nWell I think we know where you're she

yesterday most of America heard all about\nElizabeth Warren's DNA did they ever wanted to hear you probably heard more about focus ... genetic heritage than you ever wanted to hear\nBut I Know that to late in the day yesterday the Cherokee Nation came out with a strong denials saying no Elizabeth Warren is not Cherokee and know Elizabeth Warren does not get to call herself a Native American based on having a tiny amount of possible DNA\nAnd by the way had you heard that the DNA specialist who said that he had found Native American DNA in Elizabeth Warren sample actually had to admit that it wasn't from Native Americans it was from people in South America and Mexico\nAnd then I just saw this I think this is the perfect metaphor to understand it\nPeople can argue back and forth and I've

tanker and usually the tank that's on the truck is about five thousand gallons as I understand the ratios and then if they have a trailer tank then that's another five thousand gone so that's ten thousand gallons of milk\nCan you imagine if somebody tried to do what Elizabeth Warren is doing and you said we showed up the dairy farm we took the ten thousand gallons that can be held by those two tanks that you always see going down the road and saying you know have you had your cup of milk today\nAnd you stopped and you said let me check out that milk you've got and the driver said well this is a special Elizabeth Warren milk so in ten thousand gallons in those trucks you have ten gallons of milk one\nOne thousand and the rest of it is water would you call that milk\nAnd I think you know you would not and Mike it's an excellent metaphor I'm supposed to be fairly good at metaphors that one was absolutely fantastic but\nUh but I just ah I just don't understand how this woman thing she

named after him because the French government has said it might upset local Muslims\nYou might remember twenty four the march this year and ISIS terrorists stormed a supermarket\nArmed with a handgun a hunting knife and three homemade bombs he shot two people dead took others hostage during negotiations with police\nThe terrorist excepted police officer build trains offer to swap places with the

you\nCan't name a street after him because that will upset the Muslims\nIf you were a follower of Islam I have no problem with you practicing your religion if you're a follower a follower of Islam who

long time you know that by the time Obama left there was twenty almost ... almost twenty was wasn't quite twenty trillion dollars in debt that we had taken on he doubled it from ten to twenty during eight years\nNow we have well ... well I'm going to answer your question\nI Do do I think we can grow our economy enough to diminish the size of the debt and get the deficit down really the deaths it

[noise]\nLearn\nThem back to the Lars Larson show one of the things I've wondered about out loud on this\nProgram and if you've been listening long enough you've probably heard me do it I've said well you know we have better cars today but we need to get even better and better and better that's where we keep hearing from the government we need to have cars to get more mileage and that's a laudable goal\nThe only problem is that when you try to get cleaner cars with much better mileage\nSo there are two primary ways to do it and I'll be corrective if I'm wrong by the expert I'm about to talk to one way is to dramatically cut the weight of the cars but that makes them dramatically more dangerous in many cases the second way is for some kind of really advanced technology which of course dramatically increases the price of the vehicle\nAnd I've wondered for a long time since the average age of a car in America is about Thirteen Years which means you have a lot of Fifteen and Seventeen and Nineteen year old automobiles to match every brand spanking new car you see rolling down the highway so the question is if we can make cars\nMore affordable not necessarily cheaper but just reduce the amount that they go up in price every year we could probably get more people buying newer cars which would mean they're relatively lightly used cars would be put in the hands of people who would buy them and you if you can reduce that number from say Thirteen to say seven or eight\nYears as the average age of a car\nFuel efficiency would go up\nAnd pollution would go down now I'm going to talk to ... who is vice president of consumer action for a stronger economy Gerard welcome to the program\nSailors great to be with you\nSo did I get anything wrong and what I just said there 'cause I was just spit balling\nIt not at all you you sound a more of an expert on this than some of the people we've got um you know at the at the EPA so um\nAnd the national Highway Traffic Safety Administration but that's exactly right is what we got right now with the with the cafe fleet standards is government designing our cars because of an agenda it started in the seventies most of your listeners probably remember the um [noise]\nBecause of the oil crisis and the energy crisis in the embargo\nAnd the you know we ... we made speed limits fifty five the goal was sort of a it was a national effort because we all sort of we're in this together that uh there was an energy crisis and that was the auto industry is response and the government's response to making cars more fuel efficient\nAnd um but you know now they've ... it it's a forty years later the rationale for the CAFE standards has gone but the you know they bear crafts have just been crossed party and the consumers by the way here's\nBy the way he joined I Want people understand for those people under the the acronyms cafe as corporate average fuel economy what it means is\nIf you're one of the big car companies again correct me ... please if I'm wrong\nIf you say the CAFE standards corporate average fuel economy has to be twenty five miles per gallon if Ford Motor company which is one of my favorites wants to sell a pickup truck that only get Seventeen miles to the gallon to get to that cafe they have to sell a whole bunch of little cars\nAre like say Ford Escape through even smaller to be able to get the average\nOf what they're putting out to be twenty five or ... and the problem is some of it involves frankly just telling people I'm Sorry you can't buy a pickup truck\nBecause we can only sell so many are going to sell them for a fairly high price because they're in demand and you may have to settle for something smaller and something that doesn't really fit your needs\nSo that Ford can have a cafe of twenty five or thirty or an Obama wanted to put this up to fifty five which means people like me probably wouldn't be able to buy an SUV or a pickup truck at all because we'd have to have a ... tons of little dinky cars the size of mini Coopers\nTo have one or two pick up trucks the right\nAbsolutely yeah um it's crazy I mean just in the last Thirteen Years from twenty twelve to twenty twenty five they won the average fuel of cars that are sold to go from twenty nine miles per gallon to a fifty five is just that it's an almost of doubling and all the years we've had automobiles\nUm in twelve Thirteen Years we're supposed to practically doubled fuel efficiency and what that does is as you said earlier\nThey have to a vastly increased costs in order to implement technology things like hybrid vehicles which are vastly more expensive than traditional vehicles or they have to wait wait and they're doing both\nAnd the problem is is that um there's very little benefit for this this at thousands of dollars up to six thousand seven thousand dollars per price of an average vehicle by most estimates and the this is right now because there's not an energy shortage a gas can be a little bit\nLower right now that'd be nice but it's not because it's because the demand not because of supply\nThe oil of a crisis of the seventies is over America as an energy giant now we have more reserves than ever said the rationales entirely gone the only rationale is to fulfill pretty much of a green agenda of leftist politicians and aircraft\nAnd pushing people out of cars so Gerard ... is this going to happen could we see the Trump Administration say let's freeze the standards now when if you frozen standards\nWouldn't affect me if prices stopped going up on cars more people buy newer cars more fuel efficient cars already because we know that a ten year old car is not going to get his good gas mileage as the one that's brand spanking new or a year or two old if we could\nStop that and just say let's just freeze the standards or has come as close to a freeze as possible on all the new standards were pushing the car companies to get there\nIf we could reduce the cost of to the American family uh buying an automobile more of them would buy brand new ones that means more him would have new were cars a year or two or three or five years old and we could reduce that Thirteen your average age\nBack to something lower than that we'd get cleaner air we'd get more fuel efficiency and we wouldn't have to batter the consumer with these gigantic price increases\nAbsolutely not just the consumer but our auto makers their competitiveness our jobs are\nOh I'm our economy it hits it hits all the way down in the ridiculous idea is that as you said earlier because you've got to get that average you're going to sell cars the smaller cars which are not as profitable but you want a skill away from the um cars that are\nThe bigger cars that are more comfortable and have more features that people want they'll actually increase the price of those to push people into lower cars so it really skews the market at squares profitability or it's you know screws up all of the various ways that the economy should be running with consumer choice and auto makers\nMaking vehicles that people actually want to drive and\nWere you living in a great age right now or technology is doing amazing things with a you know crash warnings and\nLaying changing and break assistant and all that good stuff that's making cars safer but with these crazy CAFE standards they are going to keep people out of these cars and they're going to hold onto their car much longer um which is not only less bill efficient but it's also less safe\nWell and it and that's a big difference because they say when you get to smaller cars for every hundred pounds you trim off the car you say well that's more efficient his age also five percent more likely to kill you in a crash\nAnd and frankly I Know that they knew they couldn't go out and say we're gonna make it illegal for you to buy a pickup truck or an SUV unless you can prove your family needs that they couldn't get away with that what would they could do is say that new pickup truck or if she is going to cost you fifty sixty Seventy thousand dollars\nCagey essay known everyone else em wants to Sean show the
