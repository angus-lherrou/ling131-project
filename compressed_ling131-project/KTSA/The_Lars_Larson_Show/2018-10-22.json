somewhere in like in the University of Tennessee and I'll tell you were doing a few minutes but I Will get them to do it yeah you guys are creative I Love this tell everybody about this uh about this campaign and the the motto for the campaign is hands down the best thing I've heard\nSo in that one percent starts to drop it could affect your heart your brain your kidneys your organs and your body shutdown actually died\nWow it's all one percent of the calcium always has to be in your system and\nThere's two sources of calcium one isn't the diet you know and to us from the bones themself\n... will up absorb it back from the bones if ...\nThat's right and I say and what you just discussed right now leads to one of the major causes of a condition that the fact and twenty five million Americans right now which is called osteoporosis right which is a weakening of adults\nNow and that's due to the body deriving the calcium from the bones instead of from the ...\nYep okay and so we have to do is we have to find a way to put calcium back in the diet now you think that would be really easy\nSure just drink milk just drink milk or you know a lot of green leafy vegetables and that sort of thing but first of all people don't do that right\nAnd second of all the the quality of the calcium that comes from our diet has been decreasing in the last fifty years really yeah because things like pastures Asian foods are irradiated um the calcium as leads from the soil\nPeople are taking medications that block it so\nThe actual calcium is that being absorbed in the body okay and then you see people taking toms and calcium supplements you know they buy the health food store drug maker drink but\nThese calculus don't absorb in the body that's happening for a couple of reasons one uh when you take I let's say an antacid that had the calcium at like Tom's\nFirst of all calcium does that absorbed in the body unless it's an anesthetic environment but to see what happens when you take a tub with an antacid oh okay so even if you're getting calcium in the in the antacid itself is not being absorbed\nI see because it has to be in a in an answer an environment for it to be absorbed\nExactly okay now we have a product called the ... formula\nMy comment formula it's natural and the differences is that the powdered and what happens is you put in hot water and you mix it up and you drink it don't do it in a liquid instead of a pill and it absorbed\nInto your system wow so that sounds that problem that well\nYeah because when calcium and magnesium earn a liquid stay it absorbs ten times better than in any other state\nWow that's great matter of fact is I'm I'm reading the can right now says a fancy absorbing calcium and magnesium beverage powder\nWell it comes down to ... one of the way to tell if you're not observing them take a look at what drugs are taking are you on high blood pressure medication you need something for your kidneys or you want pain medications you need sleeping pills that the calcium and especially the ... ... you're not going to suffer from all the things\nMy combat formula does absorb incredibly in the body the thing is is that what do you take my comment formula but not like well well I feel better I have thousands of people ready to Dr ...

talking about something that we're all too familiar with these days and that stress and we're finding out about the damage that everyday stress can do to our bodies the warning signs that we should be aware of and what we can do to alleviate and even eliminate the effects of stress\nAnd Dr ... you were talking earlier about calcium and magnesium and how we need these nutrients in our bodies to fight the effects of stress in your ... formula can help us in this battle against stress I'd like to talk for a minute about how the magnesium factors in I mean\nUh I'm starting to understand about the calcium but what does magnesium\nForward talking about stress and we're talking about stress affects the body and first of all in order to function at all your body needs magnesium it's probably of all the vitamins I could list magnesium is probably the most important vitamin on the planet right now\nI've not heard a whole lot about magnesium ... why is magnesium so important\nThere is over three hundred and twenty five bio chemical reactions that mechanisms involved with it it's almost like a hormone wow and for example if it was low levels of magnesium\nYour heart won't be ... very important factor in life yeah I Would say so in\nFact let me just read a list of some of the conditions are associated with magnesium deficiencies okay um you have attention deficit disorder Alzheimer's or anxiety asthma autism chronic fatigue syndrome congestive heart disease caused the patient diabetes\nFibromyalgia high blood pressure insomnia migraine headaches multiple sclerosis muscle cramps Parkinson's osteoporosis and the list goes on and on and on\nAnd then this this is associated with a a lack of magnesium in the money\nSimply a lack of magnesium bully too so it's nothing that really mess around with now what happens is that you need that many of them in your body in order for the calcium to be absorbed\nNo so it's it's a necessary thing in order to get the first component which is calcium\nThat's right they work in combination with each other now there's many more practical applications of this ... formula ... first of all like I said you drink so it gets into your system and one of the first thing we use it for in our clinic is for people who are under a lot of stress\nAnd it can't sleep well at night it works better than anything I've ever seen for people that have\nTrouble sleep it really because it relaxes your body needs to actually feel the relaxation after you drink the ah after you drink a cup of the comics formula ... interesting now the other thing that it's really really good for her\nPeople who are in pain okay and I have a whole bunch of stories to tell you and and a case studies of people actually taking account max formula and getting rid of pain and this is including arthritic Taipei\nFibromyalgia which is a form of arthritis back pain muscle spasms migraine headaches there's a whole category of of areas that like to discuss with you\nWow that's fantastic some of those things that you've named seem to be age related or or things that we experience as we grow older is there a link there yeah\nThere's a vicious circle that I'd like to discuss what happens is that when a person has\nA magnesium deficiency specifically make museum they don't absorb their food as well\nAnd so they go into what we call mal absorption syndrome which millions and millions of Americans have and it's not like you feel sick or you know this that use it might be overtime just starting to feel more tired and tired and tired mhm and that's just a real graduate overtime type of thing and a lot of people justify that they're getting old and they just need more depressed or whatever\nRight and that's what I Would think that what happens is that when when you get less absorption you actually increase the efficiency in your system of museums\nAnd that and that started to take the calcium out of the bones you start getting bald lost you start getting um muscle loss because it also reduces the muscle mass and pretty soon before you know it you are feeling old yeah and your body that actually starting to manifest at\nWow all due to a simple lack of these nutrient\nCalcium and then they'll let me tell you and it is simple the problem in being a doctor researchers how do you get the end of the system the formula we have the ... formula is so fantastic because he had a powder form you take hot water and you make if you put it in a cop take a teaspoon of this powder and mix it in yeah and you drink is cut down\nThe screenplay absorption rate is really a incredible because it actually goes right into your blood stream\nFeeling all your joints don't move well this kind of wife's you out it drains your energy and then then you get tired and you go to sleep I guess what you don't sleep\nNow I'm I'm telling you like common scenario due to a lack of calcium and magnesium in your system when you have the comics and the first thing that happened you take a twenty minutes before you go to bed ... a good night's sleep and wake up feeling refreshed your energy comes back\nIt's comics safe I mean you're telling us how powerful ... and I'm just wondering if you can ever take too much or if it's safe to take if you're already on a ... any supplements or medications\n... never ever been shown to interact poorly with any medication\nOkay it's a hundred percent natural it's safe and you know our our formula doesn't contain sugar which isn't a lot of calcium products wheat soy gluten lactose or anything that people are trying to avoid illness doesn't have any of that but you see the point is is that if you're a person has a diabetic you're on high blood pressure you had bypass surgery guess what\nYou are deficient you are deficient in the calcium and magnesium\nDr ... unfortunately we're about out of time or any any parting thoughts I mean who\nCan really benefit from this\nGuy because if you're

what you're going to get in the midterms is they're probably going to take back the house the Democrats not saying it's going to be for certain 'cause I think this caravan and I think Kavanaugh's

serve every single day of a six year term in the United States Senate and I won't leave the city\n[noise]\nAh you know what's funny is from what I've heard from some of my uh democratic\nPeople they're kind of hoping he loses and the reason is because they see him as a person who can be more of a threat to\nTrump than in the Senate\nThing about that for a second he may not win his race in taxes against lying dead will touch on that in a second but better do maybe more of a force on a national\nScale and sometimes that happens right sometimes\nYou know if you're if you're somebody says is that conservative and you're in California the chance of winning some of these things are slim to none you have a broader appeal nationwide\nThen\nYou do in a place like California same thing for Beto cruise you probably has a broader appeal his politics elsewhere would get him some Republicans plenty of independence and tons of Democrats but in taxes you don't have a lot of that you have a lot of Republicans and even though they're kind of pissed at time\nAt ten it's still\nA red state now as they talk to him last night at this town hall ... uh they asked him the question that many people are are are are are talking about as far as they take back the house in peach men and\nUse that into line that you would as a member of the house right now vote to impeach have you changed your mind\nOr habits um let let me let me put it this way\nI'm there may be an open question as to whether the president than the candidate sought seclude with the Russian government in two thousand and six teams when we saw him on that stage in Helsinki\nDefending wedding or putting the head of the country that attacked our democracy in twenty sixteen instead of this country and its citizens and it's amazing democracy was collusion inaction\n[noise] uh [noise] like I said earlier a political is reporting that you're going to be disappointed\nWhy why why why why why\nYou're going to be disappointed the Democrats here here's my question to people out there who independent are Democrats who think that Trump did something do you trust Bob\nMueller and his report if he comes out and said look there's no they're they're so what are you going to do right what are you going to do so they're ... they're going to grab it everything they're going to\nGrab it everything they don't like him so you got to get everything it's ... it's it's it's it's if it's not this remember how many times the goalposts moved in this investigation started out as Russia and we've since moved the goalpost on numerous occasions\nYou may have wondered when he fired James Comey the principal investigator in what happens in that election whether that was an attempt to obstruct justice but win by broad daylight on Twitter he asked his attorney general Jeff Sessions to end the Russia investigation always say that's obstruction inaction\nIs it is it obstruction so Dana Bash actually does what good reporters do she she pushes she ask questions\nThe best course to get there so that every member has all the facts and that there are compelling enough to do the right thing is to allow the full independence and integrity or Bob Mueller in Libya already said\nEven though that's not done that he would do to impeach him so according to the constitution that means that the president has committed the crime of trees in primer bribery or a high crime and misdemeanor which one of those do you think the president has committed\nI wouldn't like in a impeachment to an indictment there there is enough there to proceed with the trial\nYeah and that's all it's about it's about in the end is slowing down impeaching him knowing full well that you're not going to get him thrown out of office\nAnd if there's no there there were you when did the country's you this is the other thing and this is something we've talked about before you go to potentially\nPut yourself in a situation where you look like such obstructionists and the whole thing is you don't care about the country you care about destroying Trump and taking out Trump that you put\nA situation where you you focus so much on it that it hurts the country maybe slows down the ...\nBoth of the country people start panicking we know how ... confidence and things can be can be wavering at times is waning and when we started to see things go and you're going to give Trump another opportunity to say look man when I had the house and the Senate\nWhat did I Do unemployment economy ... all of these things were going on they come along whom\nThey put a stop and everything talking about rolling back your taxes it's all they want to do talk about doing this that and the other and then what happens everything slows down everything when I was in charge was rolling they come in here\nBoom look what happens and you may give people the right to you know what he'd write everything was ruined it was going good it was because we live in a world where\nIn politics we need the other side to suck now so we feel like we can have a victory\nHe wants to impeach he did not have been waiting for the evidence yeah let's impeach\nFor two hundred and forty two years into this experiment\nWhich is the exception not the rule in world history nothing that guarantees us for wandering forty third or a two hundred and forty fourth to all of us to stand up for the democracy\nThe best way to do that and so expressing it on the twenty second of October the first day of early voting than the than election day on the ... of November but yes or to answer a question I Do think there's enough there\nFor impeachment and if af are I Would I Would vote on it\nThat sounds great go ahead do it I don't know what's gonna happen I couldn't tell you what's going to happen or if they win back\nI Know that there's gonna be tons of investigations that are going to try to get his taxes they're going to do a lot of different things and what you're going to find is and and\nThe way that our politics to set up is you know we're supposed to fight right we're supposed to look for is you know like I I talked about what Thomas old before the great thing that he said there's there's no solutions was only trade offs\nThat Truman solution is you know two plus two is for that ... there's a solution to that problem but the trade offs or it's the give and take we talk about right you're not going to get a hundred percent\nI'm not going to get a hundred percent\nBut the squeaky wheels demand a hundred percent of nothing they

that the reason there was a fist fight is because he was either\nA totally surprised and fighting for his life or be he was fighting for his life and totally surprised does the two answers\nRight those are the two answers\nSo now it's going to have the Trump he said there would be severe he said he would come hard if this was crap if he realized they were lying if that they're that they played some part in it and they can pretend\nAll day that\nYou know oh this did it didn't it started out like hey we were just we were just going to talk to the guy and then we've heard several stories and I had to read the reason why he's probably coming out saying this right this second\nHe's because the Turks are getting ready to release some stuff on pay us said that he heard some of the audio and that's not good so now this is\nGoing to be one of those situations where I Want to see what ah you know Trump ease is going to say about how he deals with because he said there would be\nSome serious a Muslim series things\nThere are other things we can do what I Would certainly make that recommendation to Congress but I Will very much listen to what Congress has to say\nAnd he's talking about the

say look we're going to be if I find that they're involved were going to be coming after him and the other things that we're hearing is that they're already looking to replace\nA him the prince so I don't know I don't know that\nAt its potential but this this can't be\nSomething that we don't like it's very serious stuff and we're going to get to the bottom of it\nAnd I think the Turks are going to come out with something and I think the big fear as you better get out in front of it both for\n\nAnybody else does or or else it's going to look we're so at at the past say we did it we've already fired some people were getting rid of some people and ... and it's one of those things to where it's like how do you keep a secret\nRight there are three people in the room there's a secret how do you
