welcome back to Mars Lawrence on the show it's a pleasure to be with you on a Wednesday evening glad to\nGet your phone calls and emails a couple of little updates on some stories would have been following tonight number one\nAnd now Florence South Carolina we know that there was a shooting it involved law enforcement officers there were five officers who were shot three deputy sheriff in two police officers one law enforcement officer has been confirmed killed tonight\nThe other four were wounded or injured in some way and we're checking to make sure ah what their condition is as we get new updates on that second\nA member of Sheila Jackson Lee staff she's a member of Congress remember the sign that she um\nShe she apparently had a staff member arrested because that staff member apparently docks some other members\nOf the Republican Congress\nAnd uh that information some of it coming off government computers was apparently illegally provided to the um you know to to the Internet and to other places and as a result of member of her staff has been placed in custody we'll get your details on that as they become available\nAs you know I probably well I certainly have a dog in the fight here because I I carry a concealed pistol every single day have for twenty five years\nAnd I've never had to pull it out but that's part of the beauty of concealed carry stage where\nYou can have a concealed carry permit every state in America actually allows them but some of the states are incredibly difficult when it comes to getting one New York and California and Washington DC our three locations where it's very difficult but every state in America offers concealed carry and the district of Columbia\nSo the question is when we see violent crime dropping across America and doing so over most of the last Thirty years is that at least in part a result of the rising concealed carry permits Tim Schmidt joins me now who's the founder and president of the U. S. concealed carry association Tim it's good to have you back\nWith any Lars at unusual it's great to be on your show I appreciate it\nAlways glad to have you here so I I've been met had my dog in the fight I mean I'm very pro concealed carry\nAnd I don't want anybody to be or have any you know Mr ... about that but um is there a case to be made statistically that the reason that violent crime in America is dropping\nIs that we've seen a dramatic rise even during President Trump's tenure and certainly during President Obama's tenure and the number of Americans who own firearms and have concealed carry permit\nIt you know I think there is a very good case for that and this latest as the average or showing violet ... with the fact that there's still carry permits\nAnd they didn't ... Eighteen million ... says the typical ... going to tell you that oh my goodness with all these new guns on the street as they like to say you know ... a skyrocket but just the opposite is happening and\nThat's and that's what my organization is all about well about ... to to get more\nWell educated well trained people with handguns who ultimately do the good stuff and and and that's what it's all about so yes there is a direct correlation\nThat the more good guys with guys the less bad guys lots of combat cry\nYeah in fact I'm trying to remember you probably remember these times better than I Do but today there are what about three hundred and fifty million or is it a higher number of firearms in private possession in the United states has had four hundred million yet\n... right now there's close to four hundred million ... he goes to the states and that's why I say that that I keep trying to tell people you know you can pass\nAs many antique laws as you watch\nAnd you know guns are going away so the solution is a scientist stick your head of the sad\n... and said that you know by passing laws all of a sudden the guys are going to ask but rather let's let's get more with us says the street because the only thing they criminals listened to the only language that they understand it's a good guy with a guy\nThat's right and and I was going to say that if you go back I think it's to maybe Nineteen eighty was the number of guns in private possession closer to two hundred million in about Nineteen eighty\nSo we come home come forward or not quite forty years and we have doubled the number of guns in private possession in America which by the anti gunners logic\nIf you double the number of guns you're gonna see twice as much violent crime or or maybe more so and instead we've seen a drop over the last thirty or forty years in violent crime in this country so the evidence the evidence of the number is is that more guns in in the hands of law abiding citizens means dramatically less crime [noise]\nYou're exactly right liars and and and the same sort of is that almost any statistics that you look at for example in New York Times\nThey're only port they talked about two thousand Seventeen there were eleven thousand people murdered by by criminals with guards in that same year at the FBI came out now granted these are very conservative FBI numbers they said it at a hundred and twelve thousand\nA non police individuals defended their lives with cars now if you look at research by Dr Gary collectors they're significantly even more but even those ultra conservative numbers ten times ten times more good things have a with guns than bats ...\nAnd and and I guess this this is just that if we could get even more guns if we made government policies more friendly toward people having concealed carry I mean Tim you know I make a nice living you make a nice living if I I bought a new walther pistol last week\nUh I have a number of pistols but what I Wonder about is the ability of the average person out there who lives in a place like California where they make\nVery expensive to be able to get a permit even Nevada and makes it a little bit ridiculous because you have to take classes and you have to do this and you have to do that by the time you're all done an average person might have to drop a thousand dollars all totaled to be able to have\nThe permit have the gun practice and and be properly equipped to do that well for an awful lot of wage earners a thousand dollars of discretionary income is is a big chunk of the family's budget over even a couple of years even though it is is great security but if you can afford it\nAllows I couldn't agree more I mean the fact that if if you have to spend that much weight to exercise a natural cause I\nI eat the permits and all that stuff that's that's just wrong especially in the United states of America we're in our country is is based on the concept is of a personal freedoms and so then the other point the ironic thing is that the city and the states that have the highest levels of crime or the areas where it's\nThe talk this just for the the law abiding citizens to get the guys and and that's I mean to me that's a travesty\nWell and I know that because I have a nice income actually kind of live in a Heinz fifty seven neighborhood they're nice houses that are not so nice as their houses\nAnd ... nicer than my house and their houses that are not as nice and I think these are people who work hard for you know to make their living and uh and they should have the same kind of protection I Do even though if you live in a nice neighborhood\nYou're ... you're a lot less likely to fall victim to crime the ugly truth is that most criminals are poor and most criminals prey on the poor people around them in poor neighborhoods and you know the the stance bear that out so if you say you know if we could make it easier and say\nThat the government says we'll waive the fee for getting a concealed carry permit if you have\nAn income below such and such not give them any money but just say if you want to get the permit man you're below a certain income you know we we give out free cheese we give out food stamp all these other things how 'bout waving the fee for concealed carry permits for people below say below the average\nAnd the baby is out of the mother's body and then you kill the baby is not abortion anymore it is murder at that point correct\nThat is correct and in fact\nYou know what's very interesting about this case this al ... case is that the jury you know needed an education and in fact the jury was elected and\nVery specifically not to be pro life not to be anti abortion so you had these people who were either neutral on abortion or in favor of abortion sitting there and they had to have the education that you're just basically happened just giving your listeners are which was let's look let's hear exactly\nHow illegal abortions adults so they had to you know good abortion doctors legal abortion doctors come in to describe what a great\nGood looks like when it's done properly\nAnd then they were able to make the distinction between what comic goggles at which was actually murder but I can tell you from speaking to the jury members and and people who witnessed the trial that they were more disturbed\nBy what what's legal in America than what\nFrom it got it illegally because the distinction to them seemed to me\nAnd for anyone who watches the movie ... ... people should go and get large numbers on the twelfth October it was one of the things that mattered enormously to us that's why the ... called the trial of America's big fee will kill a lot of it happens in the courtroom and the question was\nYou know to this first abortion doctor you know many abortions have you done in your career so that we just kind of know and the answer was foresee thousands\nForty thousand ... and I want to add some time now we're going to do the special primary you're going to be there I appreciate that but um I Want you to explain something else and that is what you started with and that is that largely Americans have never heard of this man unless they listen to this show or have read your book\nBecause it wasn't covered now this didn't happen\nIn east Timbuktu somewhere\nThis happen in a city

and here's this trial going on involving the greatest number of of murders\nBy a single person in this country's history and likely never to be equipped\nAnd yet there were rows set aside in the courtroom for reporters what was happening at least for a time\nYeah so they weren't they didn't they didn't turn up for a very long time that didn't turn up and when they did turn that didn't stay long and you know this story got very very anti coverage by the very media outlets that claimed to be\nYou know impartial and you know ... whatever for ... you know what the New York times you know anything to print kind of think well actually see this apparently\nWasn't fit to be printed this story apparently wasn't didn't make you know wasn't going to be something that would be nice the news
