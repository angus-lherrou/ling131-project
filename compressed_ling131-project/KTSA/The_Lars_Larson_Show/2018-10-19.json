show spouting off it was kind of lean welcome to the program\nWell thank you ... it's great to be with you\nI Will tell you personally the one I watched the hearings for judge Kavanaugh that one of the things that occurred to me a a well one thing was returned to think of ourselves first is I'm safe\nMode I released I think I'm safe because I live but you know a boring [laughter] boring life and and because I Am happily married and true to my wife and we have a deal a in no cheating of any kind ever that would be fatal to the relationship and so we both respect that\nAnd when I travel I never I Am alone with I I follow the my control you know you you don't go out and spend time along with some other woman because even the appearance of impropriety would be too much but I worried out loud on this program about what had happened to judge Kavanaugh because\nI pointed out that if it took just a family evidenced accusation with all kinds of reasons not to believe it\nAnd very few reasons to believe the story including the fact that all the supposedly witnesses to it except for one couldn't even remember that it happened including a ... a professor forwards or best friend\nBut I'm Wondering\nTo what extent of the liberals weaponized and to me too movement as a way that they're going to attack candidates not just in the mid term elections but probably in the twenty twenty election as well\nLars I've been watching this now for you know it's a little over a year\nSince the Harvey Weinstein story started and not long after that the me too movement and somewhere around\nA spring I began to see something very strange and unusual happen when these things are all happening in test tubes all around the country a lot of people don't collect the dots but now a year later\nA here's my theory that\nUh Brett Kavanaugh was merely the latest casualty in a long line of people of men who have been targeted by the Democrat Party and case in point ballot Pete area has reported\nThey never had a report on sexual misconduct ever and now we know that thirty two men either resigned were expelled or did not seek reelection I'm\nState governments all around the country that also includes two suicides and all\nOn accusations of sexual misconduct\nNow there hasn't been a whole lot of investigation about this so uh you know people sometimes as I say don't collect the connect the dots but they have been weaponized saying this for a long time they've gone after Democrats and Republicans but they seem to go after Democrats who are telling them\nThe party line surprisingly yeah those are the ones who vote against sweeping gun bills like the one in Colorado a show something very sinister has been going on pretty much for the last year\nBut you would think that after a year of sort of cleaning house whether you're swept up some good people along with bad people and you had some false accusations that remove people you'd think they'd start running out of targets wouldn't think\nNo they never run out of targets because when they do they just manufacture evidence uh there's a case this case I mentioned Hugh in Colorado yeah there were two very suspicious cases one in Colorado one in Arizona\nState led socked in Colorado Don shooter in Arizona they didn't bank on these people fighting back what they wanted to do was forced them out scare the heck out of them and asked him to resign\nThey were targeted and and I'll tell you in the Colorado case they had a um a day in which Democrats and Republicans all got up to say why they were voting the way they were he was expelled by the way after a hundred and three years\nNever had been an expulsion in the Colorado State house of representatives that day\nEmma crap got up and said because my wife was molested when she was Seventeen I'm going to vote yes on ...\n... now this is he law makers who are\nPutting forth arguments it would be thrown out of court in a nanosecond so I that's what I became suspicious and I started doing a little research on this and I was I was truly appalled at what I found they had flown out due process a long time ago\nWell in fact a lot of it got thrown out in all the title nine nonsense the letter of guidance that went to the colleges where they said if you can't get a legitimate set of charges against say student athletes who are thought to have committed some sexual assault\nThen put it into effectively a kangaroo court\nAh and in in those cases it's interesting that some of those targets were I mean I think almost people too young to to to categorize politically one way or another almost be a political college student athlete who may be officially a Democrat or officially Republican but\nYou know they're not that involved in politics but they would run people through the ringer\nAnd with no evidence no nothing they would they would end up being kicked out of school the worst thing you could do to them at that point in their life because they haven't built a career like\nLike a judge Kavanaugh had are now justice Kavanaugh had so I just wanted to God for that and thank God for that but you wonder how much are they going to go and eat almost instantaneous reaction well if he's accused he must be guilty and let's move on to the next one\nThat's a dangerous standard to adopt in a due process country like America\n... without a doubt and among many concerns about this is the notion that you can uh build some kind of um [noise]\nAnd I'm In and fill trader so I come in and I'm starting to\nPeel white people follow you on Twitter ... and thank you I Love following you and thank you it's\nOne of the more active Twitter accounts and yes it is and it's a growing following an Instagram social media Twitter Facebook you name it where people of all ages but predominantly younger under the age of twenty five they see\nWhat I'm doing and they say Charlie has the courage of his convictions go to Portland State and talk for hours mhm against breakfast physical violence people actually throwing my head off all sorts of crazy things maybe I have the courage of convictions to stand up and my lecture hall or in a fine fellow conservatives that agree with me\nAnd again I'm not talking about issues that I consider to be that controversial mhm\nTalking about American exceptionalism free market capitalism the constitution yet I get painted in this radicalized by the campus left because they don't believe in\nWell it is funny that the exceptionalism for this country is is so smeared out by the left because if you say well is there another place that has as much liberty as American citizens actually show it to me even Great Britain\nYou know and when a challenge they don't have an answer no we are the most benevolent\nThe most creative productive generous generous ... but not to mention accepting we're the least racist multi racial society in the world yeah take a look at Japan's in in migration do now they're they're ... percent homogenous yeah and that's that shouldn't be applauded\nBut we have a very very multi racial society that I think it's discounted by the campus left by how much we made this work and yet we get miss miss represented in and kind of construed by\nThe activists that were racist country not at all we take and half the world's immigrants every single year mhm there's something exceptional in the fabric of this country because we have really good ideas guiding us natural rights limited government individual liberty entrepreneurship that you can have intergenerational ascension these are very good ideas\nBad ideas such as the ones that the Marxist in the left teach our students victimhood ideology feelings over facts your experience matters more than evidence\nThat's how you start to have the construction of western civilization which unfortunately I think Portland leading the way well like ... and I don't I've known him for a long time and she makes that point I think\nNeeds to be emphasized he came from a culture we said if I'd stayed there and the caste system I Would have stayed right at that level and yet here you see the the guy or gal who comes out of high school and ... ... my dad's a plumber\nSo you open up plumbing supply company and then someday you sell it to Amazon and you're a wealthy person only in America goes up Russia yeah it doesn't typically happen even in places like Great Britain no and\nAnd so ... a lot of people say America is all about six or so which is true\nBut makes America different were the most forgiving of failure in the world\nOnly in America is the creed if you don't succeed try try try again that's uniquely American concepts failure is so stigmatized across the European culture\nPeople are afraid to failure bankruptcy last for example which is kind of like a fun example even in Canada bankrupt your dog ... in America we are I think to the to the betterment of society not the detriment\nOr bankruptcy laws have actually been created in a way to give people a second third and fourth chance that you can restructure debt still be held accountable but you can have another opportunity afterwards some of the great entrepreneur is\nAt one time has run the verge of bankruptcy if not dove into bankruptcy and then they created a great companies that up how about this apple computer precise jak closed to bankruptcy and today what's their market cap a trillion dollars out of or or Bernie markers who started Home Depot who's fifty two years old when he started the company never declared bankruptcy but had a very difficult\nLife being an entrepreneur and then finally had this great idea which now employees hundreds of thousands of people and that is the number one place for people you know for home renovations on and so forth\nAnd so ... what I find on the left though what it boils down to is a very unhappy angry population\nIf you live in this country and you're angry that you love your that as a that is a perspective that I guarantee you were taught that\nYou eat the natural way to analyze your existence in America is one that comes from gratitude\nYou should be thankful you live in this country you can have disagreements like you and I have disagreements with Kate Brown ... discontent but anger the vitriolic anger that the Marxist have on campus has been instructed to them up by people who are unhappy them so I'm Talking about Charlie\nKirk who's founder and executive director of turning point us I highly recommend as Twitter and thanks so

hundred thousand tendency drivers that they get all get back on the road because\nThis judge says the state cannot suspend driver's licenses\nOver traffic tickets if the drivers can't afford to pay them now I think this is a cock I made the decision the rulings a win for advocates who say a law permitting the state to take away your driving privileges if you don't pay your fines discriminates against poor people\nLook if you can't afford the car payment you can't afford the car if you can't afford the car payment plus the insurance and the gasoline you can't afford the car and if you decided to go out and get traffic tickets which are avoidable\nStop at the stop signs obey the speed limits and you're likely to go through a lot of life without getting a ticket\nAnd if you say large does that apply to you well look I have kind of a lead foot\nI got a traffic ticket speeding for a few miles over in Nineteen eighty two I got another one in two thousand two so I figure about three or four years from now I'm probably due for another one and no I don't get laid off because I'm On the radio\nI get a lot off because I don't go out and go ten Fifteen twenty miles an hour over the limit don't be an idiot you won't get the tickets and if you're dumb enough to get the tickets and get so many that the state takes your license away\nWhen I don't even know in Tennessee how many tickets you have to get how many tickets in your state do you have to get before they say we don't even want you to have a driver's license anymore and if you get a ticket pay it and if you can't afford to pay it my advice is you can't afford if you can't do the crime and you can't pay for the crime you shouldn't be doing it at all let's go to\n...

like that that is what comedian say when they have nothing funny to say um it's like flashing assigned up the audience\nUm laugh now please laugh now\nOh that's that's that's comedy gold that's so comedic\nNo that's not a punch line that's you you you are running out of anything interesting to say I'm In any event and there was an entire segment on this it was an absolute lie a no correction um this isn't news this is this is a network that it's trying to create the sort of racial hatred that gets people killed\nI I got to tell you and my rule for mentioning race has always been if it's relevant to the story and yet I see race being pumped into various situations where it has no relevance to the story but as you say to amp up the excitement the media gets when they said well a white man a white police officer shot\nA black man well really is there any indication that the officer shot the black man because he was black or maybe because of the night for the gun in his hand and and and yet\nHe literally when they have such an elastic definition of white [laughter] um there was George Zimmerman\nWas about eighty percent Hispanic\nNew if it's a cop they just ... and they just assume like but here that's it that's when they were talking yes they are constantly injecting race into things and they were accusing Donald Trump of only worrying about white men white man and then bring in you know professor Marc Lamont hill\nThe comment on this and oh well it's another example of white supremacy in our country I mean it went on and on this whole segment like I say it was premeditated none of the rest of the segment made sense if the quote had been accurate\nThat Trump had said it's a scary time for\nYoung men um only if you lie and insert old white men in there and do you bring on um you know a professor of urban studies and and host of the BEP network to talk about white supremacy I'm halfway through the segment and like a rare a switch true why from\nSomething we made up in the back room here at CNN to\nAn actual Trump's strategy\nSkating will this Trump strategy work uh it's really absolutely outrageous and and my notes or leaders\nAnd I wish anyone listening wouldn't go find it and print it out\nUm put it in put it in your wallet for the next time people say oh there's no such thing as fake news I'm neither the guardians of the first amendment yes every once in a while there is a typo no this was a deliberate vicious\nRacists lie about the president not only was it not corrected I'm In that segments if there's been a mistake I think it would have been corrected before before the first commercial break\n'em and you know come up with something different to talk about as far as I Know there's never been corrected on CNN Anna ... after 'em or I guess I don't know about the same time I called was running other people may have noticed this she send out as they tweet\nI'm saying I made an error I'm Sorry about that something to that effect absolutely no mention of uh what was\nIt goes to her pathetic list of ... of of of Twitter followers and as as small as CNN's ratings are I Believe more people saw her segment with why then you know went to Antarctica ... Twitter feed to\nSee it as a vague I made an error how about a segment and correcting the entire segment\nWell and what's crazy as they could have done some legitimate journalism and said it is a scary time to be a man now and I'll tell you this is one of the things I kept emphasizing is if somebody can come out with a Finley evidence accusation that that\nHas nothing behind it no witnesses no nothing in the Persian bringing me\nYou know charge can't even remember all the details where ... who how can that can destroy a man or and as I pointed out in these ... times\nA man or a woman's uh you know uh uh uh their entire career they're good name their family wipe them out financially and say oh I'm Sorry it was a ... it was a false accusation or we think\nIt was ... but by this time you've already destroyed the person you use a scary time when that could that one little accusation can end up destroying a person and wait until the first time\nYou know that a woman says well you know this this professional woman came on to me and they destroyed a doctor or a lawyer or a politician or\nYou know the one time you can be sure you're going to see it again is one Trump gets another Supreme Court nominee which is why I Am and systems that he make it a man\nI'm everyone thinks oh don't worry they won't be able to do anything with a woman yeah because you know they love their tail and they they love me you know this has come up with something new now that we know what their play book is they're not going to be able to pull the false allegation of a highschool groping on the next one it would be too embarrassing\nSo they'll have to do something slightly different and frankly you know you reminded me of you remember back when the ridicule was heaped on on Gerald Ford because Chevy Chase portrayed him as being incredibly clumsy and we knew if you look through the man's history he was an athlete he\nWas the ball player at University of Michigan\nAnd as a standout uses stand a football player who did very very well but if you have a comedian pretend that the president is a clumsy guy than people today will say well you know what I remember I'm clumsy George Bush George Gerald Ford was\nHow are you first off I'm great how are you\nNot too bad not too bad [noise] uh and what do you have a very very large check we do that you were holding up we'd you oh my God this is such a great event\nThis before we announce how much you're I mean what is this a mentor you over the years\nThis is about helping them right and this is what San Antonio is so good at I mean this is the hardest in Tokyo and we're just so honored to be a part of it and we really want to thank you and everyone at K.
