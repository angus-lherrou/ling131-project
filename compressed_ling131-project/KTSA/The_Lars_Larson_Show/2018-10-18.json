head of the law Lars Larson show back Lars Larson joke line is that your phone calls and your emails you know that there is a record amount of revenue pouring into\nThe United states government's treasury are still on enough to match the spending by the United states government and that is still a disappointment to a lot of us conservatives\nWe have to get out of a deficit position where we spend more every year then we take and I say we meaning the federal government in my family under spends its income and that should be a desirable place to be and most companies under spend their revenue and if they don't they ended up out of business they go their way of seniors\nAre Jason ... joins me now who's VP of legislative affairs at freedomworks Jason welcome to the program\nThanks for having me Lars I'm printing works are saying that it is absolutely imperative that we started cutting spending and immediately I I tend to agree with you but I usually votes listeners puts that to me I say that's great where do you want to start two thirds of the money is going to so called entitlement programs\nWho's grandma would you like to tell a she doesn't get her full Social Security check\nYeah I mean look you're one hundred percent right I mean two thirds a roughly ... roughly two thirds is is mandatory spending which includes entitlement programs and other ten percent is interest on the national debt so that means Seventy five percent of the federal budget federal spending\nIs going is is not going to things like defense is not going to discretionary domestic programs it's it's going to pay major health care retirement a spending or interest on the debt\nOr you you cannot ... and we actually have the upcoming publication freedomworks on on mandatory spending and the problems of mandatory spending and you have to address that elephant in the room otherwise you're effectively not doing anything so like the president proposed today at five percent across the board spending cuts\nOr it only applies to discretionary spending it doesn't apply to those major programs and you can reform those programs in a way that that doesn't a push granny over the ledgers Democrats accused back in two thousand ten and two thousand and twelve you can guarantee the promises made to to\nPeople who are currently receiving those benefits\nAs well as change those programs are people going forward you knew that your premium support and in ... allowing people like myself who are never going to see their Social Security paychecks as the program currently exists to invest our own money to invest portion of our FICA taxes into a private retirement account those are ways of ...\nA password that could be taken unfortunately some Republicans as well as all Democrats opposed those changes but\nAt the end of the day you could repeat you could eliminate all\nNon defense discretionary spending that's one point two trillion dollars of a four point\nOne point four point two trillion dollar budget and still run a budget deficit of three hundred billion dollars so\nSo what about this ... let me throw the idea that it's been thrown at me by smarter folks and me and that is the the penny plan\nWhere you essentially as a first of all the federal government which is at its agencies have become used to uh raise every year or a an increase in their spending if you if you want to call it that\nAnd you said not only are you not getting a raise or next year you get Ninety nine cents on the dollar for your budget find the places that are the most effective places the cod maintain your core mission whatever that is\nAnd uh and the other thing I Do is I'd take a bunch of federal agencies\nAnd and tell me do you think I'm wrong here I'd take the department of education which I think is it's Seventy or eighty billion a year to over ten years with increases we're looking at a trillion dollars\nGoing to the department of education I think they are about as useful as a screen door on a submarine and and I would simply say we're in a wind that whole thing down just as fast as possible and if we decided we want to give some money for particular educational project for programs or whatever give it directly\nYou know out of the Congress have them write a bill and say this is why it makes sense to spend five million bucks in the school district or fifty million in that one on on these specific programs would make them justify other than that take the whole deal we not department of Energy Department of education and simply do away with it there's a trillion dollars right there isn't it\nYeah well ours is the ... you and I were the same room right now I'd give you a big hug gum [laughter] but but the city I was like let's go back to the penny plan for a second that's the one percent spending reduction act\nWas introduced in this Congress by congressman Mark Sanford who unfortunately lost his primary that won't be returning to Congress but he has pushed that you've got one percent across the board of one percent of not interest spending so it doesn't apply to interest on the national debt but it applies to everything else you do that for five years the balance\nThe budget and then that bill would cap\nSpending at Eighteen percent of gross domestic product basically Eighteen percent of all economic output in the United states uh for\nFor the foreseeable future that's what that bill would do that would solve a lot of our problems in terms of the looming entitlement and not sovereign debt crisis that we face here in the United states is the problem here is we're looking at European welfare style of of rates of federal spending\nWithin a short time we are talking the next Twenty years that's what we're going to be spending and we cannot produce you cannot have\nStrong economic growth you cannot create incentives to work in safe with that level of spending it's going to crowd out private investment 'cause people\nWill be investing into government T bonds rather than investing in their business or the economy right those are the problem is we're seat as those problems we face and you're not going to be able to produce the amount of revenue unique because people simply are going to be different set of eyes to work with the with the level of taxation well going to be needed to to lower deaths\nJason another idea just a wild idea right now we have seven point one million unfilled jobs in America and I would\nIf I were king but we're not a kingdom but if I were King I would say All right we're going to immediately said to every single state we're no longer paying for any social welfare benefits for this class of people everybody who is above the age of Nineteen let's say and below the age of fifty five so working age\nAble bodied son to mind a and we'll start with the kids who have no ... ... the people who have no kids at home but we're soon going to get to the people who do have kids at home and say\nYou have to go get a job there seven million jobs go get one of them but we are like polar page did a main saying we're not paying ... we're not paying for food\nStamps for example he cut the food stamp rules by Seventy five percent in that group of people immediately when he said you have to work or you don't get food stamps and a lot of people just simply quit now that would have to say the least tens of billions\nWouldn't it if we did that to you know Medicaid food stamps tenets and all the rest of that razzmatazz oh abs\nAbsolutely yeah no it isn't and look the house to to their credit I mean I'm not the biggest fan of House Republican leadership but occasionally they do something right and they tried to do that in the farm bill this year was bad work warrants to uh to food stamps or if it and the granted the savings were we invested into work training programs which kind of\nA it didn't defeat the purpose of just defeated the it just took the savings out of the bill but it would've said billions of dollars\nA unfortunately the Senate decided not to pursue that in fact the Senate voted out of an amendment offered by senators that thank God like Ted Cruz that would have put welfare or or what what part of it's on a snap benefits or food stamp benefits or the Senate's been has been and will continue to be the source of most of our problems are\nAnd moving a more fiscally conservative agenda because there are too few fiscal conservatives and the Senate\nEven if we get a few more senators in November\nOh let me look that certainly numbers will improve their there are some ... there's some interesting prospects this year in terms of Senate races and I hope to see uh some of those can be for Russian but\nOne of the crew who's taking care of cleaning up rooms and the guests are done and you become the crew boss if you're capable of managing other people\nThat's something you don't have to go to college for in fact I think some of the best people at being able to manage other people may not have a college degree I'll bet some of you have worked for bosses who didn't have a college degree some of them may not have even finished high school and yet they're really good\nAt understanding how to manage people and if you say well that's not the direction I Want to go than tell the boss hey boss\nCould I moved from taking care of rooms because I've done a really good a job I'm going to show you how good a job I can do at cleaning up rooms and then I'd like you to reward me make me the overnight desk clerk\nNow that can't be a very popular job working from ten o'clock at night 'til six o'clock in the morning and sleeping during the day but you know where that one leads\nNighttime desk clerk and then you say to the boss hey I'd like to learn how to do the books do you have a bookkeeper now when he or she goes on to another job I'd like to get that job is you're late night bookkeeper the person who's putting together\nAll the books and making sure all the numbers add up and counting all the receipts and those sorts of things I'd like to learn how to do that now if you do that and you do it really really well you'd think it might be a natural progression to go from there to being the manager of the motel\nI looked at jobs in fact occasionally Tina will call me when I'm On my way home and she'll say I've been really working hard today didn't have time to make dinner\nAnd so occasionally I stop at different places and grab some dinner to go and I take it home one of the places I like to stop and I don't have any dog and a five year I don't do commercials former get paid by my just occasionally by food there so it's a fast food or Asian place called panda or panda express\nI've gone in there and do you know right there posted in the window\nTheir crew the people who are making those meals and making that food they start at about eleven fifty an hour now that's twenty three thousand dollars a year if you and your sweetheart each had a job just doing that\nWhich is a job you can learn on the job you'll have a household income of about forty six thousand dollars without pulling any overtime at all you're almost at the middle of America at that point the middle of America is about fifty eight thousand dollars do you know what the next step up from that is\nIt's being one of the crew bosses\nAnd then you move up into the sixteen or Eighteen bucks an hour they also posed the job for manager of that store because somebody has to run that entire store and obviously to step up from that would be regional manager but if you just manages store you know what they promised people forty five thousand dollars a year in salary plus benefits\nNow if you and your sweetheart each had one of those if you work your way up over four or five years to be the manager of a single handed a store and I'm sure the same is true of some other kinds of manager positions your household income would be Ninety thousand dollars a year\nNow I understand somebody like Nancy Pelosi is going to say well I didn't get to get your house in San Francisco\nAlthough I Can't do a good Nancy Pelosi so I don't know how to fix that but\nIf you could make Ninety thousand dollars a year in most of America not in San Francisco not in New York City and not Washington D.

their um all\nOver the birther or ... well yeah we still haven't said really\nTarget for years on the ... ate it yet oh boy you last that was a full\nJoyce ... do you know that some of us still have serious questions about President Obama's um background\nWe still don't know much about what he took her how he got into his undergrad his graduate school or into Harvard there are many people who went to Harvard the same time he did including friends of mine when Elon routes one of them who says I was there on campus I never saw the guy so and we don't know anything about and we knew when Gore ran against Bush\nOr for the presidency we knew what Gore's grades were and we knew what he took we knew what Bush is great joy who knew Bush got a better grade in science and Al Gore did\nWe didn't we don't know anything about him he was the editor of the Harvard law review but he never wrote in the articles for the Harvard law review so there are lots of questions about President Obama's background but you're right that's passed you know who brought this back up this week Elizabeth Warren did she decided\nThat that the second plane go into they go ahead I also listen to the show and this is a great go like well it was the and Sebastian Gorka and ... and they said well they were talking about the compassionate\nThat Donald Trump which I don't see it all day and then they were talking also about his um what they have stayed in the fact that I like it must be a doctor for it on at on his feet and\nThey will say that\nDonald Trump himself credit clarified that have enough money in it that\nHe um did it\nOn that that happened I wouldn't have made it if it had not been for you know what he was sane at the rally about publicity if our president actually he nearly eight and a woman who said that the one that name thing she re limburg was laughing and\nIt's been a tractor and Sebastian\nAnd laugh at it caused the rally at a young people who might be what about like Dr Ford said that he could get have enough ... and I say I don't know that that they enjoy me\nJoy take a break and just let me ask you a couple of questions do you agree that the accusation that Dr Ford made was very thinly evidence she couldn't remember most of the details that would be\nThe details necessary to prove something happened and when she named witnesses none of the witnesses including her best friend could remember that it ever even happened in ... for best friends so she never even met Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd yet the doctor for a professor Ford\nOr said that her best friend was there when this awful thing was supposed to happen\nThe reason there is so much anger at a Christian a blazing four to ... Ford is that she made a career and frankly person destroying accusation and did it with nothing that she did it with nothing to back it up\nMake pickup trucks very rare which means they're going to be very expensive\nAnd most of you will be forced to buy a smaller car and when you explain that to say well how can they force me to buy a smaller car is that when you walk on the line and the pickup truck is Seventy or eighty thousand dollars but you can buy a you know a phone booth on wheels\nA for a lot less and it gets Seventy miles to the gallon and your family is at greater risk of dying right\nWell that's exactly right and they put the ... or wanted to do was forced carmakers to sell more electric vehicles or the very least more economy cars it was a automakers to get away from SEVs even though that's how that's how auto makers\nMake all their money with SUVs is how they afford do electric cars and even economy car if because they they make so much money selling SUVs\nAnd of course is the Obama administration and the greens\nThey don't want us in cars to start with a show but forcing it to the electric car is a good\nFirst step and getting us out of your car um you know I mean the whole the whole process is the purpose of the process is to get us out of our cars\nCalifornia's well all that way or all if you live in a blue state I live in Maryland a it's like that they really don't like cars they specially like SUVs or they want to say this ... that's what the Obama administration tried to\n... put the brakes on that or you know the average age for car on the road right now is about twelve years\nJumping ... by holding it by putting a break on the Obama a fuel economy standards is going to hold down the price of cars to get more people in New we're safer cars quicker\nSo if he does these things and and make these changes can we avoid being pushed into cars that are substantially more likely to kill people\n[laughter] well I ... this is really a new for consumer choice\nOr we're gonna you know we're not going to force automakers to\nSell more easy as small cars automakers and able to sell what consumers wanted by which as we all know is SEVs and he looked just look around the rose everyone wants to cross over or as she is with the American lifestyles what it's what you were talking about earlier\nUm so we're going to make that possible versus what Obama wanted to do which was forced everybody a ... small cars or electric vehicles well which I joke\nI Know they're going to still ... and here's the thing if somebody chooses to drive the smaller cars Steve that's fine that's their choice we all make qualitative quantitative choices of their lives\nAnd if somebody wants to drive a smaller car and they car companies who make the smart car and the ... coup and all the rest of those ah make them you know a few more fuel efficient by making them way less those folks just have to understand that as I understand the numbers from MIT so\nEvery time you take a hundred pounds of weight off a car to get better fuel economy you're increasing by a five or ten percent the likelihood that you will die if there's a fatal if there's a a serious car wreck\nYeah well I think the biggest is standing out there is people here that are like car has a five star crash a test race as a smart car might have a very high crash rating course\nThat's only when you crash against another smart car but if you know if you're smart car hits a SUV or truck or a telephone pole you know all those numbers go out with it they don't need anything so you know part of the is if it's a very misleading system the government has developed\nNo I'm just glad to see and make the changes I think if we just freeze some of these rags we're going to get cleaner air safer cars less expensive cars which means maybe we can work that average down from twelve years to something substantially less and and and if we do that I mean imagine if I'm not just trying to say I want people to buy cheaper cars but I understand\nThat everybody if they had their druthers an unlimited bank account that most people would say I'd love to drive a new car I kind of envy some of the ranchers I've heard about the prosperous ones who drive into the dealership once a year and say here's the old pickup truck and they get a brand new one\nAnd then they drive that one for a year and then take the old one and you say well that's incredibly wasteful he said yeah\nBut it's really good for the guy who buys the one year old pickup truck it's already had I don't know eight or ten thousand dollars locks knocked off of it if if the rich ranger can afford to do that the poorer rancher can get a one year old lightly used pickup truck and then drive right off the lot

who have massive\nPension funds that have to earn money until the people who are going to get the pensions get paid and that when if they were to back out of oil stocks I assume they'd put the money into some other kind of dogs and the oil stocks would be sold to willing buyers would happily buy them so it won't make any difference to the oil companies\nCredit products are made by went back rate

N. Steve ... maybe a misunderstanding situation that there are people who dropped out of the workforce and no way oh nine ten as the economy kind of imploded and then plotted a plotted out of the whole and I know that some of the people out there\nSimply lack both job skills specific job skills but also the simple job skill of can you show up on time and the attorney in eight hours and can you stay off the methamphetamine heroin or whatever it is that you're doing but if you have those jobs I assume that if if\nSome of those jobs are lower jobs they're not highly skilled jobs\nCan we can we give a Butte and uh but I still don't understand why the administration of the Congress hasn't said let's start putting some really tight to clamp down on social welfare especially and again start with a group you and I've always talked about working age\nAble bodied sounded mind no kids at home\nAnd and start with that group and then you can work into the kids at home group and ... and impress upon them the idea that they're really good job you want to have usually for all of us has come after four or five of the lesser jobs that we weren't all that excited about but we understood how you get\nTo the better job and and but give them a boost by saying if you're able to work\nAnd uh and you have no excuse for not working there seven million jobs out there go out and get one of them the sooner you do the sooner you'll start moving up the train and do a better job\nBut I couldn't say better I mean that you're exactly right allows you and I think exactly like you know which way you know I'm very much in favor of work for welfare a program that's very strictly enforced you know that a lot of people say oh that's so hard heritage that so harsh no it isn't the best thing you can do for somebody who's not give them a welfare check that will give him a paycheck\nWell paycheck is better than a welfare check\nBecause there was a paycheck is you just set so well you learn stuff on the job you learn skills you learn that she's got one out of show up or work on that now this is your everything you said is true also need to get young people in the workforce you know the age at which ... young people are starting to enter the workforce is getting older and older that's a problem you know\nWhat I used to be at the wall Street Journal and I asked very successful people that she does have companies pay for stars and whether it's music or entertainment or sports or whatever line of ... life it was\nYou said where did you grow up and they should I go up on the phone I said when did you start working they said eight or nine years old [laughter] how you work on a farm you know very early in life and that that we need to get young people look let me give you another example we've got something like twenty million people in college today right like they'd be working while they're in school\nThey wind Twenty one twenty two year I or join I financially\nWe wouldn't have a well you know that that student debt crisis if these kids work while they were in school to pay for their education that was that show unreasonable\nNo and in specially Steve I remember it not only I worked all the way through the year and a half or in school but I did and then I took part time class after that but\nI knew people who in the summertime said they'd go and do the hard dirty jobs in the summertime and they'd rack up three or four thousand dollars in the summertime because they live at home with mom and dad works some dirty job make a bunch of money put it in the bank\nAnd they'd have half the half their tuition paid by the time they got back to school and they didn't have to borrow it\nAnd by the way of ours those kinda people 'cause I remember when I was in college my junior year I live with four guys in the house\nTo model and financial aid and the other two were working which to do you think got a better uh you know get more out of their education you know it was Steve I had to walk it actually or after that so they actually knew that valued education if you get something way that people are free they're not going to value it right I mean still I think that would\nBe an area we could get a lot more workers we need to get the skills for the workers but you know what the the employers will give these workers the skills\nThey will train them out of the job they will train them how to use a forklift or how to drive a truck or you know be a welder or you know all they shut down by the way in Texas now you know what I've tried which are earning twenty thousand dollars well\nLet me tell you I ran into a couple of guys who would come to a station about the listener event and I was younger guy and they just were friends and I said uh what do you do to the older guy and he said I run an electrical contracting business I said you know I tried to talk my step son into that\nI said I I Know they were both union and non union training programs where they would hire you\nAnd the rate two years ago was fourteen fifty an hour so it's like twenty nine thousand a year and every six months if you stayed in a program where you went to a class four hours a night for one night a week so it wasn't you know it wasn't asking\nHim to sixteen hours a day all week long that at the end the tuition for was eighty bucks a month and it was an officially state approved process where you at the end for years\nYou had eight thousand on the job training hours working at us and then and then you have six or seven hundred hours in a classroom\nAnd every if you stayed in the program you started a fourteen fifty every six months your paycheck went up by a buck fifty an hour\nThree thousand bucks a year out and by the time you've finished you were thirty five dollars an hour Seventy grand a year\nYou could salary while I said to this guy said so that's where your heart your journey mound he says large we can't get journeyman for thirty five bucks an hour he said we're paying forty two dollars an hour yeah Steve that's Ninety thousand dollars a year to start as a journeyman electrician\nAnd you know what does the same of that story is meanwhile we spend two hundred thousand dollars and you know cost the taxpayer to put these kids through college and a half of them are walking out with a sociology degree or ethnic studies degree or a political science degree I guess what there is not\nJobs for political science degree or a sociology degree it got to be able to do something you know and this was a failure education system Lars well not preparing you know these kids are the twenty first century for the twenty first century house when I was in high school I don't know if you have this we had shop class\nOh we did we did have had any market you know what they have their\nTouchy feely classes now [laughter] it's just it's the education system is not a parent we spent\nTwo trillion dollars a year on our education system of ours but we're not preparing the kids for the job so they can compete with the Chinese and the Indians the Europeans and it's one of the biggest failings of this country we've got to ... you know we've got to turn that around because there are there are probably ten\nHere's a Robin you're on TALK but it's still part of the show we let you talk about whatever the hell you want to talk about his Robin you're on your start to decay just saying that one after ... ... what do you think\nWhat I think is about to see tomorrow the beauty of San Antonio with the and then as dinner and how San Antonio rallies that I think it's over Sean I Know you're tired all of the aisle at work so hard to keep the front and center and I am grateful if there is it that we've had city council says made\nAre on the verge of making terrible mistakes and they are confident and this and it's not over they tried to came over the river walk at one time\n[laughter] like Daniel river they tried to pave over the river water that must have been before my time [laughter]\nBut it's true but we are that goes to lay the golden act the people that surround you and the Alamo yet it's very important but it's not over at as far as the propositions or ABC we can highlight the and that she may thinks she can get on a Berlin fly addict\n[laughter] oh my God\nThat's behind her however she has to do she lived with the reputation wherever she goes to she thought our way out she's going to cause you got to live with the reputation of being the one that tank at the Alamo because it late band and she does need to get what you wonder if she didn't fly across the sky and say surrender Sean\n[laughter] like a lot [laughter] do you think about\nAll of that but I Do I Try to Robin I'm a good night [noise]\nHow to write not\nTalk to\n... so bad and so I mean it's so funny [laughter]\nWhen Iran was like I'm a secret chamber behind behind the council room Raleigh all started with a dungeon like doing chamber for number

Alamo or what they're down but it really hurt ma'am and I just wanted to express my opinion on that I really hate what they're doing with it and I wish they would just leave it alone but I mean I I\nIt's just a dead to me is that 'cause it's freedom and you know I've lived in Texas My whole life and then at ... so much to me right you know and\nIt just it really bothers me or that they want to try to change it to something that that it it means so much more than what just imagine it it means a lot\nFor the independent and their freedom doesn't make any single\nMan is you know I look on the Alamo Web sites are on the Twitter feed and uh on the Elmo Twitter they say that Davy Crockett family approve of this and everything but does does they do they really know what they're trying to do it you know or\nWho knows I don't know this has been really of this thing has been a I got it wrong side of the time this thing has been so convoluted from day one\nUh you know I think purposely so
