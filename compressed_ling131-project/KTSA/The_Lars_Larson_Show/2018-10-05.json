Airborne Division yeah\nThat second division um\nIs sent into sort of relieve some of the pressure\nAnd he's pushed in along with other units and he leads a patrol\nUm to sort of take out parts of the railroad position that's a heavily fortified with dozens of machine gun deaths and your pushes forward with this man and they go they are they're immediately subject heavy fire and then drop around that your keeps pushing forward\nAnd he's just a crack shot he's um he's earned with a bold action rifle and is literally kicking off Germany machine gutters one at a time and slaves um you know over twenty\nAnd it is the Germans or realize what's happening they they send about five men after him including one officer and your kids out of ammunition with his rifle and he pulls out his forty five pistol and shoots the last man in the row down in the front man it just keeps going and\nHe just knocks them down and you know it's a really remarkable is your story as it sounds sort of leave it really feels twenty eight minutes\n[noise] but they did about ten years ago they went back to these are done in the battlefield archeology on the spot that that you know York made this [noise] this incredible uh stand if you will and they found a forty five cartridges over forty of them\nAlong with is thirty six ammunition in that exact spot\nAnd and you wrote that as you went you know he told his men because this was the guys you said the mountains in fact there's a great old movie in which he's portrayed and are they talking about what I recommend it oh it's a great movie and it was an old movie it's not very ... if I remember right it was Gary Cooper in black and white was in it\nIt was it was Nineteen forty one and it won a number of awards and uh it's really a wonderful movie it's worse you know where's the beef visiting yeah you know your listeners out there go watch it again it's a great movie\nSo he's a great strategist as well because you wrote that all the officers are dead so he takes command as a corporal and then when he finishes shooting a bunch of these machine guns in the head every time I had come up I'd done knocked it down and he said\nAnd then you said he went right down the position points is forty five at the Germans hadn't says\nTell your men to stop firing the German blow the whistle on up and down the line all the enemy sold\nOr stop firing they\nJust stop they stop in ... it's a it's incredible they he\nCaptures with along with some of the men in his patrol over a hundred and thirty Germans and they marched them back you know ... back to American lives and I wrote a piece of Breitbart on Sunday where the commanding general says\nWell your your your captured the whole damn serve an army that he sort of lasted obviously I got a few\nI feel a hundred and thirty two and attitude\nYes this is the kind of story that I Want Americans to remember because you know we're used to go into the movies in seeing\nYou know stories of the single man or a single woman who couldn't run out there and do amazing feeds on his own but this is a guy who actually did it for real and as I recall the story because after I watched the movie and this was a while back a year or two ago I went back and read the history\nOf the real history the man when he came back\nHe was kind of surprised that the I I think the community built um a house\nYou know he was he was not a wealthy guy he was he was not even you know a guy with a lot of money in his pocket but his community was very grateful for what he had done and he got all these offers a you know Hollywood wanted to see him and everything else and and he was just a symbol guy was ...\nHe was he didn't want to monetize\nThe experience and I think that that makes him so exceptional\nIt's not you know ... you look at today where people are are constantly trying to you know they would create a reality show around York didn't want that and I think that that's what makes him exceptional along with that generation of Americans which well\nOne hundred years later and they're largely forgotten but they're going to capture them in the unknowns that book I just wrote in and that's why I wrote the book I wanted to let the Americans know about this generation and how important it is and how they change the world\nI think that's entirely possible I mean it's not as though this wasn't misjudgment innocent misjudgment\nOr what happened several weeks ago when this letter was first sent to Dianne Feinstein she didn't refer to Chuck Grassley she didn't refer to the other members of the committee she didn't refer to Mitch McConnell or talk about it with judge Kavanaugh she referred Dr Ford to apart as an attorney who specializes\nIn publicizing these issues so that notion that she was trying to protect her confidentiality or that she was trying to do this process the way it's supposed to be done is a farce I'm Talking about ... yeah\nI'm Sorry Raj uh but I'm Talking to Raj Shah who's the deputy communications director the wind up so rushed about the report this comeback you've been briefed on it is there anything significant that contradicts anything or any part of what we've already heard from both judge Kavanaugh and Christine Ford last week\nI have to be careful in describing the contents of the report there's a lot of privacy issues that surround it the lord I Will say is that senators who have read food have come out and publicly said there is nothing that ...\nIt's a ... account that she said in testimony last week that this FBI report\nEssentially um does not bring new information that would reinforce or bring you evidence to support her account\nAnd what we've already seen in front of the Senate is that she has her account judge Kavanaugh has is and then she is named three additional people who she she says or president at this party none of them have any recollection of it whatsoever and so they all reinforced judge Kavanaugh's account\nNow Raj the Democrats as a as a lot of his predicted last week will do came out today and said well this isn't enough it doesn't go far enough they didn't talk to enough people watched the White House response that this ... this investigation is further referral for background or was not done thoroughly enough\nWell it seems like the Democrats will never ever ever be satisfied with what he's done in this case until\nWe have analysts delay or we pulled his nomination this is a political ploy being Democrats don't want more information to actually decide they've already decided no and they want more reasons to delay the president tweeted earlier today that says his seven background investigation that's comeback plane they could have a hundred and still complain\nA this is just simply a delay tactic I'd I'd encourage your listeners to tune out the noise judge Kavanaugh has a clean bill of health according to this latest FBI investigation and the senators have all they need to move forward and vote\nNow the Raj senator Heitkamp of North Dakota says she's not going to vote for ... she was one of the question march because she's from a very red state uh Joe Manchin a I Would imagine is going to vote for him but how does this vote line up from the point of view of the White House because you're not directly involved in the boat where you're very much affected by what the outcome is\nOf course and look we are working the vote or the White House is in close touch with the persuadable senators a lot of them have gone and seen this FBI report income that but at least an initial positive reaction I'm you know they still have some time between now and friday when there's a cloture vote\nAnd a floor vote scheduled for Saturday or it will be schedule for Saturday\nAnd they have a little bit of time to react but we think the initial reaction has gone well we think a center mansion you imagine Democrat from West Virginia is in play we think that um the three Republicans who who are still undecided are very much at all and we're likely to to get a several of them\nAnd so we're going to play this you know kind of\nOur ... our minute by minute but we're liking what we're hearing and we're very cautiously optimistic\nAnd I know you've avoids the specific names I look at Susan Collins and this morning apparently she tweeted out are made the comment she thought the FBI report was very thorough and I said to my producer I said that sounds like she's a she's leaning in the direction of voting for judge Kavanaugh um ... do you have any more information you can share with us about where you think\nHe's three question Marge like Mark ... Murkowski and flake will go\nOr definitely a very encouraged with what senator Collins said however I wouldn't I wouldn't ever intend to speak on her behalf I think she's a an independent minded senator and she is going to um take the time to review the report and come to a conclusion but a man or very encourage will it she said we actually encourage what Senator Flake\nSaid earlier about the contents of the report or feeling again cautiously optimistic about how the votes ended up going into friday and Saturday\nGarage it's always a pleasure thanks for the work as long as you do at the White House ... that's Raj Shah the deputy communications director will be back in just moment you're listening Lars Larson show [noise]\n[noise]\nWell you know for years we've talked about being the smoke house and when I Would describe it to you until you where it was I Would always say really small little building Lincoln you'll miss it as you drive down pleasant and rode well\nAs I've been telling you recently they're closed for a few weeks they are moving into a new B. and B. smoke house building if you've been craving the brisket or the ribs or the barbecue chicken for Bruce Texas style burgers just know that in a few weeks you'll be able to enjoy them all just as good as ever but in a much more ... uncomfortable\nDining room with a bigger kitchen so the pits can turn things out sooner and quicker and better at being the smoke house it's worth the waste and if you want to\nKeep in touch with her Facebook page for updates its B. and B. smoke house on Facebook for BP smoke houses their website twenty six twenty seven\nPleasanton road ... smoke house\nRoof fix now was known across the state fertile shingle and metal roofing on both residential homes and commercial property they're also known for their popular roof tuna this service at security of longevity to existing Ruth\nRuth fix now technicians who inspect and sort of by your roof for twenty four months plus he received the added benefit of applying one hundred percent of your turn off investment into a new roof installation at any time in the future we fix now provides the service for both residential and commercial properties they're the most trusted roofing company and\nAll of Texas offering a lifetime should go to get a twenty year labor warranted\nLocally owned locally operated locally trusted by both homeowners and business owners call Ruth fix now at two ten fix route or see them on line that are oh that's my ex now dot com\nRight now receive one thousand dollars in ... raised with any total re roof project when you work with respects now your work with the best roofing company in the state called route fix now at two ten fix route or online or\nOh maybe as a model on local regional national worldwide breaking news happens here\nFrom\nGary all they are in a new Wall Street journal op ed Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh admits he was emotional at last week's Senate hearing but he says he was forcefully denying sexually found out allegations against him that performance change of the opinion of a former court member\nJustice John Paul Stevens says he was a bread Kavanaugh fan before the sex assault allegations\nHis performance during the hearings cause me to change my mind\nNow former Justice Stevens since senators should reject Kavanaugh not because of the allegations but what he called Kevin O's angry political response Stevens says showed him on judge Roy Barnes\nI don't take that lightly at all my own family my wife and my now adult kids had been the target of those kinds of attacks in the past not many but one is more than enough let me tell you if you've ever had somebody stalking your family we had to put a guy in jail\nNow nobody nobody has ever scoffed at that ever takes it an seriously\nAfter it's happened to them if those are the kinds of techniques and tactics are going to be used then Democrats expected regular Americans who don't think much of that are going to say you are not going to do that kind of thing to people it doesn't matter how firmly you believe in your own cause we can't let you do that kind of stuff\nNow if you're a Democrat running for reelection in a red state how do you lose your vote no on Kavanaugh\nAnd Heidi Heitkamp of North Korea a note from North Korea North North Dakota is a is about to do just that and Christine ... blog the Ford was quick to shovel elan Kaiser into the spotlight but didn't even give her suppose a best friend a heads up about what she was about to do\nAnd apparently ... this is the young lady who was supposedly there the night\nThat ah Christine for dirt Christine blogger you she was back then in high school was assaulted she thought she was going to be raped she thought she was going to die\nAnd we'll end Kaiser was supposed to be her backup ...

Jerry welcome to the program and where do you and I disagree on anything tonight\nFor wired I I agree with you one thing that this isn't a hearing\nI had nothing to do a search for the truth but I Would say for Republicans and care about what this FBI cold was a sham it was a fake news it was fake that what's called pet is limited or they investigate cabinet or talk to a tablet they didn't touch it or they didn't even talk to the the third woman who came\nForward it was limited in its scope Donald Trump never wanted this twelve and when he finally was forced to have that you get the votes legal limit it to the extent or it was basically\nCan I ask you a couple of questions about Jerry first of all the president was forced to do anything but Congress couldn't force him to do this and that was entirely within his authority as the head of the executive branch which runs the D. O. J. and hence runs the hold on hold on Second Life\nWhen you say they didn't talk to Dr Ford Dr Ford last Thursday a week ago did hours of sworn testimony under oath by both sides what more did the FBI need to ask her\nWhat was that again for Donald Trump needed the votes to get a Senate confirmation from moderate Republican so he was forced you know that until\nWell the jury was one more to the you know that what more did the FBI need as Dr for\nWhere you can ask her follow up questions a crush\nOn time one you don't want you want to know the location\nYou could ask questions about it we have this kind of\nSupport and hold on a jury of your ... your hung over me Jerry I'm trying to be reason I'm going to keep my question short you keep your answer short\nShe was asked me you know where this happened she doesn't know where it happened you know when it happened or even what year it happened and she's not sure about any of that do you think of the FBI sat there and Senate best aging in and said ask her again you know where this answer would change\nThe actually she was more information than that how do you know ... to if they notice she status so we went pretty clear we actually there are questions that getting where exactly what time of place\nDid this happen what time of year and the Republicans cut short that questioning by that he loved us should and they brought in the Republicans\nCouldn't even hold on hold on a jury very hard when\nYou miss state facts the Republicans got five minutes at a time and they turn their time over to the professional sex crimes investigator for the Democrats each each of the questions on the panel got five minutes at a time they got exactly the same amount of time uh I ... and one of them spend all his time asking about sports\nAnd and about uh about what's slang was in high school or you know and what devil's triangle was which turns out to be a drinking game\nJust as he said so when you say the Democrats didn't have time to ask her where it happened\nShe's been very clear and all the things you said in her letter to find signs in her testimony under oath to the Senate committee she doesn't know where it happened and Jerry\nYou realize how ridiculous is is to say if only the FBI had asked that question four or five more times her answer might have changed\nLet's go to another ... nana\nThat's where we call my wife when the grandbabies around now welcome to the program\nA high rise I I just wanted to say that and I'm way out of the million little all named tonight I'm here to complain but and I am here to say that\nYou know\nFor the portion of my life since I was four I've had a baby on the forehead and as I grew up as an adult you know I was I had him either make them anymore but what you do is you\n... ...\n... people especially man mhm and\nThen I I I don't want I and I know you need to know that and you know this time we our time is limited so I Want you to get to the point you're going to make\n...

I wouldn't want to be a member of a club that would let me and they look at this and say I'm In that\nClub and these guys are behaving in a really terrible way and then for reasons that have nothing to do with\nYou know polls or anything else they say I don't want to be associated with that no it does\nI think it's I think it's a whiplash combination of they're behaving really terribly in a

so if for instance Ruth Bader Ginsburg leads the court before the end of Trump's first term before his second term in office\nOr will he get the chance to nominate somebody and have that person confirmed a lot of that hangs on the election this November if the Democrats ended up losing seats and I think they might just lose seats about a month from now\nUh I think that you're going to see them do nothing because they won't have the votes on the other hand if they pick up seats if they pick up enough ah I think ... that they're going to do everything they can to block every single one

and I've seen them used by farmers to make sure that their crop yields are up and it's amazing how that works I've seen them used in some cases by law enforcement the problem is\nWe may also see them used by criminals\nWhile I've invited Jason ... who's a policy analyst at the Edwin Meese Center for legal in judicial studies at heritage you're Asian good to have you back on the program makes your happening so do the police need the ability\nTo be able either shoot down or bring down drones if they end up being used not just by terrorists but by ordinary criminals as well\nAs a a ... for that

talking about engaging in life saving activities that can bring a emergency medical equipment at the scene of an accident minutes or healthy ... lost in the community\nNeither uses drones are being at the two right now and I think we're going to see a lot of that but we also\nIs that uh you know as with any new technology where is also a potential for misuse end abuse and there have certainly been a fair number of cases in just the last few months where drones are being put to watch a novel criminal or or even terrorists purposes\nAnd law enforcement uh unfortunately does not have presently the ability to do much if anything to stop these\nDreams and before we go to the ability to bring him down can you give us a couple of examples about ... have been using them\nShore so really what we're seeing\nIs that criminals are at least this innovative when it comes to to finding new uses for drugs as entrepreneurs and innovators of the commercial side uh we've we've looked at some of the

TSA Mitt F him one of those seven wash ... honestly for a budget is going a little Lars Larson to show\nWelcome back to the program we talk a lot about regulations on this program because as you might know the United states\nProduces oh right around ... trillion dollars worth of goods and services every year 'course we consume an awful lot of those services and the goods as well but that is the gross domestic product of the country almost twenty trillion dollars about ten percent of that\nIs spent on the regulations in making all those things so\nYou think gosh if we could just cut the regulations down dramatically without endangering life for safety or we might be able to add a trillion dollars to our gross domestic product which would be a tremendous boom not just a business but to all of us who worked for businesses and since I work in such a highly regulated industry\nYes the FCC is my best friend Wayne cruise joins me now when you laugh I'll tell you what\nHow would you like to be at the mercy of the Federal Communications commission Wayne is vice president for policy and a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute ... author also author of the annual report ten thousand commandments an annual ... snapshot of the federal regulatory state\nIs the federal regulatory stage still alive and breathing after Donald Trump's been in for two almost two years\nWell unfortunately it is he uh he's done a great deal to roll it back and I really really appreciate you having me thanks so much you bet you hit on it the regulations are the kind of hidden attacks and regulations are the least disciplined part of the whole federal regulatory enterprise\nAnd the discipline bart is running near a trillion dollar deficit than a twenty two trillion dollar debt so we know we've got a real problem with the agencies are running wild and you're just in a nutshell um Trump to me did more than any other president since Reagan in terms of slowing the flow of new regulations\nAnd one of the important things he did was say when agency wants to issue a new sickness is a little they got ... got to get rid of two other ones\nSo that's been important that the great thing to do it's really slow things down the problem is you know we have laws then we have the thousands of regulations that agencies issue but given the administrative procedure act and agencies like the FCC that you mentioned\nYou can't get rid of a regulation Lars you can only replace it with a new one and we tried to roll back the clean power role or the waters in the United states' role you have to go through a long new notice and comment period and you've got to anticipate all the lawsuits that are going to follow that so\nTrump's two for one has done a great deal he ... he put it this way he could have slowed down regulations to a trickle he's been able to roll son back he beat the two for one in a technical sense even did better than that he did twenty two for one in terms of elimination\nBut unfortunately they were kind of obscure roles which probably wouldn't surprise you could ... just like laws that they're you know laws that get passed every year naming post offices and things like that a lot of laws and regulations are obscure he got rid of a number of things but the key thing that he's done is slowed down and what I Hope that he can do\nIn the same way that Obama had his pin phone Trump's kind of got liberties meat axe I call it he can continue to keep freezing regulations and and that's what can given the biggest legacy in terms of what comes\nNext I'm Talking to wane crews from the Competitive Enterprise Institute so you have a specific idea to see you I about what the president might do to really Hample five disability to get rid of bad rules and rags\nRight just we'll just in brief um ... you know we have laws there there are a few dozen laws that are passed each year\nAnd in the ten thousand can damage record with that you mentioned and other analyses ... look at the same thing\nThere are some three thousand rules and regulations that come through every year but you remember Obama's pending phone yeah I was also guidance documents notices memoranda circulars bulletin administrative interpretations all these other kinds of agencies sub regulatory guidance\nThat we've taken to calling regulatory dark matter that pours out it's not supposed to be binding however if you disobey it you may not get your permit you may not get your waiver so there's a lot of bureaucratic pressure that can come\nThere what we recommended that the Trump do an executive order kind of like Reagan's executive order\nThat requires the cost benefit analysis that we have now for normal rules but the Trump addressed the guidance documents 'cause he's pretty much pick the low hanging fruit as far as the two for one regulations right you would imagine that you know he's looked at it you know there's a congressional Review Act got rid of Obama's midnight role that then he's done some two for one\nOf what of all the uh the laws that are out there\nBut you kind of you kind of run run to the end of that so the next thing he should do I think is addressed guy that said there's been a lot of the guy that played the bathroom ... guide and\nI was gonna say I was going to bring that we're now yeah Wayne I like my audience manageable in fact that you know the rule that said the bathrooms in both colleges in public schools had\nTo be open so that a a biological boy who now claimed she's a girl can use the ladies' room and and that's that was deeply disturbing for a lot of people they said that any ride and yet he didn't come out of even a regulation that came out of a guy who got it\nWell they're just quickly the interesting thing on that large this he got rid of that but he didn't count it didn't credit himself into two for one also the department of labor got rid of a role in front of a guidance on franchising but Obama had didn't count credit himself or that they got rid of rural on independent contracting\nThat was going to cause additional regulatory burdens for up for independent contractors didn't count that in favor in his two for one process\nThere's other guy that you mentioned the FCC that you know there will be\nTremendous guy that's coming out of the net neutrality rules that's being old that now you also got it's to me is a sense they can since the beer bureaucracy can regulate now without writing anything down I think it's important that Trump\nUse if he could create an executive order with the same kind of legacy and sticky power that Reagan's executive order on cost benefit analysis\nHas for guidance documents and I think after the PIN and phone era that's an important thing to do especially if we you know we're going to have new elections were going to have democratic presidents again we need to have something in place\nThat discloses makes transparent transparent and tries to make an effort to roll back the abuse of guidance documents or regular doctor\nWayne let me do a deep dive just a little bit I mean into the wee bit and here's one I Want to know I can understand why the the regular regulation process is ...\n\n\n\n\n\n[laughter]\nWe're going to show you how we get a darn tough guy that lives in the chest guy because you know where you\nAre you a well worn [laughter] and\nThat's not the way she talked to anybody that's not very nice people ask is how hang up on what's what that stupid beard many where I have a ... what's your name on it [laughter]\nSo maybe you're not my bungee sort [noise] um no I just wanted to sort of like ... what would you be dirty I figure I'm being dirty", "show_name": "The Lars Larson Show",
