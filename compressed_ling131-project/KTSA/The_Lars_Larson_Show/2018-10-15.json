the bones themself\n... absorb it back from the bones if ...\nThat's right and I say and what you just discussed right now leads to one of the major causes of a condition that's affecting twenty five million Americans right now which is called osteoporosis right which is a weakening of adults\nNow and it's due to the body deriving the calcium from the bones instead of from the ... tradition yep\nOkay and so we have to do is we have to find a way to put calcium back in the diet now you'd think that would be really easy\nSure just drink milk just drink milk or you know eat a lot of green leafy vegetables and that sort of thing but first of all people don't do that right\nAnd second of all the the quality of the calcium that comes from our diet has been decreasing in the last fifty years really yeah because things like pastures Asian food they're irradiated um the calcium as leads from the soil\nPeople are taking medications that block it so\nThe actual calcium is not being absorbed in the body okay and then you see people taking toms and calcium supplements you know they buy a house with started right are great but\nThese things don't absorbing the body\nHappening for a couple of reasons one uh when you take a let's say an antacid that had the ... minute like uh\nFirst of all calcium does not absorbed in the body unless it's an anesthetic environment but to see what happens when you take a tub with an antacid\nOh okay so even if you're getting calcium in the in the antacid itself it's not been absorbed\nI see because it has to be in a in an acid environment for it to be absorbed\nExactly okay now we have a product called the ... formula\nMy combat formula it's natural and the differences is that the powder and what happens if you put it in hot water and you mix it up and you drink it down in a liquid instead of a pill\nAnd it absorbed into your system\nWow so that's ...\nWell yeah because when Cal the magnesium earn a liquid state it absorbs ten times better than in any other state\nWow that's great matter of fact yes I'm I'm reading the can right now says a fenced absorbing calcium and magnesium beverage powder\nWell it comes down to ...\nOne of the way to tell if you're not observing calcium take a look at what drugs they're taking are you on high blood pressure medication you need something for your kidneys or you want pain medications you need sleeping pills that the calcium and especially the easiest being absorbed ... you're not going to suffer from others say\nMy comment formula does absorb incredibly in the body the thing is is that when you take my comment formula but not like well well I feel better I have thousands of people ready to the doctor pain 'cause I Can't believe it thirty minutes after I took the ... the pain in

that we're all too familiar with these days and that stress and we're finding out about the damage that everyday stress can do to our bodies the warning signs that we should be aware of and what we can do to alleviate and even eliminate the effects of stress\nAnd Dr ... you were talking earlier about calcium and magnesium and how we need these nutrients in our bodies to fight the effects of stress and how you're killing ... formula can help us in this battle against stress I'd like to talk for a minute about how the magnesium\nFactors in I mean I I I'm starting to understand about the calcium but what does magnesium\nOr we're talking about stress and we're talking about stress affects the body and first of all in order to function at all your body needs magnesium it's probably of all the vitamins I could list magnesium is probably the most important vitamin on the planet right now\nI've not heard a whole lot about magnesium ... why is magnesium so important\nThere is over three hundred and twenty five bio chemical reactions that magnesium is involved with it it's almost like a hormone wow and for example if it was low levels of magnesium your heart won't beat who very important factor in life you would say so in\nFact let me just read a list of some of the conditions are associated with magnesium deficiencies okay um you have\nAttention deficit disorder Alzheimer's or anxiety asthma autism chronic fatigue syndrome congestive heart disease caused the patient diabetes fibromyalgia high blood pressure insomnia migraine headaches multiple sclerosis muscle cramps\nPark and says that's the approach is getting a list just goes on and on and on\nAnd this is this is associated with a a lack of magnesium in the body\nSimply a lack of magnesium bully too so it's not that they're really mess around with now what happens is that you need that many of them in your body in order for the calcium to be absorbed\nOh so it's it's a necessary thing in order to get the first component which is calcium\nThat's right they work in combination with each other now there's many more practical applications of this ... formula ... first of all like I said you drink it gets into your system and one of the first things we use it for in our clinic is for people who are under a lot of stress\nAnd the cats sleep well at night it works better than anything I've ever seen for people that have trouble sleeping really because it relaxes you ride and you do actually fill the relaxation after you drink the ah after you drink a cup of the combat\nInteresting now the other thing that it's really really good for\nAre people who are in pain okay and I have a whole bunch of stories to tell you and and a case studies of people actually taking the call max formula and getting rid of hand and this is including arthritic Taipei\nFibromyalgia which is a form of arthritis back pain muscle spasms migraine headaches there's a whole category of of various I'd like to discuss with you\nWow that's fantastic some of those things that you've named seem to be age related or or things that we experience as we grow older is there a link there\nYeah there's a vicious circle that I'd like to discuss what happens is that when a person has\nA magnesium deficiency specifically magnesium they don't absorb their food as well and so they go into what we call mal absorption syndrome which millions and millions of Americans\nHave and it's not like you feel sick or you know this that yes it might be overtime just starting to feel more tired and tired and tired\nMhm and that's just a real gradually overtime type of thing and a lot of people justify that they're getting old and they just need more threats or whatever right and that's what I Would think\nThat what happens is that when when you get less absorption you actually increase the efficiency in your system of magnesium\nAnd that and that started to take the calcium out of the bones you start getting all lost you start getting um muscle loss because it also reduces the muscle mass and pretty soon before you know it you are feeling old yeah and your body's actually starting to manifest at\nAll due to a simple lack of these nutrient\nCalcium and now let me tell you and it is simple the problem and being a doctor researchers how do you get into the system\nThe formula we have the ... formula is so fantastic because you get a powder form you take hot water and you make if you put it in a cop take a teaspoon of this powder and mix it in you and your drink this cut down the screen absorption rate is really a incredible because it actually goes right into your bloodstream\nFeeling all your joints don't move well this kind of wife's you out it drains your energy and then then you get tired and you go to sleep I guess what you don't sleep\nNow I'm I'm telling you like common scenario due to a lack of calcium and magnesium in your system when you have the comics and the first thing that happened your ticket twenty minutes before you go to bed ... a good night's sleep and wake up feeling refreshed your energy comes back\nIs killing me safe I mean you're telling us how powerful ... and I'm just wondering if you can ever take too much or if it's safe to take if you're already on a ... any supplements or medications\nComics is never ever been shown to interact poorly with any medication\nOkay it's a hundred percent natural it's safe and you know our our formula doesn't contain sugar which isn't a lot of calcium products wheat soy gluten lactose or anything that people are trying to avoid illness doesn't have any of that but you see the point is is that if you're a person who's a diabetic your and high blood pressure you had bypass surgery guess what\nYou are deficient you are deficient in the calcium and magnesium\nDr ... unfortunately we're about out of time or any any parting thoughts\nWho could really benefit from this\nTime because if you're the age of thirty five like formula\nTo prevent it but if you're selling for someone to sleep or you experienced a lot of muscle cramps a lot of your body [noise] this is an absolute every function and your whole body\nDiagnosed with a condition even on a lot of pressure medication that I urge you to try well\nDr ...

very interesting thing and there is apparently\nSome of the interrogation was transmitted via his\nApple watch and\nBones saw is what people are saying was involved thinking about that\nHow real some of this is or isn't I don't know but I Will tell you this there is a big deal coming out here with the fact that there is a lot of money involved with about a hundred plus billion dollars pouring into our country for arms and things like that Saudi Arabia is better the devil you do in a lot of ways\nThey're friendly itch\nTo us but not too they hate Iran which makes us like them a little bit more\nThey had a oil they bought our stuff it is a weird thing that goes on there remember this is and people say well we can't not do this we have to do this deal people are texting me and I'm saying no no no I think we looked at this I understand what Trump's trying to say he doesn't want to kill this deal because a lot of money pouring into us has a lot of jobs at a hundred billion dollars that people are getting the Pentagon\nAnd saying that though this is a journalist who had power and if I'm Trump I looked at this seriously really seriously what influence what was he working on what was happening that you would send potentially fit keen\nMen to take him out he and by the way some\nMay really want this deal but I Will tell you this Congress has a say on this and a ... yeah they're not thrilled and if anything's going to unite them for all of the stuff that's happening at our country it may be this thing\nFor I think it's important to know what happened we were at the same ... some additional information which are kind of share we need to know what happened but ultimately I mean to say this and I'm not saying this is what happened during learn it soon enough\nIf the Saudi Government ordered a guy to be abducted they killed them they chop them up the sound a bunch of people and the killing them proper mountain I made a lot for that's what happened [laughter] I'm telling you either the what's going to happen here on Capitol Hill is a complete revolt against our policies with Saudi Arabia I\nThink about that and they could override this they could override this it's a very ... and again the relationship we have that look at nine eleven look at several of the other issues that have gone on well hobby is them all of these kinds of things it is the you know it's one of those things where\n[noise] they hate it they hate her on that that you know\nThey do their mortal enemies and that is a big issue so we walk a weird fine line and that we have for for years the oil all of that stuff is a very fine issue we walk but that a hundred and ten billion dollars in a lot of people were looking at\nWhat is taking place in this kind of bizarre weird fight revolution that is going on in in in what is trying to become a more modern Saudi Arabia\nWhere they were they younger king who was forward looking women may be able to get you know drive and yes what they're getting license but there may be some more progressive things but then you've got a very hard line religious sect that doesn't want to move any any more forward than the sixth century that they're living in\nA so you've got all this weird things and this guy I mean this guy is a very ... very interesting character like say\nHe he befriended\nOsama bin Laden in the eighties and is that the early nineties and when he was fighting the Soviets and uh and and at times he was even trying to broker a deal of peace between Saudi Arabia and bin Laden he disavowed him after\nTwo thousand or one and nine eleven he just said he wouldn't would never have anything to do with him but he begged him to step away from all of this stuff this guy he's had a lot of influence there and the influence he has\nAnd giving people the opportunity to have a voice even if they don't say it's so much out loud to him and threw him was huge and now we're in a situation where you know people will look around going what what is going to happen with this what's gonna happen with this relationship with us in Saudi Arabia\nAnd it's unfortunate because they're an important partner and our Middle Eastern strategy to contain sort of Iran's nefarious influence in the region\nA but but if they have gone as far as to where the sky answer this consulate kill I'm kind of a body up and then Senator Cruz here to do that and then they laugh at a very responsible for and I'm not for an hour and find out what the evidence was presented\nWell Mr ... we're going to give out the cool Halloween candy to what's
