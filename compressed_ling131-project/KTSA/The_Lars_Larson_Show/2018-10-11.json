after\nI finish the program I did a listener with some of my colleagues in Seattle, Washington I by liberal ways down from there so I had to drive home last night\nBut uh when we sat there is a panel some my fellow talk shows like John Carlson Kirby Wilbur and ah you know marketing band camp on these other gentleman that I have the a great pleasure of associating with\nOne of the questions that kept coming up from the audience and drew a lot of comments from us was the current violence threats intimidation and outright attacks\nOn conservatives by liberals and he does just that clear don't let anybody try and get the moral equivalent thing going or play that card and say well you know both sides do it no they don't and uh I I wanted to talk to generally about Martin about that who is co founder of the Tea Party patriots\nJenny Beth welcome back to the program how are you tonight\nI'm great thanks so much for having me\nI'm a I'm so pleased to have you on the show every time you come on delivering extremist see themselves as the lesser version of the Tea Party and I want to know if you think that comparison is inappropriate one between the pink hat wearing crowd or the anti for crowd or the black lives matter crowd\nTrying to compare themselves to the organization that you'd cofounded\nI think it's an outrage and it's ridiculous she took care I agree with the law ... law abiding citizens\nTo a bunch of people who wear masks destroy property a charge the SAT says the Supreme Court trying to claw their way into the Supreme Court and are calling for um like we had from Hillary Clinton\nBehavior that's not civil unless they get their way of winning election it's practically it's ... with\nWhat she was calling for yesterday and I I'm offended by it I can understand the anger and yeah we've been angry baby we share that in common but the way that we ...\nThe way that we express our anger and the way we can resolve our our our anger is completely within the system because we were stacked system and love our country so much and these people who are doing these these action guilt respect the system\nKnown journey but one of the comment one of the questions that came from the audience last night of this panel I was sitting on was why don't we as Republicans good is fired up as they are and I said well I think were fired up but if you think we're going to behave\nThe way the left the age we're not and I said it's just never been there Republican style I'm not saying that they're probably has the men from time to time a conservative out there\nWho has done something outrageous hit somebody or physically attacked somebody but I said for the most part\nThat's an outlier the situation you know that it's the left who tends to engage in physical attacks and in the case of antifa and people like them or you know throw things at police set things on fire a riot in downtown city shut down freeways that kind of thing\nAnd I don't know do do you think there's\nTwo think there's any occasion you can think of in the last decade when conservatives have behaved anything like the way the left routinely behaves\nNo we don't have that right the left is that people arrested from Occupy Wall street because they were plotting to blow something up that we say Ohio\nThe of which at Bernie Sanders follower who on clearly enhanced it had issues with and shot at a Republican and shot\n... you're on every time something bad happened\nAnd everything shooting on it for several years as our news including the Boston bombing which happened to press terrorists\nTerrorists I'm afraid we're not originally from our country the media we immediately leap and say oh it must be the Tea Party it was cheaper to hit this it was not us\nTime after time after time that you're tired and I I resent it completely reinvent\nThe way that they're trying to say that the out I'll outrageous unlawful behavior that is leading to more and more violent we're seeing from the left just anything like that group of people who I had worked side by side with for nearly the last decade\nYou know I'm going to make a comparison and I think this is something we could work with\nI made it earlier tonight when I was talking to a friend of mine and I said uh you remember when David Duke was alleged to have endorsed Donald Trump it turned out he had not and Donald Trump disclaimer connection but the media when you know crazy\nTrying to tell the president if some crazy man who's affiliated with the plan endorses you you have to immediately come out and\nAnd I guess you're not ... that you've never accepted the endorsement and I'm sure there are people who maybe have unsavory attitudes based on race religion and otherwise you say I Love the Lars Larson Joe well\nI don't control what people think so somebody told me there's some big it who lives somewhere in California that really love your show I'd say okay I got nothing I can do about it he's entitled to think whatever crazy things he wants offensive though they may be this on my fault you know because I I didn't ask cruise endorsement\nAnd and so the reason I'm bringing this up as a media extend it expended a huge amount of time and energy telling the president that if somebody unsavory endorses him that he would have\nCome out and condemn that endorsement and condemned the Klan okay on that same basis\nI Would like to see people started showing up at whatever public events democratic candidates in Democrat office holders are holding and I mean federal as well as local folks around America\nAnd say will you condemn the acts of violence by left wing extremists in this country and I'm willing to bet that most of the folks out there or running for reelection all the members of the house and a third of the sun it on the Democratic side will not want to do that they they will not want to condemn it\nAnd and the problem is right now the mainstream media isn't even bothering to ask the question and I think to some extent if you could get major office holders to condemn this kind of thing from the left that it would have some effect\nBecause right now they're happy to just sit back and let these extremists go out set fire to things and and enjoy what they think is the benefit of it\nWithout having without having to be asked are you on ... ... is this something that that you believe in and because of the mainstream media is in the position where they are the ones who should be asking them\nOn the the meat you mean it should be asking them but they're not they're not going to ask them because the people on the left or the elected officials and the people here the less the Jewish leaders\nAre chanting them up and pouring fuel on the higher Eric Holder kick day oh we when\nWe ... that Michelle Obama was wrong at St when they go low we go high no no he said no no when they go low we kick them yeah I Know what it's like to be checked by Eric Holder and the IRS and that\nThe Obama administration so yeah that's exactly\n[laughter] exactly the kind of behavior I Would expect from our former attorney general Maxine Waters hauling for silence chasing down on supporters of the president whether you can find them a gas station the grocery stores the department stores wherever you can\nStill left check her up on that we see that time after time and now Hillary Clinton saying well it's on and\nI have no idea now Seattle okay well so what is there anything about those governors that kind of is is a commonality among them at the ... that shows why they've uh they've been so poor at managing tax\nIt's just a it's a ... if you get an F and those folks got an apple low scores in our report it's because it's a combination of hide spending increases and writes in years with a tax increases a and resistance to any tax cuts so there's two Republicans you mentioned\nThe south Dakota governor the Republican uh the God he a hike sale taxes\nJim Justice the governor of West Virginia is an interesting character he used to be a Democrat he flipped last year at a rally when Trump visited uh the state I guess he stuck his finger to the wind or he's really he's kind of a big government guy at heart he's pushed hard for tax\nAll right so you got an F and then finally rounding out the bottom aid Kate Brown of Oregon and Jay Inslee of Washington state the state I live in so I've got a dog in the fight there how do they rate and what are they been doing in particular\nWhat Jay Inslee the you know the worst governor and the national fiscal policy in my view he's been absolutely relentless ... pushing taxes up he came into office originally back at twenty Thirteen promising not to raise taxes he's push for capital gains taxes higher business taxes\nAnd probably worst a giant new carbon tax would raise the eight hundred million dollars luckily those taxes haven't passed the legislature pushback on him but I score what our governors are proposing and what they're pushing for and ah he's court for these massive tax hikes it's the same over and Oregon Kate Brown\nThe governor there pushed for a gigantic or a ... new so called growth receipts tax which would be the three billion dollar tax collected in a hitman or from voters a on business luckily that was rejected too but ah\nIt's just that you know the interesting thing about Washington state and Oregon the economies have been doing well from the high tech industry and other industry so money has been pouring into those states Treasury's so but you know so they don't need you know new you know higher taxes\nAnd three tax rate but they they that's what they that's what these governors have been pushing for it's really a responsible\nAnd you know you mentioned the carbon tax and of course Kate Brown has pushed the carbon tax as well and they say oh it's only Fifteen bucks a ton I put that together and I don't know if this is interesting to you Chris but\nI put that together the fact that just this last week the last few days there's been a report saying we're at the eleventh hour on global warming and we must make all these changes\nAnd I saw one figure that said if we're going to successfully head off\nYou know inevitable or an actual role a global warming\nWe may have to have a carbon tax is highest twenty seven thousand dollars a ton so when I see Jay Inslee saying hey Fifteen bucks a ton it'll raise your gas costs natural gas costs everything that deals with energy which is everything including food but it's only Fifteen bucks a ton on carbon\nBut some of these global warming alarmist are saying we might need thousands of dollars per ton I think that the Fifteen bucks is just a starting point\nI Would say all people at the residents of what's going on a Washington state in Oregon need to need to look what's going on in California they have a carbon tax\nMoney goes into the giant um that's sort of new bureaucracy essentially a slush fund for a politician and it's used for things like ah Jerry Brown's of high speed rail line which is a huge boondoggle so you know half of the problem with these carbon taxes the damage that you're going to be causing on a industry in business\nAnd the other problem is the government's going to have a giant new tax a slush fund\nOr to to to our waste on a on projects like high speed rail\nSecrets that's the part that bothers me the most because they say well we're going to solve global warming through taxation I said well what's it going to do about using carbon well they the first to admit or claim well it's such a low tax people barely noticed the effect will say barely noticed the effect\nHow does the ... tax change use of carbon fuels or carbon production and ... they can't solve that dichotomy that they're both saying the tax will reduce people's use of fuels and other things or produce carbon dioxide\nI also think a bad thing about the carbon taxes is that they're invisible from voters I I you know they're sort of anti democratic there there's this huge amount of money the government raises where the\nPeople on the voters can't see it I like taxes that are visible that people can see an income taxes and sales taxes I don't like these taxes that are collected on business and our and our invisible to the to the citizens because then they then they vote for bigger government thinking that it's free\nChris it's always a pleasure thanks for the time and thanks for the work you're doing right now on this crocheting which will be back in a moment

spent some time talking about in civility which is probably the polite his term you can use to describe what the antifa crowds the anti cabin on crowd or the black lives matter crowd and the rest have been using literally over the last several years\nAnd you've heard all the stories about Sarah Huckabee Sanders and her husband and their gas being chased out of a restaurant\nYou've heard about us senators like Ted Cruz being harassed in public places and then more recently you've heard about ... of senators and that's the term of art for taking somebody's personal data who's in a high position\nAnd sharing their personal phone number personal address and other information about them\nThat could very easily put their life at risk will consider this story\nSenator Rand Paul the senator from Kentucky\nSaid in an interview yesterday that he's worried there will be an assassination following the contentious confirmation process for Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh Paul who has been the victim of a brutal assault by neighbor last November that left him with six broken ribs and a lung confusion\nTold a Kentucky radio station he fears somebody will be killed and the current political climate remember\nOur friend Steve ... member of Congress from Louisiana heat very nearly died he was shot on a baseball field by a left wing nut who deliberately targeted conservative GOP senators there's what Rand Paul says\nFear there's going to be an assassination I really worry that someone is going to be killed and that those who are ratcheting up the conversation\nThat they have to realize they bear some responsibility if there is elevates the violence and then you have Hillary Clinton this week saying we will not be civil then you will not get civility back until you agree to hand us power back\nI told somebody last night we had a listener event in Seattle involving some of my fellow tacos John Carlson and Kirby Wilbur and and mark claimed band camp a I told a in a we're on a panel and we're being asked questions we were kind of kid sitting in front of this audience we're having some fun\nSaid this is this is one of the concerns that we have that you're going to that you can almost exclusively see violence threats and intimidation used by the left\nAnd if somebody wants to be a nice day on that by all means called the show\nAnd tell me the last time that you saw conservatives engage in that kind of behavior for instance\nThat the women's march did after the inauguration of President Trump in January of last year where cars were shut on fire moms were going after people rocks and bottles were thrown at police\nTell me that you see a right wing equivalent to the antifa crowd that marches in the streets even at the city where we ever broadcast studios Portland, Oregon where they have thrown explosives that police say of throwing bricks said police in bottles and police they set stores on fire they said police cars on fire\nTell me the conservative equivalent\nTo that kind of thing happening and I I had a question from folks last night at this event who said well should we get as fired up as the Democrats are always the left does and my answer was that's not what conservatives do fact I almost think there's a whole book on that I don't exactly have the time to write it but\nIf you think about it most of the assassins in American history\nSERE hands cheer hand John Wilkes booth\nIf you think about the people who have committed political assassinations\nLee Harvey Oswald not exactly a right wing conservative if you know what I mean\nAnd so the left uses these kinds of tactics there right does not\nWent in TV shows up in your town be sure to have the fire department and sublease an ambulance is on hand when the Tea Party shows up on the Capitol mall in Washington DC they usually leave the place cleaner than it was when they arrived\nSo is there a reason to do that this isn't pointed out routinely I Know that most reporters\nWorking for TV channels they want to find a kind of a moral equivalence well both sides do it\nActually that's not true is not backed up by the facts is not backed up by history so when somebody like Hillary Clinton vows that civility we'll only returned when the left gets its power back\nIt reminds me of a four year old in the grocery store in the cereal aisle with mom who is screaming at the top of his lungs holding his breath well it'd be screaming you can't be able to use ... screaming at the top of his lungs and stamping his feet\nAnd civility is only going to return when the captain crunch goes into mom shopping basket we understand it it's not rational behavior but it is the kind of behavior you expect perhaps from juvenile children\nIt is not the kind of behavior that America ought to have to tolerate coming from adults simply because they identify with the left side of the trial let's go to Cindy Cindy welcome to the Lars Larson ... what's on your mind tonight\nOh hello life I was told that fish they want to go at it and get the civil\nThank you very much they only say that so we can spend most of the time your point\nOkay I thought that the credit markets horrible fish and itchy taxpayer money trying to capitalize on sexual pet it\nAround and Clinton democratic tore the actual pet it\nClear that the guy a I have eight\nYeah and you did you notice Hillary Clinton saying well the charges against my husband she actually said this week\nAre were different the accusations are different and I read that I thought yeah they were different\nBecause the charges against I mean Bill Clinton never contested that he had sexually harassed and molested Kathleen willy who came to the oval office asking for help he never contested that he had to elicit an illicit affair with Monica you know uh and and he never eat it\nNow of course he would not admit that he rape Juanita Broderick but that story is so well founded and well evidence and Juanita Roderick who's been on this program not long ago just for a couple of weeks ago during the whole cabinet business um she explained that she\nTold somebody about the assault the rate that Bill Clinton put her through\nWithin thirty minutes of it happening and she remember the details you then told other people in her close circle of friends and she told them why she feared reporting it\nBecause the man who had raped her Bill Clinton was the attorney general and he controlled the industry in which she owned two nursing homes the attorney general of Arkansas that time maybe still a controls the nurse ... nursing home business he had the power to put her out of business so you know Bill Clinton was accused accurately\nSewing Hillary says they were different I'm sure that was and what she meant but it's what my response would be your bed or was it was a different\nSince satellite era began in the early Nineteen seventies and when you look at those statistics\nWhen you look at the frequency of tropical cyclones globally either intensity there's been no long term trend now there's a lot of ... ability even a lot of decades and decades variability but there's no obvious long term trend\nSo when these folks are talking about climate change being one of the drivers as we heard right after Katrina we heard well Katrina was a huge storm it did a tremendous amount of damage and we're going to see a lot of these and then we didn't see any\nFor a long long time I actually I think it was almost it was was it not a record linked for not having a major hurricane hit the continental United States\nYes it was it was a it was over eleven years that it never happened the war\nAnd there was a scientist at NASA Goddard who actually made it that that's like a one and two hundred year that are that you brought up something else that needs to be mentioned ... even though the weather hasn't gotten ... haven't gotten worst hurricane damage has gone up dramatically in recent decades and that's what people get confused\nThey think oh well damages from hurricanes is increasing you know more and more and more and it's not because of the weather it's because we keep building more and more infrastructure along the Gulf Coast\nYou know look at the look at the Miami food Lauderdale metroplex down there you know millions of people write\nAbout Nineteen back in Nineteen hundred Eighteen Ninety five do is actually known when they're almost nobody lives in Seattle until the early Nineteen hundreds no one wanted to live there because it was a hot humid swamp the land that nobody cared about\nYou know as Miami was created in like you know as a town in in Eighteen Ninety five there was nothing there to destroy\nCourse then we had a category five ... a bouquet an angel in Nineteen Ninety two comes through the south side of of Miami homestead there's his face\nAnd it and some day you're going to have another one of those hit a major metropolitan area and if he knows the media is freaking out now you know wait until that happens\nWell and and you bring up an important point we made a policy decision to allow people to build and when I say that I'm not in favor of the government forbidding people the right to build but I'd like to market place to work on it you know if we had free market insurance someone could say I really want a beach front home in Miami\nAnd uh and you know or an orange some other city in Florida you say fine but the insurance is going to cost you an arm and a leg if you want to afford that go ahead but if you don't yeah but but let let the marketplace do it unfortunately all of the flood insurance in the United states I say all there may be a few policies\nThat are written by Lloyd's of London but for the most part flood insurance is all underwritten by the federal government\nAnd am I correct in saying doc there'll be premiums do not truly reflect the risk\nWell I don't know the details of the insurance it's more than the flood insurance there's also ... as I understand the flood insurance ... sure it's along the coast they're two different thing right and I think hurricane it and I think in ensuring your house if it's on the beach is very expensive now but I suspect you're right that is this\nIs not completely the price of it it's not completely a controlled by the market uh but I've looked at at property down there you know my my daughter lives in Pensacola and uh my wife would like to be closer to the beach or on the beach and I've\nFor years I looked at you know getting getting some land and and and I just cannot bring myself to living a myth that little and I can't afford it\nIs extremely expensive on the beach but even close to the beach is very expensive so typically what you find is that people didn't have the nice homes\nThat are built down there on the beach basically self insured in other words they're taking a chance that their home that's worth you know let's say seven hundred thousand dollars to replace the building\nIf it gets destroyed in a hurricane sometime in the next ten Twenty years they'll just build another [laughter] else with their own money or they can afford it\nThat may be the way to do a doctor Roy Spencer is the principal research scientist at the University of Alabama in Huntsville Dr Spencer thank you he's the author of

distinguished visiting followed the project for economic growth\nAnd the Heritage Foundation and the co author of fueling freedom exposing the man war on energy\nBefore we get to talking about the credit agencies you rent a reading rank and see if I Want to ask you something because those kinds of spit balling with my producers today so I said I'm going to the oil prices\nAre about thirty percent higher today than they were about a year ago\nSo I think it's around Seventy Seventy one bucks a barrel and they said yeah that's that's a lot higher and I said well when you have a booming economy we use more oil there's more demand or you're going to you and you know supplies the same are getting bigger or you're going to see the prices go up but I Would imagine what it would have been if we if we elected\nDon't drill anywhere Hillary instead of drill baby drill and all of the above Donald Trump I don't know that anybody could put a number of that but it's even wanted to ask you if you had to fall on on\nOn the because people forget about the dog that didn't bark and and again I'll probably get in trouble for making that reference in Clinton but but you know she'd been elected she said she was going to shut down all the drawings you possibly could and where would more my oil prices and gas prices natural gas prices have been if we intellect in her instead of Donald Trump\nFive hours and that's a great question because you know we've seen the oil price go from you know as you said like fifty dollars a barrel now up to eight dollars a barrel some people\nBut the thing I don't think this is true but it might go up to his eyes honored dollars a barrel which would be you know a lot you'd be talking about you know four dollars to four dollars and fifty cents a gallon gasoline at the up if the price went that high now the good news is that like that's a bad thing we don't want higher oil prices\nBecause it's like a tax on the American consumer are demanding that American manufacturing pick the good news says though as you just said luckily we are getting\nMore and more of our oil from home or you know a home sources from states like Texas and Oklahoma Alaska and West Virginia and places like that or less dependent on the middle east so it doesn't mean that this massive amount of money is leaving the United states\nBut it is a troubling thing and you know we saw the stock market crash today it went down by I think that that was out by eight hundred points I think that combination\nAllows 'cause I've been getting flooded with calls about what's happening here people are getting a little panic I think the combination of high oil prices which has a negative for the economy and I think that the fed\nRaising interest rates as it has is sparking a lot of investors and you know what I've been telling reporters and I want to say that your listeners idol I kind of side with Donald Trump he took a swipe at the fat\nOr this afternoon when the market close and said\nYou know why is that that taking the punch bowl away from the ... just when it's getting boring and look I'm I'm a hot when it comes to\nControlling inflation but other than high up prices you know you know other commodities food at that metal on metal or you know top top wheat\nSoybeans those prices are low not high so I find myself in agreement with Donald Trump maybe the fed has manufacturing this sell off in the stock market or for no good reason\nNow theoretically you're the economist not me but theoretically they're doing is to keep the economy from becoming overheated and\nPush up and let me stop you right oh about ... [laughter] you just get might\nGo with that because that's what all these you know a FedEx per se saying we don't want that kind of eat overeat\nWhat the hell does that mean they had made over ... you

wary of winning\nBears your economic lesson for today and it's an hour last a lot of these pools at the Federal Reserve bank and had a lot of these games and it kind of us don't understand when the economy is is cooking like it is now where you've got you know near full employment you got four percent growth you've got you know for jobs and people to fill them you got more and more production\nYou know that me as the economy is producing more goods and services\nNow my question ... says when you get an increase in the output of goods and services\nWhat happens is the price of things if it's a it's kind of a tradition while apples what happens is that faced apples to apples doesn't live it falls yup so I reject this notion I'm so glad you mentioned this concept of overeating 'cause it's a bogus cuts that\nYou know we at rates of eight percent under Reagan you end up with that why can't the economy got four or five percent\nWell and in China and India had some tremendous grocery does well exactly why we've got a moment do I do I did plan to ask you about this what you call the credit rating agency raccoon\nDescribed as for my listeners about how these government agencies have been ... you know putting the USDA approved stamp on a on a whole bunch of credits that really doesn't deserve that and and they helped create some of the problem right\nThis is one of the great scandals of the two thousand seven to two thousand eight a real estate you know a crisis which led to help out in the economy which was that that\nWe have these credit rating agencies the two big ones are Moody's and Standard Poor's and outliers I thought most until that day the you know the banks collapsed and the mortgage market collapsed these agencies that are supposed to rate the credit of the debt\nThey were ... basically giving AAA bond ratings to all of these mortgages that were worthless you we now know that they were just you know I'm you know practically worthless because people walking away from the homes and my point would be ... why are we still relying on these credit ratings\nAgencies that they still dominate percent of the market and they've got a terrible track record that related to that I'm not trying to scare people but did you know allow that to this day ten years after the crisis because the prices and exactly ten years ago virtually today of today\nI'm the I'm the federal government is continuing to provide one hundred percent tax payer guarantees on three and four percent down payment loads\nMay learn nothing from no back door and exactly what we're doing the poor and by the ...\nHey Steve let me I Want to make this personal I Am a producer who just bought a house and he was telling me gosh\nI said well you're having trouble getting the down payment together he says no way they engineered it and he has good credit and he's a decent job working for me if you can call that a decent job and he says one they've worked it out so we have to put one percent down but after the ... the purchases complete we actually get the one percent back\nAnd I said so effectively you're like well I agree I watch and yet\nI understand why when people find that in the marketplace they don't say that's crazy you know they say well that's great my son or daughter or brother or sister or whatever can buy a house and you say yes and they have almost no skipping the game which means if things turned south they can say well we don't have anything in this place let's just walk away from it which is part\nOf the way you know gets you know get screwed the taxpayer yes we we get on TV it's mortgages\nThat's why the banks snakes the mortgages even when they know that the person may not\nPay it back I mean it's just it is so and ... and and I do worry a lot about because if you got somebody put one or two or three percent down payment on the ... and ... and let's say this house falls and value but ... percent\nIt negative equity that means that they're better off just walking away from the old and that's what millions of people did and the taxpayers got old and you know got a stuck holding a bag of a trillion dollars
