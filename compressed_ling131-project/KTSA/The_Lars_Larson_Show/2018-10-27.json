three nine five to seven seven\nEmails go to talk of Lars Larson dot com you frequently hear politicians in the United states suggest that if we were only more like those European countries and then often they will mention Sweden\nAnd see if we could just be more like Sweden why America would be great now by that most American politicians are actually signaling if we could just be more socialist door have higher taxes\nOr how the government more involved in our lives now I think they're using it images Sweden that doesn't match reality so I've invited global economist in Kato Institute senior fellow and documentarian\nJohan Norbert on the program Mr Norbert thank you very much for joining us\nThank you for having me\nNow you've created a program a documentary through free to choose media and by the way I Love the fact that your company is named for a book or I Would imagine that that was written by Milton Friedman the great economists called Sweden lessons for America\nYou believe that there are some economics lessons in government lessons in Sweden's example of how we had reformed its own the economy and the way that it's government interacts with its population\nI'm positive I think that's definitely the case and it shouldn't be doing it but you know how images of\nOther countries or projects are systems that image\nLingers you have some things that you focused on at some point in time and the narrative was so strong low those slogans so powerful that you remember that but you forget what happened next or you didn't stay to\nThat that's exactly the case with American social it's when they talk about you know the Democratic socialist movement how we should be more like Sweden well if America\nWork to become more like sweet which we\nToday twenty Eighteen will then many regard as America would have to be more free markets more free trade opening up in a more\nSay this to competition um reforming Social Security and many school voucher system so\nPrivate schools get the same funding public ones and abolishing taxes on top of the wealth gifts inheritance that zone because those are some of the face that's we didn't have a do over the last twenty five years so it tells you something about how\nWe can trust than the ... we have to look at the facts on the ground\nAnd I think you're right that all of us do I think even the non politicians will say well I Know I Know St Louis I Know the archer I Know Paris that's the Eiffel Tower and drinking coffee and cafes and we have sort of a very a kindergarten level view of another country and then you attach whatever values you want to it\nWould you mind for my audience sketching out the terrible economic situation\nThe treating founded self in before these reforms began\nYeah yeah the reason that costs and why we did these reforms is that we did try what democratic socialism we had this experiment in the Nineteen seventies in Nineteen nineties and that they didn't turn out well for sweet and the ... that\nIn the late sixties sleeping was one of the richest country on the planet oddly because we had a long period of\nHaving an open economy big multinational companies with a high degree of engineering skills and innovation and that's ... ... ... a lower taxes Lovett European countries and that made us incredibly well\nAt that time Swedish politicians thought that we can do anything\nWell let's just do things that feel nice and distribute money\nOr to our favorite Cole sits and I'm just create a generous welfare stage and that's what they did in the nineties suddenly night lately the science of the government\nDouble or Texas or increase the government the government ... the economy and the lake markets\nBut the result was which is sort of happy and\nYou know I was in society and that they\nThat they intended it was more like\nIn an eye on ranch novel because\nOur big companies are great entrepreneurs us I'm even are sort of direct it's like in my third one sports star's light on board\nThey let sweet they stopped being productive in Sweden because the economy was suffocated was drowning in taxes and regulation or for that he is the sweeter economy they didn't create a single ... job in the private sector\nA whole new jobs were created in the public sector and in the end that made it impossible to fund the government of that size so it was a long period of general they are\nLagging behind other countries have any lower growth rates than the others that but it also and in a terrible financial crisis in the early Nineteen nineties when\nOther country didn't want to lend us money because it didn't seem like\nThey're going to survive for a long time so for for a brief period of time the central bank had drink and that day\nAnd interest rates at five hundred percent to defend the Swedish currency and the cat tiny eat will leave social as soon as we said no no we can't do this you have to dismantle this experiment before it's killed\nI'm speaking with Johan Norbert who is a global economist she's with the kid to Institute of senior ... he's also a free to Jews media which has created Sweden lessons for America\nAnd you demonstrate how Sweden managed to pull itself back from the brink from five hundred percent interest rates and become the fourth most prosperous nation in the world was it easy to persuade people to leave behind those previous policies and go for something that was more free markets and lower taxes\nWell it wasn't and uh you know people don't want to give up dates or that they get free or so that took\nMany years so I'm I'm discussing but what really changed the whole thing was was this crisis that\nThe that that little moment and uh you know it's like that old saying that the prospect of being hang in the morning which is ... you have to focus and concentrate on what's really important\nAnd for example or Social Security system and people wanted very generous and ... they had to be on this very generous pensions by politicians but at this time when the economy tanked\nAnd it seems like everything was going to collapse people realize that the old son and to to retool wall so generous pension built into it almost a collapse of the whole Social Security system\nAnd in that case a ... but a more secure and show or better so the Social Democrats out of the central light agreed that we are going to fold that system and introduce individual that counts as well um and\nYeah let's hope that that's not the case\nBecause he has said arable devastating crisis focuses mine's a but it's also credited painful and you should try to do\nAnything to to avoid that what I think most important things we was also that ended in something that a lot of America's telling me up they've seen a made up to ... is that they think that\nSweet and had a more adult conversation with voters than American politicians is actually this election and they said obvious during ... that's not the moment in time to have this laid out on the station at the moment of rhetoric and ... a week but\nIt's incredibly important just talk about these systems how they what what they did and um and whether they're sustainable knock 'em and I think many cultures and things that no they're not up to it they they we called have this discussion because people won't accept it\nI think that's a big mistake I think that it's the opposite I'm if people don't feel like they get the um the the attention from politicians the the adult conversation about the system they see like their ...\nIn the ... like ... during one election but afterwards they see like they'd be almost everything and they will just be disappointed and they will be ugly um and it's so important to look at things like Social Security system like the\nLong term debt situation in the country before\nIt spirals out of control it otherwise people will feel like there are completely deceived and uh and it's too late to shield them from the um the results of that kind of falling\nWhose documentary is called Sweden lessons for America is Johan Norbert was free to choose media so\nWhere's we hadn't had it at this point I mean for the most prosperous nation in the world it sounds as though things are going swimmingly all or old vote are you watching politicians say well now that things are going well maybe we can and loosen up the uh the constraints of that\nTrial when things aren't going well that's the moment when we should be because that's when you make mistakes that it's like the financial markets when everything's booming that's when you should be worried because that's when you make mistakes as well things that will not sustainable when there's a downtown\nUm and I think that's what's happening in the fleet and right now at age there's that risk a e you as the\nLast few years we had this discussion let's just spend a little bit more why wait so this trade or if he gets from God and that's dangerous we do a perhaps not the ... that he used to add definitely not the ones that are you with\nUs right now but we do have lots of debt so the the private sector for example and that's the case or perhaps we should think more about\nGiving people in households more of the financial space but it it using package solved and get on the same thing that sounds good into shorts on but that we come April when there is a downtown\nHave any of your European neighbors who are closer in proximity and can see the success that Sweden had by going on entirely different direction have any of them been notable in adopting some of the reforms that Sweden did\nWell sweetie was ahead of the pack because we also\nAre created more of a saucer than the others did when when ... when ... when Greece say that they want to be more like sweet they they're not like the song itself that was thinking about let's be like Sweden in the night in like in Seventy five\nStory of how the country's food and went from a very prosperous

P. get quip dot com slash Lars to your calls now in his First Amendment friday night let's go first to Don hey John welcome to the program what's on your mind tonight\nHi hey I take thanks for taking my call I just had a question if the bomber and had a motive\nI don't know if he did or not I mean from the outside you could say well he was motivated to try to attack those people who are on the left who have been opposing Donald Trump's policies or you could say he just wanted to get a lot of attention\nHe's a guy who drove around in a white van that was covered on the outside with political stickers and position statements and Donald Trump's picture and I guess depending on the neighborhood you were in in Florida that might attract a lot of negative attention are a lot of positive a jet engine but\nDid he want a lot of attention sure seems like he got it and I figure anybody who rolls around in a moving you know a ... a big bumper stickers probably some attention so\nYou and if he was trying to help Donald Trump this was not the way to do it if he was trying to help his fellow that was another way to do it\n[laughter] okay I I Know now that is Maxine Waters I mean you know cast she began considered a lack of ... I mean telling people to kick people out of the restaurants and stuff I mean\nI think that I think Maxine Waters had done many things over many years before she even did that uh the work that I considered wacko\nAnd I said show but telling apple folks your your political friends and allies to go out and harassed people in public simply because you disagree with them that is wacky it and if a Republican does it I Will say the same thing\nThe funny thing is the Don I've had a few people called the show and say we should go out and have a rally and we should get in their faces and we should carry signs and should pick at somebody's house or their office and I said\nThat has never been the way the conservatives have behaved so you're asking for something that goes way outside of our usual behavior I mean\nMost of the Tea Party a protest ones that I went to and ones that I saw in other cities and in D.C on television\nThey were incredibly civilized event whereas you look at the average left wing event a good example of January of twenty Seventeen after Donald Trump's inauguration the crazy women's march ... you know the fact is\nThere's nothing wrong with women saying we want to be treated equally inequitable yeah okay it's already in the law is that what would you like and we'd like to burn some limousines we'd like to stage a protest in which people have their safety threatened and that causes a lot of trouble and gets us on TV I think that's what's crazy\n[noise] the last ... Madonna telling telling us illicit look Trump and that's not what\nShe is often fantasize dreamed of blowing up the White House that's when Madonna said and that is wacko as well and yet you know\nThat if a Republican had said this very same words in the very same tone of voice CNN would be running it in a video loop but if Madonna says it they say look what a strong powerful feminist she there's ... there's a really strong double standard\nAnd done I I Love journalism I'd been in a long time and I love the craft I was in it as a reporter without my opinion uh being being shown in my stories and as a talk show host I give my opinions every day\nI Am proud of journalism but I'm not proud of what journalism has become because we have people who are supposed to be reporters and keep their opinions out who are inserting their opinions I worked my tail off\nAnd the proof that I think I kept my opinions out of my stories\nIs that when I went from being a reporter on both television or radio to being a talk show host there were folks I'd run into both strangers in people I knew who say\nYou're a conservative and I said yeah I'm a conservative is well I never knew that and I said what did you think I was a wife you worked on television I thought you were a liberal and I said well clearly I kept my opinion out of my reporting which is what reporters are supposed to do the other thing that's dangerous to the entire profession\nIs if you tell people when we cover stories were going to cover them in a double standard\nAt ... in other words if one group of people says something or does something we're going to tell this kind of story but if somebody else from the other side does precisely the same thing or something so similar that is nearly identical we're going to treat the story entirely differently\nI mean constantly I look up at these two screens in my studio one was Fox on it one was CNN on a big big screen TVs\nAnd I and I look at them and I see them saying with no proof Donald Trump says X or y or Z\nAnd I thought during the entire eight years of Obama I never once saw them say with no proof whatsoever Brock Obama today claimed to blah blah blah and I thought the but there ... there were plenty of times I mean when when ... when when ... was asked do you know that the IRS\n... has been going out and denying\nA conservative groups free speech rights by denying their applications for tax free status all he had no clue and he said oh the first I knew about it was when I saw it on the news and I thought\nThat at a bold faced lie you can't make us you can't tell us on one hand you're a Harvard educated lawyer and your ... according to your fans one of the smartest guys on the planet and then turn around and say\nNo I was completely clueless as ... and I made the point of the time the president of the United states\nShould be arguably one of the best in foreign people on the planet he has platoon of people around him from all these different agencies whose entire job is to gather every important piece of data in the world even stuff that that seat grade and then to boil it down\nOf being that that's also hope Eighteen thousand people have to figure it so it was not what it painfully ... because he only had two thousand people show up\nAt a self the Democrats cannot cannot produce the quantity of people and all of those people can vote and something that somebody emailed me today and I looked into it is twenty percent of the people identify that\nNo one knew her adult I got to tell you I think to some of these reporters who have that reaction that you've got of oh this is just a free event like you were invited to a free movie or a free concert you know and we've seen those used by politicians but here's the difference\nI've been to events like that both as a reporter\nAnd as a as just a regular attendee and there was a big difference if you're a reporter you show up at about the time you need to go to the event uncovered and then you leave and you know it's not like you get VIP treatment but you to some extent do if you're a regular citizen\nWho says I'm going to go to that Trump event you realize that with Secret Service and security and everything else\nYou may have to show up to three hours early then you get screened through you go into the venue I don't know the exact to a ... times in Houston and then you sit in the arena and you may be there for a while having been screened in before the event even begins then the event goes for a period of time and to some extent it's impractical to leave\nThen when it finally you know when you finally do leave it may be a long time home I wouldn't be surprised if some people who went to these events where you're Eighteen twenty thousand people are are probably occupied for seven and eight hours to be able to get\nYou know this period of time watching the president and you're and you're still only watching them from a distance so it's not like people because it's free are saying well gee this or this is not without effort it takes a lot of effort\nYou know where you say in it on an evening where to find somebody to take care of the kids the kids can come we're going to go to those then we're going to be gone for five six seven hours until it's over and all of that to get that slice of time seeing Donald Trump in in ... I I think your reporter friend who said\nOh it's just a free event like somebody said hey they're showing a free movie at the theater well let's go watch it's not the same thing it's it's much more of a time and effort commitment\nTo organic spring kinda picking on a license to own areas lousy huge crowds\nOutside and go outside it's become like his own party with the food trucks and all that Donald Trump's like if people selling they literally sell these little basket when they call them back to the floor or lifestyles you know all of Donald Trump's tweet tweet says well that's a homemade\nAnd it is a a ... and ... you know it is huge now they have that awful powerful people outside somebody told me that any wealth ferry Pennsylvania valley ally that they had\nA two thousand people outside so it is a it is a lot of uh energy and lots of people that just want to be part of this little nest and I loved that the media to Mississippi but they're all costs\nBoth they all talk about it among a there along with the people I talked to my story and it it can make a she referred to the Trump rally as a conservative state they you know that you have the\nKnowledge that they can't take their trigger warnings or whatever she said that it's so good that she can't talk about her support for Trump took my neighbors are so schools are at places she kept people killed her and she just she thought it was so exciting so many people who feel the same way she got\n... and she's ... she ... she said she cares that much that he goes and\nSo on I I don't know it's something new in American politics or the national media in New York and Washington he will not covered they dismissed it as a you know in any way they can\nAnd if you know it's a Republican whole house it will be because of this ... and ... and and the loss of\nCoverage of it it might have I think you know Donald Trump or Republicans secret weapon\nYou're kind of phenomena that really deserves national
