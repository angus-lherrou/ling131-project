E. I. economic perspective about where we stand today and what it actually means a stand welcome to the program thanks for the time\nI learned how you doing I'm ... I'm doing great I mean people might take large mechanized paycheck yes I Do and I've never been unemployed in my life I I worked hard to make sure I'm never unemployed\nBut when I see my fellow Americans having the greatest opportunity to see if I'm told me if I'm wrong about this I'll be happy to be corrected the greatest Employment Opportunity in American history more jobs more companies more new businesses black owned businesses\nAre have gone to the new businesses have gone up for a hundred percent in the last Eighteen months Eighteen months\nAnd they're up for a hundred percent this is a tremendous time of opportunity\nIsn't it [noise] yeah I think it mostly right to the unemployment rate is very low as you as you just said lowest in Nineteen sixty nine of court in Nineteen sixty nine down hundreds of thousands of men fighting a Vietnam to that but how do you think that the unemployment rate low back then so you know it's even more if ... if you think of it that way\n[noise] um I you know the only the only I think too small negative spots one is that you know wages still aren't growing the way\nI'd like to be growing and the other thing is that there are still a bunch of people nodded labor force that you know that it would be nice if they if they were brought back in ... so the people\nWho are looking for work so they you know they gave out looking for work at some point during the during the recovery uh and they they still aren't back but otherwise I I agree basically good news across the board\nWell you've just suggested my next policy choice if I was king but I'm not hanging America doesn't have a king I'd love to see some of the social programs especially those that are being used by people of working age so let me make sure I'm Paul I'm qualified this right\nPeople of working age so let's say Eighteen to fifty five ah people who are able bodied a son to mind sound the body and ... and especially those people who have no children at home either because they're young and they don't have any kids yet or they're older and they\nDon't have any kids living at home with them\nThose people could be given a little you know boot in the bud couldn't they just say hey get back into the labor force and an environment like this you've got employers hungry to hire you and probably a lot more willing to train you if you need some training\nAnd once you get into even if it's a starter job that was not like the one you had no six or seven or you may find that the opportunities for moving up are there because if there's high unemployment you know for both started jobs and other jobs\nThen once you get into that job and you say your boss boss I don't want to stay in this job forever can I Move up unless you're close to retirement age\nMost employers are happy to say let's figure out some ways for you to learn you know more about the job so you can move from that position to positions that are higher and consequently higher pay checks and once we soaked up all the access out there\nAnd if we have a sensible immigration policy we should be able to see wages go up shouldn't\n[noise] yeah I think that's right so there's ... there's there's three favorites I think if people that we that we should think about one is people with a criminal record you know employers have often been worried to hire those areas as tens of millions of of of Americans with federal records as a\nBunch of those I think have struggled to find work those are slowly I think being brought it back into\nThe labor force than there are people who've been unemployed for a long period of time that still over a million people some people have been unemployed for more than half a year hopefully those boats cannot find jobs\nAnd then there's the last group but I think that's the great where where the social that Stanley play more aggressive people having to look out at the labor force or for a for quite a while a decade ago about a million people you know I Will get bring all those people back and then I think the labor market choice it really is\nBetter than it's been in the last fifty years ah you know I think right now that the late nineties still look pretty good you know that had higher labor force station so not only the unemployment rate low but they were always try to find work we can get back to that that I'll be fully satisfies\nYeah we'll stand the limited thrown idea ... I was down in Dallas texas couple years ago to two new broadcast one of our stations\nAnd I saw a company that was advertising its services construction company but I think they called themselves con structure and they had a clever name and and on the rest of the banner they had on the side of the building it made it clear they would hire\nEx cons they would hire people with criminal records and why\nWell because you know while there may be some additional steps you have to take to make sure that if you hire somebody with a criminal record that your tools aren't going to disappear but once you've uh you know I've talked to plenty of callers to my show who said I have a crime a felony record and I tell all my employers when I first go to work for him or when I first interview I\nHave this record I'm beyond id I've I've I've corrupted my behavior\nAnd I'm going to be a great employee for you and instead we have\nGovernment's trying to ban you know even asking about criminal record I almost wish we could encourage people if you're going to go straight and you're going to straighten out your behavior then\nWe're we're happy to have you tell us that so as an employer you can take advantage of the skills that come with that person who may be a very good worker\nWho wants to get past that but I don't want the government doing and I want a private employer and maybe somebody who says I'm going to start a construction company and I'm going to hire these people and I'm going to put 'em to work and I'm going to expect performance and I'm an expected they don't go back to criminal behavior but other than that I'll pay him a good wage\nBecause then you've got access to a a whole crowd of people who may not be be accessed right now by conventional employers who just screen you out of the beginning does that make sense\nThat makes total sense of we we've started to see a little bit of that so for example Wal Mart which of course is that you know the the largest employer of them\nAll get million and a habit believes in the U.S that they've started you know trying to target a or\nReject federal records a little more in their recruiting efforts and you know hopefully it'll work out\nSo where can we go from here how low can go before the wages just start rising because employers find they can't get anybody to work for them because they don't ... you know bumped the wages up\nWell I I think first of all we'll we'll see if we can absorb those additional maybe two three million people once that happens I I think you start to the wage growth as long as you know of course the economy has to keep growing right so if we\nIf we suddenly at our recession we wouldn't see it but you know given all the fiscal stimulus we've had\nFrom the from the tax got in front of the\nWay out of the increase in spending I think of the next couple of years we should we should really start to see some wage growth at least in the long run you know wages only keep increasing if we you know we developed new technology that build new factories and better equipment or things like that so\nOf energy transportation and you're right it's a huge potential risk um because if these pipelines are turned off correctly they will have the pressure situation they will explode whether the women's said she knew that was a potential but she's still thought it was worth the risk\nAnd they're even if they don't cause environmental damage or oil spills but this can be tremendously expensive because turning off of valve is not like turning off the ... to your neighborhood or your house is outside ... and it's not like flipping off the lights which where you can just flip it back on its going to cost money\nTo be able to fix this problem and and and and the money those cars are all going to get passed along to consumers\nExactly and and I'm Glad you called them what they are which is ego terrorists a lot of his group has been put on the domestic terrorist watch lists of some of them back to the brought back memories of the late eighties and nineties\nOn earth first um and uh out the er an elf the earth Liberation Front an animal Liberation Front or put on the watch list as domestic terrorists a little story that got no attention just loves to go in August a guy named Joseph da da da da\nDa da and Nineteen Ninety seven\nShe had been hiding out and it was just out of that in five was apprehended and it was a return to the American authorities to stand trial for the damage he did in five different states\nUh he is he's a domestic terrorist and I'm I'm surprised she actually did something noble the Cuban government and turn them back over to the Americans were prosecution well I Know this is the type of\nYeah I'm Sorry I Know this goes back a couple of decades but some of these terrorist groups would go in and burn ski resorts uh because they don't even want people's skin on mountains they they would also do suddenly goes very personally dangerous to end the individual Americans they go out to first they put metal spikes in trees\nSo far and then later ceramics bikes it could not be detected by metal detector and that means that an ordinary logger usually\nA man with a train saw comes along is told to cut down these trees and we're going to harvest them and turn them into furniture and lumber a and houses and things like that\nAnd he's not cutting and all of a sudden here's one of these spikes the chain comes off\nAnd can whip around and and kill him or her human seriously so these are terrorists that are actually willing to put human lives at risk on a very individual level they are not ones who\nJust only go out and and affect oil tankers are I Know I Know they blocked oil rigs from coming in and out of Seattle in and out of Portland you know when they're coming in for repairs but they'll actually go out and effectively a salt and perhaps kill an individual working citizen to try to advance their cause\nExactly and my group power the future has been monitoring and exposing the eco terrorist and the green movement as a whole ah since its inception that's why it was started and that's biking practice you talked about was very common in the nineties especially in your area and the and the Pacific northwest in Oregon\nIn particular and and it did cause tremendous human harm a and you have to ask how this is unacceptable practice I don't want to tie everything even back to Brett Kavanaugh but but someone was arrested for outings senators addresses and phone number is what they called boxing yes they are going to vote for Kavanaugh\nThese practices that the environmental movement has been practicing for decades\nThat now we see in other forms of activism and America's rich in democracy I Love the freedom to petition and the freedom to protest\nBut when you put other people's lives at risk you cross the line and those people need to be held accountable I'm Glad they arrested that punk kid and these ethical terrorists they need to be arrested two crimes they commit not and I hope this case is not thrown out\nDaniel last issue to talk about is whether or not the courts are likely to accept the argument that when these people come to trial that they get to use the trial as a basically a soap box to announce their their views on these environmental things by advancing them as a defense in court which does two\nThings there's the potential for the court or the jury\nTo accept that they did a little bit of damage to avoid the greater damage to planet earth and the second danger\nIs that when they do this even if they lose the case and they get convicted and they have to pay a fine or perhaps even spend a little bit of\nTime in custody probably very little keep up the good war could power the future genuine thanks for their time ... thank you bye Daniel Turner was back in just moment eight six six four three nine five to seven seven females go to

David welcome to the program what's on your mind\nHey thanks Lars or what's on my mind as I dislike a cabin for many reasons that there there are many reasons like the American bar association this\nOld there are there are certainly is of them are actually not true but you go ahead\nJust ... uh as as declared that is not a\nLot of the uh the judicial temperament uh that the Catholic Church has a fold their uh their uh\nApproval of the uh Jesuits who taught in a have now pulled their uh their ... and you can read it and um they're they\nHave it instead of reading off the list of all the people who have been ... and all the people who haven't tell me why you don't think he's qualified to be a Supreme Court justice because that's what I Want to know is why you don't think so\nThe same reason that they won't ... judicious temperament uh is is not a ... acceptable for Supreme Court justice is\nThe can I ask you ... question on that I watched his original testimony before the committee\nI also watch ... testimony when he came and the answer that ... what we now and now we're ... charges against him that are absolutely not true and they are ... charge us I mean there there are the kinds of charges that any man or woman\nWould be very angry to have made against them I put myself in his shoes and thing if somebody accused me of sexually molesting trying to rape and possibly kill somebody\nAnd I knew I didn't do it I Know I Would react very strongly to that did you also watch his testimony for the thirty hours he spent in front of the Senate Judiciary committee answering questions about what kinds of judge you would be or did you not see that\nIdea and uh the real question is that is a is breakdown of uh the Clintons are against the left\n... you're talking about the day he was answering the Christine for charges I'm Talking about the testimony he did the previous week he spent thirty hours in front of the committee like a like a really long job interview answering all their questions about his judicial philosophy did you even see that\nI did and the thing that really bothered me was that ... didn't answer the questions about well he didn't answer hardly any questions but uh\nWhat can I tell you why that might be true\nAnd it might change your mind maybe\nIf you go to if you go to any judge anywhere in America\nAnd you say judge I really hate drunk drivers one of them killed my mom so I have a reason personally to hate drunk drivers if you get a drunk driver in front of him are you going to be in front of you are you going to throw the bucket him that judge if he or she is responsible judge will say I'm not going to tell you ahead of you know not ... recuse\nThey're not going to prejudge a case\nSo for instance if you ever saw a judge publicly come out and say every time there's an issue of land rights which comes up in court frequently around America I'm always going to decide on behalf\nOf the landowner instead of the local government that may say they want to do something with the land if you say every time ... comes in front of me involving a worker who says he's been injured on the job I'm going to decide in favor of the worker that judge should be off the bench and here's why and this is what judges have told me\nJudges should never take a position that ... a kind of case so for example when you have ... which almost all them in this case from the Democratic party who say your honor\nYou take that roe versus Wade does establish law and you're not going to challenge it\nWell the thing is that is a pre judging a case that may come before the court\nIf you say your honor ... ... if if a man who's suing the corporation you worked for will you side with the worker or the corporation\nHe should immediately refused and say I won't answer that because the minute you prejudged case you're not a good judge anymore now almost all the things that the Democrats asked judge Cavanaugh about what questions like that saying tell us promises\nThat you won't overturn roe the way and they didn't send those turns but they were trying to get him to take positions on things that almost guaranteed will come before the Supreme Court at some point the next thirty or forty years\nAnd they wanted him to announce ... ahead of time that he would take a position on cases that he hasn't even heard yet\nNow we don't want ... just like that and I've just explained why does that explain why he had to give ... answers to most of those questions because ... know judge\nShould take a position on a case ahead of time not even your local judges in your town or county should take a position ahead of time now does that make sense to\nOh yes your ear ... that uh I have been a master ...\n[laughter] yes I bet you are that are ... the the question is why are all those look close and ah\nI can tell you why there's one word ... secret word answers your question the word is abortion\nLost it totally ah during that that uh that session giving his testimony and so that that is why people say he does not have the ...\nHold on and have it daily pay somebody ... against us do of trying to rape a woman if somebody falsely accused you that would you have the kind of mild tone of voice there you have with me right now when you got dragged out in front of national television cameras and told\nProve to us that you didn't try to rape that girl thirty six years ago so you've got an accusation that if people take it seriously and decide that you did this a third of a century ago\nYour career goes away

tomorrow it's going to happen at some point during Saturday I I don't know if honestly if it's in the morning of the afternoon I\nI Believe it's in the late morning early afternoon because they said there will be able to keep that session open for about one day for twenty four hours once Mitch McConnell announced last night\nThat there was going to be a final vote they apparently locked that vote time and date in and I think that's a sensible idea if you say we're going to have a final vote that nobody can say well I wasn't notified or I didn't know when it was going to be or you moved the date\nApparently to change the date or the time from tomorrow or to any other data or time requires a vote of one hundred senators who has all the senators so the Dayton time cannot be changed today they had the uh the cloture vote\nWhich went fairly one to forty nine and ... the simplest explanation of a cloture vote is you'd say vote on whether or not to take the final vote and and debate\nAnd so they they took that voted one fifty one forty nine and most of the people who watch Capitol Hill very closely say that a final vote is likely to be the same as are almost identical may be off by one as the cloture vote so there's that then you had people who have counted is sass\nGonna senator Sasse going to vote for him he's announced she will uh will Murkowski she announced she won\nIt Susan Collins as Susan Collins announced that she will vote for him and so did Jeff Flake from Arizona so counting all those noses up what you get is a fifty one to\nForty nine vote now the senator
