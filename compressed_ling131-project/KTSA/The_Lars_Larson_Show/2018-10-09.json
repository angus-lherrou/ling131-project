went vote by mail I actually thought well it's not a bad idea make it a little bit more convenient for people uh and you'll get a ballot in the mail if you're registered to vote\nSince then I've seen how it actually works and I think it is a system fraught with opportunities for fraud\nWell now we have early voting going on for the midterm elections in the majority of states two thirds of the stage thirty seven of them and Washington DC will allow early voting in other words someone who really doesn't have a any kind of decided reason for having an early ballot\nWill get one if they're requested and now there are three states Colorado Washington and Oregon that have gone to full early voting by mail in ballots to all registered voters and they've added to that and it leads to Oregon Washington automatic registration if you have a ...\nA photo ID card you will be registered to vote even at the age of sixteen now you can't cast a ballot till you're Eighteen but that's how far they've tried to open it up so that everyone can participate ultimately on paper not necessarily a bad idea but in practice it\nCan be terrible a dome al ... is a national political reporter for real clear politics or don't welcome to the program thanks for having me he was all these early voting going to have the potential to change the outcome of the election that it would be different if it was held with the polling with a vote at the polling places on election day\nSo what they're finding is that a so there's a the data it's kind of coming in as we speak really in each election cycle Seventy two thousand for those who don't remember there was a very close presidential election and they were all those hanging chads and Florida and we had a massive revamp of our voting systems and one of the\nThings that start they assured and was early voting and so at first there was a a big discussion that it was going to help union voters because they were going to be more organized than getting early ballots but as we've had it basically really kicked\nIn oh wait a a an elite twelve is sixteen and what we're seeing is that the people who vote earlier are parts as they were very motivated partisan tend to be older voters and the reason is is that if you don't need to hear the debates in October or you don't need to see what newspapers\nIn stores you don't need to see who endorses\nAnyone and ah you can decide in you know many weeks before the election you're going to be part of the you're going to vote straight download\nA on the ballot in general and you're a ... and so it's part of the people and so it's a little like real real ranging furniture to ... to some extent those motivated part of the voters they were if they're going to vote October first\nThey were going to vote on election day and uh it's that people do not believe it's really changing the outcome however\nAnd I'll watch in the ... and the all male ballot states the three you mentioned Washington Oregon Colorado they are seeing an increase in local elections so local elections are a ... as the news media changes ... you know there's fewer news\nFewer reporters uh they're finding a lot fewer stories on local news it's harder for people to know when there's local elections\nAnd what the issues are and so on the local elections as a down ballot races are getting a they are seeing a an increase in\nA that based on some of the ... some of the mail in ballot states or when I was quite a few states now have these\nEarly voting like kiosks in one county or what a place you can physically go and vote early ah which is different than a paper ballot and so and their habits so showing that those are increasing and does have a quite a steady slow about a week to ten days before so people do watch a little more they\nJust make up their mind and they noticed that they are right there and they they go in and vote early ah and but some of the things they are discovering are quite amusing which one is that millennials are are dropping off dramatically they don't participate so much in early voting because they're too many steps\nYou have to Austin apply to get an application to get the ballot you have to fill it out you have to sometimes you know things like their Social Security number or have you put down your\nYour proper dress and then you have to find a stamp and an envelope at a mailbox and these are steps that you know millennials just really really can sue\nNow do you believe that I'm Wondering what the result has been with millennials in states like especially Oregon I mean I happen to my broadcast studios there but one of the disturbing things I've seen is that they have automatic registration too often I I hear from parents who say my sixteen year old daughter is registered to vote\nAnd I said yeah she can't vote till she's Eighteen but they do it automatically when you get a driver's license when you make it that easy where\nThe ... you get government id or whether it's a driver's license or an ID card you're registered you get a ballot then once you turn Eighteen good comes in the mail whether you ask for it or not and all you have to do is pick it up open it up market put it back in the envelope and send it back\nWhen they make that easy do millennials still drop off or do they vote in greater numbers\nI that I I'm not sure they have the data yet on things like that we really are in the beginning stages of a new experiment and\nUh but I I Will speak hours I don't know if you realize this but I was a county chair at one point and I was very well versed on how you register voters and how you uh get people on the ballot and things like that but uh uh I think when you drop a\nA ID and I'm a registered in a in a location where you are permanent residents\nYou get voter fraud yeah I mean you're going to have ballot nailed the people who don't live there who at one point live there and so there is no way to verify who that person is trying to break where you have voter id you go in on election day and they see your driver's license and they see your\nUh and they match it up on a some kind of voter roll and that does a a provide us security level to ensure that the people who say they say are voting or actually Bodie\nAnd uh I I Do think as we I after this election and we're still trying to figure out some of the cyber security issues to secure our voting system I Do think we are going to go again back at this issue of us who is voting and a while we secure\nOur father just today the LA Times broke a story saying that the DMV in the department of motor vehicles in California has admitted there were twenty three thousand registration mistakes including a Canadian citizen\nWho got notified he's lived in California but he was notified he was newly registered to vote he does have a California driver's license but he's not a citizen of the United states citizen to Canada according to the LA Times and he said I Know I'm not going to vote I'm not allowed to vote\nBut that won't necessarily apply to everyone if you've been living in California for Thirty years in Europe for national and somebody sends you a notice saves says you could vote I imagine some people will simply take the opportunity even though I'm doing good he was committing a crime\nThey apparently have tens of thousands of these kinds of mistakes just in the state of California where they do have automatic ... districts\nAnd where they are giving drivers' licenses to both legal and illegal aliens\nAnd eight so I Can't give you another ... at age Thirteen land or air uh like Bloomberg was uh actively search or he\nCause either withdrawal by capping are withdrawn by the president then they say well we'll drop a second bomb except their second grenade was more of a dud than the first one in the third one was even crazier and then you had this process we demand an FBI investigation and they got it\nAnd then when they got it the liberals said well it doesn't have what we want it in it so now we said this is invalid you are going to have to put it on some more that whole mess I Want to know what I thought of that being the son of Antonin Scalia\nFirst of all my dad never had to go through anything like that he was confirms Ninety eight zero in Nineteen eighty six everybody knew he was a conservative judge but he got through unanimously but where we are now ... where here where we are now because\nEspecially the last expects judges to be to the court kind of moral arbiters not just the judges they ... they're not supposed to just make judgment they're supposed to impose their will and that will is always supposed to be\nThe Democratic majority that's in other words they want judges to act more like legislators conservatives always ... uh say that we need to be careful about judges legislating from the bench we know that so often it's become a cliche but it's it's an important thing for us to stay in a metal what it means that because it\nIt gets to a separation of powers and\nWe confirmation hearings are as as vitriolic an aggressive and nasty as they are\nBecause the ... the Supreme Court as kind of a super legislature uh conservatives don't really want it to get that way it's not that we don't think Supreme Court justices will ever make important decisions or the um all their\nDecisions will be uncontroversial but we see a more limited role for them but as\n... as the justices have become more and more like legislators it's no surprise that\nUm the confirmation hearings become more and more like many elections complete with protests and senators asking questions like why do you think of this policy and what do you think of that policy and what we do to protect it uh so they become much more like\nElected representatives but of course they're not they they're not elected and they serve lifetime terms so little wonder if people are as wound up about it\nTold me this do you think there's any way to get back to what happened in your dad's day or even go back to Ruth Bader Ginsburg you know she had come from an ACLU background you had to know the conservative didn't like\nHer political background but they looked her and said okay you're you're qualified and she got nearly as as good a margin is you're dead not quite perfect like your dad but we're very close to that\nIs there any way for America to get back to that where we simply say judges are qualified not that\nThey are your favorite cup of tea politically\nI Do not know it it always feels like the Democrats are more aggressive about these things that the Republicans are and they say and like when you pick somebody more like Gorsuch but you know as if Gorsuch was a bleak it wasn't they want us to filibuster ... too so\nI you know my dad used to argue that if judges went back to\nWhat they originally supposed to do if they were originalists um that was kind of you a lot of the debate\nAnd I think that's true but the fact is that the left doesn't want originalists so I don't know if we're ever going to be able to convince them to do it maybe if the next justice\nIs the next nominee is replaced somebody from the light it will be less controversial but its Ginsburg for example if Trump nominated Ginsburg's a replacement or ... or anybody on the left I mean that's going to be that's going to be insane\nI Can't wait it out yeah that I Can't wait having a Kavanaugh was\nBad enough the place and Kennedy they just Kennedy was a moderate but if it's a Trump picks somebody from the left replacement it's gonna be no holds barred\nWell do you think though that they realize I mean I think the Democrats are actually did a lot of damage themselves because the the general public even if you're a tried and true democratic voter had to look at this and think those same kind of accusations could be made against any man and frankly these days any woman or and the accusation could come from a man or woman\nThese days no matter what gender the person being accused Chris congratulations on the success of Scalia speaks the

the largest national security grassroots organization in the country and the New York times best selling author of a new book called rise regime it's good to have you back on the program thanks for taking off on\nTheir own delighted to be back with you I Want to know what you think of of what happened last week an over the last couple of which ending with the vote to confirm judge Brett Kavanaugh as the latest member of the Supreme Court on Saturday\nWell America as we know it is being transformed before our very eyes and what we saw in the last two weeks I was basically a wakeup call for conservatives will love this country because the left\nHas declared the war on the United states on every\nFlag waving national anthem saluting veteran respecting police honoring founding fathers cherishing patriotic American the conservative side did not realize that we are at war until the last two weeks and I believe last\nThis upcoming election America's future is on the ballot people are going to vote for in America where you are guilty until proven innocent or in America where you are innocent until proven guilty\nRegime I Do think that Republicans have the guts to make that argument because you want to make the argument easily that this really is about whether or not the presumption is there and if not what does it mean\nBut I think I get the feeling that while the left seemingly will do almost anything to win\nThat there are a lot of conservatives who are afraid\nTo say something now we've had pleasant surprises from people like Susan Collins and Lindsey Graham who was a riot are but the rest of the Republicans have the right to have the you know the the backbone to say this is what we're up against and do you want that kind of America were the kind we offer\nWell and this question has a two layer to answer on the political side of the elected officials I think after watching Lindsey Graham become a rock star overnight I think what what he did last week\nMade him to start at the met met it defined him so he's political career and I think that I really I think you know what if you develop a backbone if you speak passionately it will resonate with the people because well Lindsey Graham dead is he echoed the voice of president Donald Trump for the last two years\nStray where right now is the time for you to build your fence with Paco Spence

Day although in a lot of cities\nNot even celebrating Columbus Day anymore they call it indigenous people's day as though Columbus in his arrival ah in this hemisphere is such an affront that we have to say we will no longer celebrate Columbus Day we will instead celebrate\nA day in honor of those people who I guess the liberal logic goes were wronged by the arrival of European Americans which makes all of us I'm sure Peter Raw feels just as guilty about being a European American as I Do how are you Peter\nMay I may [laughter] and go to the head of alive [laughter] yeah you\n... you know I I I I think I think that legalized product in Colorado is being circulated more widely than I had\nOnce believed because you really have to be smoking some of it to buy into this nonsense but that but the whole idea\nIn indigenous people's day it is one more attack on the bedrock traditions values and foundations of the west during this\nPolitical and economic tradition that has produced the highest living standards the greatest levels of personal intellectual and religious liberty known to man kind the\nClosest thing to a quality between men and women\nAnd has people living now routinely in to their ninth and tenth decades\nAnd this is what these lunatics all want to throw out the window I'm In the name of political correctness\nKnown as funny Peter I've thought about this that people say well we have to honor the indigenous people who have no problem saying you know the Native Americans are part of America's incredible landscape of people who mostly came from somewhere else but they also came from somewhere else they'd just arrived here first\nIf I went into any kind of political discussion\nPeter and said to the opponents well we got here first no matter which we were talking about we age wise we income wise we you know if you arrive in a place for you say we have greater rights than you do\nBecause we got here Twenty years ago or fifty years ago in the case of the indigenous peoples they arrived here nine or ten thousand years ago while you arrive first so therefore your rights supersede everyone else the unique idea and America was no we're all equal\nIf you came here on the boat and arrive Fifteen minutes ago your rights on American soil are equal to the guy who can say a I've got twenty ... generations of my family lived in America you don't have any greater lights\nAt least you are entitled to that presumption you know if you will why ... ... people came here\nAnd we can't forget that some people came here without their consent they were brought here as property does try to people that was true and we can't get that and we can't forget that nonetheless they may contributions\nThat we have to acknowledge it on it but people can hear for political liberty for religious liberty for 'em to pursue commercial success and in more than one\nCase because they needed to get out of out of wherever they were from and they needed some place where they could just start over under a new name and no one would ask the questions\nYeah but we have we have kids at continuous cycle of this um\nYou know it it it it you know and the Spanish what the certain parts of North America and the French went to a certain parts of the and the English and the Dutch went to a certain parts of the ... and then we had you know various and sundry wars and\nSome people stopped coming and some people ... and some people laugh and then it pretty much we had\nYou know there's this geographic area for 'em up that became known as the Thirteen colonies and then ... Thirteen original states at the United states of America\nAnd then we had more people from England and then we had lots of Germans and then we had lots of Irish and then we had lots of eastern Europeans that we have lots of southern Europeans and he had lots of Jews come over mixed in with that and he had Muslims come other mixed in with that and when everybody got here\nYes they did it hit everybody goes through some level of ...\nYeah ... all of them but just\nSo all show everybody had the opportunity to issue an\nExcel and and and achieve\nGreatness and you know now we have immigrants coming from the U.S across the other ocean and they're coming from they're coming from from Asia they're coming from southwest Asia\nUm they helped build the Internet they helped us still home computer they invented the u._s. be they revolutionized the way that it could be in a case and engage in commerce and living standards are going up and up and up and up and I say hallelujah a mad\nThank you very much thank you very much yet that you or somebody who is in your blood lineage had the courage to pack up if they can voluntarily pack up whatever they could carry\nIt on a boat come across the ocean to a place where they they move very few people to try and build something better because that at the courage on their part they my life so much better thank you very much\nPeter officer Newsweek contributing editor so why don't we see more politicians willing to stand up and say we do not have to dishonor\nChristopher Columbus and erase him from history and race in from the public square literally a New York city at Columbus Circle to be able to honor other people who came here why aren't there why aren't very many proponents at all of continuing to honor this man\nBecause I think that a lot of discussion about immigration has evolved around the problems that occur when people come here\nWithout going through channels\nUm without 'em and and they if they come here underground they become a sub culture and they she used to assimilate and that's one of the important things about the American immigration experience\nIs that up until about the Nineteen seventies we held out the idea that the simulation was was was it was was the goal was the melting pot yep um and that it didn't matter that you spoke\nItalian or um Chinese or or do or um you know the language of the lap landers at home\nThat when you went out and engage the public square you spoke English was common language of our American civilization and a lot of salt together and then at some point people figured out gee if we can keep ethnic groups Balkan iced by language and by country of origin\nOh probably probably probably yeah\nSure I mean for example one of the three biggest religions on planet earth you have to ... you have Christianity and Judaism Judaism is actually relatively small in number of people are but you have Buddhist you have towers of Hindus\nUm Islam is based on religion founded by a guy who took a wife not his first wife but one of his first wives\nOr was six years old and he concentrated or that relationship when they were not you think that we should reject Islam from polite society because uh Mohammed was a pedophile by today's standards\nAre no fan of a fan of Islam or or the other major religious you know personally because of a lot of things like that that I've noticed it and it all all all major religious myself but but yeah there's there's that stuff out there\nDo you think that the reason folks say that ... that we should reject Columbus is that they're more general objection with Columbus is the poster boy\nIs they don't like the Europeans came to this continent their objection is in Columbus himself or what he did because I'm sure there were plenty of things there were plenty of things the tribes the indigenous people did to themselves and to each other that we would certainly not applaud today correct\nOh I'm sure\nThey're OK so so in that chaos their if their objection is to Europeans coming here should we as a society that's made up primarily of European Americans who owes populate this continent should we say\nWe should all hang our heads in shame at least once a year on Columbus Day because somebody before us came here from Europe my on my dad's side my grandfather came here in Eighteen fifty five with his wife\nThey were Swedes but they were living in Germany at the time and they came here should I be ashamed of the fact that I'm a European American\nI don't think that any of us should be ashamed of you know who who we are where we came from I think that that's kind of a cake and I'm taking a on\nThat well then then what what are we saying we say we're going to stop celebrating Columbus Day we're going to tear down the statues are what antifa chair the statues down and then we're going to eliminate the holiday altogether we will no longer mentioned Columbus Day as a national holiday what are we saying what's the point of that that\nWell I mean I I think I think there's a difference between you know ... you know not not in one cell for one lineage and what he might have been done in the past is the difference between that and then celebrating a guy he did some\nUnspeakable unspeakable terrible things well you know apparently again you know I haven't done a ton of research but that's\nWhat we celebrate Presidents Day that'd be President's Day primarily celebrates the birthdays of Washington ah and ah and Lincoln and and others American president Lincoln violated the constitution a Lincoln did some things\nThat he him that he took away people's civil rights rights a baby is corpus for a time because he wanted to hold the union together should we Mark Abraham Lincoln's Birthday joy mark Washington's Birthday he was a slave holder a show well you\nYou know I I I Would say first personally I I Would like to get to a place where you know people take pride in their own accomplishments and what they actually do and and they actually are versus ideas of the past what the past actually was that just kind of\nWhere I developed you know because really I mean I didn't do any of those things you know I ... I go what I Do now\nKnow I get that but but you we have holidays that we have memorials for various people should we mark MLK Day\nI think people should celebrate what they see fit a\nWell should we as a country I I get that you can have every you're going to have flat earth day if you want to you can celebrate Kwanzaa which was invented by a guy who got sent to prison for torturing two women\nWith a soldering iron I don't mark ... is not my cup of tea but if you're saying then then as a society we shouldn't mark any one holiday that we all jointly say that's worth paying attention

that's the question of\nReally is it one person one vote when some districts have an easier way\nOf passing things or electing levers done it is because there are so many just qualified voters in their districts\nLet me ask you a straight ahead a constitutional question singer constitutional attorney\nUm are people who are here in the country illegally are they in title to representation in Congress would say we're in the state legislature or even though they're here in the country illegally as is has there been a definitive answer to them\nYou know\nUh and people will say yes there has so what they're doing is looking at a law says that went to the Supreme Court where the Supreme Court let's just the issue of district day so that's a matter of how the lines are drawn and\nThey said that these people count as far as the drawing the line but the question has never been answered when it comes to apportion that and that means how we figure out or the four hundred and thirty five congressional districts and that's a fixed number so it's very much as there are some games\nAnd so when it comes to those districts and how many people count in those districts them whether they are citizens\nAnd eligible to vote that question has never been answered and it does all go back to kind of an arcane issue because the fact that\nWhen our country was founded it was a matter of the state's looking at people who are eligible to vote in just different states we all have different policies back then as to what was what a ... created eligibility and and the word and habits and which carries with it a legal status\nWas used to qualify that people who were here and eligible to vote\nSo now it's a matter of looking back\nAt that language and original intense and and understanding\nThat person and have it and when it came to the way that our founding fathers originally looked at this um and have been it meant somebody who was here last fully and who was qualified to but\nDoes it help ... we now have another originalist thank God on the U.S Supreme Court if you have to sing come to record\nIt very well may help when it comes to exactly this kind of an issue which is\nK.
