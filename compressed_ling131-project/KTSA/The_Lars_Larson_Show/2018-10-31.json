Rachel boulevard is the senior policy director for conservative partnership to to to do and the former director of policy services for the Heritage Foundation Rachel good to have you back on the program\nHi there thanks for having me\nSo how do we go about maybe if we can stop this caravan what can we do to get the rest of the caravans that might follow it on a regular basis stopped so that they don't challenge our national sovereignty and tried to come into across our border illegally\nWell I think the first thing that has to happen as a resource thing at the border I just really rational question you know President Trump has sent a thousand troops to the border and that's great and that'll provide you know I think some security but the issue is we don't have enough judges at the border to\nProcess asylum close and we certainly don't have enough resources in terms of border security and in order to patrol the border and we don't have the president's order wall so all of that has to be funded by Congress any future caravan of going to be deterred\nYou know I saw a number today that says that the birds to illegal alien parent in this country that are primarily covered by Medicaid and public funding through hospitals in such\nThat total amount of money that we spend a every year is greater than the amount of money they're talking about to start building the wall so it's to me it would be a fairly easy economics choice would you rather have a wall and stop people from coming into the country illegally or would you rather just leave the border opened a lot of people come in and\nAnd have babies and we'll we'll we'll pay for all the costs are I Would rather they didn't even get to the other side of the border uh but I Want to stop them illegally and humanely but I don't even want him to stand in front of a judge I I Want them to be stopped before they get to the borders there is there any hope of that Rachel\nElection day is Tuesday November six

fight on an issue we are going to talk about on the air\nI have not attended the charter school myself I have no children my children went to public school and my step children did or they didn't go to private schools and they didn't go to a charter school but I'm One of the biggest fans of charter schools because I think that they offer a very simple equation\nIf you succeed you stay doing what you're doing an education if you do not succeed as a charter school you go out of business which is a bit different\nThan the conventional K through ... public schools where if you fail you just keep right on failing and ask for more money\nDr ... can do is a senior research fellow for education policy at the pioneer Institute and the author of the fight for the best charter schools in the nation\nDr welcome to the program thanks for having me so how is it the Massachusetts Charter schools or wouldn't have been my first guest a liberal stayed with high taxes and everything else I wouldn't have guessed that they actually had have had a lot of success\nWith charter schools and that's good for the kids in that state how they're making it happen\nIt's great but it can stay we're making it happen in large part because our charter school policy here are charter school law and here's to the charter school bargain which at its core if it was getting the school's greater autonomy and flexibility in exchange for accountability so\nWait bag go run innovate and do they think they're supposed to start kids well and when you fail to do it your clothes and\nToo many they aren't doing it that way which is one of the reasons I read this book\nNow why you explained the book why charter supporters last a ballot initiative in twenty Fifteen why did that up\nI think that there were two main reasons one of the things we don't allow it here in Massachusetts is we do have a pretty conservative cap on the number of charter schools that can and\nThat's in large part due to escape humane teachers' unions really pushing back against charter schools because a lot of the teachers in charter schools choose not to be unionized um and so in twenty can we had a small list of the cat that was sort of\nInvolved a lot of a political sausage making an out of the passage came really ill conceived law that raised the cat\nIn some places but only in low performing district and then that if you're going to have this new charter schools districts they have to be only run by people who have already run schools in the past which for closer than evasion and doing that\nReally what legislators did was they sort of frames charter schools being just for one type of kid or one had the district people didn't really understand that they were supposed to be about innovation and indeed we took the innovation is out of the equation by thing only proven providers can run at school so it was part of part of it I think we made\nThe second part is that someone say never should have gone to the ballot that that is an issue that\nIs really difficult in some ways for the for the general public to wrap it had around sort of how schools are funded the death is not something that's really dinner table conversation that many places and on top of that on charter truck phone and says he wanted the cat\nRe I think if we're honest just did a really poor job of of running a campaign and allowed the opposition on mainly in the in the form and that they can they he just wanted to propagate\nA lot of myth about charter public schools at the public in the lack\nOf with a lack of real good information about what these schools do I didn't want to\nFor example hurts the traditional public schools which is one of the claims that the opposition made a true but without evidence they they do that they they kept out\nActually doctor can do and maybe this was to blonde but I'm going to say it anyway I don't care for conventional schools get hurt and here's why what I mean by that is if you have schools successful or failing schools\nThat did you know that that uh then they have some competition in the form of a charter school\nAnd the parents look at what the charter schools doing for their kids and they look at what the conventional school is doing\nAnd they move either a sizable minority or even a majority of their students from the conventional school to the charter school because they now have a choice and they said this school is doing for my kids what I Need which is to get them a good solid education\nAnd the conventional school says hey we used to be a thousand kids here now we only have five hundred to we can only justify half the staff and a half the teachers because the resources have gone across the street to the charter school\nThat's OK even you know and and I and I wonder why\nYou know you're in a part of the country that has a lot of liberals but but it's also I mean there are businesses that are run most people who are you know not government workers are government workers are not the majority thank God would look at it and say well if my company does a better job than the competition the competition may lose business or even go out of business so what\nThat is how you breed excellence or in in any field in education and business in almost anything you know competition breeds excellence but\nCompetition usually means somebody wins and that means somebody has to lose why aren't people so concerned about saying oh we have to preserve this whole model that has been disturbing her kids\nWell I I agree with you completely that the older model is not something that should be preserved at a charter school here for example are closing\nThe gas for are low income children of color especially at ... at ... unprecedented in this nation I Would say that one of the places where not\nOnly Massachusetts gets it wrong but so many things get it wrong is that we have this cat on a number of schools that can exist so the reason they care about uh what how the district school they're performing for example is that not everybody has\nAccess to a charter public schools so here in the commonwealth we're\nTwenty six thousand individual kids on the list to get into these high performing charter public schools if there weren't that cap I Would agree with you completely let the let the charter schools do what they know how to do closed when they don't do it well and if the traditional public schools don't fare well in that system than they should close unfortunately\nI'm In too many places around the country as we do in Massachusetts we had the charter school cats which means that\nEven when families want to leave their district schools they can\nWell and that's the problem I guess what I'm Wondering is why\nWere the voters the taxpayers the parent willing to tolerate a cap if if you said these schools are going to be great and clearly if the legislature and the people who voted in favor\nOf of having charter schools to be made available it must be because they believe there is at least as good if not better than conventional schools why would you say this is going to be really great but you can only have a little bit of\nYeah well I think it's because believe me I I Wish that we would have a much more of it um that progressive Lee you know what we've got here is special interest groups that have a huge old on the politics of education at that said that they do and many others and part of the ... is what we had failed to talk about here is a complete abolition that the cat they said\nWe may feel that say over time let's raise it here let's re that there and so in that context you're always going to be vulnerable to the argument well\nEvery time you open a charter school in this community of that community it's going to drain funding from the traditional public school which by the way even true here because I'm with ya and it and it and it took them whereas it should I Believe money follows the child is for the child and not for the theocracy or not but at the school not for the adults then that would that would work\nAnd was on ... and was most of that was by the choice of the U.S government not by their choice of the tribes ride\nIt was both a fact as I said as I said many tribes did um gain citizenship ... by mutual consent many did not later on in like twenty three Congress extended citizenship\nOr in a blanket way to all remaining members of an Indian tribe that we're not citizens at that time and since that point so now for almost a hundred years or you know every little road American indian tribes also considered citizens of the United states\nSo let me ask you about this for this kind of sneak up on us because America had effectively no legal immigration or not much between what about World War one and about the Nineteen sixties when Kennedy came in with a piece of legislation that about their besides those\nThe five actually five immigration next passed and a under a later Congress and signed by President Johnson so yeah it had very low levels of all forms of immigration from a ... during the times that you describe um until sixty passage and sixty five immigration act when it went up to ... continue to\nAccelerate I ever since\nSo the president is not changing law he's not changing the constitution use just saying to the federal government we're not going to interpret it the way to has been for more than a hundred years\nThis is going to be challenged and actually I'm Glad to see that because I've asked for years where can we bring an action of some kind on somebody's be have to say we're being injured by those will the court please fix at this almost guarantees that will go to the cords and at some point\nUh unless it's decided and approve the president's ... orders approved a lower court it's going to find its way all all the way did the new Supreme Court isn't it\nI Would assume so yes I mean a couple of things are possible what we've seen a you know where the speaker of the house come out and said against the president's action but we've also heard other members say that they might be for it and others have said\nThis is a good thing we need to fix this practice but Congress should do it now I agree ... should do it should have done it a long time ago sometimes it takes a threat of executive action\nTo get Congress to boot I'm not saying that they will in this case but it's possible so you know maybe the just the just the specter of during this by that could order well in ... Congress to take action likely but it's possible if that doesn't happen\nAny order goes forward that or to oil of course be challenged I assume it will be overturned because the people who challenge it will be careful to pick a venue\nAnd a case and probably a judge that his favorable the same way they were very strategic and how they tell us the travel ban you know you you do you ensure the possibility of success in their case success needle returns and it just keeps going up up the chain until it gets a sprinkler\nNow Michael the last issues a bit personal because I've argued in favor of this change I've had people say well ours you're being a hypocrite you didn't like executive orders and I said well there are things that should be dealt with through legislation like when President Obama wanted a lead DACA kids stay in the country\nThat to me required to changing the law because the law said those kids have to be deported if they're found I said there are other things that can be dealt with legally if you're not changing the law if you're not changing the constitution\nIs this an appropriate use of the executive order\nAs I say look I Do I I Do believe that would be superior to do this legislation I agree that Congress has had the power to do that a long time I won't do it and I can hear the answer cannot be it because Congress won't act\nWe're going to be stuck for another hundred years with a misinterpretation of the fourteenth amendment that's harming our country harming courage citizens of all races so I don't think it's hypocritical point right I think I made at the beginning is that granting birthright citizenship is something federal executive department started to do without any constitutional authority\nOr legislative authority or executive direction they're just doing it the ... the bureaucracy acting in and out of control and accountable way the president is their boss\nHe should be able to tell them to stop doing something that no one ever told them to do in the first place and that they have no authority to do so I see nothing hypocritical about it\nOn answerable to the public unelected by the public I couldn't agree with you more of the bureaucracy should not be making this decision if Congress doesn't want to do it and the president can do it appropriately\nThat I'm I'm completely in favor of it Michael thanks

I pass\nBy it practically every day of my childhood as I went back way to go to school it was a it was a fixture in the community which I grow up and you know interestingly enough Lars it was a place where I first saw a sign that as a\nInspired may lately to focus on a related topic but\nIt it was a sign that said save Soviet Jews\nAnd I've been thinking about it you know this was obviously not only an expression of you know what people face doing their best which just care about others but\nIt is a reminder now that a community that used to worry about Jews and the Soviet Union now has to like Jews in Europe or even worry about\nTheir safety in our own country and this is a very very bad\nYou know side of what has been happening in terms of ah the rising not only anti Semitism but anti Israel sentiments a and and more generally I I think a a hatred for people who are art of a well\nFrankly are primarily art of the left or archery as supremacists or often allied with the left and that's a that's a very worrying as I say statement about what's happening in our country more broadly\nYeah because you warned us for a long time that uh with the rise of sharia law in in various places in the middle east with a hint of it at least in part to Western Europe like France and even in England that we worry here about folks\nYou know handing out offensive leaflets or or uh you know they they'll go in and they'll they'll vandalize the synagogue um but we don't often hear about people literally committed murder although Seattle at a murder that was aimed at a Jewish citizens are not too many years ago\nPolitically I paid for by the reelect judge got Robert campaign\n[noise] hey San Antonio for a limited time at the humor even get to kind of prepared by their brains rent it don't work right check and balance on single making eighty nine dollars on the ground in Africa yeah so we are typing on over five ... which makes it out\nWhen they said that if you were born in America and subject to the jurisdiction of the United states what did they intend to me\nWell it meant that you were born here and you weren't a beholden to the sovereign of any other state\nSo you weren't subject to the jurisdiction of foreign prints are potent Tate some foreign republic and we have more than one of the most prominent people in Congress pushing the bill including I mean pushing this that the amendment including its author or saying this that so the point was\nThat if you are say an ambassador from United Kingdom and your\nWife had a child to hear that child would not be an American citizen if you if you were somebody from overseas soldiers earning in the United states but still with allegiance and obligations to foreign um state then you wouldn't be a citizen of the United states\nSo in other words in plain language the fourteenth amendment would appear to say to those people are today engaging the practice of what's been called birthright tourism where somebody flies in from Europe or Asia or or South America\nAnd flies in has a child in the United states where the purpose of their trip is very clearly to deliver a child on us soil would that person be considered that person's trial be considered a U.S citizen under the fourteenth amendment the way it was written\nI Know that would that be correct those people have no intention of even of staying here permanently let alone and becoming citizens in forest wearing their former allegiances and so they would not be the kind of people who\nAre subject to the jurisdiction of the United states as that expression is understood by the people who wrote the fourteenth amendment no\nOne is why do you think the U.S government has so for so long miss interpreted the fourteenth amendment\nThat is a very good question um really it's been the executive branch that's decided that it was going to end out um passports to people who were in that larger group\nBeyond the one I just mentioned um of people who are just born here and had not a given up their allegiance to their home state there's no reason why the president or Congress should feel bound by this practice and\nUm it's not consistent or I should say it's not required by the fourteenth amendment of course Congress does have authority to extend citizenship that whomever lives\nBut it's never acted to extend citizenship this far and so a really this could be corrected today tomorrow\nIt doesn't need an amendment to the constitution as many people have objected to the rumors about what President Trump is planning to do it doesn't actually required amendments of the constitution to changes is it's really been mistaken application of\nThe fourteenth amendment by the other branches that has given us this problem\nWell if there's no statutory law to speak of on those and there is the amendment and all it takes is the bureaucracy to behave differently as you said the passport office or any other government agency that takes into account where you are what what country you're a citizen of primarily the state department\nThan it is within the president's power to say stop issuing passports or any other documents to people who are not citizens by birth right\nKen and an economy oh I understand it yet but to actually\nWhat what we have is we have a a statute eight USC fourteen or one that's simply with teach the language of the fourteenth amendment including saying subject to the jurisdiction there other than it's been executive application or you could say miss application of this language\nThat's given us the current problem but it president wanted to correct it I don't see any reason why he couldn't correct it of course what we've seen during the Trump Administration is that\nFederal judges a hostile to the president have sworn in his attempts to exercise is a legitimate authority in connection with ... foreign people so I suppose we could expect to kind of blow up in the lower federal courts about this\nIf the president acted on it but it could well be that now there are five votes on the Supreme Court to uphold his decision\nWell in this case that law was written I think in fifty two and the other one we spend a lot of time with I think it was the McCarron act was written in fifty five do you think that the legislative history is it the members of Congress in Nineteen fifty to all the way back to what are we talking about our eyes and our the tail\nTail end you know I think it'd be Eisenhower at that point wouldn't it where it was a true motive\nFifty twos Truman yeah of course we have there's a general rule in in the law that where you have\nA language that's been used before being repeated it should be understood as having the same meaning so what that would mean as if\nIf the Congress is language directly from the fourteenth amendment Lisa understand the language of the Congress has used as having the same meaning as it had in the fourteenth amendment which gets back to what I was saying before about what the chief author and another one of the most prominent\nAre proponents in Congress said this\nThis phrase allergies subject to the jurisdiction there a men's and again what they said it meant was that the person in question didn't ... any allegiance to any foreign state so that would not cover uh foreigners it would not cover anchor babies that would not cover birth terrorists would not cover any of these people\nKnow and in fact you could start applying that right now although I Wonder about the practical application\nBecause it gives it today's practical application if a if a South Korean mom flies in the Los Angeles or Seattle stays for a few weeks delivers a baby and goes home she likely goes home with a birth certificate from the state of California which is a sanctuary state\nSo does that become definitive of what and who that child is or is it the U.S government's policy at the time they were born the definitive\nBecause they go home to South Korea with mom and the kid turns Eighteen and then says okay mom I'm headed back to America since I'm a citizen\nDoes it matter what what we said today or does it matter what the policy is Twenty years from now or Eighteen years from now when the kid comes back to America hoping to establish himself and then at some point bring six or eight of his family members with him\nThe right to be fit itself which which is the fourteenth amendment\nAnd the Fourth Amendment that facts that because prior to that states made decisions as stayed could literally say you Mike you're a citizen and somebody else is not in a lot and and at that point the federal government said no\nWe're not going to let the states decide individually who's a citizen and who's not and they took it away with the fourteenth amendment as you say but it also has\nAn effect because it speaks to\nHow do you become a citizen of this country\nIf you are in this country and you have a baby and you are subject to the jurisdiction of this country than the baby is a citizen if you're not subject to the jurisdiction of this country than the baby does not become a citizen right\nThat is totally collect and uh what's it like what you said we are Native Americans who are in America that they looked at that as bad as ... separate nation so it doesn't even apply a\nWell it does doesn't because they ... they ... and they had to make some fixes through statute to say we want to make it clear that Native Americans are also American citizens so\nThese days I don't think there's a single tried that stuck with no we're just a sovereign nation and our citizens are not at the time and I talked to his story and about this earlier today\nThere were some tribes that said we don't want to be we don't want our citizens to be citizens of the United states and there were others where\nThe tribes were denied citizenship so this clears that up if you're if you're a Native American you can be a citizen both of the sovereign nation that is your tribe and your reservation and you can also be a a sovereign citizen of the United states at the same time so that was cleared up as well\nBut now that now that the president says we've been applying this wrong\nWe'd been granting citizenship to people simply because somebody came into the country illegally and decided that they were going to have a baby here and the baby somehow get citizenship that's not what the fourteenth amendment says let's go to Brian in Nevada and Brian thanks for listing on K.
