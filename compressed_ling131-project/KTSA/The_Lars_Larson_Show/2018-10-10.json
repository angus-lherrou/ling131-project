he's a good debater he is the author most recently of what the hell do you have to lose Trump's Warren civil rights let's talk about voter registration you were talking about that it really that is part of the core of American civil rights\nBeyond questions of whether or not people are treated equally in the workplace which is a ride and equally in in polite society as a consumer you should be treated the same as anyone else\nWill you talked about voter registration\nRepublicans do try to get more people registered\nBut what we're concerned about is making sure that people are voting only if they have the right to vote we now have major American cities that have said\nWe're going to let illegal aliens vote and they and they don't just say it philosophically they put it into a local ordinances now one tell me what's wrong with insisting that every single person who vote show a piece of picture ID to demonstrate that they are who they are and let me back that up by saying one\nYou and I travel a lot as journalists you stay in hotels you can't check into a hotel without picture ID you can't walk into the department of justice without picture ID you can't get on an airplane without picture ID\nWhy in the hell to use your\nThe title of your book why the hell should not have to show picture id to vote\nBecause of voting as a constitutional right so in other words to protect Lars Larson is right to vote when anybody even if we're talking about I think it was two Black Panthers who weren't blocking anybody they're standing there you made it into a big issue\nI Would say I don't want him standing there I don't even want the impression that Lars can't both as large as a white man sees these two guys are and by the way this was a black neighborhood nobody complained but anyway\nThe point is among those let's invest our energy our time and make them short people can exercise their right constitutional right you don't have and that's a fairly a constitutional right to get on an airplane or to walk into a government building and you can still do it but\nLet's make sure that people have this capacity rather than emphasizing a sort\nOf well of course of an issue is oh voter fraud or very well\nHarris who probably made us ... let's talk about the made up but I'll give you an example won do I have a constitutional right to buy a firearm\nAt the moment you do\nAt the moment I Know you're not you know air depart your your uh your political party has plans to change that but we can get to that later no I I tell\nYou wait large you don't have to put it on any party I even know me you know about it my wife and a instead\nOf your wife to almost gotten carjacked who I have to buy up he goes ahead for so she could get I ever saw you refused\nI think you offered up his gotten\nI I Would put it in a color she wanted in God but let me ask you this one you cannot exercise your right to own and possess a firearm without showing picture ID it is impossible right now\nIf I have to now that's a constitutional right you just suggested that if it's a constitutional right I shouldn't have to show picture ID well I certainly know exercise by Atlanta maybe well voting wait a minute is a ride shouldn't you have to show picture ID\nYou do have to show some idea when you register none none of them are not true yes I ... I Can't think of any jurisdiction where you don't have any ... I'll give me the other one is that we're talking jurisdiction of\nCalifornia is automatic registration of people automatic registration\nYou're talking about voter id yeah well I'm Talking about for a for people who are getting a car like a license to dry out and I'm\nA million a million people in California who are illegal aliens have driver's licenses and their automatic voter registration well they're not ... not\nLegally Laurie in a legal you guys are making stuff up behind me I'm just saying\nYou can't shoot at heroin legally I either but it gets done a lot in the United states of America\nAnyway look I think the reason I met I brought up guns was that I Am somewhat lives in big cities I've got a hunter I Am threatened by people with\nGuys didn't have one yeah see that's your response but I look at all the murders look at all the mass murders look at what goes on in schools like people get these guns that so willy nilly it is a mess and on we are not protecting ourselves or our show\nI Want to ask you a theoretical question this goes to a civil rights in his book is called what the hell do you have to lose Trump's Warren ...\nIf you were to arm any of the people in the great city of Chicago who are law abiding citizens if you arm them with guns legally unlawfully the ones who want to be armed what do you suppose that happened to crime in the famous murder capital of America Chicago Illinois\nIf there were more guys they'd be more death\nNo more guns in the hands of law abiding citizens\nYou want and you would think are everybody get the candidate gardeners gun\nThey never had that won all uh although if they can shoot well I plan to have my ... I plan to have my granddaughter shooting under adults are run by kindergarten do you think that's a good goal you should do it\nFor your kids yeah I don't want her killing her friends hurt I don't\nTo say like large under adult supervision now\nYeah other than voting where do you think that Donald Trump has gone to war on civil rights let's talk about immigration to while we have time\nBut you want to talk about immigration and asked me a question but I was going around the earth or go ahead and we're doing we're out there regarding the war on civil rights we talked about that divisive rhetoric we talked about distorting\nThe reality of the black community focuses on the twenty percent that live in poverty disproportionately young people it's a very difficult situation link I think a lot of the history of this country beginning slavery but coming over to\nLegal segregation and continuing biased and bad schools that are so that is a problem but he ignores the forty percent\nOf black America they are is between thirty five and a hundred thousand or the ignored the additional twelve percent earns between a hundred two hundred\nThese are people who are get up everyday Lars and Lars Larson conservative traditions go to work work hard to try to get ahead\nIn the face of continue racial bias in this country this is to be celebrated I Would think conservatives would say wow look at people\nWho had some difficulties faced discrimination and yet still believe in the great American Dream and believe in capitalism still a huge gap in terms of wealth between black and white America but if that Donald Trump he doesn't need to tap into the idea of what amazing accomplishment ... to\nAll those people are scary and I\nDid he ever saved Harlem out do not hold on hold on wait we listen when I'm going to tell you I ... I don't think he's ignoring them at all in fact if anything he celebrates the success of black Americans in ... and ... what is emblematic of that\nIs the most recent public opinion polls you know these national polls that are done say that black voters support for Donald Trump has gone up it's actually higher now than what Mitt Romney had and Mitt Romney did not have a great number of black Americans supporting him neither did John McCain delayed John McCain\nBut Donald Trump has higher black voters support than either one of those two guys\nYou know if we want to look at polls\nI mean let's look at the reality of the boat twenty sixteen I think he got eight percent of the boat\nWe are in other words you want to blame the American media 'cause you're like yes on the media even though\nLars Larson is a big part of American media but let me just tell you what do you do when in fact someone like Paul Ryan says her Trump is calling out a judge in American born because his parents are Mexican as unable to be a good and what is a lie and say that is\nThey know what are you crazy amount for actually won All right\nLet me just let me let me let me pile on here you're telling me that when you have these All right people these neo Nazis than what they're tiki torches outside a synagogue not supportive takes it takes the mainstream media to say that\nPeople find people are acting in an anti Semitic threatening manner oh come on\nLet's go back and we go back to the judge ... back\nThis guy and they start\nHis book is called what the hell the blues Trump's Warren ... about the judge you mentioned that judge was a member of a group called ... lawyers and low rise that is as bad as the plan they are the\nChannel man oh they are as you didn't mean it yes I Do mean and I said oh ... means the\nRace is a Hispanic group that advocates for illegal aliens and believes that America was falsely taken from Mexico and they want to take it back\nAnd this guy of voluntarily joined a group called la ... lawyers and that's why the president called him out because it would be like if she if if I joined the Klan\nYou know you'd say large that's despicable group the fact that you've chosen to voluntarily ally yourself with that kind of despicable group shows well that's why I Would never be a member of the clan\nThere are number of groups I Would never join because of what they represent this judge joined ... lawyers voluntarily and took part in their activities it is a racial group it is called the right oh\nYeah I see you're backing up that's a good idea you sit back up the backup way over the edge here you're like these young people that are getting hurt taking selfies on that amount\nOr ride a bike ride is nowhere to narrow that well my God\nWhat a record clan has an ass decided by the way you know who endorsed Donald Trump David Duke actually tell you\nThat oughta clan you want to go back and re debate that one that one was falls from the guard and we'll\nGet outta here he said if you don't vote for Trump your ... your your band and in your traditions it's craziness and the neo Nazis and Trump staying there find people on both sides but my larger appointed why do you guys make excuses when you see something right they're running right I don't\nThink based on Donald Trump's behavior over the last forty years as a businessman employing black Americans employing Hispanic Americans oh you if\nYou want to get into that about how he's his family was sued for racial discrimination and\nAnd ... moment okay be honest about that oh no I asked us not to landlords most of the landlords in New York City and other big cities were sued for alleged racial discrimination or other kinds of discrimination earlier he was he as old as\nThe biggest the biggest and so you want to make other people were racist too so it does and\nNow I'm not saying it doesn't matter I'm seeing is part of how we change things I mean for example\nFDR was a major big get\nOn the subject of race he Reese before he became president he reads segregated one entire government agency and the Democrats like to forget about that and say if we can show a connection to some racial misdeeds\nOf a Democrat while we forget about that but if it was a Republican boy it's part of their history forever why don't we applied to FDR as well\nI'm not going to go that far back I think he was living in a time when legal segregation was a law that land Donald Trump lives in a time when we have a civil rights act and we have a voting rights act and he acts as if it's a burden when he says make America great again I think he wants to go\nBad is not a racial slur in ... your ... your country ... the whole aggregated and who are these people are all these so come in any other long black or Latino won congratulations\nOn on the new book what the hell do you have to lose Trump's war on civil rights I Will be reading it and I'll be taking notes yeah because

this program at eight six six large that's eight six six four three nine five to seven seven emails go to talk at Lars Larson dot com as I told you crack of dawn this morning at least on the west coast Nikki Haley\nAnnounced that you would step down as the U.S ambassador to the United nations that position formerly held by John Bolton I admire him greatly admire Governor Haley ... as well speculation about her replacement has already begun and I thought we'd get an insight on that you heard would Frank after they had to say about Nikki Haley\nLet's talk to Benjamin Friedman who's a senior fellow in defense scholar a defense priorities adjunct lecturer at George Washington university's Elliott school of international affairs\nProfessor good to have you on the program\nThanks for having me on again so\nWho's the most likely candidate to replace ambassador Haley\nOh I I really don't know I mean this is the Trump Administration uh where you know the president likes to it a lot of drama around the stuff uh so uh it's it's a very difficult to say uh I I I think of it speculate\nWhat about the ... the short list is supposed to include Dina Powell we've talked about her a bit Richard Grinnell a current US ambassador journal Germany Heather Nauert\nFormer ABC News correspondent Fox News host who's currently spokesman for the state department and Jon Huntsman who ran for president or six years ago currently serving as US ambassador to Russia do any of those candidates makes sense for what is a very high profile and a new can be a tough job\nWell I think they they could all makes sense or you know a Heather Nauert a is a is a PR person a communications expert and a President Trump likes those search people people who look good on TV uh Powell is a more ah insider a\nWashington establishment type person that would appeal to a larger group of people and a bathroom on Schmidt is is a more of a a pragmatist I think you'd foreign policy is outside of a Republican or mainstream on foreign policy which is great\nBecause unlike a Nikki Haley or John Bolton he's not trying to have wars but\nYou know four or five countries at once so I think that would be a nice change of pace\nAh although I think it's unlikely to help you to get\nProfessor unless you told me otherwise I'd I'd uh I'd I'd I guess I'd just as a suspect that you are not a big Donald Trump fans\n[noise] uh well uh no I'm not but a President Trump or is or at least occasionally a postal award to a or at least once that happened in the past that didn't go well\nAh he has a I think deserves some credit for doing negotiations with the north Koreans and uh we're a U.S foreign policy left in the hands on all the Nikki Haley\nA which may be it it is it coming that the case with bald at least\nA than a ... would not be doing those things I I think that uh you know\nNikki Haley would out of her way to uh make provocative a threatening were box about ... when you were trying to pursue negotiations with them a she like bolt and I think would like to drag the United states into a war with Iran she's a notably electorate towards a Palestinian beyond ... any kind of decency\nAnd uh so I I think we could do a lot better or for us ... even in a way that's more consistent with what this president seems to want at least a fellow at the time\nWhat professor I'll be like one of your worst students and I'll push back on some of these things she you say she's belligerent toward the Palestinians\nAre these are folks who take hundreds of millions of dollars from America they don't really negotiate and they still will not accept the rights of the people who live right next to them to exist and continue to exist\nIt would be like having a neighbor who says on a regular basis Lars I'm planning that you're going to die soon uh it'd be tough to negotiate with somebody like that\nShouldn't we push back against that kind of thing and even be a little bit belligerent since all the you know warm fuzzy talk of the last Thirty years hasn't really brought the Palestinians anywhere even when Arafat was offered a uh a Ninety eight percent of what he wanted he said no\nHe wants to the Jews are dead and how do we ...\nI think it's a little bit more like a if your neighbor if you were living in your neighbor's backyard if that are going to give it back and then she do despite the U.S foreign policy\nYou ought to uh so uh the Palestinians are far from perfect\nUh and I agree with you it Arafat I made a mistake in those negotiations but uh I think it's the Netanyahu government that has refused to go shape now are not Palestinian it's a it is that the is a real obstacle to peace there but I mean that you know that issue\nOr is it is a hardly the most important one little or evaluating Haley I think a or her policies are her statements on North Korea Syria which really seems to want us to try to overthrow of Assad er which I think with bring a a messy chaos tried it\nIn Iran or or where the biggest problems for\nYou know it's funny that you mentioned getting us into another war\nAs I recall bronco bomber ran as the anti war president and he ended up putting troops into Syria without telling the public for a long long time you ended up putting troops a number of places you didn't get the while he got them all the way out of Iraq and then ended up putting about six or eight thousand back into Iraq\nBecause pulling out a wild you know it it wasn't advised by a lot of the generals was what he did and then we ended up having to put troops ride back in there and and yet the constant drumbeat I heard before Trump was elected and after he was like does this guy is going to get us into a war\nIt seems to me that the previous\nPresident Brock Obama got us into more conflicts or puts people in harm's way and more conflicts than this president has and this president is actually figured out how to get North Korea at least come to the table and he's and he's taking a hard line with the Iranians which one is the more pro war President Trump or Obama\nWell I I'm not sure I I certainly wouldn't close or almost all the ... did I Wish Obama added a continued a lot of the war is the inherited or ended the war in Afghanistan or\nGot us more deeply involved in Syria or a helped overthrow the government of Libya I oppose all those things that thought they were mistakes uh I think uh the Trump Administration has continued almost every or will they actually get every war they inherited a and I think they deserve some credit for for\nPursuing diplomacy with North Korea or by uh they bend a across the board I think a fairly electric but at the main thing is that you know we we have a bipartisan consensus in this country or left and right as much as they are thrilled off each other and decker tend to agree and all these things but I just said\nDemonstrates that so I disagree with both sides and both parties President's Day or advocate wars that I think are needless\nDo you think that sometimes talking in a bit of belligerent tone to people who've decided to be problematic in one way or another is sometimes the best way to keep them from going too far rather than try to you know the nice warm fuzzy approach to them because that never seems to work\nWell we we do try that nice warm fuzzy approach a at time certainly uh the Trump Administration does the certain countries a Saudi Arabia for example are that are problematic uh I think a third\nAnd I've got so many friends or at a personal friend anyways um he gets a monthly Social Security check a an in app off on his property taxes he's in a wheelchair I won't let him to Asia for is a sixty years old just turned sixty\nAnd usually considered fled disabled is that what he's getting ... is he fully as well or is he capable of doing any job because you know the federal definition for disability pay is to be disabled you must be incapable of doing any kind of paid work is that the case in his case\nI Believe so large now it is his hips are completely disintegrated because of this\nWelcome to the phones in an office we have a nice young ... funeral yeah\nHe's yeah he could you back\nThen that might not fully disabled he could do a job he chooses not to I don't think he should be on disability if we can cut to that trees\nI agree with you thousand percent and the reason I'm calling just to see a week it do about this I didn't just jammed let's see it everywhere and\nAnd basically I think it's a psychological situation um I think they should be required to get that disability check I think they should be required to do some counseling for mom to find out what's going on because they get a discount it gets a discount like ... on his property taxes\nUm I mean it just goes on and on demand has no incentive at all\nOut of that wheel and he'd been in this supposedly disabled position almost eleven years\nShe now so he's sixty now he was forty nine when he went into disability at forty nine I Would imagine he was more capable than he is today\nBut why couldn't a guy like that and make twelve dollars an hour to sit at the front desk of the company and answer phones and take notes and uh and and type things on a computer there's no reason\nAnd I hear this about so many people who say well I Want to be I'm I'm disabled I see you're not capable of doing anything you're talking to me on a phone that qualifies you for a whole bunch of jobs telemarketing jobs answering phones jobs you know those kinds of things and it it drives me nuts too because\nI think the ... the psychological condition you're talking about is laziness if somebody else oh yeah our bills then then there's the some of us I wouldn't want to check\nFor charity say well we'll just pay your bills you sit on your backside and watch TV that would drive me nuts so does that address does he need a month of counseling or does he need somebody to say are you capable of work\nBecause I see people well north of sixty who are at Walmart there are a greeter in fact in his wheelchair could be a Wal Mart greeter for eleven twelve dollars an hour now\nIs a very intelligent man he worked out there and search for several years worked his butt off\nAnd then he he this was what happened with Lars what they're doing is there a set of eyes in this situation there are giving him no reason as a matter of fact they're giving him a reason to stay in this situation by rewarding and what property tax or you know like I said I\nGet it get his have all those benefits and all he has to do is sit on his backside and I I don't know anyone who could admire that kind of behavior if he's capable of doing something else let me go back to Carrie Carrie are you off your speaker phone now\nI Am all All right what's on your mind yeah I\nDo that Trump ... porn and rapper UN ambassador I think he should stay up late ... early and get us out and kick them off of America and saw\nThat might be more than just a you know the than something you can take care of him to single administration but if he doesn't appointed another UN ambassador\nIf the organization goes on and operates is there 'cause I've had people I don't like the un either but I've had people make the point and these are folks from the government who made the point\nThat we use the UN and that we are able to gather a lot of human intelligence from a lot of diplomats from various countries who are in this country because they're going to the un and that that way it's actually a a relatively good information resource\nFor a country like ours that needs good human intelligence information about what's going on in other countries but I'm with you I think long term we should tell the United nations to start reforming\nChanged the way it operates reward countries that do the right thing punish countries and member countries that do the wrong thing and if they're not willing to do that then\nAs far as I'm concerned shut them down back out and tell them to go find a home somewhere else where would they like to have the United nations headquarters if not a New York city\nTo

six eight Lars that's eight six six four three nine\nFive to seven seven emails go to talk at Lars Larson dot com one of the things we talk about on this program a lot is military service\nI have not done that but I'm willing to honor those who have\nAll day long and twice on Sunday so it becomes a real concern for me\nWhen we talk about how veterans are having a tough time finding work will Jeff ... joins me now who's national employment director for disabled American veterans to talk about disabled veterans and how they can find a place in the workplace or Jeff welcome to the program and thanks for what you do\nA large thanks for having me it's really great to be on your show today and and hopefully talk about how hiring and retaining veterans with disabilities can help the help of a power America's economy\nI guess from a distance Jeff I mean I I have a dog in the ... step son who was in the military ... mom and dad were in the military I was born in Taiwan because they were in the military I've always thought that their service was it was one of the best things about being an American is being able to serve your country and there's such a small\nPercentage of the entire population that either has served or is serving now you'd think it'd be relatively easy for a big prosperous country like ours to provide a place to work\nAnd I don't mean a a make or job I mean a real job preferably in private industry for every single veteran who comes back you'd think this country would not only find it easy but ... would fall over itself looking to hire those people who've done this amazing service in uniform is that not the case\nI think it is the case to a degree Lars ah when when you look at it by and large I mean there's roughly twenty two twenty three million a veterans in the country or million of those are so are are veterans with service related disability um and what we're seeing I mean we\nWe ... we started our employment program the current version of it back in twenty four team with the sole purpose of helping these men and women who are transitioning out a roughly two hundred thousand or so each year ah we wanted to get into the employment sector to make a difference\nAlong with the other services we provide but we didn't have anything solely dedicated towards\nHelping them secure meaningful employment which is to your point a there are a lot of jobs out there you know uh having a meaningful a career is something that veterans boats deserving yearn for\nIn the sense that ah that continuity of purpose they they serve in the military\nYou know we serve at a at a very high level a with a you know a lot of danger dangerous type jobs in and sort of all over the globe and then one day you're out and everybody does get out whether you get out after you know four years or you retire with twenty four years it's going to end\nFor you at some point and you're still going to have a lotta years left in the workforce that that you can\nBack when you encounter a disability or multiple disability depending ah you know then that that window becomes even more narrow but companies themselves are they're really out there recruiting at such a high rate\nA big corporations I mean I I can talk to our career fairs and say that we ... we co host of\nRoughly a hundred and fifty of those a year all over the country we do some online these are big corporations are that are looking to recruit the highest level of talent you know from the veteran pool so they do recognize it they also recognize the value\nOf disabled veterans and what they also bring into the workforce so I think it's out there\nUh but we do struggle with the fact that the unemployed as unemployment goes down and and everybody's thrilled about where the rate is right now and that's great were behind that one hundred percent but the overwhelming majority of those that we deal with on a direct bases are are not\nUnemployed underemployed and in some cases over employed\nWell Jeff here's the thing we hear about discrimination in the workplace all the time\nAnd yet this is one of the few places were an employer could correct me if I'm wrong literally discriminate in favor an employer while I think Wal Mart did does not long ago said we're going to hire ten thousand votes and if they were effectively saying everyone else yeah we're going to hire them first that the law allows them to do that\nThey'll say we're going to hire vets were going to give preference to vets I Know there are a lot of government jobs that give preference to vets and then you take into account the fact that a veteran who's done service is likely in some cases more finished the job kind of person to begin with whether it's a man or woman\nAnd then if you factor in the Americans with Disabilities Act that says you legally have to accommodate people's disabilities you'd think that the veteran would be in the cat bird seed for getting jobs that are available that they want to pursue the careers they want to do am I missing something or because you said that the surveys show that\nNot quite two thirds more certainly more than half of all veterans are worried that when they go out in the workplace of their disabled they're going to face discrimination\nI Would hope they'd see not only employer saying we will follow the ADA and accommodate your disability but oh by the way you're a veteran we want to hire you even more than we want to hire the average applicant is that not happening\nI think what you know with a statistic that that comes from a survey that we had you know that we had done and yeah we we were a little bit taken back by the fact that fifty seven percent of those surveyed younger veterans\nYou know fear of discrimination in other words um they understand the position that they're in a ... but when they come back and they want to maybe they want to join the police force so they don't want to disclose a particular disability uh because I think a lot of it really comes from the stigma that\nYou know you don't do that over the years that was taboo to do that you kind of keep that thing to yourself\nUm where in fact I Believe where we are today in society is exactly as you put it companies are seeking those individuals again because of the fact that they have no disability um you know one of the things that that we\nParticularly when we started interacting with companies on a regular daily basis [noise]\nEspecially the multitude of them that career fairs is the fact that there was so much and and still so much work to do on the education front of educating employers on what a disability is\nHowever to the point the the companies are doing everything they can and creating a really really great opportunities for veterans now we got to get the veterans to understand that hey\nYou need to disclose that when it's proper to disclose it\nUh companies want to hire you because of it because there are tax incentives for them financial incentives for them to hire you\nAnd it just trying to get both of them and bridge that gap that's where that you know our our ... guide to hiring and retaining veterans with a disability is is really that we've released this month is hopefully going to help on both sides at the table with that\nThat kind of stuff ... and then a\nFlight attendant works are way back passed everybody and starts talking to this person up there and things seem to have settled down and the flight attendant gets a weird look on my face and she walks back and I'm way back on the plane that wasn't built around me and I'm way back in the planes you walk back and I said what's that noise up there and she looks at me and she goes\nIt's a duck and I went\nDuck and she said yes a duck and I let somebody brought a duck on the plane\n[laughter] and she said it's a therapy duck and I went there upbeat and she said yes a therapy duck [laughter] it does look on her face [laughter] and she\nWalked off and I could tell she thought it was ridiculous too and it was about that time when everything buddies started ... you know everybody would was willing to pay the ten bucks depending where you live but everybody's willing to pay the ten bucks and you could get a therapy animal any dog you had any animal you had you could get declared your therapy animal usually what was happening\nIs you had two kinds of people that were the people who actually needed a therapy animal or a seeing eye dog or something along those lines\nAnd then there was the freaky people who had their little tiny Paris Hilton dogs and ... daddy didn't want to leave movies at home so they would get the little rat dog declared a therapy dog and that way they could take it to restaurants and all that kind of stuff\nAnd after that you started things seen things get kind of weird and this is where we are where things are getting kind of weird\nJust a year and a half ago there was a therapy duck on the airline well\nA woman was removed from a frontier airlines flight last night after you get the after the airline refused to let her fly with her emotional support squirrel well how do you even know you're going to be emotionally supported by a squirrel [noise]\nSee see I just want to know she needed it and then she did need a therapy duck we all know that there is no therapy duck this woman just have a pet duck and she wants to take it places so that she'll be able to show people are pet ducks you and give a damn about that why would you even think where are you sitting around in the animal support officers\nAre going just going through hell right now I just can't take it right now and they just hand you various animals until one of them lowers your blood pressure how did they decide on a squirrel thing\nBut if it had a squirrel the airlines that'd be a woman noted in your reservation for flight sixteen twelve from Orlando, Florida the Cleveland that she wouldn't be boarding with an emotional support animal but she didn't see what kind\n'cause it's a freaking squirrel she never indicated that the animal is a squirrel or to the airline adding that rodents including squirrels are not allowed on its flights\nBecause they're evil and they carry disease beginning November first front ... frontier will only allow dogs and cats audits flights as emotional support animals the passenger was told of the airline policy and refused to leave the plane when asked Orlando police were called and everyone was forced\nTo the plane and the woman was scored it off the flight [noise]\nAnd everybody got to get back on the plane why do people not you know we've seen this over and over again\nWhen they tell you get off the plane there is never in the history of flight especially not since nine eleven\nThere has never been a time when somebody was ordered off a flight ... got to stay because they were just be a little ... children and decided to buy you can't get here and you know\nWhat to do anything to me and they all they always have to kick everybody else off the plane and then they have to pull the more on off the plane they always always always have to get I don't know why they think they're special [noise] the annoying thing though is they're still going to be allowing dogs and cats as therapy animals [noise]\nI flew with dogs and I've flown with cats are as therapy animals and not not a therapy but the ... that were on the plane and so what they were doing is just again it's an elderly couple whose ... real children don't love them any more I'm guessing\nSo they bought a dog and it's there for a baby and they name it and they buy a little treats and they buy a little close and they love it and they and they spoil it and it's just a freaking dog who's one day going to die and poop all over your stuff and they won't care at all [noise]\nThere's no therapy involved right [noise] well I'll be back tomorrow for Shawn Ryan from four to seven stick around Lars Larson is next it's four five six fifty seven a new start five fifty Katie ass\nTightest Webster to tell you about some folks that makes them absolutely great
