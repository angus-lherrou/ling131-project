to eat a lot of ice cream anyway\nBut Ben and Jerry's decided a long time ago to be very very political I think they're also more than a little bit hypocritical because\nThey wanted to run a company and say well we're going to give away all the profits and all this stuff and then turned out they didn't want to give away all the profits well they're still using the company to some extent\nA from a political standpoint and they've come out where they resist ice cream to match up with some of the current political rhetoric that's going on and uh and I think it's silly I mean if they want to do it it's their company but I don't like\nI I I kinda don't like the insertion of politics as much as I talk about it\nIn the things that shouldn't inherently be political I asked Tyler merit to join us

thanks for coming on the show tonight Tyler\nHey thank you so much and I I Am not a diabetic and I do eat ice cream but I I'm going to stick to some other ... ...\nYeah what do you think of the the idea that that folks running an ice cream company would say we're going to make his political and suggested if you buy this particular flavor of ice cream that you're somehow joining the resistance are showing your support for resistance\nBut can he can really early on us I think that's what makes this country amazing is that a\nPrivate companies have the ability to take a stance and they said this is what I Believe it I have a fan base right now and obviously\nWe are are in the business of selling apparel and and I got at a ... you know that patriotic American and I feel that a large majority of the United states falls it's category is silent majority we share beliefs and opinions\nSo we know they always said that sometimes we're villa and ... reason but\nI I Love taking the opportunity when individuals like Ben and Jerry's or Nike decide to take a stance because it's one of ... and disrespect sometimes I'm ... and it gives me the opportunity to say you know there's another Side Story\nWell I I look I'm with you I I tell my listeners all the time that a private company has the right to do whatever whatever they want but it just seems odd in America especially in America it's constantly preaching goes about we have to be tolerant of other people if somebody was born on a boy and his now\nSees himself as a woman we have to tolerate that we have to tolerate this and that and the other thing but when it comes to our political lives were told no no that tolerance isn't necessary at all and in fact a private company may even say you know basically a big middle finger to you or we don't even want you to use our product because we're going to name it in such a way\nThis resist word that's being used that\nThey're going to resist the results of the twenty sixteen election I actually think that's kind of on American\nUh because she goes you're saying I've always been proud that we have a country that as a peaceful transition of power either every four years or every eight years and that's a plus because a lot of countries don't have that you've been in some countries that don't have peaceful transitions of power they don't even have peace in between the transitions of power and so we have that\nAnd then we have a bunch of people saying we're going to make it our mission to\nPush back and resist the choice of the American people when they chose a president to years ago\n[noise] I agree and by large he's the middle east is kind of an oxymoron and we talk about\nA democracy democracy versus a theocracy versus you know socialism and that's what we're talking about right now it it is to seal is Suzie Suzie sociologist like I don't really know how to call them\nAt the socialist these individuals believed in a system that is just fundamentally unproven and even these\nIconic individuals Ben and Jerry they say they want to give away all the profits and then when it comes down to it they realize that\nYou know but by and large that's not within our human nature we want to be successful you want to get that and really the actions\nSpeak louder than words and nine line apparel we have nine line foundation we build houses for veterans when we are creating a community called the veterans village where you take homeless veterans off the street and we help educate them and get them into some sort of employment what I\nAsked him that you were to ask you Ben and Jerry's is why don't you put your profits where your mouth is instead of preaching of all these things talking about the things that shouldn't be done by someone else and saying that I'm going to donate some of my money\nOut there you know really we're talking about less than one percent of total earns a well why not put some your action jihad it put a little bit more of that that type you know and it had doomed to others as you want like\nTo be done to you it's preached in the obviously the folks who face a why can't we just adhere to it in the civilian practice\nI'd like to see that happen in fact I think it would have been a lot more fun and a lot more all American Ben and Jerry's had come out with a [noise] I don't know some red Trump or you know paint Trump or ice cream and and then the the the resist stop and say\nJust pick your flavor because in America we can have all the waivers ruined and then been injured twice as much ice cream because they're selling your both sides I've seen\nSome other retailers sell soft drinks and cans like that and I think snapple even decided to do a red and blue version so that they're heading up to the election you could choose do you choose read or do you choose blue I thought that was much more the attitude\nThat Americans can believe whatever they want to believe now that we don't stone people to death for their believe like happens in some countries\nAbsolutely so one of the things that I really like to see is the fact that people look at the issues at hand it's not read said it's not lose faith it's the idea that there's issues\nThat need to be discussed it if we can vote along the lines of the issues that we want to be addressed which is what happened this last election you know people were tired of\nSeeing some of the things that we held near and dear to our hearts deteriorate ... and people believe that the current administration was going to make true on their promises it if we can vote along our our belief systems and and are you know issues and get away from the politics of just\nVoting blindly red and blue [laughter] then I think this country came to progress\nTyler um document Tyler married for nine line a former army captain retired army captain helicopter pilot Apache helicopter pilot would you mind explained for my audience where you came up with the main non line what it signifies and what it is you're selling to the public and what your financing in a way of some of the good the works that you mentioned a moment ago\n[laughter] yeah ... is a cat that call it's a call for help on someone's injured on the battlefield they call for an outline and its guys like me and there's a lot of other people like me\nOut there they they they come in to help as individuals do when the ones that side and the the the bleeding stops there's still a need for continuing care and the idea behind nine\nLine is to bring together those who served and those who support and to create a conversation there and it's\nA comic of wanting to give back to those shows iconic of wanting to stands on ... of a ... and not desperate to fly low pay homage to it and what it represents and the people who have given their lives to sacrifice to this country\nOil illegal and so there are some people who certainly want to do that but to your point more specifically even the people who aren't that crazy that people were pushing sixteen thirty one this carbon tax which is a tremendously expensive say this is a good first step\nSo they already have their next steps planned or even if this passes this is hardly the last thing that they're going to do and they admit that where they're going to spend the money\nSo there is a ... member board only one of those members is actually elected by the voters wash and that's the commissioner of the plants the other fourteen are appointed by the governor and so there's an elected body and gets to spend the money however they want they have some basic guidelines about how to spend\nYou know for clean energy and four forest restoration and then for social justice programs they have a special pot of money but the initiative says that they can spend the money on anything late seemed to be important to meet the goals of the initiative but it's even worse than that which is that\nBy Washington state's constitution they don't get to choose where to spend the money in the legislature has the final say in what has happened in the past\nIs that the legislature simply takes the tax money and spend it on what they want which would make this just a billion dollar a year tax increase\nAnd you don't have to trust me on that a governor Inslee actually was talking to the effort Herald recently and said that he doesn't trust the legislature because they will just sweep the money out of these funds so really at the end of the day the legislature can do whatever they want with this billion dollars a year\nBy the way on those numbers I gave I I Can't recall and that's where I was looking for the source on the other ... that they're proposing er or could be a bit Justin Trudeau has already said they need fifty at times so that would be more than triple a Washington state is considering\nAnd ah there's a leaked document or the Canadian taxpayers association says\nThey need three hundred dollars a time in US dollars are to be able to uh you know to be able to do that that would raise the tax on a leader of gasoline about a quarter of gasoline in Canada to sixty eight cents per liter\nOr so to say two and a half three dollars per gallon to buy gasoline in Canada they started doing those and Washington state's not the only state voting on this this time around is it\nWhy is it definitely has the most dramatic increase or ... other states are looking at in California is looking at it\nColorado has a different initiatives dealing with natural gas um but art is really drawing attention in fact the New York times recently came out and editorialized telling the voters of Washington that they should\nPass the carbon tax and and the people who are yes on sixteen thirty would've been touting the fact that the New York times says yes they've been last local about the fact the Seattle Times the spokesman review\nThe tri city here all the ACA will Herald a number of other papers of all set now\nAnd by the way when they spend this money if the board that decides to spend the money if they spend it on failed projects were failing projects where the money doesn't actually do any good what happens\nFirst there's no accountability so that nobody gets kicked off the board nobody says look you chose badly you're out of here\nTo the contrary they actually get

Native Americans might be a great example of that because the Eighteen the fourteenth amendment literally made them not citizens because as I understand it had an that had to be\nFixed legislatively we had to pass laws saying no Native Americans are American citizens if they choose to be because apparently there were some tribes\nThat we're not a record not or would they were they chose not to be affiliated with the United states in the way the most drugs are today where I didn't go most every Native American today is both the ... a member of a sovereign nation and an American citizen at the same time would have the time the fourteenth amendment said they were not an invalid\nThe Congress tried to fix up right\nAt that that's right so actually one of the first cases at that really addresses this issue is is a case called el the Wilkins are from the mid early Eighteen eighties in which there was a Native American who was born on an Indian reservation he later cut ties with his tribe\nThat goes in and lives a year off the reservation and he goes to vote in a state election and\nThe government says you're not an American citizen so he used to saying well yes I Am I was born in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction of the United states and the court in that case says\nNo you're not a citizen when you were born at the time you were born you were born subject uh in large part to the jurisdiction and owning sovereignty to your tribe\nSo you were not a ... in that ... in the moment you were born you are not subject completely to the jurisdiction of the United states and you are not a citizen and so that was something that as you noted essence it wasn't under the fourteenth amendment Congress that years later passed\nA law granting citizenship to Native Americans or should they accepted that she should they should they're tried to be okay with that and so that was not something another fourteenth amendment and in fact\nSomething that the courts and and everybody involved the greed or even though they were born in the United states the geographic United States they were not subject to the jurisdiction of the United states under the fourteenth amendment\nNow Amy I'm darn movies were legal policy analyst in heritage\nHere's the throne of your issue except I I think this one's got a simple answer too but I'm a non lawyer so you know I don't worry about billable hours I don't have to make things complicated\nAh the president says I can for those who are the executive order and I of all these losers use or large you didn't like what Obama did and I said no I didn't like it when Obama said I Want to train federal immigration laws says you have to cook the DACA kids out because that's what the law said and he tries to fix the law by signing a piece of paper is no dad is\n... you can change the law by San ... paper you can't\nPresident Trump does not proposed to change the constitution or amended who does not proposed a dream federal law he merely says\nAll the way along the federal bureaucracy has recognized or has said in effect the the the fourteenth amendment says if you're born here no matter what your circumstances you're an American citizen we're now going to change that interpretation\nCan he do that with an executive order\n[noise] well so what let me start off by saying that it's incredibly hard to speculate because we don't have\nAn executive order in front of us don't have the language of what he purports to deal with it but that being said this is very very different from a for instance what you saw under DACA where\nThe Congress passed a law there are laws regarding the deportation of people who are in the United states illegally and the Obama administration essentially said we don't like that we're going to prioritize so that certain individuals are not deported and also on top of that even though Congress gave us no authority to do this we're going to uh make it so that\nCertain individuals have legal status or outside of what Congress has stated that that's a lot different from a president saying look there is no clear authority especially not from the Supreme Court not from Congress as to what the\nFourteenth amendment means with regard to the children of illegal aliens and so it would be well within his his\nConstitutional authority to save\nA instruct executive agencies who issued passports and Social Security numbers that they're going to to execute the laws in a manner that is\nConsistent with this very limited view of of who is and who is not a citizen that given that Congress hasn't really said one way or the other and at the Supreme Court certainly has not ruled on that but\nEspecially not in the last hundred and Twenty years or so it's two very different situations there um but again hard to speculate we don't actually know what this executive order might say\nBut at least we finally get a test of those who will I mean I'm sure it'll be fairly quickly challenged by someone although do they have to wait until somebody is through harmed in the eyes of the law by the implementation of those before they're going to actually ...\nAs somebody who's ... accused of crossing the border illegally\nNow they can only hold him for about two weeks if they hold him that long and then they have to cut them loose so many of them are cut loose right away they are told here's a piece of paper show up in court because the court just so clogged up with so many of these people\nA show up in three or four months or six months now do you know to a fair certainty what that person who's crossed in illegally\nDoesn't give a damn about our laws and his told to show up in court in McAllen, Texas or El Paso or somewhere you know somewhere on the border uh San Diego he's told to show up in court what do you suppose are the chances he'll actually show up\nAt ... or like I say that what they but it's still the fact that we have a lot of the ... the world what our country about the\nOil well I ... I got to tell you something you did you watch any of the news coverage of the migrant of the Muslim invasion of of Europe and the last couple of years is Syria was coming apart\nYes I did\nDid you see some of those European countries erecting big physical barricades to say you can't come in because when they ask people to obey their laws the folks just said no we're not going to a bad now this crowd got to the border ... they they left Honduras\nAs near as I can tell traveled through Guatemala without any legal permission to do that they got to the Mexican border and found a locked gate have you seen the videos you out of what they did to the locked gate\nAnd what they call it the liberal ...\nWell ... they got a liberal media over there and show\nEverybody well well not like like everybody well you know what they're looking at it out on every great presidents they're ... they're going to get that\nDo you know part of being an adult as an individual and part of being a country if you're a real country\nYou may listen to your critics from other countries who say well you guys are terrible and it you could look at your own actions if you're an honest law abiding person or an honest law loving country freedom loving country and say go ahead and criticize us we've looked at what we're doing this is what we have\nTo do to exist as a country we're not doing anything evil were saying if you want to come into our country come in legally or not at all\nAnd all I'm telling you is the practical problem and the reason I'm Glad to see the president\nTake troops who are already on the payroll and you know so we're still paying\nWhen they when you start to see the mainstream media start to add\nUp the cost just remember most of those costs are costs were already paying\nYou know the average service member who's sitting on a base somewhere deployed somewhere but in most cases that are going to be somewhere they go out and train every single day so we're already paying their paychecks we're paying for their child we're paying for the place where they live or most of it\nAnd uh and we paid to have them go out and performed training exercises if they do that on the border\nInstead of doing it wherever they're station right now\nThe difference in cost is only the cost of getting them there\nAnd getting them home but if we put troops on the border I Know that some people are shocked by this idea\nBut I'm telling you if you let these people cross the border\nOnce they're in they will be caught at great expense but they will be logged in as you're supposed to show up in court and then there'll be turned loose and they will disappear into America\nAnd the next time they'll turn up they'll be in a sanctuary city like the one I broadcasts from which shameful enough is a sanctuary city and they will say\nGosh our police will not even help the authorities catch you so they know once you get past the border patrol once you get more than a hundred miles out and and border patrol can't act on you anymore and ice has been effectively or ... or or you know in mass\nScale aided by cities that say we're not going to help you the next step is great I can stay here forever and nobody's going to touch me\nWell Donald Trump is going to change that and the Democrats better get with the program they'd better remember that Harry Reid didn't like the idea of birthright citizenship and he said so he said it was insane Bill Clinton said we can't just let people come into our country without\nLegal permission in ...
