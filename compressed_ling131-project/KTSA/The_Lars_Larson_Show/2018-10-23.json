eight six six eight Lars that's eight\nSix six four three nine five to seven seven emails go to talk of Lars Larson dot com Twitter poll should the government identify what is and what is not gender the Trump Administration is the way the New York times tells urban take that into account\nThe Trump Administration is considering narrowly defining gender as a biological immutable condition determined by Jenna tail yet at birth wow what a crazy idea you determine whether you're a boy if you got one of those and a girl if you got one of these what\nAre crazy narrow minded idea except that the New York times doesn't seem to recognize that an awful lot of us think that's exactly how you determine gender if not no it's whatever comes into your head\nSpeaking of that and anonymous gay male is step forward over the weekend they're released a shocking description of how he was allegedly sexually assaulted by senator Cory Booker\nBack four years ago the man claims Booker came to his workplace to give a speech met him as he was coming out of the men's room pulled him back into the restroom and then sexually assaulted in the young man is a gay man and is a Democrat\nThe man tells a very detailed analysis about what took place at work\nHe says he reached out to Ronan Farrow\nBut to me to reporter did not show much interest the gateway pundit reached out to civil rights lawyer Herman Dylan and was told the man is considering the situation has no further comment at this point and by the way\nPresident Trump announced this morning that he's going to start the process to cut or reduce aid to Central American countries that have not stopped a caravan of illegal aliens\nOver the past few days the caravan has grown to seven thousand people some are even saying closer to ten thousand it's only estimates at this point\nSo the president tweeted out this morning Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador will not be able to do the job of stopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to the United states we will now be getting cutting off for substantially reducing the massive foreign aid that is routinely given to them\nAnd I think that's absolutely appropriate let's go let's go to John first who wants to talk about the blue wave that Peter Raw for Newsweek and I were both discussing John what's on your mind denied\nIt lord it's I'm kind of a history buff and you know I haven't heard anybody mentioned is that yes you hear about the uh the blue wave coming and everything well\nIf you go back to two thousand and two terms they were saying the same thing on in the one George Bush was in office mhm and then after the election was over the Republican that two Senate seat\nBut remarkably they picked up eight seats in the house and it was such a devastating blow it will remember Richard Gephardt at the time was believed that the majority whip up so that he will sign that post\nAnd now I'm kind of wondering you know you know what her name is Nancy Pelosi she has lost in two thousand and two thousand twelve two thousand fourteen to say it but on the show [laughter]\nI just I think all these predictors are going to turn out to be wrong or I think some of it is whistling past the graveyard for people who are themselves a bit favoring the Democratic party and some of them a lot favoring the Democratic party\nAnd they've decided this is the only thing they've got left hatred for Trump hatred for what he's doing which most Americans look at and say well it's working out pretty good\nFor me why do you hate this and they've decided well okay that's why you get things like this vox is reporting tonight the numbers are in in Trump is up so despite all the negative\nThe city of the last two years and especially the last two months a Rasmussen poll shows that President Trump is more popular at this point in his presidency than President Obama was and at times the difference is almost ten percent\nThe poll released by the wall Street Journal and NBC News shows that Trump's approval is the highest it's been since he was elected\nAnd I'll remind you he's more popular than Obama was at the time\nObama got nothing but great press the first two two years he was in office frankly he got it most of the eight years that it was an office but the first two years were almost it was this slobbering love affair between the mainstream fake stream press and Brock Obama\nMeanwhile Trump got exactly the opposite every reporter with a TV camera or a microphone or an Internet Web page was telling you all the reasons you should have Donald Trump\nSo it was all that he is now beating Obama by as much as ten points it's extraordinary let's go to Diane Diane you've heard is talking to be talking about that invasion caravan is headed north that I Know is going to reach our border before election day what's your take on it\nWell I live in California first college thank you very well thank you very concerned about

election just\nTwo weeks away make sure you vote and encourage other conservatives devote as well\nOne of the things you're going to hear heading up to this election is that if we don't put Democrats back into control not only\nAre we not going to get the civility that Hillary Clinton promises but their health care is going to go away as well only it seems that the Democrats who've been responsible for trying to take health care opportunities away from Americans\nPhil ... is president of American commitment a nationally syndicated columnist and the author of democracy denied Phil it's good to have you back on the program\n...\nTo one of the Democrats been doing to take health care way\nWell they are trying to ban all the non Obamacare plans that Trump's deregulatory efforts are bringing to market and uh\nIt's really incredible that they're doing this because for years and years and years including last year during the health care debate the one thing that Democrats in the media always touted above everything else was what's your coverage number how many people are going to be covered under this policy what's your total what's the impact how many people will lose\nHealth coverage and then that's always there headlines when it plays in their favor but when it comes to banning not Obamacare plans which of course would take healthcare way for millions of people will be attractive to attracted to those plans because the premiums are\nSixty to eighty percent lower I'm suddenly they don't want to talk about that even though their own estimates from liberal groups shows that uh the bill that Democrats voted on just a couple of weeks ago to ban short term plans which is one of the deregulated non Obamacare options that Trump has brought back to market\nI even the liberal think tank show that's going to take away a health coverage for about two million people every single Senate Democrat voted for that\nAnd I didn't see a single headline anywhere except for my own article that I wrote a pointed that out so I said a ... shift that suddenly they don't care about coverage of snow\nFell I Want people understand what the short term plans are and they and and to understand why they're they're written as a short term these couldn't go up to one day shorter be or three hundred and sixty four days\nThey can be renewed for up to three years I don't think that should be limited either and they can be put together with a premium guaranteed prior to lock in a successor policy after three years without any risk of a premium be going out because\nYou know you you're locked into that kind of plan\nWhat possible objection good they have that other than that it undercuts Obamacare\nWell that's their whole argument right as they're saying you know that these plans are much less expensive and so that means that healthy people will pay for them\nAnd then the people are going to pay more in Obamacare but that's sort of a hassle kind of first level argument because if you think about it a little bit more um if you say that these plans are going to be guaranteed renewable that people who get sick are going to stay in these plants they're not going to go into Obamacare and they're going to\nMost likely have access to better networks of hospitals and doctors because those have been so restricted in Obamacare they're going to be happier and they're just\nEditor bomb and kiss their costs are not going to be pushed under Obamacare if they have guaranteed renew ability in this market in fact we're more likely to see the opposite and it is sort of eat the same as this thing is is that this argument misses are deliberately ignores is for the most part of the people who are in the Obamacare exchanges\nAre either already very very sick or more likely and this is about eighty five or Ninety percent of the people in them or they got their ... their exposure to premiums kept because there's subsidy eligible and so when prices go up they don't pay any more you and I and the tax payers pay more and so\nI think the ah it's really critical to have non Obamacare policies that are affordable because we've got millions of people in this country\nWho don't qualify for subsidies and therefore can't afford Obamacare policy and if they don't have something from their employer and they're not old enough for Medicare yet they're basically out of luck and millions of those people by the way we're paying the individual mandate penalty tax\nBecause they couldn't afford coverage until Republicans were killed that tax of course Democrats would like to put it back in place but it's not good enough to get rid of the penalty to get rid of the individual mandate if you don't also have deregulation and there's nothing for people to choose their no non Obamacare options available\nEven if Obamacare's voluntary rather than mandatory unless you also have the deregulation a deregulatory steps that we've seen from the Trump Administration and Democrats are basically saying look if we can't mandate Obamacare\nLet's ban all the other option so people have no other choice then they're stuck in it and I think that's you know if our guys were any good at talking about health care on the stump they would be carrying Democrats up on that thing so horrible votes from them and they somehow said we're protecting preexisting condition or a physician's\nWhich makes no sense because this you know they're basically voted to repeal a guaranteed renew ability and the short term market well you know if you get sick and developed a preexisting condition\nGuaranteed renew abilities of great protections you don't have to go into Obamacare and yet that's exactly what they voted to repeal so if anything it was the opposite of what they kind of made their talking point on this vote in the media basically let them get away with it except they paid attention at all\nYou know fill over the weekend I heard more people talking about pre existing conditions\nDo I I Want to I Want you to test my numbers on this and see if this works I Wish we could knock this issue out altogether once and for all and here's how I Do it\nI've talked to a few different experts including balancing the coin you and others who knows this issue well and they say\nYou know for all the talking about pre existing conditions the total number of people who meet that description is about four hundred thousand and they base that on the number of people who signed up with Obamacare for pre existing conditions and the number of people who are in risk pools\nBefore Obamacare came along his four hundred thousand people out of three hundred and thirty million people in this country\nAnd the total cost of covering those people it's a high premium it averages thirty two thousand dollars a year but in terms of a national\nPolicy is twelve million dollars is a drop in the bucket in a federal budget that is four thousand billion dollars and you need twelve dollars twelve billion dollars to cover it if we passed\nA law that said if you are you know judge to have a pre existing condition and it's not it's one that actually takes a lot of money to cover\nThen we're just going to cover you were just period unless you you know make more than five hundred thousand dollars years I mean you could send some income limits on and you knock that issue out altogether and say now let's solve the rest of the problem was let the private sector do most of it and the only other big issue I'm aware of\nIs the one where people say but if you're going along happy and healthy and something strikes you down you need a above a triple quadruple bypass or you need a liver transplant or something like that\nSay fine look so catastrophic plans ... not have the government do it well let's have the private sector of the government were to say to the private sector insurance folks hey\nCan you come up with a product that's what they called the insurance industry my wife used to work for ... a long time ago um have a product that will cover you for catastrophes right it's a kind of coverage most people have if they paid off their cars just one policy that covers ... only if things go completely terribly wrong and those can be sold very cheaply to\nNow you've covered people for catastrophic loss you've covered all the people the four hundred thousand that are that have ... existing conditions now the rest of it for the most part\nIs the stuff where people wanted Obamacare to pay for maintenance basically they wanted you to pay for everything from birth control pills to your annual checkup and everything else which I don't think should be the subject of insurance any more than I think my car insurance should cover the maintenance on my car now my wrong on the numbers that are not getting this wrong\nWell I I Would I Would disagree only with your last point at the end there because Obamacare actually in practice has extremely high did not know that we are all paying these\nVery high premiums are not getting coverage on any of that routine stuff or even a more expensive stuff than that and so you know the the perverse\nMostly because I Want to stay away from the crazy\nThat's all that's all this man I look in her eyes today\n\nEspecially when she realized the uh the the entertainment center didn't match the coffee table oh God ha ha\nHa ha ha ha ha ha ha or\nThe oil was flashing running holes in their walls scary stuff man there's\n[laughter] here Steve man I did I got the hell
