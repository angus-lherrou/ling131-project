and I don't run around and say well I've got a thousand Jersey those are two guys ensures that I Do have a four one K.\nSo I Do have a dog in the fight and in in my concern about looking up at the screen when I'm standing in the studio and seeing that\nThe market has dropped dramatically or they just lost a lot of points are in the last year or so you're racing some of the games through twenty Eighteen so I'd want to talk to a doctor Michael butler a who's a public policy analyst economics expert and a professor of finance at Stockton University in New Jersey\nDr ... thank you very much for joining us tonight\nWell hello large thank you for having me it's my pleasure to be here\nWell should we all be very very very concerned that the market has has had some dramatic changes in the last couple of weeks\n[noise] well there's one thing that you can be sure of and that is that the stock market will fluctuate the question is are we looking at a big down a cycle with the stock market or is this just a perhaps a collection that will um end soon we'll get back to normal\nOr so there's a whole lot of factors that um affects stock prices mostly\nWhen somebody buys stocks they're looking at um what they expect the corporate profits to be into the future if they could company has got to make a good profits a stock prices will go up you'll get there\nDid you end up buying stocks like that if you perceive that the company is going to have a decline in profits\nThen there'll be less or evidence for you if if any and stock prices will will fall right so a today there's a lot of uncertainty and the uncertainty has brought about by a number of of things uh one um the Federal Reserve\nTo get us out of the last recession and to get that meets recovery\nGoing dramatically increased the money supply and dropped interest rates near zero well about two years ago they started raising rates and they're on a very aggressive path or to get interest rates higher\nThey've raised him three times this year they're probably going to raise them again in December as interest rates go up\nOr some investors say look I was buying stocks for good will returns I'm not sure what's going to happen with the economy next year interest rates are higher now but some people say well let me get out of the stock market and uh and do a debt instrument where I can take advantage of the increase in interest rates\nAre so what are some of the things that make\nPeople feel that maybe the economy is not going to do so well next year I'm\nInflation is starting to come up a little bit\nThe Federal Reserve will not allow that to happen which means they're likely to push interest rates\nHigher that will put a dampening on the economy um we're in the middle of a foreign trade war\nOr nobody's really sure how that's going to end up right um so that adds a bunch of uncertainty and in my view the biggest um cause of the uncertainty in the market is political rather than economic\nYou know some of the doctor bustle using I don't know how to be resolved two weeks from now when we're past the election or or is that I knew it whenever you think it will\nI Do I Do I think I'm the mainstream media I Am is pretty much has pretty much convinced people that are the the leadership of the house of representatives will change\nOr if that does happen um the Democrats have said look this tax cuts that the Trump pushed through last year the majority of it went to wealthy people that's not fair we're going to reverse that I'm\nA bay a hold on to reverse that\nDoctor they'd have to have the house the Senate and the signature on the resolute desk right\n... yes I'm not going to have a very difficult time doing that a particularly if the Senate maintains control Republican control and President Trump won't won't sign it but there are some things that the house can do a true resolution buy them themselves\nEven if they don't raise\nTaxes uh they're certainly not going to support President Trump's latest plan which says we should I look for another tax cut this one geared a little more toward consumers rather than business the last tax cut\nThe the purpose of it was to increase economic growth and then indeed that now to increase economic growth we have a capital intensive economy so to increase economic growth you have to create new capital he did that by reducing corporate tax rate\nFrom an average of thirty five percent down\nTo Twenty one percent and he or reduce personal income taxes for everybody including the upper class and the upper classes the one that creates new\nCapitals so the first tax cut was geared to economic growth\nUm there is a feeling that uh the higher income people and they did made out better than\nA middle income people so now Trump is pushing um another middle class tax cut if the Republicans maintain control both houses he's likely to get that if the day he died if they're Republicans don't he's not likely to get that and I think they are\nA investor community is saying ah look all the same as Trump has been doing to stimulate growth which appear to be working I don't have a difficult time keeping that up if the house of representatives with\nDr ... let me ask you why do we need to cool down the economy I understand the concern about inflation\nBut the fan of says gee the economy is doing too well we're growing too fast\nWell what is too fast and can we grow without having too much inflation would a little bit of inflation right now necessarily be a bad thing we we didn't have much inflation\nDuring all of the eight years of Obama before making a briefing on to it would it would it be that bad if we had a little bit of inflation along with a massive amount of growth if the fed would stop crunching the economy\nYou know it's funny I just wrote a column in the hill a few days ago arguing that uh exact point\nThe twelve month inflation rate for the last couple of months outs hire the Hispanics in a to point seven range but it has been inching down a little bit because we've pushed interest rates up\nNew home sales the last five months of death\nExisting home sales have death so\nI'm there doesn't look to be any inflationary pressures yet and I think the Federal Reserve is over reacting to this similar to what you just said we can get much higher quote what Ronald Reagan cut taxes in Nineteen eighty one went into effect in Nineteen eighty two\nTrump models his tax cut after Reagan ... when Reagan tax cut winning in eighty two in Nineteen eighty four\nThe economy had an annual growth rate of seven and a half\nPercent so the fact that we're up in the four rains and tomorrow the third quarter number comes out of ... being a high three we're nowhere near an overheated\nSo tell me this um you see all this tape and I don't think you need this discussion you and I are having if anybody's concerned that we're giving away trade secrets that are going to enable some bomb or to be a better bomber I don't think that's the cases ... out in the public domain but with all the tape that was used on that package\nOr the package is the fact that ... put on there but they were apparently delivered by ... service would you explain the lack of cancellation of the stadiums and all the tape on both the packaging the bomb\nHe's almost impossible isn't it just put the bond without getting fingerprints DNA on it\nAnd it was a that would be nearly impossible to what we really have to be concerned about it and\nWhy it's important to you like to see this is that we don't get struck by what looks to be an average for a situation that we get hit hard by something real that that makes us believe\nThat we're okay in the current situation 'cause it's not that so it doesn't know what they're doing we never want to believe and if you remember that I did it or if it was a ... devices in Iraq and\nAfghanistan and with the most deadly weapon we are seeing the psychology around using a cell phones and pressure devices and being able to trigger this a long distance\nIs a is white issue was formed in the military is much more successful now in in a in a using that on the battlefield to turning out where it was it how it was before before it happens in ... when they when they lay down their first unexploded devices\nAnd ship so that has created a you'll ... you'll hear a lot less of a military is because of this you know the worst backwards to military and what they have in their ...\nHave you ever seen a criminal or whoever did this is a criminal plain and simple you ever seen one who deliberately tried to you know create a situation like this so that it looked like it was done by an amateur but it really wasn't\nYou know that's an interesting question because I think some people believe these kind of cereal criminals or there'll be murders or bombers ought to be caught they don't even remember the Unabomber Ted Kaczynski what twelve years a ... a and actually it was successful until they treat people\nAn injury and some of the neighborhood of twelve to Fifteen more before he was caught but what caught it wasn't necessarily a good place where it was the forensic just writing it is rather recognized so the fact of the matter is\nIs that these people do not necessarily want to get caught and if it's more than one individual then we're going to have\nAn issue that eventually whoever it is it's got to be let me just say that that will that will tell us a lot more about what we don't know now that doesn't that doesn't mean that just pattern is starting to get set in the United states and I think that's what they're concerned about\nIs that we always chasing guns and gunfire and\nBaked on weapons just as the kind of stuff that ... that puts a population that is because it is so there's so many of those of us just it's a mystery\nBombs explosives or history will be on the list or or understanding and while we can put it goes ... and maybe we should from time to time these kind of things that was certainly a lot of states is of great concern is kind of situation without us if this person's successful or not\nYou know I the one thing that occurred to me and I don't you know I don't like big brother Bernie I'm Talking to Bernie juice the former ... but if he had a courier delivered this package\nI Wonder whether the courier companies whether it might be good for them if they don't all ready to have cameras so that when somebody dropped off a package or did they you know that they see who the person is that they keep her record of it\nYou know and I know that can be touchy because there may be but but any time somebody is sending a package\nTo someone else if they're doing something illicit like sending drugs that I Want to give I Want to see him get caught if they're sending legitimate packages then then it's you know it's never going to be anybody else's business because all but but in this case this guy apparently\nIn some way we don't know how it was delivered to the courier who then delivered it but he handed it off to someone and it would seem like\nThat's a pretty obvious way for a bomb or to get caught Bernie thank you

like that system by all means propose a constitutional amendment to do away with the electoral college\nI won't be supporting you in that effort because I think the electoral college protect something that the founders of this country geniuses all of them anticipated the idea that the large population centers even than with Thirteen Colonies they knew that the large population centers would say we

the abandon with which the media got out in front of what we know about\nSensitive which so far is not a whole lot\nUm it was really staggering to me I mean the the the trench Eric determination to try to make this about Trump and even kind of vaguely or not so vaguely suggest that Trump a\nSort of it in sided this or that his rhetoric um it is so unique\nAnd uniquely bad for the country that it might have driven somebody to do this is just really a\nMind boggling ... op ed piece coming out on a colon coming out on National Review about this tonight but you know just\nWhen you when you move out of the world of political uh talking points and narrative and soap opera like we deal with and you get into the real world of like prosecutions on the court room and a jury common people's common sense\nI'm most normal people understand that nobody\nGoes out and commit mass murder attach on the basis of anything they erode a political rally no matter how obnoxious or odious it may be and it really trivializes this kind of terrorist behavior to suggest that it's driven by um something along those lines\nIt's it's just foolish\nWell I guess it is it is a pretty easy jumped to make to say give all of the bombs were sent to people who were you know in one way or another politically oriented toward the left from George Soros to Maxine Waters to the Clinton the Obamas and to CNN\n\nAbout

John welcome back\nThanks I've got a new piece of hope we're talking about America's house divided who's to blame yeah and that's it streamed out Oregon uh I have to say it would make this more sophisticated if I could say a pox on both your houses the right and left are equally guilty but uh I don't think that's true\nYou're not ... the moral equivalency that most reporters do or they say will have to be unfold\nRight right no I I don't think so I think that if you go back to like Nineteen Ninety six okay when Bill Clinton was president the left and right agreed on a list of really fundamental things that I'll just go through them quickly you're\nAmerican borders are sovereign and those who enter legally have no right to be here and they shouldn't get government benefits Bill Clinton Harry Reid Pat Buchanan George Bush all agreed on that the left has walked away from that\nAbout the Americans are fundamental gun rights under the second amendment though that can be regulated by the government their basic fundamental part of the constitution\nThe leftist walked away from that Hillary Clinton wants to overturn Heller case and and strip away the second amendment as a fundamental American right the ... the idea that the Supreme Court is just supposed to interpret the constitution as written and that the constitution is head of the sacred founding document\nNow you've got Democrats saying oh the Senate's undemocratic we need to get rid of it\nAll the Supreme Court now that the Republicans control it is a threat to democracy and they really need to abolish it about this one\nMen and women are are different but equal and each sex as part of a fundamental biological reality now the left is telling us sex is just a social contract\nThat I can identify as a woman or a tree frog anytime I Want and then flip back and it's entirely arbitrary again that's the left walking away from the common table\nAbout abortion but Bill Clinton was saying that\nAbortion be safe and legal but rare even the left acknowledged that of course it was a bad thing and they they want to discourage it now you've got I'm saying it's it's part of women's empowerment a shout your abortions story the feminist or say a back then everybody agreed that marriage is between a man and a woman and ideally for life now\nGay marriage has been imposed on fifty states by the Supreme Court and people are talking about polygamous marriage being being allowed by the courts\nHow about religious liberty we used to think that was fundamental now you've got you got Christian businesses getting sued into bankruptcy because they won't take part in same sex marriages\nFree political speech the left used to be for that now if what you say make someone feel unsafe the government can step in and arrest you for it and finally how about the idea of academia seeking objective truth\nAnd letting a free range of opinions you know be on campus even if it hurts people's feelings because that's how we find the truth now they're they're silencing free speech on campus and all those things\nThe left walked away from the American consensus and embraced extremist views and now they're screaming at us for being fanatics because we still believe what we did when Ronald Reagan and George Bush and Bob Dole and Bill Clinton that Harry Reid all agreed on all these things we didn't walk away they did\nAnd they believed and now let me ask you something soon as you and I are on the same page I think on just about everything every time I've talked to John I'm Talking to John ... from the stream and you're going to read this piece he's written um\nIf we were to try just as hard as you and I could could we come up with any kind of similar lack the list or or something like it I Know you\nI don't believe in the artificial moral equivalency were let's lift off the phone from both sides but if you tried to find out is there anything that the right has walked away from where it was on the same page as the left Thirty years ago\nI Can't think of a single thing honestly now I Know what I'm thinking single thing when we\nWere not calling for America to be a monarchy or a Christian government we're not calling for people to be put in internment camps were not calling for ... racial supremacy we're not doing any of the crackpot things\nThat they're accusing us of they're they're just redefining what the American consensus was in Nineteen Ninety six as a patriarchal white supremacists evil heterosexual heterosexuals patriarchy patriarchal monstrosity so the last to move the goalpost out of the stadium\nAnd they're calling us lunatics 'cause we're still on the fifty yard line\nNo do you think that some of those divisions caused by one side walking away from the consensus points\nIs what's causing all of this turmoil lately violence in the streets bombs sent to a bunch of\nOf liberals a political liberals and we don't know how many more may be on the way things are delivered in the mail do you think some of that is because we're we're putting Americans in a ... in a position where the two major political forces in the country\nUh one has walked away from the table and those dozen or so items and and that leads people wondering well ... than what am I supposed to do a riot when they're no longer consensus\nAlso I mean ... ... ... another item of consensus is when you lose an election you accept it yeah but but the left didn't accept even that Obama's and I know that much in two\nThousand eight was supposed to be a permanent fundamental transformation of the country wanting the election twenty sixteen that was supposed to be a formality like an election in East Germany where you just certify with the party has given you when the American people said no we won't take Hillary\nThe life was outraged this was supposed to be a permanent irreversible revolution under Obama so they really think that\nUnder a foreign occupation by foreign enemies that's why they have to have the resistance was just what you're doing the Nazis occupy your country not win Ohio votes against you\nWell and I know this happened when I was a little kid and you weren't even born John but when Nixon you know said okay I'll concede the race\nThere were folks who said no no we could fight over this winter we could win this one you know because there was probably cheating on both sides there were certainly cheating on the Democratic side he said for the good of the country I'll do that I think that's what the left thought was going to happen in two thousand with Gore and Bush and they fail\nAnd that drove them crazy and lately that that sort of we're going to to rush the barricades and they'll they'll simply open the doors for has happened with Kavanaugh when they said well we're going to throw all this stuff down they'll caved in and Republicans have finally grown the spine and said no we're not doing the cave in thing anymore\nAs we've accumulated for over a decade now we have little to no reason as conservatives to trust them on this and that's and that's that's what we're getting into any trust issues that you know\nAnd one of the ... the trick\nAnd this is what I wrote about this week that flick is okay whenever they censor conservatives I say oh well first of men or a publisher\nWe're publishing and we can do what other publishers to like ... times you know not everybody can you know there were times could decide oh of course all oh tears when it doesn't appear on their cages electronic appointed a that's fine however\nAnd in Nineteen Ninety six law Congress gave these a\nWeb sites a special status as platforms\nAnd the deal was okay if someone puts a libel is er slanderous content on the site ... chair made aware of it do Facebook whomever you take it down but you can't be sued\nFor libel or whether the person who posted it can but you can't mute Thai food for slander\nYeah and and they they have they have\nTo be careful about what they publish so maybe the answer is just for the Congress once we get past this election assuming we keep both houses on the Republican side is to say we're taking the ... the uh we're taking this way because you're a publisher you're acting like a publisher and you can take the full weight of all the all the punishment\nWell I I think we given me the option and I think at the end of the day they will have to choose to deal with the platform as an exchange\nThose extra protections against slander leibel and by the way\nIt will extra property fast you know Google owns YouTube if someone posts a full movie that they stole on YouTube\nAnd YouTube is responsible\nFor the ... the laws that are being violated\nSo they say they pay for that you're going to be an open platform and not censor anybody can jump from one foot to the other and say oh we're publisher or a platform right\nMoment to moment so I think at the end of the day to keep as much of an audience as they can bring your audience of course means more money I think they'll have to revert to\nOkay we're a platform nowhere to stop locking people they're just being a publisher\nJust so incredibly diminishes and they're still have to worry about you know if they're going to be left wing Ollie platforms publishers like New York times ... times audience doing you know I have to look at that and make the determination but it doesn't make any sense to do that\nBy the way what did you make of the New York times I was angry when I read this this morning that they had published a fantasy from an author and said oh it's a piece of fiction\nPolitical theater yeah political affairs or yeah so\nYou know the one about assassinating the president as this fantasy of where Donald Trump's next chapter is written\nAnd you know that anybody who calls this show who tries to talking about assassination of any president whether it was Obama or Bush or Clinton or Donald Trump I dumped that call and they never make it to the air and yet here's the New York times openly allowing somebody to fantasize\nAnd not just and and yes of course now we're back to gee you're a publisher you can choose who publishes and you choose a book beyond that it's the content\nWas if I'm not mistaken wash and tried to kill from gun GM or something Secret Service agent and gone to the ocean to finish the job that was very ...\nWhich was ugly because I Know people in the secret service and while they've had some scandals in the last ten years I think every one of them every man and woman there would throw himself or herself in front of a bullet to project\nIt'll be the largest whether they\nAgree with them or not and it's a huge insulted the secret service and the New York times and say well this is just one author you chose to publish that author you put it in front of your audience and you're going to have to take\nResponsibility for it or\nMaybe the pie that play Julius Caesar was stabbed to death on stage yet\nThey sure did and you you know what the reaction would have been at the New York times published a similar fantasy about Morocco Hussein Obama seat and thanks very much you've got

won't get the benefit of a a a reduced charge or no charge at all you're treated much better by prosecutors any sanctuary jurisdictions\nUm if you're a non citizen if you're an illegal immigrant than if you're a United States citizen um boy wow talk about talk about privilege we have an illegal immigrant privilege um so there is of course a law that prohibits a abetting a felon or or a crime actually any crime after the fact\nIt's been all in the news this is what they want to get Trump for for the non existent Russian collusion or right they are section three of the federal criminal code but but James Buckingham couldn't make it to section three never got there oh it's crazy there's no way we can go after the sanctuary cities\nYeah it took me six seconds on on on Google on Google defined accessory after the fact\nWilling in you pointed out and I remember the\nFight we're Arizona said if you're not going to enforce the immigration laws we Arizona well under a good governor and the Obama administration fought it tooth and nail and at least in the gorge one and they want under the premise that only the federal government can enforce immigration laws\nAnd you would think that that that would make it very clear about the other thing that occurred to me you're a lawyer as you point out in the column\nAnd as we pointed out before but isn't there an equal protection issue here I don't suppose the rest of us who are legal citizens the United states\nCould bring a massive ah you know go to a case against a class action case saying we're being denied equal treatment under the law\nYou have a certain class of people you're the one kind of treatment under the law and American citizens get lesser treatment believer and\nThat's actually a really great idea of one of the grounds on which it's illegal to ... to discriminate as place of birth and nationality on in this case I mean the assumption was discriminating against people who weren't your fellow citizens [laughter] no it's just the exact\nOpposite on people who are not our fellow citizens who commit crimes are being treated better by prosecutors are less likely to be charged with charge at all or charged with ah the maximum\nCrime they can be charged with in order to to make sure they stay here we got to keep the criminals here\nWell and and you know that there are at least a couple of places in America they are going to have a vote on this on November ... six to get rid of ... and I think the voters are going to vote to get rid of it but how do we convince so the New York times which thinks that it's terrible that Jeff Sessions we'd go to one of his deputies and say would you please research says\nAnd then and then the the New York times is an outrage and the deputy comes rings as\nNo couldn't find anything like that and the law and you find it in six seconds on Google\nIt's it's it's pretty amazing but there is an element on the left ah it it's been with us for a long time who just\nThey hate America whether they were um you know selling selling or giving nuclear secrets to the Soviet Union rooting for the Soviet Union over our own country um to today where they are rooting for the caravan to come across they just want to destroy the country now I think most elected Democrats\nAren't that hateful driven by a passion to destroy our country but they're certainly bucked up by those people and and\nThe position of most elected Democrats is number one ah the the the masses of third world are pouring into our country oh look they vote for the Democrats were all for them and number two it's just gotten to the point that whatever Trump is for their against it's worth mentioning that\nNot very long ago hearing elite Dianne Feinstein even Iraq Obama were against this influx of illegal immigrants bringing their path all like jeez I'm Dale poverty their medical problems to our country when we have our own people with allergies poverty and health problems that we need to take care of\nAnd and in fact we've been running a sound bite I mean it's it's amazing that the New York times is forgotten the great ... Hussein Obama\nWe simply cannot allow people to pour into the United states undetected undocumented unchecked and circumventing the line of people who are waiting patiently diligently unlawfully or the become immigrants in this country\nI guess the editors over the old grey lady just forgot all about that happening just a couple of years ago and congratulations on the success of resistance is futile how the Trump painting left has lost its collective mind and I appreciate your time did I\nTakes for the call man you know but you know I'm Sorry dude that you're writing my saying that correctly Christ is that what they use their colleagues said what do they say\nThat being the bat but Neal fifty new that being y'all be Neal mapping Neil ... new EPA Neal say you pickle that by Neal I had to give up\nThose stupid CDs because they're all there is such that the Spanish language CDs or so and ... say the word pickle around now said pickle again remember Neal and again I don't just shut up you know I just uh\nSo I think of this I'm going to do [noise]\nUh is open lines that we can talk about whatever you're on TALK about here is Daniel Daniel you're on your start five fifty K.
