Donald Trump he was in the oval office yesterday Trump sat there and just listen for the better part of ten minutes and it was fantastic\nAnd I know that on the left there saying well Tanya is a

friend and he's a senior fellow at the national Center for public policy research and co chair of the project Twenty one national advisory board or is it is good to talk to you again\nHey it's great to be able to program\nSo tell me about this what is what is Kanye West position on Donald Trump and some of the things he talked about yesterday to President Trump what does this mean for the the left politically and they seem to be losing their minds over it\nWell I Love how flexible the left can be you and I we come up with the principal\nOr standard and we try to adhere to it\nBut and it's hard it's hard you have to be consistent you have to be a logical you have to think it through the left side as well they don't really want to go through that work in that effort and so what they revel in if the double standard\nNow see it wasn't just that long ago and this is the problem that I have with so much of left it might be the case if twenty five years ago they said one thing and then they suddenly sorry say another thing today they can barely go Seventy two\nHours with the principal we heard\nFrom a number of celebrities that were explaining to us\nHow due process and the me too movement we're supposed to work and what we're supposed to do about the Kavanaugh accusations\nPeople who were on and for people who are very logical people who were mostly just passionate\nAnd didn't really have a comprehensive thesis were presented meet the press let a lift them alone oh\nCome on their their program gave her a prime opportunity on the Sunday Morning as if she were\nA deep and consequential thinker\nSomehow when Kanye West\nA celebrity not to be or the or even a great with Alonzo but eight and eight grade celebrity comes and visit the White House we're supposed to be under the impression\nThat he needed a special training in public policy and making sure that he spoke and quick short soundbites\nAnd the like the ... the hair was really really remarkable but it was ... I Believe born of desperation what he stands for is the kind of concern\nThat if other people regularly started acting out it would be very devastating to the cause of progressive well\nYou know a horse I think you're absolutely right about that is the number I shared with some of my audience earlier was this Donald Trump got about eight percent of the black vote in the twenties sixteen election\nAnd the point was made well Hillary got almost Ninety I think it was eighty nine percent\nWell that was eight percent in November sixteenth by the summer of Seventeen Donald Trump's approval among black Americans was twenty three percent not quite three fold greater than what he got just six or eight months before and then you say well where's your gun this year clearly he's been painted as a racist big it\nFor the last year and a half by the media\nHis ratings can't be very good no they're not eight percent they're not twenty three three times higher there's thirty five percent more than four times the support he got at the polls in sixteen\nAnd I think the left has looked at that and said\nWe're in trouble we bones these voters or at least that's their attitude I think toward black of American voters we own these people\nAnd they're they're going off the reservation they are now supporting Trump I mean what am I going to say when it goes from thirty five percent to say fifty percent by twenty twenty for the next election I think the Democratic party is going to lose its mind\nAll right so I Want to give you some data points to harm me the number of votes that ... that block Obama got a two thousand eight set a record for the number of blacks voting for Democrats [noise]\nIt was it had been approaching a higher and higher number from all the way from Ninety two to two thousand I guess what\nWe've seen it go in the opposite direction rock Obama in two thousand twelve set a record for nominee among black voters actually true for everybody but he's the only president to be successfully reelected\nAnd receive fewer black votes than he did\nWhen he was first elected since Roosevelt you name the candidate whether it was a Republican or Democrat they always managed to get more black voters the second time around what did those black voters no well here's what we got to see in two thousand six\nIf you just look at black men they gave Donald Trump\nThird team per cent of their vote\nIf in fact black women had voted the same way that black men did that would have been nearly a thirty year high the truth is we hadn't seen this divergence we didn't see it in two thousand twelve two thousand eight two thousand for their divergence\nYou gave me some stats that are accurate about the overall numbers there then a bike among black men for Donald Trump and for rejecting progressive is that most in the media aren't even wanting to talk about it as more than quadrupled\nWhile and you can imagine the effect tours all of us I think react this way if if there's someone I highly respect\nWho comes out and says I'm In favor of something I'm not going to avoid that I Would ignore the facts on the ground\nI don't always support what those I admire also support but it's a factor there and you know right now the facts are pretty good black entrepreneurship for absolutely ... percent increase in New black businesses in the last Eighteen months\nAnd then record low black unemployment and then a couple that with\nAdmirable figures for both black Americans in white Americans they ... they're going to be people who look and say well ... the guy\nMay maybe I should too and that may just pushing them over and I think that's what the Democrats are so concerned about that they are losing what they thought was a guaranteed piece of their electorate\nIt was the message that everyone was supposed to understand ... don't worry about what you said don't worry about what you feel just believe if the progressive socialist agenda is being pushed forward you're better off\nThere continue drug use thoroughly policy is that she cannot huge with any cabinet but everywhere else you're allowed to use so what you end up happening is is you have these individuals who are who are users going outside of the ... into the neighboring communities\nUsing heroine throwing the needles in these communities then going back to the place they're not allowed to wear the actually enforcing that\nWell because because their answer wasn't well let's see if we can stop the trafficking of heroin and and I know\nTally oh I don't know if you saw this or not but one of the things that struck me is\nThere's a desire by both politicians and media reporters to say well you know this is a problem created by the drug companies\nYou know I don't have any particular dislike or like I don't have a dog in the fight on drug companies but I've talked to some of the prosecutors and they say well Seventy two thousand people you're overdose on opioids in general\nBut all of that Seventy two thousand it's a terrific death toll I mean Fifteen hundred people a week across America\nThey say that other Seventy two thousand maybe six thousand are from pharmaceuticals the other sixty five thousand or from street drugs so street drugs are the big ...\nIslam heroin not opioids but it's easier to blame a big pharma company say well they're the drivers of all this and not blame the heroin that primarily Ninety percent of it is coming in from Mexico because then you'd have to come to grips with why is it coming across the border so easily well we know why\nHow could we stop it well there's a wall that somebody mentioned once that might be built that can help stop it\nYou know we could enforce the laws but the war on drugs is unpopular with liberal politicians and so they say well let's not deal with that one lunch yell at the drug companies 'cause I don't make it look like we're doing something and they're doing it and and I think you're right is a driver of crime\nHow many people have their homes or cars broken into because of heroin addiction how many people you know as you say step on needles or there's a public health issue how many people are living intense because of heroin addiction so an awful lot of the ills of the big cities of America are driven by one specific thing addiction to drop\n[noise] yup yup absolutely I mean of course they were out there filming me and my ... and I just kind of walking around the U.S a downtown Seattle um you know we encounter\nI'm going to say about upwards of about three to four very aggressive very kind of\nConfrontational often very obvious heroin users ah we'll just start to me and like ... I'm I'm not allowed to carry out there now I'm not saying it was it\nEscalated to a point where I was pulled aside or however it definitely put me in because the realize I'm completely vulnerable I hear it is one of these individuals decided that they want us to completely losing it go man it\nI guess nothing I can do above and beyond whatever with my hands and Fifteen and then a lot of ways sometimes when I was one of these individuals actually caring about so from that perspective it it it kind of begs the question is like your your especially creating\nA space for nothing but the victims and then having to deal with individuals who are allowed to shoot ... without without any type of course when it gets that they continue to push the narrative that that goes already issue and I just it it is ... my mind that regard and it was something that was\nPublicly aware of it is really hit home until I got down we'll talk out to Seattle to really kind of thought to myself because it it it it just just below the surface and what did you get there you notice it\nI'm Talking to a collie or new or who's the host of the war on an hour ATV let me ask you about something as close to I

pointed out to people already on this Richard if they will take the time to watch Kanye West entire commentary to the president yesterday as he sat in front of the resolute desk and President Trump sat behind the resolute desk\nI think they'll find that his commentary was very very intelligent\n... it was very much on point you talked about\nThe damage it does when kids grow up without a male

you're worried about those things you have to worry about identity theft with id theft occurring every two seconds somewhere in America you need the protection and you needed from the best\nI switched my id care they'd been raided the number one identity theft protection by third party review site best companies millions of people have chosen my ID or just like I did because they are the best in the business my ID card covers you for the nine types of identity theft\nAnd they even offer a family plan so you can protect your whole family that's what I did was try bureau credit monitoring and dark Web monitoring\nThat's the kind of comprehensive protection that you need you can sign up at my id care dot com slash large the plans started for less than ten bucks a month so it's affordable and only my id care offers a money back recovery guarantee\nI don't worry about identity theft anymore and neither should you or your family my listeners say Fifteen Percent at my id care dot com slash large learn more and let my id care take care of you that's my id care dot com slash Lars my id care dot com slash large\nGlad to be with you on a First Amendment Friday nights and going to take your phone calls and emails I wanted to mention this first though\nFlorida seems to have a really well sketchy relationship with law enforcement you'll remember the cop who didn't do anything at Parkland high school in Florida when the massive shooting by Nicholas cruises going on we'll take this guy for example\nFlorida's worst cop that's what they called Florida's worst cops back on the job again\nThe infamous open a lot of Florida police sergeant German boss who's been arrested three times fired\nSix times in the course of Twenty years for stealing drugs possession possessing counterfeit cash brutalized suspects and bystanders subjects and bystanders lying in sub ordination and sexual assault\nSo and he's back on the job a magistrate has now ruled he can return to the ... police force the decision came after a jury acquitted ... of a battery charge but he still has all those other charges against him\nSeven years ago after a youth counselor filed a complaint boss reportedly reacted physically pushing him up against the wall and then arresting him prosecutors said boss acted without probable cause\nAnd he himself was arrested on battery witness tampering unfolds imprisonment though acquitted on the battery charge mosque was still convicted on the other two counts\nBoth of them felonies a Miami Dade judge eventually dismissed the false imprisonment charge even when he's off the clock\nHe's a burden on the taxpayers in twenty twelve it came out that he was collecting sixty thousand bucks a year essentially to sit at home and do nothing\nThanks to back pay following his numerous reinstatement absolutely unbelievable now on this program especially on First Amendment friday we always put naysayers to the head of the line John's on the line and John welcome to the program and what's on your mind on a First Amendment product\nTailor admittedly this is a ... and and I'm not I'm not one of those I I have is when they were just ... days but I Believe that\nCall us with acting completely I think in the White House so if he was encouraged to listen to the to the the the way that you said it's a a a raft of says he says the sentence that had nothing to do with this evidence that\nIt was all over the place and mentally unstable but I don't see that way even though he admitted to buy a push up and even though\nThey last like Lehman look we're saying he has a little problem and he needs to take care of him so\nI think he did it because people like you know you're right we talking heads the family is like his defense is is Lucy's liberal\nSo he really because there's no neighbors even though he was totally bonkers\nSee I don't think he was I Know too well okay you've asserted that let me make the argument to the counter All right\nThat okay with you\nSure I'm okay I Know I could interject\nYeah I like it address what did they in the ... the best route should live that it should be a complete ...\nYes I Know about in all the old on train of thought on take a breath and I'm gonna responding I'll put you on hold if I have to here's my answer directly to that point which you interrupted\nThere are a lot of people I Know who communicate has kind of a stream of consciousness and one of them who I met and I admire greatly is Donald Trump if you listen to his speeches he will often start on one tack\nHe'll go to something else that may seem unrelated then they'll go to something else then I'd go to something else it can be difficult to follow up but I think that's a style and and it's something that people do and I don't honestly think they have a lot of control over it I can do the same thing sometimes I find\nMyself down the rabbit hole because I'll start on tax policy I'll go to drug policy I'll go to talking about a wall and then an editor planning it well\nThen you may end up all the way wrapped around to something else like defense policy it happens there are other times where I think at a very linear manner\nAnd I go from eight to be to see and if I keep going all end up and see that's what you're saying is that somebody is crazy if they don't communicate in an entirely linear way in all instances\nI Will tell you something having sat in that same office not with President Trump although I Hope to one of these days but if you've never been in the oval office you don't know how totally intimidating it can be and I would imagine even for a guy who's used to performing like Kanye West does\nThat would be an intimidating experience you're in the oval office with the president you're surrounded by one looks like about six dozen urged cameras and everything else and then you say\nGosh he didn't seem to be speaking from a set of notes are under strict outline and he started at eight and ... but el ... and then went back to see and went off dizzy and came back to ... and ... pie you know that that if the fact that he wasn't going in a straight line shows he's crazy\nThen unfortunately an awful lot of us are probably crazy as well there are people and I know that some people I Know who are very smart\nWho don't always talk in a linear fashion one of them is one of my best friends over forty years he's a prosecutor he's very smart\nBut he will sometimes start with one thing and they'll end up going down a rabbit hole and I will confess to having done it as well so given that and don't decide that he's crazy if you sit down and do what I Would encourage people to do and I've said this a few times today\nListened to what he said to where he talked about the\nLack of father figures in families and that's something that's not a black or white issue it is an issue for all families if you don't have a father figure in that family and they're very many households this is not disparaging single mothers raising kids it's a tough job to do\nThis is not something that went well for them\n[noise] you know I think that's right and and keep in mind I mean Republicans ultimately won the battle right I mean that's the thing that matters we now have a five for conservative majority for the first time in\nDecades and so they won the battle of the question is what about the war in the war is is is coming in twenty four twenty five days keep in mind the fact that Republican motivation is higher\nIs meaningful for the following reason democratic motivation was already high it's been basically very very high for a year now they want to resist Trump they want to teach Trump they want to see him go to prison\nLanguage they're using about Trump and his family and really all Republicans is so over the top [noise] uh so their motivation is already been high and that's part of the reason why the congressional generic ballot looked bad wide shut like Trump's numbers maybe look bad why them it turns looked bleak\nThat dynamic has changed considerably last two weeks and I don't want to be over the top tier in terms of positivity this thing is still\nI'd say fifty fifty or maybe sixty forty against the Republicans in terms of the control of the house but it is an arranged now where Republicans have a very good three weeks ahead of us\nWith the president being disciplined and delivering on his promises as he has a and Republicans raising money running good racist finding their opponents here towards the end they do have a chance to old house and a month ago that was absolutely inconceivable and so they're overreach on a on justice Kevin I think has backfired in a way they could not have foreseen\nJust the other thing I'd like to hear from because I've been really kind of stunned by the numbers that I really paid a lot more attention to because of Kanye West interesting interaction with the president yesterday which I thought if committed to a piece of paper as the text of the speech and moved out a little bit\nFord's flow a ... would actually passes a pretty good Republicans reach\nA we have to be concerned about kids in a single parent households no man in the household we have to be concerned about families mashed and welfare for for generations and all that it sounded like kind of speech that either a moderate or conservative Republican might give so I started looking at the black voter numbers when I went back to sixteen\nTrump only got eight percent of the black vote by the best estimates I could find he was a twenty three percent favorability among black voters last year and now he's thirty six\nGrowing from eight to twenty three almost three fold and then increasing that by fifty percent to the current thirty six I'm that and and it doesn't look like that trend line is changing what's your take on black voters and how they're responding to this man who the mainstream media is trade tried for the better part of two years\nTo paint is the biggest reasons biggest ever sit in the White House\nYeah it's a great question and then you you you paint a picture there that's pretty compelling and you do with numbers uh let you know if you watch CNN and they point yesterday uh they weren't making compelling arguments they were making highly emotional argument said African American panelist on and hosts on that we're using totally over the top right or talking about\nKanye West you know do I think he's the most brilliant thoughtful cause you know person in the history of the world no uh but I didn't think he was taken some interesting points and at that moment and the and it highly unusual moment there ah you know in the oval office um look here's the air here the facts black unemployment is is the lowest it's ever been\nThat matters a lot more than rhetoric that's being used on cable news or by someone's perception that Trump is racist or you look at government dependence being down just the overall opportunity that Americans have but he but particularly African Americans\nOr is he ... he has a good record on those issues now look I have I had serious issues with Charles ... and and kind of their response to it I said so at the time\nBut the language that the opponents shoes or a ... that Donald Trump's opponents use against him is actually a tremendous gift for him\nIt is so over the top and so on and so\nSort of divorced from reality and fairness uh that that it makes it easy for people who are in the middle to look at the results are and to make their own their own ultimately their own a kind of decision and it's just that this is a threat to the economy was poses to the Democratic party\nHe can show that Donald Trump's not racist because I think most African Americans can look on the west and believe he would not spend time in a hug someone ... believe it was racist\nIf he can show that and show that he thinks that truly thinks the tropics make life better for African Americans in this country that is a powerful thing I mean\nIt wasn't as massive platforms uh to to to spread his message and a massive persona and so that was a powerful moment yesterday it really was I Would have done it I've and Presidents Day is probably not a you know I Wish she wasn't using you know foul language and things like that\nBut Donald Trump or risk taker Matt

Epstein welcome to the program and tell me this\nWhat do we now know about Google because of a leaked internal briefing that's now gone public\n[noise] well actually they've been three or four league set in recent weeks and they they all confirmed or what I've been saying and others have been saying about Google for years except we've never really had the documents in front of us before but they confirmed that um\n[noise] uh people at Google are very conscious of the power that they they have a over us or the power they have to shift opinions and votes and the power that they have to answer\nI'm a material to determine what we see and don't see and it's not just us in the U. S. I mean they have that power over more than two point five billion people around the world and that number is going to grow to over four billion within the next three years that's a lot of power\nYeah it is and it's nice to be conscious of power if you're handling of the right way but is Google handling of the right way and that\nIf I'm conscious as I'm driving down the road that I've got a five thousand pound vehicle that's going sixty miles an hour that can hurt people people want me to be conscious of that because then I take care not to hurt people with that is Google taking that kind of care in trying to make sure that it you know that it doesn't hurt people with its actions\n[noise] I think uh you know this this latest leak which is a big internal a brief it's about eighty six page brief\nA seems to indicate that you know there's there are discussions within the company\nAbout you know how can we handled this power responsibly I I was actually kind of pleased to see that that there are those discussions uh but uh my opinion is that they're not handling a those airpower responsibly in part because there's just no transparency these are leaks after all that so they they've never\nOpenly talked about any of these are these issues\nAre and you know we have a evidence\nOr that they have been using their power to uh to influence elections in the U.S and of course the uh the EU uh they've they've a ... huge fines against Google because they have evidence of that Google has been misusing their power in a number of different ways in Europe are not only with their\nUh their biased search results but also with the way they handled their monopoly\nOver mobile devices using their Android operating system\nI guess it'd be awfully tempting if you had that kind of power and if you were let's say somebody who believes I think certain candidate should get into office and other candidates should not I hear that mean going on in the United states with regard to Donald Trump I happened to be a fan of Donald Trump but I Know there are other people who view him as\nYou know as as essentially a guy with horns on his head and and that he's evil incarnate\nAnd that if you said well I have this amazing power should not use it to keep people like Donald Trump out of office\nHow do we get people who will resist the temptation to use this to try to control something that whether you like it or not is controlled by American voters right now and should be\n[noise] well you know I actually wrote it\nBig essay about that issue of temptation owes published if if a couple of years ago in a in a left wing publication I published everywhere by the way\nBrad Bird glad to her and I read\nIt [laughter] and uh and that's what's called Google snoop ... and I actually talked about the fact that they have access to of course all of our personal information\nAnd there are thousands of people that Google and thousands of people who work at Google's business partners but if I have free access to our profiles our emails\nI mean how can they resist snooping they can't and now in in a legal employees have been caught doing very bad things with our data and of course we also now have a leak showing\nAn internal discussion among Google employees about how they can fight Donald Trump's a you know immigration policy of this wasn't just from two thousand Seventeen so you know there there are people they're just people frankly and I think it's dangerous yeah\nOh I I guess Dr I Know they're just people but for example and I I really resist the idea that these should be turned into government government controlled utilities like\nA power company or a natural gas company I don't like that idea because I didn't get very quickly run up against the first amendment and I ... I Want to safeguard the first amendment for both the left and the right even though I'm On the right but I think and tell me if this comparison isn't isn't appropriate I have friends who are cops\nI don't even call them and say would you give me the criminal background on someone if it isn't public record already because I'm aware that the data systems they have access to\nWould do that one is called the law enforcement data system you can plop and Dr Robert Epstein and find out how many wants and warrants arrests and all kinds of other really salacious information might be available by Epstein her Larson or anyone else and I'm aware of that there are there legal constraints on that\nI almost think there ought to be ethical constraints that are good cop\nShould say that data is for law enforcement only it is not for you know to be used by you to figure out whether your girlfriend has you know an arrest from ten years ago or potential employee does unless it is public information and all those people who work in police agencies\nSometimes they break the rules to but they are tough consequences when they do they say you're not supposed to be using the lead system for anything but law enforcement it's there for a reason to catch bad guys and bad gals\nBut it's not there for you to check on your boyfriend or your girlfriend you know if we catch you're doing it it it's the end of your career is is Google prepared to beat that tough on employees who will break those rules\n[noise] well see there there's a big difference because you're talking about not just ethics you're talking about uh laws and regulations you're talking about accountability to the public and the problem is a with Google Facebook to\nThere are no laws there are no regulations and there's no accountability to the public there's accountability is chair of shareholders I or my you know my my views on this actually have changed I have to say over the years um\nI I used to start to think
