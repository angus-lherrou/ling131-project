we're all too familiar with these days and that stress and we're finding out about the damage that everyday stress can do to our bodies the warning signs that we should be aware of and what we can do to alleviate and even eliminate the effects of stress\nAnd Dr ... you were talking earlier about calcium and magnesium and how we need these nutrients in our bodies to fight the effects of stress in your ... formula can help us in this battle against stress I'd like to talk for a minute about how the magnesium\nFactors in I mean uh I'm starting to understand about the calcium but what does magnesium\nOr we're talking about stress and we're talking about stress affects the body and first of all in order to function at all your body needs magnesium it's probably of all the vitamins I could list magnesium is probably the most important vitamin on the planet right now\nI've not heard a whole lot about magnesium ... why is magnesium so important\nThere is over three hundred and twenty five bio chemical reactions that magnesium is involved with it it's almost like a hormone wow and for example if it was low levels of magnesium\nYour heart won't beat who very important factor in life you would say so in\nFact let me just read a list of some of the conditions are associated with magnesium deficiencies okay um you have\nAttention deficit disorder Alzheimer's or anxiety asthma autism chronic fatigue syndrome congestive heart disease caused the patient diabetes fibromyalgia high blood pressure insomnia migraine headaches multiple sclerosis muscle cramps\nParkinson's Bastille Perot's is going to list just goes on and on and on\nAnd this is this is associated with a a lack of magnesium and the money\nSimply a lack of magnesium bully too so it's not that they're really mess around with now what happens is that we need the magnesium in your body in order for the calcium to be absorbed\nOh so it's it's a necessary thing in order to get the first component which is calcium\nThat's right they work in combination with each other now there's many more practical applications of this ... formula ... first of all like I said you drink so it gets into your system and one of the first thing we use it for in our clinic is for people who are under a lot of stress\nAnd it can't sleep well at night it works better than anything I've ever seen for people that have trouble sleep it really because it relaxes your body and you do actually fill the relaxation after you drink the\nAfter you drink a cup of the comics formula\n... interesting\nNow the other thing that it's really really good for our people who are in pain\nOkay and I have a whole bunch of stories to tell you in and out case studies of people actually taking account max formula and getting rid of pain and this is included arthritic Taipei fibromyalgia which is a form of arthritis back pain muscle spasms migraine headaches there's a whole category of of areas that like to discuss with you\nWow that's fantastic some of those things that you've named seem to be age related or or things that we experience as we grow older is there a link there yeah\nThere's a vicious circle that I'd like to discuss what happens is that when a person has\nA magnesium deficiency specifically make museum they don't absorb their food as well and so they go into what we call mal absorption syndrome which millions and millions of Americans have and it's not like you feel sick or you know this that yes it might be overtime just starting to feel more tired and tired and tired\nMhm and that's just a real graduate overtime type of thing and a lot of people justify that they're getting old and they just need more threats or whatever right and that's what I Would think\nThat what happens is that when when you get less absorption you actually increase the efficiency in your system of magnesium\nAnd that and that started to take the count them out of the phones to start getting bald lost you start getting um muscle loss because it also reduces the muscle mass and pretty soon before you know it you are feeling old yeah and your body's actually starting to manifest at\nAll due to a simple lack of these nutrients\nCalcium and then they'll let me tell you and it is simple the problem and being a doctor researchers how do you get the end of the system\nThe formula we have the ... formula is so fantastic because get set up powder form you take hot water and you make if you put it in a cop take a teaspoon of this powder and mix it in you and your drink this cut down this great absorption rate is really incredible because it it actually goes right into your bloodstream\nWiping people out and that's the key to low energy is a lot of it's caught by pain feeling all your joints don't move well this kind of wife's you out it drains your energy and then then you get tired and you go to sleep I guess what you don't sleep\nNow I'm I'm telling you like common scenario due to a lack of calcium

who federal subsidy legally\nAnd those were for them just respect the rule of law and they are showing disregard for those who are following the law we simply cannot allow people to pour in for the

yeah that's where I used to be president United States so that was when he was sent it\nSo we got all these people coming here and of course things have changed because uh you can change your mind if you believe in you know a a traditional marriage and you are a a bronco bomber or the Clintons and you can change your mind and I don't know if you okay that's fine that is what it is but I think what he said there was was was fairly\nFairly good and we've got these people coming here and and we've got to ask her questions what in God's name are we going to do with this because we've got to start doing something don't we we just can't continue on the way we've been doing it\nIllegal aliens should not be treated the same as people who entered the U.S legally\nI voted on numerous times when I

they're coming here and they've all jumped ship if you will as far as what side that this\nNow doesn't\nHelp them to be this way and only hurts them so they've got to go to the other side and said

about her exit on Tuesday Kelly came under fire during a discussion about Halloween costumes and black\nThat [laughter] I kept that was okay as long as you address another character\nKelly apologize the next day but many felt Kelly and NBC were never a good fit and the NBC was unhappy with the ratings\nAnd that's what it really is I'm going to tell you guys this right now this was a culmination of a lot of things first wasn't a good fit it wasn't very case closed and the story\nWas never a good fit she didn't get ... into the in crowd over there a lot of the other talents and people behind the scenes were thrilled by her she came over with tons of fanfare and a lot of money\nAnd the our ally on the investment wasn't very good\nAnd they said to themselves even if that were making some money which I hear they were making some money there was a lot more money that we're leaving out there\nIt just didn't really work and they would rather get rid of her now and pay or off a portion\nOf everything and allow her to go do whatever and it was fine did what happened the other day is stupid I think we can all agree with this right you know somewhere along the line we've cross this line of of of insanity when it comes to this politically correct or craziness out there but somewhere\nOut there people who are reasonable and both sides they don't realize what this is about like the people who feel emboldened as if this was the reason that she was fired was singularly this episode in this situation that scares me because we know arbitrarily they go after\nAnybody for anything and they come as hard as they possibly can and I\nIt gets frustrating it is me it is it is so frustrated that we have this kind of world like this but before everybody reads into the oh this is because it wasn't it wasn't true [laughter]\nShe had some issues I I I think I'm going to go out there and say this a little tough to work with I'm I'm I Will put to work with the times um you know\nAnd when you

if your revenues massive\n\nRate I worked at stations where ratings have been through the roof and I've seen people whose revenue wasn't there and they've gotten rid of him and I've worked places were ratings have been average to pour across the board and the revenue was massive\nAnd they've stuck around ideally you'd like to have both but the truth is revenue\nMatters and she was she wasn't all that in a bag of chips when it came to read and it was not a good fit and I don't know what she's going to do next and all kinds of things you can do the money's there she can go start her own thing
