Democrats candidate that\nWish to dismantle I\nThe you know the people who protect deflation so yes anything is possible and that's why the November midterms also incredibly important because\nIf you believe the last two years just brought us prosperity is to cure the then all of that is on the ballot box and all of that is in jeopardy if we'd do vote down ticket Republicans\nYou know as as you and I are speaking I'm I'm Talking to a doctor Sebastian Gorka author of why we fight as you and I are speaking the midterms is still a few weeks away and that final vote if if Trump loses the White House is not the White House the house of representatives\nOr the losing the senators is less likely according to the polls I've seen I Would hope that we would actually see Americans you know rise up and and and give us even greater strength in the house representatives but if Trump loses the house of representatives what is it he will be able to get done in the next two years of this term\nWell here's the last drove the deal he wrote the book the odd as it deals so he can he can do amazing things or when it comes to negotiate thing behind closed doors but ah his agenda you know the Democrats have admitted it\nThey will try to sabotage his agenda remember the house maintains this but the the post\nDuring the Senate is more powerful on paper but when it comes to funding defence when it comes to funding anything it is the house of representatives has as the as the key so you know that the president is a is an unstoppable freight train\nBut the Democrats will try to do everything possible to slow him down and to undermine his agenda\nDr Gordon let me ask you about this this is a divided country and it's not just divided because the media says it's divided we see\nReally serious a disagreement between people wishing friendships and and and and perhaps even marriages dissolve over the disagreements over President Trump's occupy you know his position in the White House\nA can a country is divided is that be still be effective in meeting these challenges against our enemies around the world\nWe we have been more divided into posture member of the biggest war we ever for was not\nWorld War two wasn't even Vietnam the greatest number of\nCasualties more than half a million Americans killed was ...\nOwn civil war or during Vietnam I Believe we were more divided but the idea that we've we've we've never been more divided I don't buy it but of course it makes things difficult but I think more and more Americans are waking up to who Donald Trump is and how he wants to protect this nation\nFrom old threats in the house to get around the office first you so\nYou know I Am an American now proud American\nAs a result I'm an optimist I'd like to think\nThat the ... the sleeping giant is awakening\nYou know it's funny ... you say that because I I see people coming together in ways that I think even the mainstream media wouldn't have expected I went back last week and looked up\nThe percentage of the black vote that Donald Trump got in twenty sixteen not quite two years ago and it was eight percent by the middle of last year twenty Seventeen he was at twenty three percent almost three times the number that he got ... votes in the election and this year he's already at thirty six percent\nDoes that kind of grows would make almost anybody in any field very happy and yet the mainstream media\nAnd that's on one of the most divisive issues that America's face and that of race and whether or not a black American citizens feel they're being treated appropriately and equitably it seems that an awful lot of black Americans are a huge percentage in percentage terms has decided this is the president we like\nYeah I I think what did we see in twenty sixteen and incredible\nSilent majority the mainstream media is that the Hillary has more than ... ... you can post that something like Ninety seven to ... percent salt water ...\nShe lost both from one I think in the last two years that Ficre all of silence up to ... votes as can only have increased\nAbout why I remain very very tall for them\nAnd yet the other side and especially the media player in the media is a big player in this seems willing to do almost anything even entertain a lives to win a fight like the fight that occurred over the appointment of justice Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court\nYeah I mean in in in my book why we fight I talk about with the ... trained as what they could chambers was was justice cabin all before justice capital was even born so you know the Nineteen forty eight of mine who had been a former communist agents stood up and Congress and the first of all\nTelevised a lot of the Modi told the world who the secret agents were\nCommunists inside government including al ... is a the left try to destroy him they used to being a homosexual an alcoholic or you know everything you can imagine and it was\nAll live so that the Democrats have made a bargain with the devil the ends justify the means if you were shocked at what they did the Kavanaugh than you need to open a history of vote because they did it because ... they did it the ... the jobs are your\n... and they did it to a with the ... back in Nineteen forty eight\nHow do we meet them and let let's talk about the president's successes and if you would Dr ... remind folks of what a block Obama had given us as an expectation toward the end of his presidency about what we'd be able to do about ISIS\nAnd about what President Donald Trump has been able to do about ISIS despite what President Obama had predicted\nWell let's remember what President Obama did but you said about eyes but this is a ... threat meaning\nYou just have to get used to it sorry going to take a you know our children our grandchildren babies to deal with that this president as soon as he came in I I worked very closely with special forces on the street he ... a ... but if you professionals and what happened within a master of just a couple of months\nThe ISIS caliphate ceased to exist so if the incredible it was president says this is the threat for generations and then the next president manages to squeeze a generation into a couple of months that\nAmerican leadership and that's why I wrote why we fight but al ... and ...\nAnd he says and all of the other Islamic jihad to groups have not gone away what do we need to make sure to do to make sure that they don't become the kind of force they were under President Obama\nWhile I have a a whole chapter in my book where I write about the face to this war in the face to\nIs really the ideological war so we we have to deal ... the idea is so we we can kill anybody would eat the kill anywhere in the world if they're a threat to America but right\nOff the bat we have to make sure that other people don't want to become jihadi we have to undermine the jihadi ideology just as we on the ... the ideology of communism so the whole thing collapsed in life the unite the nights that face to this war\nSo how do we do that when even when it is true that there are even some young uh mostly men not not so many women in this country who have come here because they were seeking refuge from terrible situations in other parts of the world\nAnd they come here so often is young kids and then grow up and become radicalized how do we stop that\nWe have to talk of the radicalized that we have to undermine their ideology with count the propaganda that just like we did during the Cold War you have to set light you have to have a giant spotlight\nOn the lives of the other means the end of the day nobody takes them as credible and nobody wants to join them when that happens then the ... the desire to to\nBe part of that radical organized they should get just such a low level but it's no longer\nA represents a serious threat to the nation so uh you know the details are in the book why we fight but it's about ... the propaganda of the good news is we've done it before and we can do it again\nDr Barker you and I are both fans of president Donald Trump by supported him as a voter and it's the talk shows you supported him as a deputy and now you continue to support him from the outside\nOnce he gotten wrong or there's some places where he's either missed an opportunity or he actually blew it\nI don't I Can't see anything we're way he's low that um I think if there's anything you know that was a disappointment for me um it's just natural the he really had no idea how\nDeep the corruption is in Washington and then the wall and it took him sometime I mean I resigned for a reason I resigned because people like a child but lost that came into the administration who was part of the ... but

headed toward the Mexico Guatemala border and I told you this is an important issue but it's been an important issue for a couple of decades\nLong before President Trump used it as his signature issue launching his campaign in the summer of twenty Fifteen or Mike Louis joined with he's right for the hill Mike it's good to have you on the program thanks for the time to nine\nLarge thanks for having me appreciate it\nSo there are folks who are saying that President Trump is ramping up on immigration is that even possible for Donald Trump to get tougher on immigration that he's been one\nWell that's a great question uh you know the answer is no but it allows him to return an issue that has really been in the headlines recently\nAnd so whether or not he's ramping it up I guess it ... it but it hasn't been in the headlines and now at it and so the care of and it's kind of given him an opportunity\nTo kind of low hanging fruit at the softball and and uh and he thinks that he's just going to hit it hit it out of the car right ahead of the mid term election so your uh your point is well made a he has ramped up really anything it's the same position that he had all along\nBut it does is allow him to uh to to re enter this into the news cycle at a very crucial thought\nWell maybe maybe if Nancy Pelosi goods conspiratorial should good shape Donald Trump or range for the caravan to arrive in precisely the right moment before the mid term so that he could bring it back up do you think she can launch conspiracy theory like that\nI was I think she could probably drink something like that I thought you know right now you get a lot of finger pointing across the aisle Trump of course is blaming the Democrats for allowing the caravan to come up and the Democrats appointed right back across at him and saying wait a minute we don't control the government wants to do something about the conditions down there\nAh in in Central America so of course it's going to be a blame game this immigration in Washington and uh and and the fingers are going to be pointing all around and and that has to change the course just a a headed elections it's only going to get a more heated\nMike let me ask you this and this may sound a little crazy but I'll I'll throw it out you anyway or is it possible since we now live in a world where anybody with a smartphone anywhere on the planet knows can know what's going on in another country\nIs it possible this caravan shows precisely this moment because it is around the midterms not because they wanted to help their friends and the Democratic

U. I. P. G. E. T. Q. U. I. P. dot com slash Lars to your calls on this First Amendment friday\nLet's go to Michael in Alabama and Michael welcome to the program on a First Amendment friday night what's on your mind\nThat you've added now that I'm a kid the care of and this guy um yeah I kinda feel bad for the man because I think that falls at your life you know\nWhen they all want to go to the United states I'm just kind of what your opinion is a lady I Try to see these people just after ... ... ... and I have another question it yeah\nWell here's the short answer is they're being driven north by the dollar I think for the most part these or economic refugees I Believe they're coming to the ... they want to come to the United states as far as I'm concerned they should not come unless they come legally but they're coming because the economy is better here and it's not in their home country\nThe crime problem while they wouldn't want to settle in Chicago ah the the crime problem here makes the crime problem at back at home looked dramatically worse and worse dramatically better we have a court system that while not perfect\nIs ... is a legitimate court system not driven by corruption like so much of central and South America\nSo those are three great reasons they don't need that George Soros or Michael Bloomberg or some other rich guy or gal to go out and try to give them an incentive to come the incentive is they're naturally\nI mean I don't know what I'll have to look up what the average wages in Guatemala or Honduras but I'm willing to bet it's at best a hint of what it is here so if you have those kinds of incentives and your kids get to go to school paid for by taxpayers and if you come in as a refugee\nLet me tell you one little detail from the law Michael\nIf you are given refugee status and eighty five percent of refugees do not get refugee status they're simply told your circumstances don't justify it you are allowed to access all of America's social service programs so welfare food stamps ten of\nA section eight housing Medicaid all the rest of that so it's a sweet deal if you can get it as a refugee\nYou could work and make them far more money than you made back at home you can be reasonably save at least compared to back at home your kids get to go to school you get medical care\nAnd you can access all those free goodies\nPaid for by the American taxpayer and if anybody thinks that's who writes\nOr fair or just or legal\nI think you've got to take another look at the wall let's go to norm norm welcome to walk into the Lars Larson show what's on your mind\nNo I was like\nYou get a\nNew order that ... ... ... ... yeah yeah he he was ... it you know he's an Arab here are they going to guard like anybody else that held the true\nSo why should it be a ... day any more than it is in her way home and he got killed plenty of thought well\nI I can tell you one if you want me to make the argument for why it should be a story\nIf somebody I went to the American consulate in Russia or Japan or France\nAnd they ended up murdered inside that consulate\nAnd it's a conflict that say from a friendly country or or contract at least ... billion ally of the United states that would be an ... that would be a major story that's not just some foreign national who's gone home and and goes to an ... and goes out and gets killed in a mugging or a a a crime of some ...\nThis is somebody who was allegedly killed in an embassy now I Believe\nThat his murder may be more the result of his ties to the Muslim Brotherhood the fact that uh he was a friend of Osama bin Laden and that he identified where they you know the the ridiculous ... end of Islam and that had more to do with it and the fact that MBBS the guy runs the crown prince who runs Saudi Arabia right now\nIs trying to westernize their country and the sharia folks the hardcore is llamas do not want that to happen I think that may be more to explain why he ended up dead\nThen the Saudi Government just simply saying we're going to silence a critic by murdering him but he wasn't just a journalist he was a political actor as well\nAnd for the most part I understand our media tell them tends to tilt to the left but we said tell to the left\nImagine somebody who worked for a antifa one of these dug huge crowds a drop in American cities right also worked for a major newspaper or a major news organization like CNN\nAnd they played both roles the role of being a political activist as well as the role of being a journalist on television most television objects even the folks at the chicken noodle news network would not tolerate having\nSomebody on a they'll do it for commentators\nBut they will not do it for somebody who's straight ahead news reporter which is what ... is being presented to Americans and all these stories as but he was a political actor I mean if you said I have a job with the Democratic National Committee has one of their staffers\nBut I'm also working as a journalist and CNN CNN would say no we're not going to let that happen unless you're on as a commentator but if you're just simply a news reporter so what they're trying to portray this as is\nThis man was a journalist he wanted to tell the truth about Saudi Arabia and he was murdered for being a good journalist I have a feeling that when we finally find out the details that we're going to find out that he was also a political actor and he was pushing a narrative that was anti Saudi Government right now\n[noise] they are but I Will say that the ball is\nRolling it isn't just New Mexico and a lot of it is these really stupid licensing requirements you know if you're good at cutting hair I'm not going to go back to you to get my hair cut a second time that she'll be good enough\nThat should be good enough right she out at the march\nRegulate that sort of thing and governor Martinez is on the ball on that front she's not the only one that\nThey've done some of this in Texas they they did some of it under the previous governor lazy and and not the current governor but um\nIt is being picked up in some places um inevitably by Republicans I Wish it were more bipartisan because America would benefit from that but um one party is more committed to bigger government than the other and that's being\nReflected in ... and and and you see the difference in how the different states to economically opportunities growing\nIn states that are limited government not states that are expanding government\nWas talking about those two were you set this in context because people here you know everything to do with the federal government is a huge billions are tens of billions of dollars so Donald Trump is taking off regulations and saved twenty three billion dollars and that's money saved by individual workers and individual employers the most part\nHow much did Obama ad to regulations and what was the cause of that\nOh wow wow I mean the numbers were massively and the other direction in the same time period in about it in ministry and I want to say they added about two hundred and thirty billion dollars of cost\nTo the U.S economy and look regulatory costs\nAre are are totally wasted dollars you know create an ounce of well you know create opportunity it's just pure crab act I'm doubting I's and crossing cheese of government and so\nWhere the Trump Administration has three to twenty three billion dollars for either employees or for research or foreign investment the Obama administration did ten times the opposite they were burning the economy with two hundred and thirty billion dollars or more of cost just to run either\n... economy it's why we never saw anything above ... percent gross under Obama it's why\nTheir whole administration including their most senior economists\nGradually came to the conclusion that it wasn't even possible to have more than two percent rate um economic growth and that's probably true if you keep slapping two hundred and thirty billion dollars worth of ... of burdens on your economy that the economy doesn't need and frankly we get no meaningful benefit from\nWell as an example can you tell me if I'm off base on this I've got a friend who's in the financial world right he he's he's local ... I've known him for thirty plus years\nBut he has a friend in Jamie diamond the guy who had to chase bank and diamond like say ripe about regulations in and rightfully so diamond claims it out of out of all the employees who work for chase bank he has five thousand full time employees and you imagine\nThese people and finance make some pretty good money probably not stratospheric salaries but really good money\nFive thousand people who do nothing but comply with regulations well if you can cut that in half\nAnd have those twenty five hundred people making mortgage loans or consumer loans or or small business loan right and doing that work instead of working just to fill out mountains of paperwork which creates more jobs in the federal government and ... yeah\nOr or keeping exactly the same number of people doing everything they're doing now but lowering your prices yeah to make yourself more competitive and to not make people at chased richer\nBut to make all of the Americans who borrow money from chase save money at those banks making them richer that it's it's coming from the same place and I just think that ... was it a bit more for people to know that they could have\nLiterally have loans with lower rates they could have a savings account that offers higher rates of of interests than you'd they get now all those things affected their lives and yet they're spread out across a lot of people but that's what those costs are going to a gym and does he get the print money\nKen Cuccinelli is racing\nJoining the rebellion more\nHe's had freedom orange and we

O. recounts that say if the postal service doesn't pay for its pensions American taxpayers will so every dime they lose while they're under charging a customer is a dime a or a dollar or a billion dollars that American taxpayers are going to have to pay\nIs there an argument made that were charging a fair rate to China and they shouldn't be paying more\n[noise] um\nThat's interesting question I mean I hadn't really thought about it in those terms I Will say that uh you know the post ...\nThere's nothing there's nothing that prevents the postal service for simply or the minister racial physically I'm charging China a larger rates which is what they may in fact eventually be doing as a consequence of this administration's a decision on this side of this sort of signal the scent of wanting to China or or that they may do that and that's\nProfessional water system from Connecticut so affordable to store owner Connecticut system for as little as a dollar a day Hi I'm Chris ... owner of Connecticut boil water systems in San Antonio and the hill and if you've never owned a kinetic go in you're missing out\nIs like not having an air conditioners that big of a different you really need to get a free quote and see how horrible it in this month we're offering four hundred dollars off any full house system in same as cash zero percent financing\nCalled six five six pure or sign up at our website\nAnd let it go essay dot com affordable there's always a good thing because this time of year can be taxing non governmental taxing I'm Talking about the quality of water in San Antonio can be taxing on your skin your hair your health your water heater dishwasher and coffee maker to fix your taxing water problem now\nWe're limited time get up to four hundred dollars of any full house system and same as cash to represent financing call kinetic go at six five six\nPure ... all the ... school books in\nHigh this ... from my friends in the San Antonio or market can you believe at that time again\nHard to believe that we've been doing it for twenty seven years to but it's this coming Saturday stand at the Pearl again this year\nAnd a reporter fun of and it's going to be it's an all day event Saturday only nine killed three are going to be\nCooking demonstrations sampling you're going to be able to get a tremendous amount of information the are busy year they fear is actually the Homs is gonna be a lot of things related to Hobbs is going on it's just they spawn event at an event for the whole family plenty of free parking down there at the ... got big\nParking garage and extra parking over there underneath the freeway come on over and enjoy bring the\nKids you gonna thoroughly enjoyed today and I ... well the farmers' market right there right around the corner you know where the parolees down just decided to downtown and then down to eighty one twenty seven years going strong more fun\nThan ever even more information go to San Antonio or market not or\nDon't just check your messages jak vote world is Katie essay on the go\nWith the gay TSA yeah and it's the essay dot com [noise] more\nHonestly provocative\nLars Larson show welcome back to the program your calls on the six six four three nine five to seven seven females to talk of Lars Larson dot com and a fellow us on Twitter outlaws largely show\nYou know it's not smart jobs sites that overwhelmed with tons of the wrong resumes you know what is really smart zipper critter dot com slash Lars unlike other jobs ...\n... doesn't wait for the candidates to find you zipper could or goes right out there and find them for you it's powerful matching technology scans thousands of resumes identify as the people with the right skills education and experience for the jobs you have\nAnd then actively invites them to apply\nSo you get qualified candidates fast no more sorting through the wrong resumes no more waiting for the right candidate to apply\nIt's no wonder zipper critters rated number one by employers in the U.

A. R. as\nZipper critter really the smartest way to higher but have you with me on a friday night\nYou know I Love our national park service a park system and I'll tell you when I was a little kid my dad was a national park rangers so I have a bit of a dog in the fight and I lived inside of two of this country is great national parks mount Rainier and glacier oh so I'd like to see them do well Monica roads is the associate director of the whole crew\nFor the national trust for historic preservation Monica welcome to the program\n[noise] hey thank you so how are the national parks doing these days what's their current situation\nYeah so the four hundred and Seventeen national parks um and that's about eighty four four million acres I'm you know there there's a lot to maintain\nAnd right now what's going on with them is that there is a lack of funding um um it marked to um help restore\nAnd make sure that those parks are around for at another generation as you mentioned before large I mean you're a huge fan of the parts that you know how important are these public spaces um you know how they ... they are to the American public uh and the role and now they play in and Willie Nelson who we are a show or\nA you know I think right now are we are a in a moment where Congress has the ability to pass legislation to restore our\nParks and to make sure that those um places like glacier in Mount Rainier are are not only around for today but um for our children and grandchildren as well\nIf we were to catch up with all the deferred maintenance that's deployed real estate agent term for a house that need for painters windows or something we'd have to write a check for twelve billion dollars right\nHe was about twelve dollars corrected and\nSo and ... and look I I don't know I'm not necessarily a fan of taking that out of the general treasury although they are our parks we should really take care of them I feel like our national parks are\nLike that guy with three busted cars parked in his front yard and Everytime one breaks Johnny just parked in his front yard and buys another one to let you know till it gets busted done and pretty soon you got the whole yard full of cars on blocks and and you think why don't you just fix these up and if you're not going to fix them up\nThen dispose of them because it's a real shame to say we're preserving these national parks but by the way we're letting them fall apart at the same time and most of what's falling apart correct me if I'm wrong or the human facilities used so that people I hate to use bureaucratic language like that but the stuff that people need to get to the parks\nThe the hotels are the restrooms are the the roads are the trails that's the stuff that's busted down right\n[noise] yeah I mean other than that almost twelve million dollars I'm just under half of that is for historic assets alone so you know do that as you mentioned the lodges that cabins the places that we use and the memories that we have all these parks um cultural landscapes the battlefields of cemeteries all of that\nI'm I'm all of that as a part of that that um that maintenance backlog now\nLet me ask you this because I'm always want to run the numbers my wife and I buy an annual pass every year and I think it's Seventy five or eighty bucks and it was a very good deal if you're just going to go to one of the ... one time on one day every year or they get paid thirty bucks what did you buy somebody for every dollar proud and maybe a little bit more now that they would uh\nYou know the that let you go to any national park you want all year long and it's a it's a pretty good deal and I feel\nThat part of this bill should be paid by everybody in America because they're available to everybody but those of us want to use the ... pay a little bit more and I don't think that's necessarily wrong I don't think the visitors should pay the entire drought nor do I think the taxpayer should pay the whole tab\nUser away and I keep wanting twelve billion ... billion a year on top of whatever spending now in the poor maintenance we're doing right now we we would catch up and about a decade which wouldn't be a bad gold should be nice to do it in five years instead of town where you could do that\nHow many people visit all of the national parks in a way that would cause them to pay an entry for your show their past you know\nAnd um it's just that's a great question I Know that millions of people go to the parks here and I think what this restore our\nParks um legislation does which has bipartisan support is that it it doesn't\nYou know jobs or up created an additional burden on the taxpayer\nAnd in fact the six point five billion dollars which the legislation proposes um towards this almost twelve billion dollar deficit over five years comes from federal middle revenues and so this is on showing offshore oil and gas I'm so these are things that we um those funds that are already there but they're not\nEarmark on right now for national parks allocated to other programs but I'm not of legislation\nOur federal budget expert either monitor but if they if money wasn't going to the park that would go to the general treasury and it'd be available for all the other stuff the federal government bars right\nYeah well the way that these funds I mean what we are proposing is to to reallocate these funds to to the park so it's not\nNecessarily um you know pulling drawing down our adamant increased burden on the taxpayer on what it does it's it's it's a identifying a pot of money that we haven't thought about um that could benefit the national parks\nAnd and I think you know what that does of course is with this um six point six and a half billion dollar influx of funds I think on the back and and you know you're talking funding um it's always return on investment right so investing this as a country well what are we going to get back for it and you know to that I went\nThere I mean we'll we'll have the you know the statue of liberty\nI Will be preserved and that has a a backlog a maintenance back lot right now Ellis\nIsland and we know how important um you know that was a stopping point in\nOur American story um we know that places like the Little Rock Central High school um in in in Arkansas yeah that's a historic site and brown\nV board of education at that you know these are the historic places that tell our story and so we have a ... we have places we can go to talk about um who we are as a country and to get to the numbers of things I mean I'm wheat um add an analysis done by the cat and his group and they found\nThat if the if this legislation passed it would create a hundred and ten thousand infrastructure related jobs and so that directly impact\nLocally and caught economies at these national parks are part of and so I Would say you know by redirecting these funds it's a it's an immediate return on investment um for what these local communities can get\nAnd the job they create um by just restoring um places that we already know hum are important to to who we are as a country\nTo monitor who's opposing it\nUp you know ah right now there is a bipartisan support so it's on on both sides I think right now we're we're trying to get through and we're hoping to get this legislation passed in the next month or two so after the election um to to really get boots on the ground and get to work around around that\nHe said they're poor they pass over opportunities repeatedly and we do we have opportunities come our way all the time but when is it the right time this is the right time this is the opportunity\nTo see what I saw like Michael said you don't have to take our word for it get behind the wheel of the Ferrari for a
