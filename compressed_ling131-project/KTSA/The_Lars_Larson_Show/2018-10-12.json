is when you have one of the biggest stories of its kind in American history and it's centered in a media capital is not out in Waco, Texas it's not in the far reaches of Montana or Idaho\nIs right in Philadelphia in between two of the media\nCenters of the universe I'm In Washington DC and New York city\nOn the planet are two of the biggest concentrations of media and it involved a crime that was incredibly heinous horrendous\nAnd it involved a man who committed more murders then he was not convicted of all those but you don't need to convict him out of all in fact many serial killers are not convicted of all the crimes they committed\nHe committed more murders than Gary Ridgway the Green River killer and Ted Bundy put together\nMany more and yet the media\nThe TV networks the newspapers the Web sites all the rest is for the most part\nCompletely turned a blind eye to this crime that was right in their neighborhood right in that city and the trial was going on in Philadelphia will that story is told in the new movie and it's to try the story of the trial that happened and the man Kermit guys know the movie is called God's now\nThe trial of America's biggest serial killer and andme apple Haiti has the young lady who wrote the book\nAnd produced the movie and she joins me in the studio today how are you I'm delighted to be here lies thanks so much for having me this is a tough subject and I want to make it clear to people if they're thinking well if I go to this movie is going to be like going to a Stephen King movie it'll probably be full of blood and Gore and all that\nYou know it's not no no we got a PG Thirteen raising 'em and that was important to us that this would be a film that you could bring very young teenagers to anyone of any age actually and we've had of audiences across the country\nLook at a early screenings up at the end and everyone says you know it's amazing and we don't show anything that was very important to us the book it's not like that the book is the book is very graphic and goes into all the details of you know all the things that this guy did which is really difficult\nIt's a difficult read but the but the movie is very very accessible and it's an import exactly if you say\nIt's happened you know in America not in some backwater not in some other century\nYou know between the two you know media capitals of the world and and crickets you know my husband came across the story very much by ads for failing that Salem Wendy ... you know went into the courtroom it was a couple of men and women missing 'em\nAnd then there were these banks upon banks of the ... reserved seats because they expected such a media interest they reserve the biggest courtroom and then no one turned up\nYou know it's extraordinary and and you know there's so many aspects of this story that a newsworthy obviously this man kill children which should be newsworthy in itself\nBut he also had you know he had kept trophy ... feet of children kept them in jars\nHe also had employed a Fifteen year old to give that a ... that was the chief anesthesiologist and by the way and you're a Fifteen year old and by the way to everyone everyone said agreed that they were lucky the patience that they had her and didn't have the other nurses and I'm doing air quotes here because the other nurses\nHad a combined you know their average the average education was about the seventh grade they were and they had a cocktail of like alcoholism sexual abuse drug addiction and as one of the detectives gym or the ... the prime detective and said you wouldn't let them know you're alone\nLet alone give people drugs so they had the Fifteen year old and it's out of the the L just they had cats\nWalking around through the ... procedure rooms they had ... who came up night Dr ... nice\nAt to this place and would be eating breakfast cereal in the room with the people were doing these procedures I mean this was an extraordinary thing the bodies were piled up by the way in the basement you know and the body for piled up in the refrigerator same place where people have to peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and that wasn't newsworthy that wasn't newsworthy in America you know I mean that's you know ...\n... ... who's written a book about gods now the two specific things and I think to conservatives these issues are familiar that kept the media way one it involved abortion although\nAbortion the way it is done legally in Nebraska but done\nMuch like a slaughterhouse and I don't think I'm overreaching no no I Know you're not to ... now he was black\nYeah it's funny actually it's funny somebody just wrote to me and said to me are you worried about being called racist\nI was working on this story for nearly two years before I realized with black you just knew the name I just you know I met him I mean I met him I Know I never noticed he was black and I met that might sound weird to people but it's like the least interesting thing about him like I literally didn't taking notes of his ... of the color of skin because it's like\nHere's the Seventy two year old doctor who delivered baby's life and then cut the next what scissors and it's like somebody said to me you know he's black and I went oh God yeah\nHe is actually but I ... we had never thought of us\nI mean and I'm telling you the God's honest truth my husband and I neither of\nNoticed that he was black now tell me about this the most interesting thing I think about your ... shoes you got a chance to sit for three hours and talk to this man in person yeah for you in the same or were you through glass no I\nWas in the same room and I mean I was like yeah well not good because I expected to have the glass I thought were going to have the ... the protection of the Plexiglas and in fact actually we're in this kind of coffee lounge where he had you know very free reign he was allowed to even move his chair and what he did was he came in I was backed up against the door about against ah against the wall\nAnd he pushed his chair opened his legs and kind of you know trapped me between his legs if you do what I mean I had my legs crossed and then continuously touched my my my knee as he would make points on sorry once I'm terribly sorry\nAnd he was like you know kind of electric kind of character he has this Melissa Lewis voice the soft voice he smiles all the time kind of laugh you know and here he is serving life sentences and talks about you know she was an awful shame he didn't get into the poetry class\nAnd and that he's reading the Koran in two different versions two different translations because he's just so role like that\nAnd you know he's getting to play a lot of music which is great you know when he listens to a lot of music it's you know he really liked reading and hasn't been able to read because he's been so busy all these years when you get to read true crime which he really enjoys\nI mean you're sitting there and he by the way he sang to me twice in the middle of this yeah because he was talking about music and then he said you know all you know when I started listening to ... you know ... and every now and again during the three hours he would do this brain free thing where he'd say what's the name what's the name\nAnd I love ... by the way the Belgian crude or who died you I've read a lot of your listeners would know having a big smoker and I think he just basically smoked himself to death but he had this incredible voice and goggles looking at me think what's the name what's that song what's the name of that song doubling the famous and I'm sitting there thinking do I tell them do I tell them at ...\nAnd then of course I say you know kind of ... and then he leans right in Maine goes\nMimic he did and start singing the song basically don't ever leave me you know it's like\nAre you serious as this what's happening right now yeah so does this guy has\nNo sense of what he's done or or the reaction that most people would have that you just generically told the story I mean left out the door but just said he murdered a couple of ... inch does anyone know for certain how many babies were put to death by by having their spines nip it was a pair of shoes\nWell according to the grand jury you know which I think you know if you think of how long they stop what they've sent her to evidence they've had thousands\nBut it was not an ... you said in your introduction it is very face to face he's America's biggest serial killer and you know John Wayne gave the Ted Bundy the Saudi I kill all of them combined come nowhere near that\nOregon with the military person who was on several that within the confines of hearing that will carry it in a legal question that display is first illegal for that too because\nThe state statute allows that have certain locations\nYeah that's right so we'll see what happens I've a feeling they might try to shut us down but we've been shut down by bigger people than the chief it'd be as you so\nLet me ask you about a couple of baby weight actually plan to talk to you about should stop and frisk be used in high crime cities like Chicago which seems to be the murder capital of North America now\nWe can't quit that became famous New York city in the Nineteen days destined to two thousand a year and stuff for Mayor Bloomberg was kind of set piece of that but it was really based on a policy so my\nBy my answer is yes\nShould make another here's\nWhat I think the situation is is you know the federal court\nIn New York ruled that it was just it it's just for that was disparate effect on people of color and so the court said the base of the population one point nine percent in New York City and the arrest twenty\nPercent for for for violating the constitution equal protection so uh but this is what this is like ... like ... we just give up I don't know we just give up I guess we don't try to redo the policy\nWe try to focus less on the criminal part of it and more on the fact that we take guns off the street I really don't care if it's you know the FBI for many years had our current criminal is one of their top priorities and we ... we focused on the feathers with guns\nThat was that was okay and they got heavy casualties for that\nBut the real situation in New York just like it was a Chicago now with somewhere in the neighborhood I think twenty three hundred shootings this year down down some from\nA year ago at this time or is that we eat because off the street and if we have to press the law that we we have to create a policy that is consistent with what the court says search we're disparate treatment\nOf of a of a minority communities let's take another whatever let's try it again in fact let's get to the purpose of justice for just as our partners it was partly to really figure out a way to get back to the street and get those jumped off you're never sure what the average from David jail\nWe could all that good or bad when the guns God we have those individual lives are worth saving and that's what we are discussing it isn't by life by life it's we would feel better that there are issues Chicago basic sort of have this year but are people that they shot it ... ...\nNo not yet let me ask you about this you know the Portland in particular is getting negative attention not just nationally but internationally about the fact that antifa is now running the streets\nAnd the police are standing idly by while they watch motorists be threatened intimidated and my threatened I mean one there's video of one of the ... and folks saying turn your car down there or I Will kick your ass\nThat's not nobody has to interpret of Toronto that it's it's a primary Fisher case for that and you and the police we see police officers standing watching from a block away and doing exactly nothing so I Want to get your take on that and and what's happening\nI asked the mayor's office\nAs effective police to that as a marriage responsibility is that the ... that's ... that's where the dime starts but on the way up the mayor should be asking that question was four or five or standard route washed our streets we blocked although I'll tell you is brave enough to pick on eighty year old people in wheelchairs\nAnd bully or was the other side of us who asked them to please please ... aboard outside of Portland because she was ill and it ... it it made a stressful they start pushing around so this is the crowd\nThat that is equal opportunity budget cowards is what they really are and I have to tell you that ... that I think it's worth taking a look at what is that where the roadblock is between the mayor the cliche of the guys on the street now I Hope the guys on the street I don't think they are but I worked a lot of cops\nThat are here to make a make a point about this mayor and the leadership\nIn the city is that for his way for the cost to deny that people think is when they act or

mention these law school students and what I Can't figure out\nIs why more people who are taxpayers around America who provide a lot of the funding that allows kids to go to college and go to law school\nOr not objecting to the overt use of law schools and colleges and universities as political tools let me give you this example a dozens and dozens of law students walked out of class in New York\nOn Wednesday one day after justice Brett Kavanaugh heard his first cases on the Supreme Court and they wanted to protest his confirmation yesterday there was a lot of rage across the political spectrum says Justine Medina who's a Brooklyn law school student who helped organize the demonstration Kavanaugh's confirmation of the Supreme Court last week obviously\nPrompted public outrage multiple allegations of sexual assault you know the whole pack of allies of the Democrats have put together\nAfter his testimony before the Senate almost a thousand female faculty members of law schools around the country signed a letter opposing his nomination and guess what the Supreme Court did the right thing they confirmed him\nBecause that's what the ah that's what the Senate is supposed to I said Supreme Court I meant the Senate the groups have been at the letter which included we demand that anyone seeking to be elected to Congress in November commits to impeaching Kavanaugh to protect any semblance of the rule of law and the people of our communities well this is ridiculous because\nThe job of the Senate in this case is to advise and consent not be a rubber stamp\nBut here's their job you take a look at a candidate for Supreme Court and you decide is he or she qualified for the job Ruth Bader Ginsburg for example was not Republicans cup of tea\nAnd yet she was confirmed by a vote of Ninety six to three why Republicans didn't like this lawyer coming from the ACLU they didn't agree with her but they looked at her and said she is qualified to do the job\nTherefore it's not our place to tell the president who should be there and you heard a lot of that language of the last week well he may be qualified but he's not the right man for the job well the person who decides whether or not a particular man or woman is the person for the job is the president\nThe Senate can say this president you've nominated a thoroughly unqualified candidate we reject him or her\nBut in this case they had to admit that Brett Kavanaugh was ... was a a fully qualified candidate\nSo their job was to simply affirmed that and put them on the court which is what they finally at long last it with one Democrat voting the right way now I mentioned this little off it was amazing to\nWatch this president Donald Trump sitting behind a resolute desk in the oval office today and Kanye West sitting across the desk premium\nAnd Donald Trump listing for I Would say the better part of about ten minutes now I'm not going to play all of it but I wanted to play just a little bit of this because this is Kanye West and I know the standard line from the left is what this man is crazy now why did they think he's crazy because he he's a successful black American\nWhose conservative in a lot of his views not all of them and he supports Donald Trump to the left anybody who supports Donald Trump is crazy as far as I'm concerned they probably think I'm Crazy well I'm find to be put on I'm OK with being put in that category but take a listen to just a bit of ...\nI have a I have to say that basically said that welfare of the reason why a lot of black people and say you know first of all the letters are a lot of jobs are so as the father of the job and they say we're getting more money for have more\nAnd then we got rid of the mental\nHealth Institute and age that I and the ...\nRace just shy and I was shot right which is actually far harder it's going down right now he\nHe mentioned ... Iraq a clear reference to Chicago which has an amazing number of murders and inept Democrat leadership of that city that doesn't seem to be able to get a handle on the problem area and saw\n... ... ah I think it's the way\nFor it but it has\nIt gives you power in a way he's talking about the hat that does keep America great or keep America great twenty twenty or make America great Donald Trump's campaign slogan and he's saying this how gives you power and why\nYou know my dad and my mom separate site and have a lot a male heir she and my home and also a marriage or family that I'm\nGoing to\nYou know everyone but like has\nMade me feel that the guy that he can get all the time like the guy\nIt was something that I had and may feel like Superman you made\n... era now\nThat's Kanye West saying that by putting that had on he becomes a superhero I Know that a lot of the left who said this man is crazy and yet in all of what he just said\nDo you do you find anything to object to he says he grew up without a male figure in his life and that that damaged him he said that an awful lot of young men end up on welfare and they effectively said to young women\nSo this because America is very important market for them so I I guess the thing that's occurred to me lately 'cause I'm not a big expert on trade but but\nBut seat and why is it that it didn't occur to anybody in politics right or left before now they're doing multinational uh you know agreements was a bad deal I mean to me it would be like\nYou know when you sit down with with forty family members and say let's all figure out where to go on vacation we'll all throw in our favorite thing but it will make will make the agreement to go on and so somebody says the beach and somebody else says the mountains in somebody else's camping in someone else's Vegas and you say now\nWe are going to come up with a deal for vacation then makes everybody happy you know it makes no no the happy well what ... and it probably screws you the United states\nWell first of all of those I don't know if you ever saw the movie theaters it's with George Clooney I did and if it old wine family or do some amazing Hawaiian real estate and it's going to Fox or they have to decide what they're going to do with the truck is coming due and they can't hold onto it again just keep it\nAnd so all these disparate family members living off of wealth for years\nHave to come together and agree on what they're\nTalking about um but no this is you know I I think it's not ignorance I think it was the various I think the American trade representatives over the last fifty years\nHave had deals with big if it wanted to move overseas so they went and cut deals that made it easier for them to move overseas I think this was intentional and I think Trump watched it and he was involved and and and and those are machinations over the decades\nAnd he knew it was changed at all and he knew it was stupid and that's part of what he campaigned on was I'd seen as go down for years this was in an accident\nAnd it's not going to be an accident we reversed course\nNo and and in fact when we do that as far as I'm concerned the other thing that's always been missing lately is the willingness of American politicians to say we're going to do what's good for us first and often times what's good for the United states has a nice spillover effect for everyone else\nBut we are not going to say well we'll do what's good for the whole country or for the whole world and and if it happens to work out well for the United states grade and if it doesn't\nWell too bad for us well apparently approach light light as\nWell you know people confused America First with America only know and as you point out when good things happen for us ... hey we're pretty magnanimous and we understand the market economies and we should or should\nAnd if we knew well one of the world's biggest economy if we're doing well it were ripples out throughout the entire world look what happened to the world economy on the other side of the coin when we stupidly sold houses to people by the millions who couldn't afford our\nWater back into the global economy when all what our housing market collapsed the entire global economy collapsed so conversely good things happen for us good things happen for everybody and and and and take care of ourselves a tourist does it mean taking care of ourselves Ollie\nNow do you think that we can be successful in getting trying to to understand that we no longer want to do business with the country if they're going to insist on ripping off our secrets and and will is actually produce what we want\nOut of here so we we we need to they got they got their laws set up ... in a way we need to ... foot ours and do they have very light ... chicken protection very very strong protections we have very strong or a train ticket protections\nAnd very weak and protect shows and that that'll allow China to

facts\nUm we have Deborah Ramirez\nWho accused cabin up um justice cabinet um of doing to her what Bill Clinton did to Paula Jones as governor of the night of of of the state of Arkansas um it was sued when he was president of the United states and money was president of the United states Gloria Steinem oh laughed\nIt off he took no for an answer who cares if he whipped it out to an underlying as governor of the state so maybe we can at least get Gloria Steinem under oath to explain why um it is just qualifying for a drunken college freshman to do that something I don't think anyone believes Brett Kavanaugh ever did\nAnd there are certainly no corroboration evidence witnesses or contemporaneous statements to back it up\nUm but in theory you what the accusation was something that it's just qualifying for John college freshman to do but hey okay for a governor a of a state in the United states to do and\nI'm the first accuser the one who is um testimony was what was supposed to be believable because people watched her and wow she sure looks credible to me\nBut hadn't mentioned it to anyone for Thirty years\nAnd what do you do when no one who backed it up at me and what about that front door she claims you had a front door because two front doors because the trauma everyone looked at at the house\nThis is a very expensive neighborhood she lives in um kids said that\nYou rent they rent out in an apartment in Google employees or insurance as she called them oh I think those interns are paying a pretty penny for that that isn't a front door to her house it seems perfectly clear that is a door to a rental apartment that's a lie under oath or fear of flying\nUm that certainly seemed to me to be falls and as much as ... jets all over the globe to go surfing\nOn who paid for the for the polygraph all I guess you correct in that one but whether she'd ever coached anyone on a polygraph or live in six your ex boyfriend\nSays that he was present when she was coaching and her friends on how to take a polygraph something she was asked about under oath and that night [noise] um you know the next the next tier rang\nUm the next Supreme Court justice to go and and be replaced and I have a few guesses about who that might be um it's it's going to be it's going to be an\nAbsolute this April May have an outlook like a day at the beach\nAnd what's the thinking I mean I'm just to some extent do you think prosecutors ... talking about the more local cases are afraid to do this for fear of being accused by the meat to crowd of you're attacking\nWomen know you're attacking a liar you're attacking a bright and you're so so what will it take to get those people to get a backbone and say we will go after every truly guilty sex offender in America but if you lie and tried to falsely accused somebody you too will face consequences\nNo in fact I think they should face the consequences of what they were accusing the other person of um false accusations of rape have sent have sent innocent men to prison um while I'm there's gotta be some some repercussions for that\nWell and and but where do you see the venue for being able to do I mean I'd like to do it but how do we do it I mean do you put pressure on the local prosecutor who's got the call it's not often as often gonna be a federal cases local case so how do we get this to change to where we we said this is part of taking you serious way\nThat we take your ... your true accusation so seriously that when we find a full one we're right through it equally hard\nHow do we get that dynamic to shift because right now I think most prosecutors would rather do anything in the world and go after a fall took user\nYes and as you indicate it's older men idea oh we don't want to discourage false accusers from coming forward no actually we do want to discourage that we don't want people's lives being real and um but you're right there's this feeling that you're going against actual rape victims\nAnd getting folks from point a to point B and all my colleagues or that I've been working heritage\nAbsolutely a great environment for us knowing that we're trying to have some solutions and provide some solutions for archery and it\nYou can find a lot of options will stay informed by logging on to via info dot net\nThat's as via info dot net\n[noise]\nI Try where here have a great
