counting on the house I've got to lean against the house right now that\nSo in that one percent starts to drop it could affect your heart your brain your kidneys your organs and your body shutdown actually died\nWow it's all one percent of the calcium always has to be in your system\nAnd there are two sources of calcium one isn't the diet you know and to us from the bones themself\n... absorb it back from the bones if ...\nThat's right and I say and what you just discussed right now leads to one of the major causes of a condition that the fact and twenty five million Americans right now which is called osteoporosis right which is a weakening of adult\nNow and that's due to the body deriving the calcium from the bones instead of from the nitrogen yup\nOkay and so we have to do is we have to find a way to put calcium back in the diet now you think that would be really easy\nSure just drink milk just drink milk or you know a lot of green leafy vegetables and that sort of thing but first of all people don't do that right\nAnd second of all the the quality of the calcium that comes from our diet has been decreasing in the last fifty years really yeah because things like pastures Asian food they're irradiated um the calcium as we turn the soil and\nPeople are taking medications that block it so\nThe actual calcium is that being absorbed in the body okay and then you see people taking toms and calcium supplements you know they buy the health food store drug maker drink but these\nThings don't absorb in the body that's out there for a couple of reasons\nOne uh when you take a let's say an antacid that had the calcium in it like a Tom's first of all calcium does that absorbed in the body unless it's an anesthetic environment but see what happens when you take a Tom is an antacid\nOh okay so even if you're getting calcium in the in the antacid itself is not being absorbed\nI see because it has to be in a in an acid environment for it to be absorbed\nExactly okay now we have a product called the ... formula\nMy combat formula it's natural and the differences is that the powder and what happened to be put in hot water and you mix it up and you drink it don't do it in a liquid instead of a pill\nAnd it absorbed into your system\nWow so that sounds that problem that well\nYeah because when Cal the magnesium earn a liquid stay it absorbs ten times better than in any other state\nWell that's great matter of fact yes I'm I'm reading the can right now says a fenced absorbing calcium and magnesium beverage powder\nWell it comes down to ... one of the way to tell if you're not observing calcium is take a look at what drugs are taking are you on high blood pressure medication you need something for your kidneys or you want pain medications you need sleeping pills that the calcium and especially the making these is being absorbed ... you're not going to suffer from all these things\nMy comment formula does or incredibly in the body the thing is is that what do you take my comment formula but not like well well I feel better I have thousands of people right at the doctor pain 'cause I Can't we're thirty minutes after it's over the counter pain in my wrist

seven three for\nIf you're just joining us I've got Dr Michael pink is on the phone today and we're talking about something that we're all too familiar with these days and that stress and we're finding out about the damage that everyday stress can do to our bodies the warning signs that we should be aware of and what we can do to alleviate and even eliminate the effects of stress\nAnd Dr ... you were talking earlier about calcium and magnesium and how we need these nutrients in our bodies to fight the effects of stress\nIn your ... formula can help us in this battle against stress I'd like to talk for a minute about how the magnesium\nFactors in I mean I I'm starting to understand about the calcium but what does magnesium\nForward talking about stress and we're talking about stress affects the body and first of all in order to function at all your body needs magnesium it's probably of all the vitamins I could list magnesium is probably the most important vitamin on the planet right now\nI've not heard a whole lot about magnesium ... why is magnesium so important\nThere's over three hundred and twenty five bio chemical reactions that magnesium is involved with it it's almost like a hormone wow and for example if it was low levels of magnesium\nYour heart beat ... very important factor in life yeah I Would say so in\nFact let me just read a list of some of the conditions are associated with magnesium deficiencies okay um you have attention deficit disorder Alzheimer's or anxiety asthma autism chronic fatigue syndrome\nCongestive heart disease caused the patient diabetes fibromyalgia high blood pressure insomnia\nMigraine headaches multiple sclerosis muscle cramps Parkinson's osteoporosis and the list goes on and on and on\nAnd this is this is associated with a a lack of magnesium in the money\nSimply a lack of magnesium bully too so it's not that they're really mess around with now what happens is that you need that many of them in your body in order for the calcium to be absorbed\nOh so it's it's a necessary thing in order to get the first component which is calcium\nThat's right they work in combination with each other that there's many more practical applications of this ... formula mhm first of all like I said you drink it gets into your system and one of the first things we use it for in our clinic is for people who are under a lot of stress and it can't sleep well at night\nIt works better than anything I've ever seen for people that have trouble sleep it really because it relaxes your body needs to actually feel the relaxation after you drink the ah after you drink a cup of the ...\nFormula interesting\nNow the other thing that it's really really good for our people who aren't paid\nOkay and I have a whole bunch of stories to tell you in a case studies of people actually taking the ... formula and getting rid of pain and this is included arthritic Taipei fibromyalgia which is a form of arthritis back pain muscle spasms migraine headaches there's a whole category of of various I'd like to discuss with you\nWow that's fantastic some of those things that you've named seem to be age related or or things that we experience as we grow older is there a link there yeah there's\nA vicious circle that I'd like to discuss what happens is that when a person has\nA magnesium deficiency specifically make museum they don't absorb their food as well\nAnd so they go into what we call mal absorption syndrome which millions and millions of Americans have and it's not like you feel sick or you know this that use it might be over time just starting to feel more tired and tired and tired mhm and that's just a real graduate overtime type of thing and a lot of people justify that they're getting old and they just need more breasts or whatever\nRight and that's what I Would think that what happens is that when when you get less absorption you actually increase the efficiency in your system of museums\nAnd that and that starts to take the count them out of the bones to start getting bald lost you start getting um muscle loss because it also reduces the muscle mass and pretty soon before you know it you are feeling old yeah and your body's actually starting to manifest that\nWow all due to a simple lack of these nutrients\nCalcium and then they'll let me tell you and it is simple the problem and being a doctor researchers how do you get the end of the system the formula we have the ... formula is so fantastic because it's a powder form you take hot water and you make if you put it in a cop take a teaspoon of this powder and mix it in you and your drink is cut down\nThe screenplay absorption rate is really a incredible because it it actually goes right into your bloodstream\nFeeling all your joints don't move well this kind of wife's you out it drains your energy and then then you get tired and you go to sleep I guess what you don't sleep\nNow I'm I'm telling you like common scenario due to a lack of calcium and magnesium in your system when you have the comics and the first thing that happened you take a twenty minutes before you go to bed ... a good night's sleep and wake up feeling refreshed your energy comes back\nIs killing me safe I mean you're telling us how powerful ... and I'm just wondering if you can ever take too much or if it's safe to take if you're already on a ... any supplements or medications\n... never ever been shown to interact poorly with any medication\nOkay it's a hundred percent natural state and you know our our formula doesn't contain sugar which isn't a lot of calcium products wheat soy gluten lactose or anything that people are trying to avoid illness doesn't have any of that but you see the point is is that if you're a person who's a diabetic you're on high blood pressure you had bypass surgery guess what\nYou are deficient you are deficient in the calcium and magnesium\nDr Baker's unfortunately we're about

know when Mitch McConnell came out and said your vote your votes right here this vote\nThis is the biggest oh you're going to have because we're a lot of them their votes are largely nobody cares you know pay any attention but this whole big for two reasons one\nBecause of what it is going to do with the court and two because some of these people he knows voting in certain directions they're going to be issues down the road absolutely\nThis is\nInteresting very interesting I Love Chuck Schumer says here though\nLet no American be surprised\nIf judge Kavanaugh becomes a decisive vote to restrict the rights and privileges of the American people while stretching the bounds of privilege for the current occupant of the White House\nOr the fear factor fear card always good everybody has that is what they do\nAgain you it's no longer you being a you go out and you're talking from the microphones and you do your thing it's no longer that right you don't get to do that anymore\nIt's not that now it's you've got to be able to get everybody riled up you have people bussed in and and you know I was thinking today what what has gone so let's say was it was a female right it was it was a ... a\n... that would have been the one right like here's here's a woman who is a lot of people thought it was going to be very good super Hoover pro life there were already\nTaking aim at her over the last couple of days thinking they might have Kavanaugh done they were taking aim at her and then some of the group she's been associated with because she was going to come in and destroyed the whole row the weight and this is what it again it it wouldn't have mattered but how would that have gone\nLike these are the things that you know just understand this for what it is it was politics and now

federal court in lower Manhattan the first of these defendants is are being tried three of them\nUm one executive with the data's one consultant for Adidas or who was also a coach on the grass roots basketball circuit these basketball circuit\nAnd I'm One what's called St agent or runner or one of these operators and the grassroots circuit or who was said to be involved in\nSoliciting money for a player to attend the University of Louisville and that is one of the central threads in this case the recruitment of Brian gumbo and junior a who committed to Louisville and uh never quite made it there\nYou know I always tell everybody as dirty as you think a pilot politics can be and you know this better than anybody Michael a college basketball and the recruitment of\nKids is so dirty and it is so bizarre with a U and the you know ... which camp you're involved in and all of this kind of stuff in these really weird kind of ancillary characters they get involved with players and it's just so it's it's it's awful\n[noise] it's a swamp you're exactly right it's an excellent it's an absolute swamp and I you know look I still follow college basketball and I like college basketball I like the game I like the sport but I always chocolate people who\nWant to watch college sports because they think it's somehow more pure I mean professional sports is pure you know what it is you know what the players are getting paid uh it's it's fair to the workforce\nA you know with some exceptions I'm not sure it but the NFL in that category but but college sports at the highest level\nIt's just a swamp and that's what the FBI uncovered\nNo one in college sports in the industry is shocked by anything that was uncovered what was shocking was it was the NC double a rat or or it was the FBI rather than the NC double a who was the cop on the beach here\nYeah absolutely talking to Michael a cycle of his new book the last ... Rick Pitino and Rick Pitino is the one right I mean you've got all these guys now these coaches even somebody who's ...\nYou know ... you realize that you're you're a holding place it's a one and done we're going to get these kids in here they are going to be super storm McDonalds all Americans\nAnd uh we get him here we have maybe a good run to the sweet sixteen the final four maybe a chance at a championship and then I got to turn around and retold his program every single year and that's where it gets weird Rick Pitino is one of the best of bringing them on in\nWell he was although you know one of the interesting things isn't that Pitino wasn't the best recruiter he wasn't getting all the best players um you know to his credit\nHe achieved final four is a national championships with guys who weren't lottery picked she wasn't getting the players coach K was getting or or um ... or ... bill self at Kansas um but\nUh he apparently wanted one of them here with with Brian bow and junior and ah didn't play the game quite cleverly enough\nTalking about the game and and this is very interesting and for those people out there and making college more as we look at it we think oh it's it's it is pure just kind of like the Olympics the reality is there's so much money there's billions and billions of dollars in it and one of the places that millions of dollars comes from is the athletic side of the the Nike or Adidas\nThe Under Armour the and one because these kids they go out they recruit them young ages you who you're going to play for which a Eugene but you go into the night camped you're going to the deepest camp it's vitally important and then a lot of ways they'll try to funnel you to certain schools that are you know that have contracts\nThat's what happened here you know uh\nI think a lot of fans think well they want to put shoes on kids in eighth grade or because they think that you know they they might be an end of this kid might be an NBA player and he's going to be a Nike a indoor sure when it gets the NBA\nThat's a small part of the center of what they really want to do what it does Nike and Under Armour largely want to do is funneled kids to the schools they sponsor and then they are human billboards you know within this amateur sport\nThey are human billboards for whichever apparel they're wearing and that is one of the most cynical things\nSo Louisville signed to sign a hundred and sixty million dollar contract with the ... and all these kids are wearing Adidas stuff from the bookstore by the way you can barely find a book you know after you you know after you get through all the details gear and that's true\nYou know at Ohio State with Nike or\nUnder Armour at at UCLA where the former football coach said now everybody's going nowhere big time because we got this huge contract from Under Armour\nAnd it was like really you have seven Nobel Prize winners who came through UCLA you had John Wooden and it takes being associated with them Under Armour to be the time so everything is sort of turned upside down by the money and by the\nCommercial partnerships with a shoe companies\nTalking to Michael ... love and his new book a which is amazing last temptation of Rick Pitino story of corruption scandal and the big business of college basketball\nYou know now we've got ... we've got all of this stuff money huge March Madness the whole nine yards we always wink wink nudge nudge Israel played the pools and played the brackets and stuff\nI think this is going to affect the this moving forward because the NCAA is holding on for all they possibly can as far as their you know hey we're just amateurs their student athletes they get a free college ride but they see the money's at the coaches make that the NCAA makes and now you've got betting and how's that going to play into this\nOne of the betting is just going to make it ever bigger um you know the the the kids who play these games generate money in ways we don't even think of the recruiting sites you\nKnow rivals dot com and uh you know the whatever bleacher report runs and I I Can't remember all the names of them\nBut they're they're all these\nUh betting all these recruiting sites that that run on\nThey're doing by the way the impeachment thing is a myth I mean they could do it but they know they know what's pointless because they're not going to be able to get him off the Supreme Court\nSo if they do it it's all just if it's all just shadows pay no attention but the man behind the curtain that kind of stuff um some some of the clear thinking I'm Democrats are saying well you know if it will after the blah blah blah blah that kind of stuff ah my theory is that they're talking it up\nThe possibility of impeachment until the election and even if they get control of the house\nThey're not going to get control the Senate so you're going to get control the house\nOr the Senate is the one who votes on the punishment the Senate is not going to vote to kick him off two thirds vote they're not going to have to think about so it's a pointless waste of time to even do it\nMy theory is they're talking it up until the mid term happened and then once the midterms go away once they're all you know in their place if they get the Democrats get control the house or they'll get control the house Judiciary Committee\nA there are probably just going to put it on the back burner and not waste any time but uh you know talk about how it's a possibility for a while because they know they don't have the votes to get him off and it's pointless even try so my theory is it's just an election ploy this by the way this entire thing has just been a lecture play\nThe entire thing has just end up paying during a election play that's all it's been but I Want to play a if you're just doing it I Want to play the part in Trump's speech again when he goes comes out to a you know do the swearing in and apologizes to the cabinet family it's a little less than a minute law but let's go ahead and play that Chris\nI Would like to begin to nights proceeding differently than perhaps any other event of such magnitude on behalf of our nation I Want to apologize\nTo Brett and the entire Kavanaugh family for the terrible pain and suffering you have been forced to endure\nThose who stepped forward just serve our country deserves a fair and dignified evaluation not a campaign of political and personal destruction based on lies and deception\nWhat happened to the cabinet of family violates every notion of fairness decency and due process our country a man or woman must always be presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty [noise]\n\nSo I mean\nJust imagine that Trump apologized on behalf of the entire country mostly the Democrats because of the Democrats demographic crazy I'm but I'm going to be out of the entire country for what they had to go through when the Democrats fabricated this entire story\nImagine how desperate they must be for power\nI mean truly imagine how desperate they must be for power if they're willing to fabricate and that's what this what\nIf they're willing to fabricate and in tire\nA sexual assault story and use a woman who didn't remember this used up upon Dr former just upon\nAgain don't know that she was a sexually assaulted we do know that it wasn't my Brett Kavanaugh 'cause she has no for an even her own witnesses wouldn't supporter but I'm so we know that but imagine that they used a woman like that as a pond\nOrder to maintain power absolutely positively used this woman\nIf she was sexually assaulted a we know it wasn't by Brett Kavanaugh but she was just assaulted again by the entire Democratic Party for that and now the Democrats are ah putting out a call they want to um ... the the\nFrom ah Brooklyn from New York who is the Democratic socialist I don't know if you've ever heard her speak\nShe is she might be the stupidest person on the face of the planet and that's not because she's a woman and it's not because she's a democratic socialist if because she might actually be the stupidest individual on the face of the planet\nI Want to do a test ... paste out like they used to have an preschool but a little thing a paste out in front of her and see if she eats it\nBecause she's going around ah she tweeted the other day calling for an end for the electoral college she's talking about how because you've got to where we all know she's going to win the competition out there uh she's talking about how she's going to be inaugurated into the costs", "year": "2018",
