soldier and what we're talking about is the original announced soldier and it's really a a solemn and an important story in American history that I tell in the book the unknowns which I wrote and\nIt's it's really a remarkable story we did not have the with with the conclusion of World War one we did not have it on the soldier for several years the um you know\nThe war department felt that they could identify the twenty seven hundred Americans that were listed as a male and they were in many of them had been badly ... mutilated by heavy artillery shells et cetera they were missing in action\nIt was hard to tell who is who is still unknown but they still felt that they could do it and um there was the thought that the that all of our soldiers could be identified and that really it wasn't happening and what what occurred though is the great powers like France and England\nBoth decided to designate a special to for those who are considered a no it it really represented all of those who had fought in the great war is a sense of of clip give me a sense of closure to the war\nAnd what happened is in the United states there was a movement that that was created interestingly

Russo who's an attorney former law enforcement officer and the author of ... one cops kill and blue news Lance it's good to have you back on the program although the circumstances as usual when we talk to you are less than ideal because we now have people who have died\nBecause of a a horrific act of violence\nAbsolutely I mean it's a tragedy when there's any life lost but these things are just senseless [noise]\nWell tell me this though the president was asked a question for which a lot of reporters only use the answer making it appear that Donald Trump it immediately change the subject to guns but he was actually asked\nShould the synagogues have armed security of some kind either hired or members of the synagogues congregation so that they're capable of protecting themselves that's not blaming the victim it saying how do we avoid these murders and the future\nWell the answer is simple and the answer is easy to divine if you apply logic to the facts we have security outs outside and inside the doors of court houses that are or we have the same thing it capitals we have the same thing now it's schools with school resource officers\nYou start with an assessment of the level of risk of the facility\nAnd what that facility as a fortune five hundred company or a mom and pop grocery store whether it's a synagogue or mosque or a church you start with an assessment of how vulnerable is it that can be a function of where it's located how many people attend 'em how public the services are\nAnd something as simple as locking doors is the first level of security but you got to go beyond that in this environment and law enforcement has on dirt for years why more of these things are not happening\nAt so called soft targets and they're soft targets because it's very easy for someone to penetrate them any once they get beyond that first level of security\nThere's really nothing to stop a madman and that's what these people are they're they're mad\nIndividuals' we've seen mass\nAttacks with knives with edged weapon we've seen massive tax with I ease\nAnd we don't even law enforcement only and column active shooters any Mali call of activists say let's because of the myriad of ways that they try to Maine and kill\nYou know it's interesting lens I've been to Israel five different times in the last less than Twenty years\nAnd when you go there and I would imagine that not every single member of tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh has been to Israel but when you go there you routinely see armed security everywhere at grocery stores at places where even in the United states who wouldn't routinely see them like you mentioned in government buildings at banks and things like that\nBut you would think knowing that that's a country that knows it has to protect itself and even on the very very grassroots level\nThat you would think it would make perfect sense to say we we need to have some some way to repel an attack like this the police will be there quickly but not nearly quickly enough to stop this kind of of of murder and and there were in fact for police officers who were wounded as well and so\nYou know this this is something that and yet in that very city in Pittsburgh last week the school board voted not to allow police officers to carry guns in schools and then a couple of days later this happens I Wonder how the vote might have gone out the vote been taken this week instead of last week\nWell it probably won't be changed sadly\nThat you know we see this over and over and over again I've had clients who were told they couldn't bring their children\nTo daycare to drop them off in the morning on their way to work in uniform\nBecause they were carrying a firearm you know and people have said well we don't need firearms they do need people to to be able to react to it we just have metal detectors well first of all metal detectors at a house of worship basically would be running\nThe individuals who support the congregation through the metal detectors and if somebody shows up to the metal detectors and start shooting\nYou still are start stabbing people are dropping an id you still have to have someone to protect them\nAnd someone should respond to that threat and\nYou know it's really interesting and due to a you mentioned the law enforcement response an excellent law enforcement response the United states about four to six minutes yup and due to an incredible military and an incredible law enforcement force throughout the United states\nWe have lived in relative comfort with soft targets being exposed other countries recognize that these target need on security and you know I listen to the nearest Pittsburgh's comments and he said he does not want to live in a world where we have to have on security outside of a church\nWell no one does but that's the ...\nWell and would you I imagine I haven't checked but I'd be willing to bet you ten dollars lands that the mayor of Pittsburgh has\nArmed security with him do would you imagine\nThat there's armed security at the mayor's office there is in almost any medium to large size city in America there's armed security with public officials heck you go to a ball game at the stadium at a university there is routinely armed security not may take the form\nOf state police were assigned to that event but they understand\nLarge gatherings of people are are often the target of Mad Men like this Robert Ballard\nWell it would not surprise\nMe if the mayor of Pittsburgh it's a large city I visited it's great city I wouldn't surprise me if there is on security but with you know people don't even realize that confidence as that law enforcement college as we've had our security outside of the doors before and and even though law enforcement tends to be a harder target\nThere's a vulnerability there where people are not focused on their own safety\nSo how do we fix this problem I mean because if we have institutions like those who say and I'm not for forcing it on them but how do we how do we stop this problem if the people who are perhaps a the most attractive targets the nuts like Robert Bowers will not protect themselves\nWell the first thing is be realistic and stop living in a dream world you can't say to yourself well we don't want bad things to happen here and therefore they won't happen but that's just not realistic in addition you know my son has been retain several times\nTo help design security programs are trained people inside of houses of worship\nBecause there's a recognition that there is a different risk\nFor a little church than there is for a church in the downtown area with a lot of exposure\nYou know what happens I watch CNN now here in the northwest if the police go to a meth house and mommy and daddy meth cook are there and there's three kids there and do you know what happens to the kids when the police arrested ...\nAbsolutely they do and there's absolutely no reason people present themselves at the border that's a legal thing for them to do and no it's\nNot for asylum weeds not to the border is not you know we're not allowed to cross the border with Jeff I'm I'm really curious you we started with the subject of whether or not the media's the enemy of people and you agreed with me the bad information can be damaging to somebody in in some cases it can literally be deadly\nIf you get bad information sure and I told you that I think the press corps is supposed to be self regulating that is you and you said you're not seeing any of it can you give me\n... I was in jail say look you know my well I mean I see my point is that sure the press has problems and there's going to be biased reports out there there's going to be\nIncorrect report generally the press a self correcting I find but not always they haven't been in this case you might miss that using the term I mean the turn the enemy of the people is not a neutral terms\nAnd it originated in ancient Rome where it was he used to designate someone who could be executed on site\nI don't think any you know you know the Trump is not using and he's saying that if if you need\nTo try to tell you that you know why are you using that phrase I mean you have reporters\nI think the president is right you think they're the enemy of the ... not all of them just as Sarah Huckabee Sanders said I'm not saying all what's no I'm not saying all and I need to wait till we\nAll first and then you know we I mean do people need to be that it didn't know what exactly you know none of that term here's the muscle shouldn't get like the old on Jeff you want to determine on an answer against you know just go ahead and are not right away and get wired\nLibel against Jews are entirely different if you say that bad information is dangerous or damaging and the people who are feeding that bad information are the mainstream media and I think you know I mean I could send an everyday listed out is\nThe New York times the Washington Post the Seattle Times the Portland, Oregon in Eugene writes cash register guard the Boise paper and list them all off\nAny publication Fox News or ... or Breitbart hold our hold on\nFox News sometimes as part of the problem and and I did I I agree with you there but here's the solution the solution to anything when it comes to information is sunlight and transparency and here's why\nIf you have an entire press corps that for the most part with a few exceptions you've mentioned and they aren't always on the same page either\nIf if the entire press corps marching to one set of music right down the street and you see this and you know this was happening the Washington Post the New York times and all the rest of those\nAre not telling a different story or country story they say whatever the story is today we're all going to go the same direction the way to stop that used to call them out but you have\nTo have somebody who has both the platform and the guts to call them out if nobody calls them out and most most politicians\nAnd most politicians won't do it because there is a political downside in other words they're an awful lot of people in Washington DC including some of our Republican friends\nWho won't say butter if they have a mouthful they they they could say well you know the New York times really did a job or NBC but they understand the old at the old admonition you don't pick a fight\nWith somebody buys ... by the barrel or the digital equivalent today electrons by the barrel you don't pick a fight with them because they will just the pavement with you so most of them won't call out the press corps for really agree just abuses of this president specifically Darryl afraid to\nGo ahead ... ... when the president I mean sure then called them out for their bias but using that phrase enemy of the people is no accident\nStop I don't know if you're seeing some deeper meaning in what Trump is saying I really honestly don't think that\nI Need to be defeated they need to be destroyed and he wanted to do\nI Want to defeat them by the mechanism I just explained if you have a report let's say you have somebody who writes a book and it's a bunch of crap and he gets called he or she gets called out on it and his book sales\nDisappear and nobody wants to publish his books any more than that is a solution I'm going to give you a

[noise]\nHey this is Shawn Ryan might get more of a PSA every day at Facebook Twitter and online at KPSK dot com stay connected\n[noise]\n... one of our country is hurting likely staying on in the last several days as find ways to bring our country together and we've seen him do exactly that that he has certainly I think\nFound us now next to bring our country together and certainly focus on some of the things that all of us can support and all of us I came down this law now\nThat is Sarah Huckabee Sanders speaking just a few hours ago at the White House during a briefing\nAnd I'm going to see if my friend Conrad Juan Williams from Fox News you know him from Fox News whether or not he agrees with Sarah Huckabee Sanders that that is what the president has been trying to do and that's what the president will do for America is provides immunity especially in troubled times what are you said comrade\nWell I Would hope so you know the thing is it's a mixed message ... sometimes he tries to do it he looks like he's reading something a teleprompter but he's doing it and I'm sharing them\nAnd then it gets to one of those rallies and he's back on the presses the or sometimes it's on Twitter I must say in the middle of the night like three am and he's there saying that presses the enemy that people the press is dividing this country because they're attacking me and he makes himself into the victim as opposed to the people who are dead\nWell see I tend to agree with them and I've been in some long conversations with listeners why I say if you had somebody who gave you bad information and some members of the process now you necessarily but you know I have disagreements with you about policy issues ad is if you're getting bad info that he is\nA dancer antithetical to good government and a and to this country in some cases if you're trying to persuade people a ... of of a point of view that isn't backed up by the facts and I so I'd say because I've asked people if somebody gave you bad info could kill you\nAnd the answer is yes and then if they don't come to that conclusion I give them an example or two of were bad information can kill you or it can hurt you\nAre and if you're giving bad information to a whole country it could be terribly injurious to this country and and most of that is focused on President Trump because the press most of the mainstream media seems to hate the guy's guts\nYou know what I don't agree with you I think that one my job as a journalist should be to hold power for people to account\nOr what they're doing I Henri with that\nAnd so I think I think liberals and conservatives can agree on that point we don't want government officials running wild spending money in acting policies in behind closed doors we don't need it the second thing I Would say to us huh\nThe press spreading inflammation large what about the president saying things that aren't true I think the Washington Post has him up at five thousand lives it's unbelievable\nWell and some of that when I looked at those lists one\nSome of it as a matter of opinion ah for example do we think that ten or twelve thousand people all saying we're going to conspire to cross the border of your country and enter your country illegally\nIs that something that's a threat to the United states and I'd say yes it is not in the same way that China is or Russia or Ron uh but but it's a threat now when people say we're going to simply ignore your laws\nUh he says it's a threat I'm sure everybody else says I've seen plenty of liberals say oh no it's not a tried all these are just poor people want a different place to live and and so the when lies like that get called out where you say that's a lie\nIt's a matter of opinion now on factual things I Know the president said he brought about the largest tax cut in American history and folks have said well no there were a couple of them were actually larger in percentage terms or whatever\nUm look as far as I'm concerned I I I don't like it either when he does things like that but on the other hand if we called every politician every time they've said this is the biggest or the best of the first or the last or whatever uh we'd be calling politicians all day long on on those kinds of things\nUh excuse me can I get Lars Larson out on the line as far as large as a matter of our lives lost and going up on ... Obama if you'll like your doctor you can remember that\nLot did you ... oh my dad Lars Larson went ballistic went nuts I went nuts\nYou know you can then that kind of what you said was false it and I said you know what I understand that he made a mistake but you're right Lars\nIf that's not true it's not true okay why did why would you have a different standard for this president then the last president when this president does it all the time\nKnow one I have lots of friends who tell me that their business is the biggest or the best of the longest and that might think well if I really want to debate with you I could probably be chew on the fact but I also understand that some of that is just talk but what he's actually getting done for the cuts\nDo you think the mainstream press which I think you like a whole lot more than I Do like the ... and the New York times and and uh ... the chicken noodle news network and and MSNBC they won't give the guy credit for anything he got done will there\nAnything I boy I don't know I think what we had reports I mean obviously there's been some turbulence\nIn the uh financial markets up late but are there are people who are quick to give him credit\nAnd uh you know here at Fox News I think we look for opportunities to properly deservedly give him credit when credit is due and of course Fox is the biggest cable channel I think the wall Street Journal the biggest newspaper gives him a credit where credit's due\nYou notice how the the papers that actually tilt to the right to do a whole lot better than the ones that go to the left does that tell you about the audience\nI don't know I mean I think the wall Street Journal it's been pretty successful for a little bit of time\nThat's what I mean but but yeah I mean Fox has been very successful in the Trump era a and you would think if we're if we're told that people hate Donald Trump with a passion that Americans didn't want him that they reject him and that's what we're told is all the whole country hates the guy\nAnd and then the minute his approval ratings get actually better than Obama's words the same point his presidency they stop reporting on the approval ratings and say oh we\nDon't all ... you know you're feeding grievances fact is that when you look at Republican support for Donald Trump it's still in the eighties that's unbelievable it is it's almost universal\nHave you looked at black support since you are black ... black support for President Trump eight percent of the vote in twenty sixteen twenty three percent support by the middle of last year thirty six percent as we stand here today by the time we get to twenty twenty\nTrump on this on that on that trajectory Trump may get to the point where he is half of of black Americans supporting him now that are friends are\nAll those are such a weak pose with small sample size they said it's ridiculous but go right ahead so\nYou haven't heard about the black suit\nOh yeah that sort of Kanye West with others fraud\nBut it's not just Kanye West because if canyon county away could say anything he wants to but of black Americans weren't embracing at the numbers wouldn't be changing in that direction or would they\nKnow I say I think black Americans not embracing struggling you just tell you but I think that anybody who's the incumbent who has the pope it it's going to have some impact but you're talking about starting at a point so low\nThat increases are going to especially when you have a small sample size than a poll it's got a jump up and down but boy I wouldn't bet on that one and in fact going into this mid term election the big issue is not minority groups it's white women\nLars especially educated white suburban women and are given Trump's history Stormy Daniels and\nYou take care of those things and somebody's personal style means a whole lot less than when you have a failure of the country\nYou know because our economy was failing for eight years uh there were bad things going on and frankly people were being treated differently under the law and Donald Trump is done everything you can to make that change\nWell I agree with it yes it makes sense but I guess you know it's just like ... it gets to a point where everybody\nPuts down so many people because of Trump and it's like oh wait a minute and like he said he got to look at what he's done and he's done a lot from that\nIt's going to be that's what I Want it that\nWell and and and you know what you said makes perfect sense Debbie and thank you for the call by the way\nA couple of updates for you the caravan of now ten or twelve or fourteen thousand people is still headed to our southern border and where friday night we were being told there would be maybe another eight hundred to a thousand US ... service members dispatched to our southern border\nInstead it's going to be about fifty two hundred troops\nThat are going to be deploying as early as tomorrow the reinforced ones are headed for the U.S border there a non combat troops they include engineers aviation and medical personnel\nAnd if you think about it I Know that there are people on the left would like to characterize this as well the president has got to put a combat soldiers down there to shoot people as they come across the border\nIs not what's going to happen the U.S military is very good at building things an guarding borders and in this case guarding our own border seems at least as important as guarding some other countries border we also mentioned that Hillary Clinton is talking about running for president\nThis is the amazing statement you made this weekend\nHe want to run again now [noise] now because why well I'd like to be president okay [laughter]\nWhich is kind of spooky ended up itself as we had to Halloween because Hillary saying I don't want to run for president again I just want to be president\nWhat do you think you get there without running a campaign in persuading voters apparently she that's the way she thinks that happens I can just be president I don't have to actually run for it because frankly she's not very good at running a campaign [noise]\nI think hopefully when we have a Democrat in the oval office in January of twenty Twenty one\nThey're going to be so much work to be done and it's just going to be a lot of heavy lifting that less than ... oh I have no idea care but I I'm going to you know I'm not going to even think about to get through this on November ... election will come\nOn you know the truth of this this woman cannot move her lips without line when she says I'm not even got to think about it do you think that if I said Hillary Clinton wakes up every single morning and\nHas awakened every single morning since the morning of the ninth of November twenty sixteen and she has thought how can I get to be president of the United states now\nFrom a purely personal point of view\nI'd love to see Iran because I think she's a disaster as a candidate\nBut if she decides to run it will make it very lively Joe Biden will likely be in their Hillary Clinton will be in their Bernie might even run again and then you're going to get people like Pocahontas you're going to get Elizabeth Warren she's going to run 'em Camelot Harris the former attorney general now US Senator from California She's going to run\nBoy is going to be absolutely nuts and by the way I Want to mention one other thing too\nWe're starting to see cities and local areas that are signing up non citizens devote case in point from the San Francisco chronicle San Francisco just spent\nThree hundred and ten thousand dollars on a new registration system aimed at getting non citizens to cast votes in school board elections\nThey got forty nine new voters which means each and every one of those voters cost the city of San Francisco taxpayers more than six thousand dollars apiece the chronicle says the effort is pretty much a\nBust the first time out local officials say residents who might otherwise be considering registering are worried the Trump Administration will learn their identities so illegal aliens in the United states of America are being signed up to vote and it's costing the taxpayers plenty\nLawyers losses show [noise]\n\nElection day is Tuesday November ... you will be choosing judges for Fifteen states district

Donald Trump at this point is showing approval ratings that are in the forties where was Ronald Reagan at about ...\nRoughly the exact same ... his approval ratings um towards the end of a second term or high thirties low forties but gradually as an African economy approved and the third or fourth year of his presidency his approval rating lock it up or to propel it in ... reelected in Nineteen eighty four but the first two years in his\nPresidency his approval ratings are roughly right with Donald Trump's are\nYeah because you point out in your writing that when Reagan left office in Nineteen eighty nine there were still people in his own party who didn't like him there were lots of Democrats who didn't like him I Know that there are lots of Democrats today who weren't even alive when Ronald Reagan was president who don't like Ronald Reagan a lot of that it's based on mythology\nBut people have to remember that if anyone thinks you're going to have a president with approval ratings in the sixties or seventies\nIs not likely to happen Reagan had an average of ... approval rating as you point out\nThat when all the way up to fifty two point eight just barely above the middle and so if Donald Trump gets into the forties now and the economy continues to do well he might hit twenty twenty with some very nice approval ratings from Americans about how well he's doing the job\nI think that's definitely true especially if the American economy based on you know we have although unemployment rate\nAnd it's actually lower today that was a time during the Reagan Era I said I'm ... today um is probably not so much for those five during the Reagan Era so yeah I think\nAnd this is Sean does the sound of rain on the roof the lights you worry too severe thunderstorms with wind and lashing rain make you happy everyone's inside the house for thinking about the damage that could be happening over your head\nAnd what about hail here in South Texas feeling confident of author roof is crucial Gulf Stevens roofing and rest assured that your recon take whatever whether Mother Nature ...\nStevens ruby repairs and installs all kinds of groups meta look opposition commercial the residential to do it with the ultimate inexperienced and satisfaction\nUse the local company that high recommend want them to check the damage called two one zero Seventy five zero nine nine four one ... you have something solid and secure Stevens roofing had two one zero Seventy five zero nine nine four from simple leaks the roof replacement to the U.S most of the peace of mind\nStevens repugnant Seventy five zero nine nine four protect him out on line that Stevens roofing dot net that number again Seventy five zero nine nine for\nAbout America's diamond everyone gets our very best price every day of the year we never double or triple or best price and make you wait for a big sale or force you to argue to get the best price you always get our very best clearly marked America's diamond prize without asking\nSometimes clients ask why we don't offer a five year no answers financing it's because we would have\nTo add more than twenty percent up front to our best price to pay for the financing contract twenty percent of every payment you make for five years is a lot of money at America's diamond we offer a better financing alternative\nAmerica's diamond is a jewelry manufacturer we design and create or jewelry right here in San Antonio you can buy direct skipped the retail tricks and gimmicks\nAnd forget the whole retail argument quality for quality we guarantee that our everyday prizes lower than any jewelry stores very best sale price or will respond the difference plus twenty five percent sea America's diamond first call two one zero five six one one thousand\nHey this is Sean Lima and Ulysses ... new saw five fifty K.

I mean look at a bank control in New York City right at a price control\nAnd they they have all sorts of problems in New York because of all sorts of quality problems all sorts of shortages and that's what happens when you impose price controls\nIs it you you end up skewing the marketplace around in the marketplace is pretty good at anticipating needs and trying to fill those needs as well why can I can go to Amazon and or I can go to of arise in store and buy a thousand dollar iPhone or I can go to Walmart\nAnd buy a smartphone that will do most of the things the iPhone does perhaps was elegantly for fifty bucks and you get every choice from a thousand down to fifty\nAnd a and you say but I don't want the cheap phone well that's fine if you can afford the more expensive phone go forward but it makes the phone or a phone like it available to far more people if you allow the marketplace to answer that need so why do you think the president is pushing this\n[noise] I don't know I think part of the ... and you hit on it earlier\nWe really do have an affordability problem that's plaguing the healthcare system into people want to do something right because we have problem didn't need to be addressed a price controls it made it a false prophet Chile to it feels\nLike we're addressing the problem but we're creating a lot more problems that were actually fixing by doing that\nI think it would have let you know so many other consequences in Europe where we'd be using basically importing their price controls\nAnd what would effectively happen is we would have the shortages have we have a lot more access to medicine to hear a lot more introductions here then you see in Europe exactly because the price controls and if we import them if we bring this price controls to us and not have access to it\nIt was just a matter of cost pricing people out which is an issue but also just having the availability of medicine and it's very very important\nWell see here's the other piece I'd like you to speak to and this one's perhaps a little less tangible for people but right now as you say we have more access to newer stuff here because it's developed here but the reason is developed here is you can pay or you can charge the prices nests\nOr to recoup the the development costs which I understand now on the average pharmaceutical to get it all the way from white lab coats you know doing experiments with bickers all the way to appeal you can get from your pharmacy and take is about two billion dollars if you can't get that two billion back\nVery few people I think are going to be willing to say well let's throw a lot of money into that will come up with a wonder drug and then everybody will insist on getting it for fifty cents a bill that that doesn't work nobody wants to do that and nobody will do that\nSo when we stopped doing it who's going to develop the new drugs to treat ailments you know that that aren't treatable right now\nNo one yeah absolutely nobody will end and that it's a big part of the problem look there's all sorts of ways to address to the price controls overseas in terms of intellectual property right uh\nYou know in ... with the countries and that's something that because we know we should be pursuing to to make sure the respect our intellectual property rights and that's it\nI think a a smart way to proceed but it price controls is going to do exactly what you said we've had some great innovations in terms of cancer in terms of hepatitis C cures it can exist before and we did a lot more to do and if we if we step on price controls we're not going to get\nWell and see that's the concern I've got dark because I'm I'm pushing sixty of those born I have to take a couple of medicines but I think they'd been out of copyright or patent for a long long time so they're dirt cheap even if you have to pay for him out of your own pocket\nBut I worry that we're ... we're gonna have all these companies say I'm not going to go out and spend a lot of money to come up with a new drug if I can get the money it seems like the uh get the money back for what the cost of developing was and making it profitable and frankly for all the people curse the former companies don't curse him\nThey want a Fifteen Percent return it's a high risk activity if they took the same money in Puerto plowed into a restaurant they get eight percent return and other investments they'd get other returns but you want a slightly higher return\nBecause you're doing a more risky activity to brings lawsuits and you know terrible stories in the news you make a bad drug and you don't know it's bad ... out and you know a hundred thousand or two hundred thousand people a ... they're all kinds of risks for risk there ought to be reward so\nIs it I'm I'm just wondering why when the president's focus so much on trade and intellectual property up till now why he doesn't say we're not going to put price controls on we're just going to Canada in China and Russia and Western Europe you've got to pay\nSomething closer to the real cost of these drugs and if you rip us off we have ways to punish you through lack of access to American markets\nWouldn't something like that also have the ... in other words if the bill really takes twelve bucks a pill\nTo recoup the cost and Americans are now paying fourteen dollars a pill and Europeans are paying four dollars a pill or because because they're ripping or Canada is doing four dollars a bill why don't we don't Canada they gotta pay the same price we do and Europe has the same price but the overall price will drop from fourteen down to nine\nEurope will pay more will pay a little less the drug gets paid for\nIt doesn't it seem like a more sensible way to go at it\nBoth ... certainly way it is you restrictions we have it ain't better off in a globally things would be so\nI think there are always complicated they don't always work out you know ... we would like it or as you were describing but yeah I I I think the intimate despite on in terms of it well we're having\nTrade negotiations and we want we need our intellectual property rights respect it and that's something that you know it's important to achieve in pharmaceutical isn't\nIt's important in many other kind of interesting as well and that's something\nThat ... we want to engage more with the world and into it until we and to make sure they do all the intellectual property rights are respected in a ... year the point that you made which is also really important to emphasize is ... and you're
