In and says I'm doing very well on H. A. thank you very much\nThanks Chris rates have you with you\nSo let's get right into this whole stress issue you know stress is such a normal part of our daily routine these days but why should we all be concerned about it and more specifically what's going on in our bodies and one of the warning signs that we should be looking for\nA while you know there's two ways to look at stress on is what we call mental stress on the other the other is how stress affects your body as a doctor I'm more interested in how it affects your body sure so the way stress affects the body is this a what a person's under stress the body transpose as the stress that tension and\nYour mother end up contract and everyone feels that and they're in the upper ... right\nAnd the doctor I'm more concerned about the muscles that you don't feel that has the muscles in the arteries oh heck I Love and the mother's heart is a giant myself over and the muscles in and around your digestive\nTract ... these are the things that are resulting in in a heart disease digestive difficulties\nAnd I want to talk a little bit of your show today about nutrition because there are two nutrients that completely handle the buy in terms of stress okay now according to the research that I've been involved with it it's as simple as calcium and magnesium\nCalcium and magnesium right okay when\nFishing and calcium and magnesium a lot of things can happen\nCounting magnesium for example is needed in order to go to sleep at night and how many people you know they just don't sleep while you wake up tired your body hurt more pretty soon it starts to wear down and pretty soon you get sick and you have a condition that people are suffering for pain and I feel frozen fibromyalgia\nAnd cramps and their legs and we're illnesses so there's something wrong with this picture\nAnd it has to do it not how much calcium someone taking in their diet or how many calcium supplements or how many in Athens you chew it has to do with simple absorption is that calcium getting absorbed into your body\nWith calcium being something to do with stress isn't calcium for building bones\nWell yes okay yeah and it does does your ... but it's the one percent of the calcium actually circulates in your blood\nSo in that one percent starts to drop it could affect your heart your brain your kidneys your organs and your body shutdown actually died\nWow this is all one percent of the calcium always has to be in your system and there's two sources of calcium one isn't the diet you know and to us from the bones than south\n... absorb it back from the bones if ... that's right and I say\nAnd what you just discussed right now leads to one of the major causes of a condition that the fact and twenty five million Americans right now which is called osteoporosis right which is a weakening of adult\nNow and it's due to the body deriving the calcium from the bones instead of from the ... tradition\nYep okay and so we have to do is we have to find a way to put calcium back in the diet now you think that would be really easy\nSure just drink milk just drink milk or you know a lot of green leafy vegetables and that sort of thing but first of all people don't do that right\nAnd second of all the the quality of the calcium that comes from our diet has been decreasing in the last fifty years really yeah because things like pastures Asian food they're irradiated um the calcium as leads from the soil\nPeople are taking medications that block it so\nThe actual calcium is that being absorbed in the body okay and then you see people taking toms and calcium supplements you know they buy a house with started driving right but these things don't absorbing the body\nOut there for a couple of reasons one uh when you take a let's say an antacid that had the ... minute like Tom's\nFirst of all calcium does that absorbed in the body unless it's an anesthetic environment but see what happens when you take a Tom is an antacid oh okay so even if you're getting calcium in the in the antacid itself it's not been absorbed\nI see because it has to be in a in an as an environment for it to be absorbed\nExactly okay now we have a product called the ... formula\nMy comment formula it's natural and the differences is that the powdered and what happened to be put in hot water and you mix it up and you drink it down so it's in a liquid instead of a pill\nAnd it absorbed into your system\nWow so that's a problem that well\nYeah because when calcium and magnesium earn a liquid state it absorbs ten times better than in any other state\nWell that's great matter of fact is I'm I'm reading the can right now says a fenced absorbing calcium and magnesium beverage powder\nWell it comes down to absorption one of the way to tell if you're not observing calcium take a look at what drugs are taking are you on high blood pressure medication you need something for your kidneys or you want pain medications you need sleeping pills that the calcium and especially the easiest being absorbed ... you're not going\nTo suffer from all the things my combat formula does absorb incredibly in the body the thing is is that when you take my comment formula but not like well well I feel better I have thousands of people right at the ... I Can't believe it thirty minutes after I took the ... the pain in my wrist went away or I was able to leave for the first time in Iraq I mean this is really amazing\nI Want to take a moment here to

our bodies to fight the effects of stress in your ... formula can help us in this battle against stress I'd like to talk for a minute about how the magnesium\nFactors in I mean uh I'm starting to understand about the calcium but what does magnesium\nOr we're talking about stress and we're talking about stress affects the body and first of all in order to function at all your body needs magnesium it's probably of all the vitamins I could list magnesium is probably the most important vitamin on the planet right now\nI've not heard a whole lot about magnesium ... why is magnesium too important\nThere is over three hundred and twenty five bio chemical reactions that magnesium is involved with it it's almost like a hormone wow and for example if it was low levels of magnesium your heart won't beat who very important factor in life\nYou would say so\nIn fact let me just read a list of some of the conditions are associated with magnesium deficiencies okay um you have attention deficit disorder Alzheimer's or anxiety asthma autism chronic fatigue syndrome congestive heart disease caused the patient diabetes\nFibromyalgia high blood pressure insomnia migraine headaches multiple sclerosis muscle cramps Parkinson's osteoporosis and the list goes on and on and on and\nAnd this is this is associated with a a lack of magnesium and the money\nSimply a lack of magnesium bully too\nSo it's nothing to really mess around with now what happens is that you need that many of them in your body in order for the calcium to be absorbed\nOh so it's it's a necessary thing in order to get the first component which is calcium\nThat's right they work in combination with each other now there's many more practical applications of this ... formula mhm first of all like I said

... system may maybe again day came\n... killed\nI mean you know we don't mean to my friends and neighbors really keen like\nLines that yeah no I haven't\nEither so what is what is your best to shine line you know what the euro was ever sales were had to lie so what what is your it costs a Dallas\nIt costs to survive as well there you go your course you know you were talking about Boy Scouts and that sort of thing and of course you know I actually wasn't my high school friend shot after all up and\nYou know he's an Eagle Scout his dad was I think vice president of all ... or something somebody said he's been a professional scholars you know six am about to retire from it\nBut you know and the boy scouts they're always try to treat teach you how to sell and and obviously you figure it out one thing that always sell is\nThe valley the price incense duck the dollar that's a good price\nThat is a good let me tell you I Want to get by boots on but when he told me that how do you not do it\nFor a dollar five dollar bill yeah it all worked out yeah I think the biggest temper your overhead four dollars\nA you know it's kind of kept that like I tell you what\nThe heck\nIs probably the most total years so we're going to get to the shining ... you know you're not going to do the radio and get all but there was more about some of it will pay for it you know which are going to have you better what we'll do this what we're doing that a cast your video you guys doing it so that will take some of this all your ... over so that people can see the good job Jodie\nAnd then when you're going to if you don't have a Facebook page or anything that show use you know\nNo I you know may not be a bad idea and I don't know if your parents kind of embrace that I'm Out here on it wasn't around when I was young but if you did some kind of a social media thing where people knew you were going to be there when it came back\nWith candles singing pay how he does okay\nI Can't promise to take care of their\nYeah there you go\nYeah so so what we'll do is we'll we'll get Charles or your Instagram or whatever yeah we'll get that and we'll put it on our website and everything and then all their if you'll let people know when you're going to be out there 'cause I from here it's only about forty minutes yeah I'm a drive over to looking back I can give me a cold beer\nThe wrestling I don't know if you use of insurance you\nCorrect correct and so you know when you looked at it you don't want to go with the crowd in fact I tell people investing this kind of like a high school party you want to get there early you want to get your beer before everybody else and when the when the geeky kids start showing up you want to leave because Iraq by [laughter]\nOh that's a have a non [noise] say why [laughter] [laughter]\nWell I'll tell you what if he actually stayed around they should have left what any of his friends showed up\nMoney for them yeah yeah so I think that's fine right now actually I was reading\nHow we're such through so let me ask you a let me ask you this question do you\nWork for the White Houses for a while what what was the thing that compels you to go out on your own [noise]\nI actually I I I wanted to show you mentioned Lynch I'm only had one job on Wall\nStreet when I got out of graduate school I got out of Roger with a school in Nineteen Ninety eight I was already are in one years old at the time of course I was in the music industry and Israel on that show the Israeli Army so I didn't get out of graduate school so I was thirty one years old and he's not mentioning\nThat are sort of higher out of them actually scores jars\nFrom on high and that was the number one rocking on them out of that and then you have to constantly you know in a while and I\nDo remember that well actually you know what I had left barrel by day\nOh well ... years old and journalism has on a hunger into\nLaGuardia out environmental and the gymnast when I left and I've been on my own for the last eight seniors\nUm yeah so I only went from one one and it wasn't a maybe from bad to there will be mocking them a ... an ounce out their training operations ... Jersey that was my sympathy business I was in a small area in a way that will show [laughter]\n... and I wouldn't give it to ... conditions and they wouldn't ... so that's just so there I'm sure that our clients\nSo let me ask you this at all because one of the things that I've talked about the school allows for the last number of weeks\nIs is about the the relatively than a a slow that there is it a lot of these crypto currency and you know there's a number of people out there that are just they trade the snot out of it\nAnd they are they trained the snot out of it was somebody else it today take Jay trade to start out of it and then there's actually some pretty large flows tried to get their way up\nAnd in fact we we do of up some some big blocks that are trying to trade privately so that they can actually get the size that they needed and the other haggling over what kind of discount together so on and so forth [noise] what do you believe and I certainly kind of believe that one of the things that will really help crypto\nIs is a little bit for standardization in regards to to the trading platforms of where you can actually access the security for access the coins\nSo this is from ah I don't know how the ...\nI don't know how that would be almost a regular basis I mean there were two thousand names right now on the market account and many of them only ... few hundred thousand dollars a day ... million dollars a day which means you're going to go in right now or ... thousand dollars cello hundred thousand dollars or would I mean\nWithout a limited rocket or not I sounds when it was signed by then the next and that creates a kind of an issue elation and it has it's actually quite common in the short term is I'm just saw less than a well when you buy\nTwo or three times what we all have these on the dollar I'm In a line has five channels that seemed Alison\n... final or is it only takes a few bad apples sort of cause chaos I'm already in use names and you really have to know\nHow to recognize Miami was manipulative and when he was one of those letters long count that as an adolescent tell you sell all the time or someone's attempt to manipulate\n[noise] so so they're here at five said that that they are running the country and there's a link to you know that when I log red candle is a bias not sell yeah by any stretch of education especially if you're committed to the space of the long term and unfortunately you know that you know they talk about the hurdles\nWell you know I'm part of the problem I think is is that there are a lot of people that have tried to come in with technical analysis and do day trading\nIn a fairly traded market and are really count it probably just chewing themselves up weren't they take a little bit longer view and and look at things kind of what some of the analysis that are there Ronnie gives you\nA and look at it over a span of several years you're gonna do it yourself a lot a lot better yeah I'm In a way the way that you slice it so I'm just wondering why is all you that are out there that are involved in the crypto space\nYou know you might want to link that out your time is it a little bit and relax because the block changes for real or ... for real and and basically the coins that you're at the all the less it's a what'd\nYou call the wife is one of the coins will they will be All right\nWell the Ninety five percent of the names on more than he has turned out he was January I Know that is really I mean Ninety five hours of names names are scams ...\nThere's no way ... extra wild west okay\nAnd I'm you know I'm a I I tell you all\nDon't try to be a hero or they just focus on the names that are twenty five ... let's see which is the way all the money in the non stop Twenty years and years to call during the ... will go by Johnny ... and I'm\nSteve are not calm my sister in law Amazon Microsoft and joined them and all over the top twenty and hold on to them don't go in jail they are trying to make a million dollars and I was in your mind\nWell I'll tell you what ladies and gentlemen I couldn't solve it up better that kind of that's kind of a sudden but at the bumper sticker although it might be a little bit longer the good bumper sticker for this\nWell our segment Ronnie I Want to thank you so much for your time look for to get to meet you personally that
