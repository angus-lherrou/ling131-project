Austin Camacho said that um\nUm a lot of bonds won't even be bored they'll be stillborn or you know have problems and then kind of what happened this year was\nUm for the most part we had quite a few fond man born but condition and worse\nSo bad when they came into this world that are in and didn't get better during the early part of their life you know they they didn't make it to the first\nCouple of weeks or months of their life and so there's there's two ways of of ah not getting on you know to that to that adult stage and and that's that's kind of what happened this year\nGot you you know you're part of the state uh I've enjoyed hunting up there for years and years and years and ah there's places up there that just an phenomenal a coil hunting when we've got quite a while but uh again drought kind of caught our ground nesting birds particularly our our ...\nMan you know the the I guess the peak of of Bob White um patches and and asking activity is engineered you know early part of June and we are right in the middle of the heat and drought and so\nUh and had a lot of hot day and a lot of grad days after that so kind of like the ... on the chicks that were hatched um just just didn't like it very long\nWell a couple of years a couple of years ago though didn't we have a few years we're showing her ... how does a bad year correlate to uh one of her curio rehab from those are better ranchers\nOil you know a coil short lived bird and so all life expectancy is less than two years on average and so I'm really dependent on last year's crop of birds to to carry over and so\nLast year was was not a great hatch either and so we started off with with the euro adults to to produce those checks and then we had a really bad hatch and so this fall as is looking pretty dismal for for coil hunting\nYou know sitting down here in Houston when I watch a weather radar and every now and then I'll see the radar light up your part of the state and I get excited going come on right on it was for me to wear a\nOr doing a rain dance here\nDown here and this is in the last thirty days since um we did the report for the magazine have you all gotten any weather is or any signs that maybe we're starting to see 'em a maybe a wetter trim coming\nWell we did not long after we talked to a lady just days it it started raining and uh actually to to look at most of our country now you never know that we were in a severe drought you know back to three months ago\nUm we get some ten plus finches a while in some places and so for the most part the current habitat conditions\nUm they don't really tell the tale because things look really good um but but it's what happened you know during those critical times are back earlier in the spring and summer that it's going to be affecting what hunters experience in the woods spirit hunter hunting season\nNo use to me well and that's the next question I Want to ask hum given the conditions are given the moisture are we seeing ... come up or is that pendulum still ah over on the hunter side um we're going to be moving all more this year\nWell I think it's a mixed bag um yes we are getting lots of of all forms and uh and that's good um that you know in an acre and crops are are\nAre spotty or to the point where you know some areas of the district or the biologist says it's a bumper crop of ... and others it's it's a bust you know so\nUm that's going to be kind of spotty so I think in general though hundreds you're gonna have to\nThey're going to have to hunt pretty hard for that trophy here um I think most of the trophies are going to come out of the the older age class here rather than a you know younger dear I'm In in really good years you see good condition and and and those younger deer can really excel\nBut I think it's going to be a bad and that may be an average to to maybe below average year for the young in middle age class there so so there's trophies out there you're just going to have to look for an older dear I Believe\nGot you one final question we got about thirty seconds before we take a break um twenty eleven were pretty well put that in our review mirror we're talking about age or older age going on so we still are seeing some on six or seven and a half year old dear that hum hum maybe we're not impacted by twenty eleven\nI I think we're I think would get that in our rear view mirror I'm sure they've um you know this this year may be one that that we need to look at you know three four five years from now and say you know it was that that was the cause I'm just like twenty eleven\nVery good Hi Kevin listen we appreciate the update our first year as Kevin mode north Texas district leader out of brown would Kevin we do appreciate you joining us here on

district leaders and I was looking back at the October issue of Texas outdoors journal um when we visited and um something that I had missed and I guess that was the age differential\nBetween white tailed deer immunity right you know incorrectly\nAssumed that they had a basically a similar lifespan but we're I'm going with this is you were a winning back to twenty eleven when we had the severe drought and then hails ... still is impacting mule deer simply because they mature at an older age correct\nCorrect yeah Neal they're uh they mature a little slower than white tell a pre produced a little slower or as well which is an important a\nCharacteristic when you're managing a population but you know typically a of our biggest meal there mature meal they are going to be at least six but probably seven years old to to reach the has the potential [noise]\nSo that's that's why they twenty eleven and twenty twelve years a really a\nCome into play you know we didn't have many fall on hard during that rally in in both twenty eleven anti Trump so that correlates now in twenty eight teams that they're born in those years that would be six and seven years old so uh what happened a six\nAnd seven years ago is going to impact the hunting season this year\nYou're with 'em coming out of the last hunting season a looked like a good portion of the state yeah your areas will ... side what kind of recruitment did we have on you know the meal deer and then of course you got a few white deal in the eastern portion of your district and I was born recruitment this year\nA recruitment Scott
