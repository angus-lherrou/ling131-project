{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KTSA", "content": "So what's different about these cards here doc\nSaid the new Medicare card that people will be receiving in their mail by the end of October I'm no longer have their social Social Security number on at a table with Medicare will be receiving a brand new number\nOr in an effort to help uh avoid fraud and protect their identity\nIs that was it was that a big issue is that's why they're they're switching out of this because the fact is I wouldn't want my just my Social Security card I don't know if I Want my ah my Social Security number on anything\nYeah that that's true it it it is an issue yeah we've seen an increasing a number of issues with identity theft\nAnd where people take your Social Security number and use it to open a bank accounts or or credit cards and your name and say we really want to avoid that for people with Medicare or at a at one way that we can do that is to get the Social Security number\nFirst off of their Medicare card 'em and give them a a brand new number that doesn't identify with their Social Security number at all\nWhich is a very good a thing and I know but a lot of people are are asking and this is something that goes I was talking to somebody about this the other day\nBecause anytime something changes right you know even though it it's changed you for a reason to protect her identity and things of that nature the big question is is is just going to change my benefits how is this going to affect me 'cause people you know when you don't have the information you allow things run wild in your head\nYeah it can be confusing the people with Medicare should understand that their coverage isn't changing their benefits aren't changing 'em all it's changing is the number on the card on the card also has a little bit a different look to it so they shouldn't be surprised by that\nBut once I get it they can take it and use it just like they get their medical card before with their doctors and their providers\nWhich is a very good thing talking to Dr Lisa McAdams she's the acting regional administrator for the southwest regional office of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services or so people are gonna be receiving this how many are going out because and and do a lot of people even know about this because I think that's part of the problem is\nWhen I started talking about this ah people didn't quite understand why they were doing this and again there's that fear factor of trying to figure out why and some people have been thought oh this is going to be a fraud so I'm not going to take this Medicare card\nYeah well in the state of New Mexico we have four hundred thousand people with Medicare will be receiving a new card\nAcross the country they're sixteen Neil Young people with Medicare and so we've been sending these out and wave 'em and for a New Mexico do way there's now a so they should be receiving their card by the end of October\nDo they need to do anything in particular so does anybody to call anything or is this just going to be done on their own and then they get ... what do they do with their old cards\nThere is not anything that they need to do um they don't need to pay anyone uh we won't be calling down intact Medicare will never call\nA unsolicited people with Medicare I'm so that they do get one of those calls they should call one eight hundred Medicare number I'm and report that immediately because that fraud\nUm and then once they get their new card they should destroy the old one that old one that has a Social Security number on it um and when I say destroy I may cut it up\nInto little pieces shred it burn it something that makes it impossible for somebody to see that Medicare number that old Social Security number on there any longer\nYou know again that's it's in this day and age with the whole Social Security thing and having your number out there like that fraud how how ... was the fraud\n[noise] um well it's it it is a growing problem um with a Social Security numbers bang out there um fraudsters are out there they do tend to pry on our senior citizens\nUm and so we want to do everything that we can to help prevent that and protect the identity of our people with Medicare\nAbsolutely so let's just say for the sake of argument you are listening to this right now are they are there podcast listening to live and they want to figure out exactly how they go about checking to see when their cars going to get there what what's happening what do they do\nIf they want additional information there's a couple of great resources that they can access one of those as one eight hundred Medicare so they just call that number and we have counselors who are available to answer any questions or provide other assistance that they may need\nAnd we also had a ... website Medicare dog God that they can go to and all the information that they need to know about the new Medicare cards is available they're\nFantastic Dr Lisa McAdams acting regional administrator for the south west regional office for\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services we appreciate you coming on today and telling us about this I think a lot of people again as we get into that you your time they're going to be getting their cars and the more information they have the better it's going to be for them

back horns and then you'll go to some ... trees and they're just you know loaded so uh you know\nI think makes me laugh sometimes it hunter's kind of get disappointed when a corn crops good because you know their corn Peters not as good their dependable so [noise]\nUh the we've had some really time the rains here lately so for production a nice little green up there's going to be good as we're here in the early parts of the archery season and ... these days so low I I think were set up pretty good mood and an old habitat conditions what he'll do\nWell and that and to John I think it's time for you to get up on your legs like a man and get out there and get amongst them uh and you know do a little do a little still hunting uh with that mass crop though are now what's the status of one of my favorite game animals squirrels\n[laughter] squirrels and the big game animals might have missed [laughter] why aren't there aren't many smaller rival make some bigger you know [laughter] there you go yeah\nSo are there are no squirrel certainly a underutilized you don't want any of our or especially in public\nAreas here in in the district you know we get more squirrel hunting pressure from non residents but to\nTo they you know this morning when I got up you know is in the fifties and and the guy should really consider going out and sitting in the woods dual middle school and so they're apple opportunity we had you know good mass production the last couple of years so that equates to or city quite to more squirrels so the opportunity should be plentiful\nA you know I Know you are as a a long time waterfowl hunter and we when we put the report together for the October issue of Texas outdoors journal\n... areas were down a book that was voting well for what a production of of CD type I'm a grant says or or da da da da da da da kitchen in the water to a plug some back areas\nThat you know some local lake or do most of my copy fish and stuff is still a couple of feet low not necessarily a great waterfowl like\nBut uh as I go up all night I went to court or again you know the the those lakes have filled up or have put some water and those Warsaw plants the last part of the early tail season\nOr the guy's a visit with were reporting a very nice numbers the ducks and an excellent habitat condition\nMany of the stock tanks which are certainly sleepers in the dark world across Texas 'cause most people don't pay that much attention to that or you know surveys and everything in the case you know significant water values across the state owned stock on them so they shouldn't be and and much better condition than they have been a so [noise]\nYou know we get some you know miserable weather for our friends up north we ought to have you know a nice\nOf you know John looking in the program has been going on for a guy I guess decades or in your area or the or the turkey restocking what are we looking at it as far as our Turkey's now\nWell it's getting a little better\nUh may know it was we weren't you know having real obvious success or they two years ago [noise] burglary move this year both summary of brands and some eastern or\nYou know we don't expect much from those first your stocking but we've documented production and same birds in getting more trickery courts so I Am cautiously optimistic that I'm not going to say where you know turn the corner but ah we're gaining momentum and uh\nAs far as just general hunting success for the spring season you know it was it was slightly better than the last couple of years average but a little bit lower than the long term average you know the guys\nYou know still only shooting you know a few hundred eastern Turkey's a year or in this part of the state but ah as far as our restoration efforts are like I said I'm very cautiously optimistic and we had some really good success last year with birds so\nOn some of the wildlife management go off to join or working in managing specifically for ground nesting birds for turkey um what I have learned is that benefits all while alive but it takes a pretty good chunk of ground they really need to talk to each other a minimum acreage is what ten thousand\nYeah well we do a an eastern talking eastern turkey stocking restoration effort yeah we we want to put together ten thousand acres so that takes in this part of the world you know some good neighbors or some cooperation overall you know a larger landscape but uh [noise]\nWe continue to get interest from a land owners are hotter than and\nWe've got a couple of ... a locations under evaluation right now and then really the only thing that's holding us back at this point is is getting a more Eastern Birds from you know are cooperating neighbors steaks you know people that have nuisance birds are made and there's a threat or what the baby trade or something but uh\nSo the interest is is high you know especially in that the Snake River record or and that's most recently we're having our best success with a\nDocumented a production and birds moving around and of course\nDoing all that fun stuff to the mall just like to do putting transmitter from satellite GPS instances where you know we can kind of think we can kind of keep track of them and and\nNo I make fun of sometimes they were not as smart as a turkey because we we evaluate habitat and do all this stuff from some times of Turkey's want to go someplace else so [noise] so we're learning as we go all and and like I said our successors improving and so we're looking forward to invite her future with turkeys in east Texas so\nOutstanding land so\nGiven that any big left\nA couple okay All right very good job and we appreciate the update our first yesterday John ... the ... district leader out of Tyler
