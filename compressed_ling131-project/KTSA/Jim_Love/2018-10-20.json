oaks and you know that have very few corners and then you'll go to some ... trees and they're just you know loaded so uh you know\nBut I think makes me laugh sometimes it hunter's kind of get disappointed when a corn crops good because you know their corn feeders not as good or dependable so [noise]\nUh these we've had some really time the rains here lately so for production a nice little green up there's going to be good as we're here in the early parts of the archery season and em out these days and so uh I I think were set up pretty good mood and an old habitat conditions what to do\nWell and I am to John I think it's time for you to get up on your legs like a man to get out there and get amongst them uh and you know do a little little still hunting uh with that mass crop though are now what's the status of one of my favorite game animals squirrels\n[laughter] squirrels and the big game animals might have missed that [laughter] well yeah I'm there aren't many smaller rival makes them bigger you know [laughter] there you go yeah\nSo are there are no squirrel certainly a underutilized you know many of our or especially in public\nAreas here in in the district you know we get more squirrel hunting pressure from non residents but to\nTo they you know this morning when I got up you know is in the fifties and and the guy should really consider going out and sitting in the woods do a little school hunt and so the apple opportunity we had you know good mass production the last couple of years so that equates to or city quite to more squirrels so the opportunity should be Clinton for\nA you know I Know you are as a a long time waterfowl hunter and uh we when we put the report together for the October issue of Texas outdoors journal\n... areas were down um but um that was boating well for what a production of of CD type hum a grant says or or not go duck duck weed and stuff like that do our thing shaggy shaping up now we're catching me one or two a flood back areas\nThat you know some of my local lake or I Do most of my copy fish and stuff is still a couple of feet low not necessarily a great waterfowl like but uh as you go up or ... or again you know the the\nThose lakes have filled up or have put some water in those Warsaw plants the last part of the early ... season or the guy's a visit with were reporting a very nice numbers the ducks and an excellent habitat condition many of the stock tanks which are\nCertainly sleepers in the dark world across Texas 'cause most people don't pay that much attention to that or you know surveys and everything in case you know significant water values across the state owned stock on them so they shouldn't be and and much better condition than they have been a so [noise]\nYou know we get some you know miserable weather for our friends up north we ought to have you know a nice\nOf you know John looking in the program has been going on for a guy I guess decades or in your area or the or the turkey restocking what are we looking at it as far as our turkey is now\nWell it's getting a little better now is we weren't you know having real obvious success a\nDay two years ago [noise] burglary move this year both some real brands and some eastern ... uh\nYou know you don't expect much from those first your stocking but we got documented production and same birds and getting more trickery courts so I Am cautiously optimistic that I'm not going to stay where you know turn the corner but ah we're gaining momentum and uh\nAs far as just general hunting success for the spring season you know it was it was slightly better than the last couple of years average little bit lower than the long term average you know the guys\nYou know still only shooting you know a few hundred eastern Turkey's a year or in this part of the state but ah as far as our restoration efforts are like I said I'm very cautiously optimistic and we had\nSome really good success last year with birds so\nOn some of the wildlife management go opposite Joan or working in managing specifically for ground nesting birds for turkey um what I have learned is that benefits all while alive but it takes a pretty good chunk of ground neighbors really need to talk to each other a minimum acreage is what ten thousand\nYeah well we do a an eastern talking eastern turkey stocking restoration effort yeah we we want them to put together ten thousand acres so that takes in this part of the world you know some good neighbors or some cooperation over you know a larger landscape but ah [noise]\nWe continue to get interest from a land owners are hotter than and we've got a couple more of a\nLocations under evaluation right now on and and really the only thing that's holding us back at this point is is getting a more Eastern Birds from you know are cooperating neighbor states you know people that have nuisance birds or maybe there's a threat or what the baby trade or something but uh\nSo the interest is is high you know especially in that the Snake River court or and that's most recently we're having our best success with a documented a production and birds moving around and of course\nDoing all that fun stuff to the mall just like to do putting transmitter from satellite GPS systems where you know we can kind of I think we can kind of keep track of them and and you know I make five or sometimes they were not as smart as a turkey 'cause we we evaluate habitat\nAnd all this stuff from some times of Turkey's want to go someplace else so [noise] so we're learning as we go all and and like I said our successors improving and so we're looking forward to her by her future with turkeys in east Texas so\nOutstanding land so given that any big left a couple of okay a couple
