[noise]\nGood morning he'd have how can we help you this morning good morning thank\nYou for taking my call I'm sure this is probably a nod requests but I'm at my wits in\nA I have an older that has started in the house I guess it started in August and it smells\nLike a ... ... ... when the ... air comes on around five or six o'clock in the evening that's when I start to smell it and and it smells\nLike a cat stock well\nIt's not my cat stocks my cat's boxes in the laundry room you can go in the laundry room and there's no snow at all but it's in the family room and I had a company out Thursday he went up in the attic he checked out the air conditioner\nAnd everything up there it looked OK he went around to see if there was a dead animal non he came down\nAnd I understand that the plumbing a lying dumps out of a under my master bathroom he checked all the ad out could find nothing last evening I'm sitting in the chair and the family room in there I\nSmell it again now I had to you any suggestions of where I could start from near\nYes ma'am in cats the odor of a cat litter box that's pneumonia based order a oh I'm Sorry\nAnd that ammonia based older becomes inundated into your air conditioning ducts system um it's not necessarily a problem with the equipment it's not a problem with anything other than\nBecause you have a fiber is a duck system than that older can become inundated into that fibrous duck system the best to judge them I can do for us to call your AC company if the if if you trust them have a good reputation with him or good report with them\nAnd tell them you want to check on getting your ducks sanitized and why would may have mentioned that when they were either that I don't know that's clear to me about the company the duck sanitizing a is a a a process that has done where they come in now of course you'll have to leave the house for a few hours but they set up a fog machine\nRight in front of the return air chamber of your unit they turn your fan on and they pull this fall into the ducks system and it sanitize the inside of the return the unit and the ducks system that will typically remove most ammonia or chemical based owners okay I have one other question what type of Florence you have in the family room\nA there's carpet in the family room\n[laughter] have the kitty cats ever\nI'm not use the litter box for an evening for for like ...\nI only have one kitty and she she's very she has never missed on the floor ever ever ever and like I say that cat box is in the laundry room which is right off the garage a and you can walk\nI can sit in that chair in the family room the smell it and go out in the laundry room there will be absolutely no smell\nThe marriage the return air intake for your air conditioner in relation to the the ... the litter box\n[noise] ah well we have in the hallway off of the family room between a bathroom and it gets drunk there is this big filter up there well five twenty five or something like that is that that I think that's when you're talking\nAbout yes that is a return to air intake and there may be another return and take somewhere else in the house well he had\nLike a win that filters are changed like the the filter is changed in the two bedrooms and the a study that all that all gets changed with\nYou so you have multiple return ears on the system yeah the best thing that I can suggest to use to get that system ... get that system a sanitized and ask one other question\nYes sir used the older constant or use it or you remember him\nKnow that that's the thing right now I don't smell it at all\nThat now I'm sure whenever it now the big box stores typically when you buy a product any product they have they'll have a some tips on installation a lot of those tips are product based and manufacturer based so you definitely want to look at those installation tips to give you an idea as to how to put the flooring down\nAnd it sounded like you and your husband work and he considered doing it yourself\n\n... ... at ... a lot of times even the big box stores have classes um well you can go in and take a class on how to ... ... how to lay um the vinyl plant flooring they'll actually have little seminars\nAnd they'll also have some ideas on what products to use to make sure that the order doesn't permit\nIt well it sounds like\nAnd it's gorgeous [noise] hearing that kind\nOf concrete see or you can purchase that it's a big box store it and that's exactly what it's called is concrete sealer um\nHey they think yeah you bet All right\nThank you you know that it's a great call leading up to the next hour and ... things if you're thinking about doing home improvements if you're thinking about you know painting the inside what if you have um a handling or what if you have wallpaper\n[noise] right right and as far as flooring yeah Oh absolutely flooring is definitely a big key but as far as painting we had a person called in off the air and ask about painting over wallpaper now there's a few steps that you have to keep in mind on painting over wallpaper\nA first thing is is that if the wallpaper starting to peel up at the edges which it does a lot on your seems in the wallpaper it'll peel back where you can see the same\nYou want to take a good sharp razor knife and sliced those seems off to get back down to where the wallpaper is good in in in attached to the wall very tightly still anywhere that the wallpapers loose blistered bubbled anything you want to peel those areas off\nYou want to get all of that wall paper that's loose off the walls then you want to take just some drywall mud and you also want to make sure that that is not going to become loose elsewhere lime right\nAbsolutely if if the if the wallpaper is if it keeps popping loose and you keep having to go down than just remove it all you have to there are wallpaper removals of chemicals that you can put on there to remove wallpaper but it that's not something that you're wanting to do than anywhere any patches that you've had to cut out because it was loose\nYou come back with some drywall mode and you float those areas back with a smooth with the the the edges of the wall paper where you don't have any ridges there where you've got to smooth smooth transitions then you'd definitely folks want to put a texture on that you don't just want to put paint over the wall paper\nBecause you just paint over the wall paper is going to show any imperfections and the wallpaper exactly you've got a strong possibility of the pattern of the old wallpaper bleeding through and being able to be seen through the paint you definitely want a texture that wall\nAnd sometimes they have are all the time they have textures that are easy to apply even in a spray cans some\nAbsolutely absolutely and then ... string it is going to give you a good idea because most of the time when wallpaper comes off it's because it got wet\n... is going to get taxed ring at the texture goes on moist it's not soaking wet it's not so but it goes on moist that's going to give you a good idea once it's textured let it sit for twenty four hours to and then go back and check and see if the moisture from that texture ing has caused any more of the wallpaper to pop loose\nUm then put a light coat of paint on it and again one coat just put one coat on and wait you don't want to get all your paint on the wall it nice and beautiful and completed and then find out that the the the moisture in the paint the actual water content of the pain is going to cause that wallpaper to peel off\nSo you want to put one code on again wait twenty four hours if you're not getting any of the wallpaper lifting off the wall after that go ahead and finish out your wall but as many coaches you need on there and take care of it but just do it in those steps\nThat way you don't have to worry about well if you do the entire wall you do the entire finish and lord forbid if it's a multi colored wall you put more than one color on the wall and then you get areas that are starting to peel off because the the ... the fate or yeah awesome to ... to pull off\nAnd that'll help out with painting on the wall paper now of course if you're painting over would paneling now paddling is one that is very difficult to paint over\nSimply because most paneling is going to have an oil absorption or it's going to be some type of oil or a stain\nThat has been put onto the handling that is going to bleed through no matter what kind of pain you put on the wall would if you were to put ... where I can just say the first thing you want to do when you're when you're dealing with ... painting over paddling is that you want to make sure that you prime it you put a good primary with a sealer in the primary\nAnd don't they have a painting oh that has the kills actual brand in the paint I\nDon't want to you at paints that are paying primer their pain and primer and what they do have those but when you're dealing with the the the paneling or any hardwood paddling whether it's the real thin stuff that wasn't a lot of homes or whether it's real hard would thick handling you have to remember that the stains and the treatments\nIn the cleaning that they did for that for those over a lot of years contained a lot of oil so you want to put a good coach of prime off on the wall first\nAbout opening another for and that's the most that they would have opened does since the history of this dam which holds back lake Travis which feeds or goes through the water that goes through

I'm going to start us off with a summary and then I'll I'll click on your hair a little ... and we'll be talking All right so Mike has a\nTwo thousand and eight Chevy Silverado and he was asking about his knock sensors he's already replaced him but he's got a check engine light back on for the knock centers is that correct Mike\n... was placed want\nNow why did you turn the radio down or the rails off good okay\nOkay yeah I don't hear the echo now okay good okay All right so Mike you only replaced one and did you do the wiring harness that goes along with it\nA big deal you sir\nYou did and did you do the pink tail with both pig tails or just the one pick two\n...\nOkay All right so uh this is a common issue and we have learned through experience so this is not anybody that did something terribly wrong but as you and your mechanic or as are mechanic gets more experience they will suggest ah this repair as a complete unit did not put you back on hold so stay there just\nThere's something really going on with your phone I think uh All right so\nAnytime Syria any automotive in any of my friends in the business any of my shop friends in the business do a a knock censor on a Chevrolet engine we always do both and there's good reason for that because you're in there anyways you've spent all this labor time\nIs we can tell you right now if this car needs a five hundred dollars worth of maintenance or three thousand dollars in repairs\nAnd that's kind of what we can tell you and then you can make your decision based on that we don't have a crystal ball but we're there to look for repairs and if we can find three thousand dollars and repairs already I can tell you usually that's not the car you want to buy but if we look at it\nThere's not a spot in there's not a spot underneath that is not leaking it doesn't look like the owner just cleaned it and detailed it and\nAnd you know ... so that it doesn't you know they cleaned up all the leagues if we can see things like that\nA a a you know if it if it doesn't look like they're trying to cover anything up and we look under there and it looks gorgeous and everything looks like it's in good shape then then that's probably going to be a pretty solid vehicle especially in dealing with a Toyota so good for you all for going for a Toyota I Love those vehicles\nAs are now you have a a flat rate for that service\nOr that service can run I usually use the price for San Antonio right that service depending on what shops are going to look at it can run anywhere between fifty and a hundred and twenty dollars\nThat would be you guys yep\nYep so somewhere around there I don't like to shoot out the exact because then I mean there are too high or too low and then you know I don't want to I don't want to do that to my my colleagues in the business and\n[noise] yeah well that's a reasonable All right and the the other part of the question\nIf you see many older model rat poison the air for common problems\nJust normal repairs\nBreaks and and you know every once in a while one of them needs an alternate or a ... but I can tell you that Toyota's of all the vehicles don't have the pattern failures that some other vehicles do have that that okay or lack of a better term keep us in business you know you see the same thing a lot and certain vehicles are Toyota's don't don't usually have that type of failure\nSure no one would you passed with a hybrid [laughter] I Would\nOnly because my mom bought afford a fusion hybrid and I loved that vehicle totally depends on your driving habits but yes I I Would I Would I Am very interested in finding a hybrid in a vehicle that I Want to drive\nOkay and then the the ... program that I got my daughter's car I ... is if it's over thirty K ... that program diminish or\nIs it actually yes uh and I can't remember right now at the top of my head if it was thirty or thirty six thousand but let's just call it thirty right now\nOr if you do that for instance on the engine is the easiest one to talk about if you do the engine oil changes using be GMO way a starting at thirty thousand then you will have a up to thirty thousand or below than you will have up to four thousand dollars coverage on your engine so if the engine fails that goes out you can provide the receipts\nShowing beauty products then they will give four thousand dollars to the repairing shop to help repair your vehicle\nIf you hit it after that mark and it's thirty or thirty six then um you will have two thousand dollars coverage which is still awesome\nSure oh yeah [noise] okay and and that's up to any mileage\nUp to ... well on the beach on the motor all additive on the extended Motorola additive\nHim away then you're looking up to a hundred thousand actually is the kind of ... and the different systems have different cut off so when you're ready to do it a service a transmission or break or a\nEngine or whatever then talk to the shop that you're dealing with an in our case it would be me but uh talk to the shop that you're going to deal with and ask him what kind of coverage you have right now you know when you start\nOkay All right where do you guys

she brought on by fifty TSA ... on\n\nRight we've got to be focused on the line we also have an open mind to thin five nine nine\nHe's five fifty five I'm going to post a a little post on Facebook about cabinet air filters\nSo when you go to an all change place or you go to an automotive repair shop at some point that you will get suggested\nTo replace your cabin air filter and a lot of the times it's nice for them to bring it out and show you how dirty it is and what a clean one looks like and then you can say without a doubt yes I'd like to replace that some folks just take you take your word for it and and they take my word for it and it's like you need to replace this and\nIt sure go ahead just do it so uh we had a picture I have a picture that we took this week of a cabin air filter\nThat I think is probably the dirtiest one we've ever seen if not then I'll continue to find the dirtiest one but uh this is unbelievable has a pile and that and it looks like there was a mouse living there but apparently um the gentleman that drives this\nGoes a lot in the country does a lot of things out in the woods and stuff and and it just there were there was a pile of leaves and stuff I've never seen one so bad why should you replace the cabin air filter it filters air coming out at your face okay so if you're in if you've got allergies and stuff is really good to replace those but\nIt also filters what goes into your blower motor end up against your evaporate are so if you wanted a long term repair or why shouldn't replace the cabin air filter\nHey you won't get the leaves in such a debris acorns we found acorns in there I don't know how they get in there but they get in there\nA acorns debris all kinds of stuff in the blower motor okay that can ruin the blower motor but if that stuff gets pushed up against dog hair and and and ah all this you know dirt and all that stuff if it gets pushed up against the evaporate or which is wet from condensation\nIt will stick to the evaporate er and eventually it will form an air dam and stop the Airflow\nSo you may not even know it but somebody gets in your car after you know years I guess a year or two and a while you know I think you don't have any air flown I can barely fill your AC coming out of the fence it may be cold but there's no air and so a lot of the times that's clogged up cabin air filter and if you didn't\nHave that kind of an air filter their instead of just replacing that filter now you're looking at major repairs you're looking at pulling out the dash to replace the evaporate or because you have no Airflow so uh there's lots of things we can do to mitigate repairs just doing some maintenance\nAvailable at eighty dot com twenty four seven three sixty five you're an ad on every day so you

the automotive presented by the products five to Haiti essay and ... on my\nBecause I\nWhat I did\nIt so we've got an older drug in the shop right now and it's funny that's all came on about the clutch because he wants to put an engine in it and move later I'm going to tell you about this uh this too\nAnd then six GMC or ... that or is it at another shop and getting some serious work done\nBut um anyway he's got an older ... older forward and he just approved us to put an engine in it and it's going to have a three year hundred thousand all parts of labor warranty it's a\nI think his late seventies early eighties truck or with the big engine and uh one of the things that we brought up speaking of clutches is you know when you do the engine you ought to do the coach at the same time and these are things that you need to think about when you're doing repairs\nUh the shop is trying to let you know that you will save some labor by doing these things at the same time they're not just necessarily trained up so they're trying to save your money in the long run because if you had put an if he had put an engine in\nDidn't do the clutch and then a year later the coach went out now he's got to pay not the same labor but a very similar amount of labor when he could have just done it at that time ain't got no warranty on it so ah okay we've got Mike on the line we got a few folks on the line and a very short amount of time for the first hour Mike what can we do for you\nWell good morning a called you before about the what we determined to be fuel pump issues yeah if\nIt gets down to it yeah I get up I I Do a little research I should ask you before but I get a nice part and I figured instead of motor craft for Ford\nI've I've I've read that Delphi pretty good and maybe even know am where you get the part and and you get the part of the box that says made in China no wonder now how you feel about that or if you've ever yeah I mean how many parts you installed say made in China and\n[laughter] all of them I mean you would expect that a lot of them would say made in the u._s._a. or especially on the GM and the motor craft but uh the ... most of the time actually may go in and made in China and Taiwan or\nYou know what I mean they just they're from all over I mean we're Aaron international community at this point I don't I'm okay let's see here how can I word this properly price is a big deal the cheapest part is usually the one that's going to fail first for me\nUh and the most important thing that I pay attention to is warranty because if they're offering a good warranty they're usually ready to back that up and they're not going to offer product that's going to have a high failure rate most of the time\nDelphi is a fantastic company so it was then so okay motor craft as is maybe what I Would have chosen for afford but you did not do anything wrong by going with the den so or the Delphi I'm Sorry\nYeah I just want to warn their customer ... [laughter]\nNo uh uh because I'd have to put that a disclaimer on everything I mean they have to say a warning your air filter was you know made in Mexico and warning and this was made in China this has been Taiwan\nOr it's unbelievable and I think uh most of the re manufactured products that we get are made in the re manufactured in usa [noise] uh I Know for sure our engines are and then I've been to their plant and it's unbelievable at Jasper\nBut um but yeah it it's just it's international and I know that that used to a comment taped if that's the word I'm looking for it used to do note uh um you know inferior quality but uh then so and don't fight they they give the quality specifications that they want to the manufacturer in China\nAnd so a ideally you're still getting a great product\nSure that I think it's probably ... most of them 'cause they're whoever's over here tell him to make it tell them and make the job\nThat's exactly right now you nailed it yeah and so the only thing that I Would not by the ... for parts of like let's say you were going to buy fuel pump\nAnd it said made in China and that was the name of the fuel pump that you were by you know it's a bright yellow box that says made in China that's the one I'm going to avoid the ones you can find on line the ones on ... the ones that\nYou know they've got it you can you can picture it I was exaggerating there but but that's that's the one that I Would not by\nA good deal and this is your opinion day this is my opinion day got your opinion I appreciated it makes you feel better Oh thank you know\nI'll keep you updated on a it's an ongoing issue it what would you start one forty times and I think we felt there was a fuel from getting weeks so we'll let you know now that turns out so\nWell they said you\nBet thank you for the call this is my opinion day as always consult your automotive professional before listening to what Louis has to say but we've got Dan\nWe've got a smile and we've got bill on the line you guys hang on time we've got a lot more automotive show to go this is the automotive show on news talk five fifty KPFA and ...

itself\nWhen I was talking about on a after market exhaust is catalytic converters in particular okay so I really don't think it's the piece that you install on I think that there's an issue with the wiring on that center or the center is getting lazy or was going bad and now it is bad\nBut uh did you I got to ask you one more question did you happen to clean that censor when you pulled it off\nOr not really I guess that I took it out I started back\nGood out here and you plug it right 'cause a lot of folks will uh taken off without unplugging it and that twist\nBut the wires real bad so you did and plug it when us\nYes yeah 'cause otherwise you get the heart ...\nOr you go yeah a lot of folks want to push right through and just twist up those wires like crazy so um anyway yeah go back double checked to make sure it's totally plugged in make sure that where you put the wires and stuff that they're not pinched anywhere and they're not melted on that exhaust anywhere\nOr if not then do you have a ... a um let's see do you have a scanner or were you going to ...\nI went to the ... were the ones that went to two different ones is that\nIf you have ... ... ... if you'd like getting\nA that part in installing it I'm okay with that just one time but I don't go back and back for warranty type stuff um if you if you put a new one on and it doesn't fix it then it's time to take it in and let the shop look at it because they'll actually look at the data and see if that uh oxygen sensors fluctuating normally\nAlso ... ... ... what they see it actually is that or not yeah you\nGet like a heart monitor basically and then you'll see that oxygen since are going up and down up and down and sometimes you'll see it go down and hold for a little bit and they go up and hold for a little bit that's lazy one or maybe it doesn't reach the peaks and valleys that it should uh or you'll see it just flat line totally flat line and that's a dead center\nSo if I go take a shot what am I going to ask them to check or a how to ask\nWell you would let them know that you would let us know that you have a check engine light on and you like to have it looked at okay there is a diagnostic charge for that in San Antonio that diagnostic charge ranges anywhere from\nA let's say Ninety five dollars to a hundred and thirty dollars okay you're gonna pay for the diagnostic but at that point you're gonna know exactly what's wrong before you take it to his shop I Would encourage you to go back down there and look at it and to make sure that\nThe center itself is totally screwed and in in tight OK okay and then make sure it's plugged into the point where it clicks so I Want you to unplug it and then plug it back in until you hear the click a lot of guys won't plug it in and not hear the click and then it's like oh you know what are we found was that it was there just wasn't totally pushed in\nRight right okay well that's right that could that whether it's hard to get\nYeah don't you don't have to do that I that's not going to be your issue I don't think okay\nAll right well thank you very much\nAll right thank you so much for calling him a great weekend and

with Luis ... of Syria on the automotive presented by being brought up to five fifty TSA and ...\n[noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\nThe question on the table is can smart smart cars or cars that need the smart key and that's the name of it than that you'd you'd mentioned [noise]\nThe ah [noise] intelligent key you know those key fathers\nWhere you put them in there and it knows you're in the car and\nBut can they be hot wired and for lack of a better term they can't be hot wired okay because there's a lot of control modules and there's a lot of wiring that goes into those things\nAh and so you can't ... the odds of somebody getting in that car breaking a window getting in the car have all weekend to try and get the things started uh they're pretty slim in my opinion not to get it started get it running well enough to drive and all that\nOr they could probably get it to crank over but not start and a could they be hacked yes uh to answer the question yeah smart keys can be and have been hacked\nOr this is according to insurance hunter dot CA it's a place that I found a reports of hackers manipulating the radio signal from the smart key to the car\nOr to be able to magnify the signal from up to a hundred meters away are present in both traditional and online media outlets so there's a lot of uh a lot of write ups regarding this on a you're smart kids getting hacked and of course there's nightmares about\nPeople using like ... radio frequency receptors and they sit near your ... your garage and they intercept that signal and they push the button and\nAnd the odds of that have got to be worse than getting struck by lightning I mean it's just\nI in my opinion I think the smart keys or unless you have a a ring of a band he does a man that that are going to come through and ah their goal is to steal smart cars smart key cars are the odds of getting that car stolen or jumped are are very unlikely so you're pretty safe with a a vehicle like that\nUnless we get super intelligent thieves and as my dad always says a thief is a thief they will figure out a way\nA and it's our job to keep fighting and making sure that they don't so that is a good step in the right direction day and asked me that over the break in a piqued my curiosity so let's go to our next caller we've got bill on the line what can we do for a bill\nOut it'll all the way hey how's it

exterior is a it is just gorgeous it really is and I love it it has turned that part of our house into his show room and that wasn't my intention but it did and then it prompted my wife to say uh well since you got the the Florida and I would like you to pull the paneling out of your garage\nAnd a and replace it with some drywall so we did we pulled the paneling down replaced it with dry wall put some a base for words in there and painted it and oh my gosh\nUh I've had my family come through I've had friends come through and say you're not really going to park cars and here are you in the beauty of it is it looks gorgeous\nBut you can't park cars in there and and this isn't even a commercial for them under super excited I did posted on the automotive show Facebook in case you're curious ah it's on there with a nice picture my garage and my ... in there and uh I didn't clean the floor\nThere is still some dust marks in there from I'm\nFrom the the drywall being done so ah maybe it'll take an updated cleaner picture but it is it's just unbelievable if you've been thinking about that for coating gives southwest exterior usually call for the look for the garage you'll love coming home to\nEnd up with that I Will go to a ... with your ... I think uh what can we do for you\nYes sir I have a question I have a two thousand Fifteen Tahoe and went on a course Eli notices that night I have never really thought about checking during the day but when I'm driving and apply the brakes and sometimes when I fly the signal light the dome light flashes\nAlright Greenland's okay although\n... if I push the break and or in a flash what if I immediately pushed the break again it does not flash\nYou have a on a two thousand and Fifteen Tahoe you have a lot\nOf issues that it could be electrically not a lot but I really you could probably narrowed down to just a few of the body control module is one that rings a bell but on Chevrolet in particular and I'm going to get the number incorrect but I think it's G. one oh three ground\nNumber one oh three or four and if I'm wrong maybe it's one Thirteen or fourteen but there's a grounded the back of the head that tends to come loose\nOkay and they are it's a it's a ground and then there's a ground at the bottom where the drivers feet are down by the frame\nOr but underneath the vehicle obviously and there's a ground on there that tend to get really dirty and and corroded or are loose or whatever but ground or a particular issue or they're becoming more of an issue that we're seeing in our ...\nWith the uh later model Chevy's okay and so in my opinion I Would [laughter] you know you hate to jump into like oh it could be this can be that but I Would kind of started there I Would look at the grounds first because they're super easy to check and just make sure they're nice in tight winning Chevrolet has a gremlin\nUsually a Chevrolet a truck in particular\nUsually it's the ground okay how are you start really in in where my dad would say is you could start by checking the battery make sure that the battery is good and you can just\nGo ahead just put a new battery in it this week did that start after the battery or before no before okay so and so I drove it last night and I notice it's still doing it so we could real the battery out\nThat's right so my ... you really you're probably going to end up taking this went to a shop but if I had a quick point or to give you a check for the ground and again I think it's either ... through your window four or one Thirteen or fourteen\nI'm pretty close on that but um check the grounds and tobacco in the head and underneath where the driver's seat or and make sure that they're clean in tight\nThey will do that then you may fix the problem you may find in the son of a gun there it is that both loose the grid the wires are all loose on there\nOr yeah it's just totally it's got stuff all over it let's take an awful lot of times we'll brush it just a little bit of the connections and spray it with you sprayed with anything WD forty or or you know anything ah to try and make that ground nice in tight and clean\nI kinda thought it was a ground but I didn't know where to start looking at Yale or can I ask you another question you're\nOkay I have a two thousand six Ford F. one fifty K. ah and my son has a jeep\n... I'm not sure what kinda G but it's a SUV jeep but we seem to be have the same problem I think I fix mind but uh when I pull into a parking lot or even if I was driving slow sometimes they're not real often but it would just die\n[laughter] okay well uh\nWhen did you do on which one that you thought you fixed wasn't the four day on\nThe truck at first they say if you will pop out which really needed it but that wasn't me up to it so then I claim to throttle body\nYes that's super comment I should have told the last caller that too but go ahead\nWas very very gummed up and dirty you end up now it seems that when I start uh my motor wraps up for\nJust a few seconds and then goes back down to normal and it doesn't seem to be going lo and dying out like it it had but I've only done this about two weeks ago\nOkay do the same thing on your jeep and and I think you might have heard the last caller or two callers ago that he had a forward that he was bringing in with the timing chain issue and anyone stall pulling into a parking spot so here you are saying the same thing and I didn't even mentioned the throne nobody cleaning I should have but yeah that's a very very common issue\nAnd my son a you know I talked to him and he's he's telling me now that he start he thinks he's smelling gas also a", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Jack Riccardi", "city": "San Antonio", "day": "20"}
