dots I don't think that a congressman as the tower should be able to order any police chief do anything but if you connect the dots properly or Castro called uh his buddy ... who's the mayor obviously the mayor called the police chief in ... at that started working down what I Want to know if\nI don't think that the chief for the answer to the mayor actually I the only person I think that she would answer to is the city manager a kit from an authority standpoint now from a sympathy standpoint I don't know if maybe Castro can go directly into the SAP because maybe there are some ... to go with him politically that either\nOh okay my question for you ... for the understanding this is who is who who commands the police chief ... you know what what is a chain of command in terms of who we received orders from and\nHe was hired by the city manager and rehired by the city manager and so the issues like that he's a department head okay and and department has answer to the city manager not to the mayor or or members of the city council but but again there's two ways to answer your question there's the there's the\nUh on paper the way it's supposed to work answer and then there's the who is sympathetic to who are who was an agreement with who answer an eye on that one I don't know I mean so if you're if you're let's just say hypothetically\nIf you're a liberal progressive police
