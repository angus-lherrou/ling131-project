think my wife was when I was surprised when she first moved to south Texas and realized wow how many people from her country we're coming over here\nSo I'm\nOne of the things that will you notice though is that um our country the United states we subsidize the Central American nations and one of the things that you're talking about down there\nIs that the a lot of locals what actually like ...

because he's going to run for president and you guys are just trying to ... them before it gets really so I don't know I I'm not bringing this up because I think Cory Booker did this I have no idea I there's no way to know my point is this is very similar\nTo the accusations against Brett Kavanaugh and\nI'm waiting to see if when this story begins to percolate and spread will the people that breathless Lee told Christine Ford we believe you you should be believed believe this man\nHe by the way he says he doesn't think that will happen or he says elsewhere in his links the letter um I don't expect the me too movement to be a sympathetic to me or embrace me because after all they like Cory Booker and he's their champion and whatnot so he's he's he's expecting to be\nA shunned and since none of us have any way of judging\nThis story or or putting anything into it\nUm I throw it out there mainly because I just I think it will be interesting to see if people are put on the spot if senator Booker is put on the spot if his fellow senators are put on the spot if the various people who told us that accuser should always be believed\nA and that uh\nWe don't need evidence anymore and you're not innocent until proven guilty you're guilty until proven innocent until you prove yourself innocent\nWill that apply here will that apply to Cory Booker\n\nUm you can you can tell me all

operates that must be how he likes to work or or or whatever [noise]\nAnd um it seems like you could I'm not saying I Would want them to do this but seems like you could you could justify doing the

forward not to corroborate Mr anonymous but to say oh he's a liar and he lives about everything and here's some other things he lied about I don't know but this is where you\nYou have to decide if the way\nJudge Kavanaugh was treated is okay or not and if you're OK with that then you should want Cory Booker to walk that gauntlet I personally don't want him to because I didn't want judge Kavanaugh to walk it either I don't want anyone to\nI I see a lot of value in innocent until proven guilty I think we'll be sorry we ever throw that away we'll be sorry\nI think we're getting close to throwing it away now\n\nYou get those big oversized postcards right and you just throw 'em away without even looking at it\nMost of the time but get this sense of like Ninety One percent of all text messages are red\nAnd isn't that true and you think about it you don't listen to every other kind of ads you don't watch every ad on TV Now streaming and watching things on a time delayed basis we don't see the commercials are weak and skip them\nBut you always when you get a text message you always if you're awake you always look to see who was from and if you don't recognize the sender then you read it and that's all they need you to do\nCandidates are using it to tell you about when the vote where to vote as well as to make the case for voting for them\nBeto O'Rourke is being sued by people who received a text messages from his campaign I'm\nOne of those people that received one I'm not soon but um I I I used to get them and uh\nI I couldn't imagine why I couldn't imagine how I'd be on any kind of a list or contact\nUm list for for Beto O'Rourke or for his supporters are for Democrats or\nAnything never never have any money than he Texas candidates of any party never did anything like that never joined a campaign never ... filled anything out but they just have you because they have you in public records\nAnd that Ninety One percent statistic tells you all you need to know it's not going away it's not going to stop and it's not going away\nBecause it's so effective\nAnd um you you can screen your email you can have spam filters and folders and again you can you can avoid other kinds of advertising completely but something that's cheap and that they know you will read oh yeah sure\nYou're going to get them and you're going to get them and you're going to get I mean I guess the only thing that will denigrate the value of them as one everybody sending them\nEventually the message will be lost and diluted and but for now\nAre they seem to really help candidates there's a number of races around the country where an underdog has won a race well Andrew Gillum the guy in Florida as an example he was the underdog he was not expected to win that democratic nomination for governor in fact he was ... and the polls and his campaign says one of the things they're sure\nHelped was all of the direct text messaging and there's much more on the way according to those in the business now a group called the pizza pie alliance is asking the Federal Communications commission to clarify that these services are\nNot subject to consumer protection that that doesn't ah constitute what's called auto dialing see auto dialing is\nThe legal term for contacting people without permission but it's done in a way that is very specific and of course very old school\nThese laws by the way have not been updated in many many years because of the political gridlock that we're in right now and of course both parties would like to continue to be able to do this stuff\nSo\nYou can always try to block and you can always respond to text and say hey don't text me again\nSometimes at work sometimes it doesn't but this is going to be around for a while at least for the new thing to ten five nine nine fifty five fifty five I I also get them\nSo I get the better ones I also get them from Republicans and the Republicans put prominent names on them like I'll get

what they would be doing and it would not\nBe texting me Jose is on K TSA Jose good morning\nJog it's you know [laughter] it better not be\nSo I just like yeah I think right out you know like and what I Do yeah look I got the solution is there a text message ban might do its thing it'll work rent so someone right so now where um ... you get a text message that's spam you just marketing spam boom it's it's marked right\nThat information is set to uh central database that you're disconnected you and it goes to a list once the numbers than market spanned more than a certain number of times let's say ten that central database center walk message every user that has that app installed on their phone\nAnd everyone that has that at no longer receive text messages that phone number and that means that they can exactly ten shot\nAt a sending text messages and after the person says this is Pam\nThat number is said and and they have to pay for these numbers and that that you know they rotate them but you know they're getting Honda who knows how many hundreds maybe thousands of text messages you know but I just think that if you could do it it has to be like combat you know\nLike electronic warfare and that's how we're going to win some app developer out there that's what I'm saying that up is going to make up a zillion dollars that's what I think\nThat's a great idea Jose now the question is what the person make more money developing that out or more money sending out the text messages for politicians because whatever makes more money is what they're going to do\nA Martin\nBum

was going to ask you how how you are observing the bump from that to to what degree there is a bump and is there even maybe movement from some more recent things like the uh\nThe obviously politically a manager massaged caravan of illegal immigrants are are you seeing a is that coming up and your encounters with voters\nPolitically I you know you get back to ... uh I get the energy and enthusiasm multiplying factor uh after\nAmericans across the political spectrum saw the insanity hold it in the Senate Judiciary committee fair to you Mr Kavanaugh dot org ... that people are better with that that's why the walkway movement is gaining steam and they see what's happening now\nWith this politically motivated up with a migrant which by the way\nNot only undermine our sovereignty and harms our sovereignty\nIt harms the very immigrants that they say they want to help it dangerous that puts them in harm's way all the political purposes crafts and that\nI did get starting to wear a very thin on electric tired of people doing the political purposes rather than what I Know isn't the best people in the United states people Texas so I'm getting a lot of\nEnergy of who's the outcome when I'm Out on the trail to push back\nAgainst people outside of trying to tell us what to do it I might say on the issue on immigration a I'd like to give a shout out to the Argus family uh Laurie Vargas the

taxes the president is hinting that he may want to introduce another round of tax cuts and although they couldn't probably be voted on before the election they certainly could be in the mix what are you hearing about that\nWell I Know that there's a lot of people that I don't watch try\nTo make sure that we make tax cuts permanent I Know that there are so interested in making sure that we can idiot what bothered code or even more than what they accomplish last year I think there's any additional rape productions reproduction and they want to make sure I got to reach the forgotten men and women that strong hard working class\nOf the United states and we'll see what happens with that but I tell you what I hear on the campaign trail all the time is a focus on balance\nThe budget securing the border every story health care that's why you're every day\nMore than anything or I hear people twenty first district around Texas they just want Republicans to do what they said they would do and do those things secure the border give us health care freedom and balanced the budget and that's what I really uh uh excited to focus on what I'm interested what are representing the district\nWhich I was Roy a Republican candidate in house Twenty one we're right now here on the TSA um I Know when we had you in for the town hall um some of the questions from the audience were about\nThe debt ceiling and the fact is that a rag now Republicans are standing by and letting the sky rocket just the way Democrats did how do you explain to people who are worried about dad who are worried about their grandchildren inheriting the bill\nFor the party we're having now uh when right now at the moment at least Republicans can't claim to be the the sentinels or the watchdogs of of death\nWell I'll

TSA and one of seven one FM al ... morning to you\nGet my jak I just kind of hanging out in the early voting too I always vote early although I don't trust them very much there either but the point is um I ... I voted to different places depends on where I Am at my day and all that kind of stuff and I voted early\nAnd I'm just not up to Capitol and knock it out you on the line with us in the street I mean I I don't have that kind of time it's unbelievable\nWow uh I don't know that\nThe good news or bad news but if it if it's a red wave I'm I'm all that\nYou know I it seems like with early voting probably the first day is not the optimum day to do it 'cause that's the day that the media hyped up and you know everybody thinks they want to get it done in that first day seems like a way to three days you're in good shape but we'll see\nCal thanks for the call as we want to hear stuff like that if you can compare apples to apples meaning you've early voted on the first day and in the same place two or four years ago or what your experience was like or how it compares\nToday not everybody has that experience or that comparison to make maybe move around a lot and you\nHave to have early voting to different places are different so he didn't early vote last time but you're really voting this time but if you have that kind of comparison that you can make\nA two one oh five nine nine fifty five fifty five or jak AT T TSA dot com and\nUm I think that uh yeah on on on the national debt thing uh I I don't think that's [noise] I don't\nSee how the Republicans can run on that I really don't all all my life they've been the party\nThat was going to do something about that um and they've blown through the ceiling just as fast as as Democrats did so\nUm I think what happens with politicians you know the answer a\nDance or the other gentleman's question Michael is that they when they get up there\nIt doesn't look the same to them anymore\nThe way things look down here and the way things look up there are very different and all of a sudden what we see as sir really massive and out of control is\nAll relative up there well it's our spending bill well this is my uh my party spending bill well this is what we want to do with the defense spending or this is what we want to do you know so all of a sudden it it's not ... and the money is not the same and the dollars they'll look the same if you want to know what happens to people when they get elected and they go to Washington that's one of the things\nI Believe that ... that happens you down here you're making your budget around the kitchen table you don't live on a democratic budget or a Republican and he live on the money you have\nBut they get up there and it's the Democratic spending bill and is the Republican defense authorization bill and we've got to rebuild our military and we've got to do this and provide that and we've got to have of course we've got to have foreign aid all of a sudden ... of course we got to do that\nAnd I don't I don't think they see it our way\nAnd the only way that you could change that would be if they were constrained by some kind of an amendment balanced budget amendment although as ... I think correctly pointed out they would then spend all their time and energy getting around that so\nTo ten five nine nine fifty five fifty five Jennifer is on K TSA Jennifer good morning\nAnd I'm sure and I just left like like it has no Weiner's way Trayvon at war or something like that and I've been here for Twenty years so I don't think there is a chunk something's going on I Hope it's a red wave\nNow I couldn't really tell though right\nNow that I have a car and it's I mean it's going to it's an hour or so late LA wow\nAll right John thanks for the next\nDay there you go I think it will slow down a little bit thanks for the call twice on K TSA high ...\nHigh jacked up on the same way as a lady we'll always vote early Sadler and we live by a vote and there was just a big crowd by just sell going out\nAnd you're not seen that before never not even two years ago you\nKnow we walk and already vote and leave all and they're just standing around maybe one or two people in their door boating and learn right and it's like we're like we never got other cars just dance I mean he would leave their house\nIs starting to believe but here in it for more and more people do I thank you for the call will get more of these coming up\nAnd we got the new news from ABC and our TSA twenty four hour newsroom here next and then you're not back on the phones to ten five nine fifty five fifty five [noise]\nA million\nPeople in one sense the city being told to boil their water details after ABC News it's twelve o'clock on PBS save San Antonio\nOn the ABC News\nI'm Scott hold bird President Trump is going a caravan of Central American migrants heading towards the U.S border a national emergency now threatening to cut millions of dollars in aid to the countries that they're fleeing something Congress would have to approve or from ABC's parent driver is\nTrump made in ... claim I'm Glad this morning about the caravan of migrants that's making its way through Mexico president writes quote criminals and I'm young middle Easterners are mixed them that Mr Trump provided nothing more to back up that claim there's been no evidence that there are people from the middle east and the ... parents average ABC News\nA circus investigators are not checking out a Mercedes belonging to the Saudi ... was it was found in Istanbul it's the latest development in the investigation into the death of Washington Post journalist ... who was last seen walking into that conflict\nThat fatty official told ABC News just two days ago that he walked in there was a physical altercation sound kind and then he was tight in a chokehold that if I saw that said that they've like killing him and the guy who put him in a town called is one of the Eighteen individual who is now detain says that's a\nLong way to go in three weeks but we're still all kinda flabbergasted ... three weeks to come up with that ABC's\nMolly hunter and ... in Wisconsin the Baron county sheriff is asking for thousands of volunteers\nTo help search for a missing teen girl whose parents were found murdered the Baron county sheriff's office wants to ... thousand volunteers for a search that will take place Tuesday for what it calls articles of evidence Sherry value it may be related to the disappearance of Thirteen year old Jamie costs they are telling volunteers to be prepared to walk on an uneven terrain wear boots and warm clothing\nSearch will take place about six miles north of a search done by one hundred volunteers last week ...
