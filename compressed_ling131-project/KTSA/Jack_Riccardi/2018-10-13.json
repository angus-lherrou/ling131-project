what I Do is just uh what I'm putting out the cubes for them especially if you've got a you know a little raised trough or something you put a man\nOr just does it over and the cows not only don't mind eating and all the Cubans or they go back and they lick that uh you know what I'm Talking about the little kind of rounded bottom\nFeeders maybe six feet long and put it on the cows will go back in lick until they have gotten every bit of the D. up but uh I was just a that figures out for me that figures out to a little over a cup of coffee per fifty pound bag of cubes\nAnd uh I just you know try to keep the cows way until you get it out or\nYou know the you know how cows are they'll try to push out all the way to get a few of us but uh you can either dump it in and if you put down to ...

spot\nAnd simply ... a little bit of corn meal and water overnight and then spraying with that\nWill go a long way to work and ...\nWell All right and what the question ah what is your plan it gets really when you start 'em ... said they just\nSpend a lot of fast instead of two little sunlight\nThere is a little ... there is a hormone in the sea matched that no no the too much there's a hormone

the crickets are they are a nuisance they're not a real threat that things but uh uh any of your bacterial beach will help with controlling them\nOr they're going to go away as it gets hotter and

TSA F I'm One of those seven one nine thirty six I'm Martin bumble that's Jim Smith\nFan we are here to help and or the phone lines are open to ten five nine nine fifty five fifty five to ten five nine nine fifty five fifty five as we go to Jeff uh Robert sorry Robert you're up next on the K TSA home improvement show\nGood morning to you sir my daughter my daughter\nAnd a lot of the microwave electric cooks yes or no\nOkay she wants to double oh we got one that was given to us earlier that record of fifty observers okay forty apps are going to know\nWhat to say or what would be cheaper or ... or whatever\nTo where the F ... servers to double the other set or use your service those are the cooked up and go on a cooked up\n... well that out first thing first step is to get a an electrician over there and the and the reason I said that is because if the wire size\nThat goes to the forty apps service that was there for the single or even if the wire size and the ... when it comes off of war handle ace or adding ten more apps then you may your whole problem may be solved by simply changing a circuit breaker\nThis wasn't built in the ... ...\nWell yeah you'd be surprised because the typical in electric an electrical for many years the typical was a forty to fifty percent overage um in other words the ... the panels and the wiring was designed to handle forty to fifty percent more than the than the actual draw against him\nOh okay so you may be surprised at the first step is going to be get electrician and see if that wire size is is is enough and the panel is enough to handle an extra ...\nYeah I'm afraid it might be a little bit of a\nWell uh again that that would be something that because I'm going I'm wires still used today and and there's nothing wrong with the woman I'm are as long as it's done correctly\nAnd my daughter was what what do I guess a cooked off but I mean what would I have to do to get that\nWell you would have to get an electrician to do the to move that service from a from the cook top to where the where the double ... can be located in the service to have to be relocated\nAnd then a plumber would run and that well you ... you need a plum you have you have gas already\nYes I have a water heater that so yeah okay good all why I don't know why they're cooked up was it\nThe ... probably cost factor at the time the the reason I ask because I happen to live in a neighborhood that does not even offer a natural gas so I had to get propane brought in in a in a propane tank buried in the back yard\nTo run the gas but then you have a plumber that runs the gas for you ah there's actually there's actually a couple of companies out there that do that I'm trying to remember the name of the company that that ran my gas line for me but they were reasonable and they did such a good job I'm really did such a good job for us\nTo be a nice to know the er at all\nWell I can tell you from from the electrician standpoint Kevin possum as the electrician though I recommend all the time he's he's the guy that does all my electrical work for me\nAnd a and his numbers to ten seven eight eight Ninety five twenty and a and I will see if I can figure out and find out who the the person that did our gas line for us was because they did they did a really good job\nOkay you're very she had it All right if I if I if I come up with that all the listen to the show and I'll Try to bring that up later on in the show OK\nOkay thank you thank you appreciate that very much Robert ... being a part of the show you know it's funny that he mentions that because this morning\nAnd Jeff we're going to get right to you and your calls to uh to ten five nine nine fifty five fifty five to ten five nine nine fifty five fifty five ah we ah\nWent to use the microwave this morning he'd some stuff up and nothing no lights no no nothing and I've got a double up and that's a microwave conviction of in combination with the regular conditional love them\nAnd and I had nothing but problems with this doggone thing I I just have not been happy with this beautiful looks great and when it works it works great\nBut this is the second or third time that I've had the panel have a problem with it and I mean no lights no nothing came on the island of insider could turn the other non but the microwave side nothing\nSo we're looking at taking that out and putting a double oven a regular double Lebanon and then just getting the microwave yeah yeah I'm I'm about done with a so anyway it's funny that he that was whatever it was in order to be that this was the thing is that at the bumper house this morning so [noise] uh let's get to Jeff Jeff good morning welcome to the K TSA home improvement Joe\n... thanks for taking like oh\nAbsolutely sure how you doing\nGood I\nI'm I'm trying to help my daughter she lives up at like like Texas ashes flat roof house that was built in the seventies and she's now she says the leaking as she's looking at replacing it eh so she asked me because she\nKnows that some houses and such I said well site is totally different ads you know stop three ... singles very into her and I really think about it so she asked me to kind of research it\nFor ... ad ... they got into it I thought it was a simple thing but nowadays I guess it's not there's all kinds of different ... as they should go with it I just wanted to ask your advice on what you think would be the best\n...\nYou know what there are all different kinds of newer type flat roofing options now than there were say Twenty years ago I used to be the roll down roofing was you know well first it was the the tar and gravel roof and and we all know the leak a nightmare as the ... that have happened what turned gravel roads in the past ah then it was the role of embracing\nShe has now yeah that's hard gravel\nYeah yeah and it's it's just it's it's awful um I've never liked turned gravel roads they they they're just not a reliable\nUh so so those are are ... you know those are kinda going by the wayside anybody who's replacing them is not replacing them with more tolerant ground you know uh the other one is then it went to the roll down roofing which again was slightly better than the turn grab a roof then you went with the torch down roof or which still is used today\nAnd then you've got the beautiful roofs um that that are also used pretty widely on uh on your a flat roof areas\nThey're all different kinds of ways to to do a flat roof and in different people have different opinions I'll tell you what I Would do I would uh I Would call I'm Duane over ... now and get his opinion of it because he's he's going to have kind of be the end all uh on on his opinions on that but\n... designer ... my

zero two ... two one zero five nine nine fifty five fifty five let's try that again to weather oh five nine nine fifty five fifty five uh\nLet's see who's been hanging on the longest ear it looks like Duane Shannon in record coming right up the way and you're up next on the K TSA home improvement show [noise]\nNeither do I\nI get learning good morning how can we help you this morning I\nA home that was built in about eighty five and it was not ... or water softer um I got the skill set to do it but I'm not sure about exactly what if that makes any sense\nI'm I get I Can't even figure out why the water was in the house from the from the meter so I get very what comes out later that would solve one problem\nThis is am I going to need to um athletes don't like a of shit outside and runs separate uh separate state gets for wired in the grass and that kind of stuff we're just sort of the house 'cause there's nothing in the garage\nOkay there's several different ways that it can be done 'em and you're going to you're talking about things in pricing that ranges from and this is having someone to do it there's beer you talking about ranging and prices from Fifteen hundred to two ten thousand dollars for a\nA plumbing route to to put in our water soften or there's a lot of things that have to be taken into consideration I'm typically like a water soften our company if they unless they have a license to plumber on staff\nThen they have to tie into basically an outside host them\nUm they can't they can't cut into your yeah your your plumbing in in inside the home whereas if you bring your license plumbing company they can route from anywhere um you know they can try and anywhere the main things you need to make sure of is like you said that you don't want to be wasting your water your your salt water to water your grass\nUm the the the only way that I could really tell you is to at least pay for a diagnostic to get a plumbing company out so that you can see how the water lines are routed wants to see how their routed then you can give us that was the game plan as to how you want to tie into him\nBut without knowing where they are routed um if you're outside the biggest come off of the main line before it enters the house um a lot of times it's a simple um which this is one of the cheaper fixes it's as simple as tying on\nTo the main line right before the water heater and breaking the line there and tying in your water software\nBut then there's other times where that's not possible\nOkay that sounds like even if I Want to do it myself I should add one more to come out and at least\nGive you a lay out to give me a do a lay out for you can you can do a lay out as to how your water line drawn in the home\n... and I will tell you in all honesty in all honesty if it were me even though like you I've probably got the skill set to do it this is one that that probably would behoove you to go ahead and just pay the money and get it done right\nAll right thanks for the advice and\nYou're sure welcome thinks along for being a part of the show this morning we appreciate the call and uh let's see here who's a who's a shattered Europe next on the K TSA home improvement show\nBy either morning or good morning Shannon\nAnd I have a question that will hopefully Sheila can I call the ... so we live in a in an area called Carol ill in and and and we have water\nThat seems to be running out of our French draining ran out all summer long running and then we actually developed like a link a lovely thought little league by our public Lipman says we had to learn where we've had our little guy now and then he can find a link we've had our on\nAir ... check and my husband and I did Charlie clout unless it's spring under the law this water is there any tell me you might call out\nThere all this ladders Kevin Durant\nYou need to call a leak detection company I'm not necessarily plumbing company is not necessarily a of the swimming pool company someone who specializes in leech detection\nI've got a really a a nice little a story to go along with that I worked many years ago I'm right at the at least for ten and parents Bible at an apartment complex was back when I was in college and cutting my teeth and um [noise]\nThe we found that for years there'd been a leak in the swimming pool um it was actually the pool itself it wasn't the the pump it wasn't the plumbing there was actually a breach in the ... in the pool itself that have been leaking for years\nWell we've got to be fixed I'm a huge undertaking they had to dig up the entire pool because the the water over the years it put a big ... beside the pool and it was a huge undertaking met long story short about a week later there was an article in the in the express news where a man that lived down in a terrible hills\nHad a natural spring dried up in his backyard [laughter] and it was actually the water traveling from up on the hill where the apartment complex was traveled a mile\nDown the hill and came up in this man on the back yard\nAnd when we fix our swimming pool we stopped his natural spring which in the course of about ten years he had put in a nice a Japanese garden in the backyard had go coy pond [laughter] everything was fed by this natural spring which turned out was a swimming pool lake\nWell at least are actually deploying guys came out and check the equipment and they didn't test to see if our pool is leaking fools lightly because they they were out there probably for about a week and a half just trying to figure out where the swatter is coming from so that still leak detectors you think it tell me if it's not\nTotally yes they can tell you that could absolutely rule out pool plumbing on your home and they may be able to give you an idea because it doesn't necessarily mean that does that mean it has to be a leak on your property as it was the point I'm trying to make that leak and a half a mile or a mile away that don't have to be on your property okay\nAll right ...\nWell yeah but it's like a person that can check if there is a Springer some somewhere\nThey can test the water they can find it at that water is domestic or if it's natural that is going to be the best way to do it is to have that water tested\nThat's a great idea okay well thank you very much I appreciate it\nThanks a lunch and appreciate your calling in this morning let's get to rex rex good morning welcome to the K TSA home improvement show\nGood morning fellas I have a couple of contributions if you don't mind certain with the guy that are willing to put it in the water is often are you my can save himself a whole lot of money and buy a set of tectonic magnets to place on the line and be bothered just about as good as he would have spent all the money to install water soften are okay\nOr the other point is I have a house that is built in Nineteen sixty four and the a C drainage goes down through the slab comes out through a um about a two and a half inch three inch\n\nTalk to Martin now at five nine nine fifty five fifty five now Martin bom bah American\n\n[noise] man I haven't heard this want to know why [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\nOh yeah

has to try to ... it's a water main licking an ESL it they'll have to dig it up to try to figure out where jak 'cause sometimes are precious and\nGo up to a hundred and twenty to a hundred and forty PSI and it don't appear until the ground a kind of worked his way in a certain direction 'cause I trade links that turned out to be bored yards away from where the water was coming from\nYeah that that was a story I was telling about that we did one at the apartment complex that I worked out when I was very very young that it was almost a mile away where the water where the water breached the ground five thousand feet\nOf but the ... the last the last thing I told her was to just get the water tested because just as a test on the water is going to tell her whether it comes from a domestic water supply or whether it comes from a natural water supply\nThat cause officials are chlorine residue into it that's got to be a city water\nAnd like any ... right yeah absolutely have to go ahead and\nDo you get a fight with him in order to justify that the lake is coming through and its mess up your house foundation\nYeah yeah ... thanks for bringing that up because you're absolutely right we

springs around the house so whenever we hit you know a certain water table\nYou know level with the water getting saturated in the ground she said the springs start meddling and I should really I thought she was full of it but I went out front in the house right after it rains and\nThere was this little guys are coming out of the sidewalk [laughter] before that is crazy that's cleaning up about\nAn inch about an inch out of the ground I mean it was bubbling like crazy and they come to find out that that was behind the significantly lower elevation than a lot of the parts of San Antonio writing just kind of runs to the almost base and you know\nBut ... direction right now they have found out that a lot of those springs or ... actually like the last caller just said they're actually said he leasing city water mains\nYeah yeah but this particular one I can tell you it it it just it's unbelievable you know during the drought nothing's coming up you know what I mean it's not like er it's saturated anymore but as soon as they hit it says that groundwater hit saturation point other working at that house for about\nTwo and a half months now and when it was dry it was no not a problem outside the more we hit that ground water and I tell you about that little guys or was coming up\nBetter that she was ... you're not as yet rains and\nYeah it was in and when I saw that answer

[noise]\nThe automotive show with Luis ... of Syria on the automotive brings me she brought us five fifty the essay and ...\nMean there's a a there's two events that I Want to get you interested in this weekend actually today are and in fact\nThey both started right now there are two or car shows and one of them is it on west avenue right near ... Selma the other one is in Bernie and I'll tell you just a little bit more about that and just a second but we've got a marine who's been holding quite a while or what can we do for you\nIt sounds a synthetic oil also\nSure I'm a recently drove a car\nFrom a family member or haven't been here about four or five months okay I was concerned about\nThey well Errol Morris and everything else stopped ... make a long story short they go low oil okay when they top it off and have found out later like top off what was to take oil have our little in the car\nNo no not at all it's a very very good question you know you have not ruin the car so that the car that you borrowed has synthetic and they added regular or vice versa the car you were driving has regular\nI'm Still not after ... when I told them I hadn't been getting about four months and then I said oh and they said they topped off and he said oh no when he got snake I could've called\nOh yes no and you did not ruin the car so let me tell you um ... what the synthetic versus the regular and what what you you can help me make this decision with you and and help you\nGet your fears alleviated here so\nThe synthetic motor oil without going into any science whatsoever about it synthetic motor oil protects your engine better than regular motor oil okay and it allows for extended or change intervals let's use the number\nSeven thousand miles versus three thousand miles for regular oil change\nIf you have full synthetic motor oil and your car you can go seven thousand miles on an oil change without worry of slow junior or engine getting damaged or anything like that\nNow and really we're talking long term effects not short term but anyway\nSo you can go seven thousand miles on synthetic motor all if you add one court of regular motor oil and there you have now diminished what these synthetic motor oil is capable of doing\nAnd so in theory the oil will break down sooner than seven thousand miles okay\nThat one court and there is not as pure as pure synthetic now you've got a four courts of synthetic in one court of non synthetic so let's knocked it all changed back by I don't know a thousand miles two thousand miles maybe\nLet's go instead of three thousand on an old ... and instead of seven I'm Sorry let's go to five thousand and get that all changed input regular synthetic back in their photosynthetic back in there I'm Sorry\nSo um anyway you have not done any damage whatsoever more damage\nOr it had you not topped off the oil okay the the the main issue is keep the oil full and if they accidentally put in regular motor oil instead of synthetic it's okay it's all it's only one oil change\nIn reality you're not going to do any damage to that engine and I know there's a scientist or there's somebody who is really\nA OCD about this stuff is screaming through the radio right now but I'm In reality in the real world if you had five courts of full synthetic and you added one court of regular motor oil you would just need to cut back the oil change in a row for that one or change until you put the ball synthetic back in there and so it's it's really\nNice I Would say maybe these people are almost ...\nEvery time they should but now let me tell you that if you were using synthetic like that that car that you were driving that you borrowed if you if it had synthetic in it and they added synthetic you're fine\nIf it hadn't regular if it had regular motor oil and they added synthetic now you've got more protection okay I wouldn't suggest you extending the all change interval but you've got more protection in there then you had before so\nIt's it's really ... the long and short as it's not a big deal at all if you are doing this if you were doing this every time like okay let's say somebody at a huge oil leak and they go in and they get a synthetic motor all change and then they put I Want ten thousand miles on my old change I Want you to put that on that sticker up there\nBut over the course of the next ten thousand their car leaks oil at a at the rate of a court a month and they add a quart of regular motor oil every month well now they don't they don't have full synthetic in there any more they have regular motor or\nSo the point is you don't really want to mix them all the time but if you got to top it off you use whatever you've guy and then and then just change the oil was at the regular interval and and go back to what you had\nOh my goodness I think he's talking oh\nAnd something goes wrong with the engine on that car in the engine goes bad okay let's just say something catastrophic happens be G will pay the shop that is repairing your vehicle the engine\nFour thousand dollars if something were to go wrong\nAll you've got to do is keep your receipts okay\nSo you go in for your all change and and you put a and B GMO way and the next time you go in and you put MB GM away keep all of your receipts\nAnd if you don't happen to keep 'em remember where you got the oil changes and they can always print the receipts out for you okay and so that's why I Do suggest that people stick with the same place all the time unless they just don't trust that place but a stick with the same place all the time that way you have a good accurate historical record of your vehicle\nAnd you can call them and say print up all my old changes please something happened to my engine and I need to call me gee\nAnd your car's a shock getting an engine installed MPG will pay that shop four thousand dollars\nOkay I get my car dealership K oil edge\nIf you're a dealership uses be G which sounds like they do and not every dealership does but if they use it then that's all you've got to do is just keep your receipts\nOkay I any fish oil ship sink or exactly\nExactly what the manufacturer suggest do not very the oil and I want everybody to know if you've bury your oil the viscous city\nAh from what the manufacturer suggests and it's in writing on your receipts than when the when or if the engine goes bad and it is possibly under warranty they're going to ask for receipts for oil changes and if all of your receipts say the wrong oil\nThey're going to say this was your fault okay so only use what they say to use in your case on sixteen Toyota Camry it's likely going to be zero W twenty\nWhich is a photosynthetic motor oil\nAnd so you're using the best all anyways but if you add that in my way on top of it then you'll get that protection plan at no extra cost\nOkay why should I Do it the dealership does say he did get rather\nGo to be gee find a shop dot com and I swear I didn't prompt is called but this is what made you want me to tell people go to ... find a shop dot com they have a shop ... and there may be a shop right next year dealership that carries be G products\nIf your shop just these\nBroad absolutely yes we've been using it as that are very close to my house\nOh great yeah well we'd love to see you just call us talk to roll he's my right hand man they're a scheduling all change and we can put in the the the factory oil and be G product him away and and you'll be covered\nPerfect thank you very much appreciate it\nYou bet well thank you so much for the call and let's go to Rob you're up\nNext what can we do for you today okay can you hear me oh yeah definitely can you hear me okay\nYeah nah I'm asking because I've been having some some problem huh uh\nTwo questions um eh a lead that costs here you've got the the model number a\nModel here is a two thousand twelve dodge but not like he had a car truck van SUV it's a charger okay got it okay\nA first question that we had all that heavy rain uh\nAfter that uh my window on the driver's side\nStarted a I noticed a little bit of moisture inside a not not not ... you know with the rain and we'd just like little moisture and I have a whole I think I always will my windows up all the way good anyhow\nUh after that heavy rain uh it started to kind of drag and making a noise like or like in having trouble going up so I rarely bring it down 'cause\nI ... I don't know whether it's going out or ... or ... or not they just\nYou know does sound like your window is starting to go out\nAnd let me give you too well one piece of advice that two pieces of advice\nOr okay so if you have a leak one of the ways to check for a league has to fill a spray bottle with dish soap and water okay just a little bit of this show up enough to make a plenty of bubbles okay\nAnd water and then spread all around the window and the theme of the door turn the car I'm Sorry turn the car on turn the AC on full blast with the air coming in from the outside\nGate and then ah and then shut the door is shut the windows spray the door and spread the window was soapy water and see if it starts to bubble anywhere okay\nAnd then you'll see that leak if there is a leak right\nNow on your window going slow up and down you can spray the channels where it dried up and down okay but overall if you've got a motor that's going out that's not going to help that's just going to alleviate some of the pressure that the motors feeling\nA I think it it it may just be a coincidence or unless you just got a whole ton of water in that door and it showed it out the motor I think it's just a bad coincidence\nOr but if you'll spray the track the channel that that window rides and going up and down you alleviate some of the pressure and allow that ah that window to move just a little bit more freely and that may only buy you some time okay\nWhere's is or what I had to take something\nOff a no role the window all the way down on them for John older roles that window all the way\nDown and use a spray can of WD forty with a straw we usually like to use white lithium Greece\nBut if you have is Wu forty use a straw puts that strong in the channel sprayed in the front and then sprayed in the back of that window where it rise and uh we've got plenty more automotive show we got one more hour to go you're listen to news talk five fifty kids you're saying if someone

supposed to be really really fun go\nSee them if you see anybody that's a part of that tell them that Louis area on the on the radio since you\nIn Bernie you've got a gigantic car show and they're expecting a five hundred troops sedans and roasters from all over the country is the main streets going to be closed down and uh it's supposed to be just a wonderful event\nAnd uh last night I was

call me at the shop or\nGo to Syria any auto uh let's see my emails Syria any automotive at SBC global dot net sorry Syria any auto\nSBC global dot net we've got a Facebook page and all kinds of stuff just get in touch with me I Want the jeep club that was there to be a part of carpet is coming up in April and I'd like to get with the person that was doing the scheduling for that moment to meet up last night\nUh anyway get in touch with me are coming here at the station I'll get your information okay we've got Irene up first what can we do for your Irene\nWell maybe you can just give me a quick answer I don't know there's a there is one\nIf you've been Lindland me at all you know that I have no quick answers I like to talk way too much but go ahead\nWe'll see but\nI I mean looking when any any way to go buy a car or just to me or nothing I mean you know non got great whatever\nThen all of a sudden everybody I mean he's terrible is that a good or bad\nI think it's a wonderful thing I Love it it adds more power to smaller engines better gas mileage\nAnd uh I think that it is a really enjoy the turbo aspect of what's coming down the road a and most of it is through diesel right they do have a lot of gas engines coming out with her bows obviously but most of them are coming up till now had been de so\nI don't even work on the east coast but I Do appreciate the fact that they're trying to do more with less uh the only thing that I Would caution you about on a turbo\nIs to do your oil changes on the most regular basis that you can put it on your in your phone is a reminder\nMake sure that you never ever ever skip an oil change and ah I Would definitely encourage you to use ... products on those turbo cars but go ahead what car or are you looking at\nI actually it was like you said you know that girl law hash back and it's terrible that always wondering\nYeah I think you you will be pleasantly surprised you're going to have a lot of power in that vehicle Toyota makes a fantastic product and again the only thing after you buy a vehicle with a turbo in it just remember that you do need to do your all changes find a good a reputable repair shop stick with the dealer or do whatever you got to do but make sure those all changes are done\nOK okay thank you thank you thank\nBet thank you and that's about a short of an answer as I could give I Know she was asking for a short answer but sometimes my mouth just keeps going\nAnd he just got to keep talking prank crank prank crank prank crank prank crank yeah no it that we did not having a a crank snow start Dan thank you are All right let's go to a Jason know Johnny what can we do for you Johnny\nHi good afternoon just half an hour ago our drought are thirty five I had my air conditioned ... it's a little bit warm progress and out of the blue you're conditioners started blowing warm air and then I also noticed a little bit later that the seat cooler there was also on didn't cool anymore\nAnd I still with the air conditioner adjusted the temperature and less than that but it was blown law where I was wondering what would cause it just full of cold air it'll all let it\nI don't know but more than the AC not blowing cold air that seat heater and cooler that would be the worst because now you're just sitting in heat but right what would cause that uh what year did you say the Porsche was fifty\nOkay that is very unusual uh it sounds like it's an electrical issue more than a freon issue and I know my rule on ac is always free on free on free on but\nAh but this sounds like an electrical issue almost like a body control module you'll be you'll hear me be the first to say that we don't work a lot on Porsches so I couldn't say hey it's this little doo Hickey right here that they went bad and you need to replace it um but ... have you driven it since you turn the car off and then back on\nA larger sparked it ... it up again\nOkay so I Would started up again and see if everything's working as normal and if it happens again on a very irregular basis\nKate then you're looking at something electrical in my opinion and and you can even get a scan tests done by a shop that could scan every module not just the engine but the body control module probably the AC module on that one ski and everything but if you turn that car back on now\nAnd it's not working then it's time to go back in and get it repaired okay and again I\nI don't work on Porsches you'll hear me refer you to a euro car care or the dealer\nOr for a Porsche and and that's where that's that's the route that I Would go I don't have the best for you but um if it's an intermittent problem ... those are sometimes a little bit difficult to find but if it's broken today than on Monday and make the appointment and take that current and get it for a\nWhile I Love your show I was actually listen to do it while I was just out driving and that's where a man I just thought I'd call right away and then the poorer\nShe got to be able to go fast and the poorest what's the fastest you've ever gone to that porch\nOr a cat a [laughter] or fear ...\nThe area you're awesome well thank you for calling
