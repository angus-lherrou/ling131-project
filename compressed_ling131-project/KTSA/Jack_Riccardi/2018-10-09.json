I talked about this a million times since the election of Donald Trump if you remember that last debate they had when he was asked will you accept\nThe outcome of the election and he said well we'll have to wait and see and Hillary went on this tour for the next ten or so days just renaming him a lot about saying that\nAnd that our democracy depends on the losers accepting the outcome right and it's her her and her side who have refused to accept\nThe outcome bright and and and she was right when she was going around and preaching that because the democracy or the republic cannot stand if we don't have these rules in place that we're all willing to follow right right that makes sense the worm has turned so what do we do where does all this go from here what are your thoughts\nI have to

of it the only thing it doesn't have is the the redrawing of maps of the declaration of another government but hey who knows what else I mean I wouldn't put fast anybody right if they're talking about eleven Supreme Court ruled that was yeah and after you know what happened after\nThe Eighteenth sixty election right that was another layer the losing side did not accept the outcome and we know how that it and look where we are right now\nSo it's coming up on the big show talking about all of that okay of course I'm as we like to say much more okay\nSo that and much much more as we go forward

this is either a very sudden decision or a very closely held one or maybe both a but a Fox News producer chat program was just saying a few minutes ago that he\nHas checked with people uh on both sides of the aisle on Capitol Hill of people with the foreign affairs committees in both the house and the Senate and they had no idea where given no advance warning about this so when we hear you will hear\nUh in in the meantime ah your what are your thoughts about that to ten five nine nine fifty five fifty five I mean I I've always thought that she would eventually run for president\nI Wonder if she's thinking about running for president sooner than we expect it um in which case a this will be a little awkward because Trump is saying my friend Nikki Haley and I've got a big announcement with my friend ambassador Nikki Haley it would be a kind of weird if she then turns around\nNext week next month next year\nAnd says oh yeah well I'm now I'm going to run against him in the twenty twenty Republican primaries I I really can't see that because I think it would be hard for her to explain why she was on team Trump and that was running against team Trump\nOr that would be a little awkward I mean if you expect that somebody is going to primary President Trump in twenty twenty and I do expect that you expect it to be a Jeff Flake who never got on board or John Casey Kuhn never got on board and ran against him before and never did sort of come over to the\nTo the idea that ah that he was legit [noise] um I I think I think one or both of those guys and maybe even some other people will try to run against Donald Trump in twenty twenty it's almost too\nIt's almost too fat and opportunity you know what I mean think about it ... you have nothing to lose and maybe something to gain even if it's just notoriety in challenging him I don't think he can be knocked off\nIn a primary challenge and that is so rare in American politics\nUm it it's just about unheard of in modern times even as low as dear as President Carter had in Nineteen eighty as badly as he was doing in public opinion polls and we had the Iran hostage crisis and he was just a huge mills stone around the next\nOf many Democrats and he drew a very high profile prestigious primary challenger in Ted Kennedy\nOr and even even Ted Kennedy at the zenith of his political\nUh powers could not overcome a sitting President Jimmy Carter so I I really don't think\nDonald Trump who is a I think a better politicians can be Carter is gonna is going to ah be vulnerable but I Would not I would not put it past people in the Republican Party\nFrom saying hey might as well take a shot I don't think he's the future of the party I think a lot of Republicans are holding their nose or just going along\nA you know with him for now but maybe if I give them an alternative and is she one of those people I don't really see her that way I don't see her in the same mold is Jeff Flake or a John Case sicker and Michael Bloomberg or one of these other people but you never know will\nI guess time will tell I I Would more have thought that she was somebody who would run for president in her time she's still very young um she could wait till twenty twenty four she could wait till twenty twenty eight she could run for the Senate from her\nA state if those things are of interest to her or or or not and again we don't know what this announcement as we do know that this is some sort of personal\nIssue with her health or with her family\nUm was something that she needs to take care of right away\nOr you tend to think that might be it you don't want it to be that but you tend to think it might be that because of the abrupt this of this I mean here's the White House just swearing in Brett Kavanaugh last night\nUm and now getting set for a major um departure and another vacancy or in their team\nOr somebody on Facebook Eric just wrote do you think maybe she's going to be named attorney

that and even if that's not the reason I think that was a smart thing to say\nWe'll see you on hold for ... owns Pakistan vice presidential running mate right\nWell and and it would be smart to say hey I took a little time um I was out that you know who did this to me most effectively of all the people I've ever seen do this was Ronald Reagan he you know when he ran for president in Nineteen Seventy six and ... all most caught Gerry Ford for the Republican nomination\nEverybody told Reagan okay well ... ... people love you I mean you've got a standing ovation at the national convention you could do anything and what he chose to do was spent four years just touring the country giving radio or he did a little radio commentary every day that he rose\nAnd those years in the wilderness everybody said later kind of fresh and him up kind of sharpened up what he thought about the Russians and the Cold War and um disarmament and when he came back in Nineteen eighty he'd had that time and we had had that break from him\nOr that that I think made him more effective and and uh attractive\nTo people in Nineteen eighty and ah\nYou know who has a a great insight on this we should try to talk to them one of these days is Gilbert Garcia because he wrote that book about Reagan running for president and yeah the ... what they call the years in the wilderness of course it's not really the wilderness but those years where you are out of the public guy or at least out of the daily public\nI I'm can really be good for your uh for yourself for your perspective and you know people need a little break from you\nSo yeah I mean I think this will be in North of the break for ... rice ... this is the ...\nLooks like they're doing between ah basically two and four years\nAnd if Nikki Haley stays till the end of the year it'll be just shy of\nTwo years so she went over there at the end of January twenty Seventeen went from South Carolina to New York city\nUm and represented us at the un ah but when you look at the list it's a heavy on career diplomats are people that had been in other diplomatic post that's not her\nOr or people that had been in politics are like at least Stevenson who ran for president as a Democrat twice last Eisenhower twice he was named by President Kennedy\nOr to be a UN ambassador he actually died a on the streets of New York city while he was UN ambassador\nUm but ah yeah I mean it's it's a lot of people that are not very well known very prominent ah many of them diplomatic or veterans George H W. Bush was among the many things he did before he became president\nThe UN ambassador are under Nixon\nIn Seventy one and Seventy two\nUm and you don't have to stay long to make an impression when I was young I remember there was always a lot of talk about and he was really really a a prominent a a an outspoken guy Daniel Patrick Moynihan he had been a a new ... a a great society Democrat\nA and he was appointed by president for the Republican or to be UN ambassador and I didn't realize so I just looked at this that he only was in that job for eight months\nBut he was very prominent very outspoken in the news all the time or really elevated our um\nOur presence that the UN um so it isn't how long you do it it's what you do with that job and I think that's sort of what she and what the president were saying about her tenure as UN ambassador what's your take on it to ten five nine nine\nFifty five fifty five but again it's been a combination of people that were very prominent in the way they did it remember Jeane Kirkpatrick was President Reagan's first\nA UN ambassador and was really um front and center a really outspoken really a powerful and and a charismatic and eloquence during the Cold War\nI'm Andrew Young was a President Carter's UN ambassador for the first two and a half years of his presidency also very very outspoken\nUm other people did it and it was kind of a you know victory lap last thing they did in their career Madeleine Albright did it before she became secretary of state\nSo that's that's the history of the job and\nUh she is the twenty ninth person to have it and already the speculation beginning about who the thirtieth person will be president said by the way in that news conference or I guess you would call it a news conference\nThat um he expects to have a name and a couple of weeks and that a recording to him there are a lot of people who are already indicated\nThat they'd be interested in doing it\nUm it is a job that depends a lot on who the president is on what's going on with the foreign policy of the time and a little bit on who you are I'm so some un ambassadors that we don't hear a lot about publicly maybe are more behind the scenes people or what have you\nUm I've always been given to believe that it was all there was a lot of one on one lobbying and you know button rolling people in the hallway and\nIf you've ever been to the UN um it it's a\nIt's obviously a place where more business happens away from the general assembly hall you know that big hall that you see on TV with the green marble backdrop it there's obviously a lot more going on in the\nIn the uh lounges and the hallways then go on in the public eye and so people that are effective have to be effective\nIn ways that are not publicly prominent are publicly known and um again pretty good uh reviews for her time from even some Democrats uh who obviously don't support the president's foreign policy but recognize she was pretty good\nAt representing it and um I Do think that the twenty twenty election cycle is going to be heavily populated with women I mean if you look at the Democratic side we're we're talking on the J our poll well Hillary Clinton run again\nI think this tour that she is now going on with her husband is part of getting ready to run again I don't I I I Know I Know people that one or two I don't want her to but\nUm I don't think she can let go of but I think you're going to see a lot of women in the Senate look at running for president I think Michelle Obama is somebody that people are going to continue to talk about she claims to have no interest in it but guess who else is\nGoing on a book tour right after the midterms are over Michelle Obama and so on the Republican side they're going to look at this and they're going to say well we can\nWe can say that that's um their gimmick and we just look for the best person or the best people but I think I think there will be opportunistic women who will say um hey look twenty twenty and maybe twenty twenty four\nAh we're gonna take advantage of what's happening and what's changing and maybe Nikki Haley is is one of those in in her case and she says she will be campaigning for President Trump maybe she's his running mate or in\nA second term will see fall speculation for now the news of the day including the latest on the Haley announcement coming up next on five fifty\nK.

off\nTo one end of the uh of the bench\nBecause they see them by seniority that chief justice of the middle and then they found them out by seniority so he will ah I guess Gorsuch's at one end and he's at the other end is probably how it works\nA but he's hearing arguments today and on the job today last night the president hosting cabinet and his family at the White House apologizing to them you set on behalf of the American people\nFor what went on during those a confirmation hearings by the way there's some new polling out today from CNN and Ipsos shows independent voters are not happy with the way Democrats handled the Kavanaugh hearings\nAnd maybe breaking toward Republicans now we know Republicans are going to vote for Republicans and Democrats are going to vote for Democrats and we can only wonder about the the the you know the the swing voters where are they going to go and we can all only wonder about a intensity of turnout for dams and intensity of turnout for GOP\nBut a ... interesting if independent voters\nAre making up their minds some of them I'm On the cabinet hearings anyway [noise]\nCloser to home why is it the San Antonio in the middle of a red state uh and so many cities around the country whether in their in red states blue states why are they\nThe playgrounds for liberal progressive radical antifa loving uh you know jock sniffing politicians\nWell it it's probably easier to explain why no one else's interest to than to explain why they've gained control you know if you look at San Antonio\nWho lives downtown\nTo conservative people live downtown do they want to live in loft apartments\nOr you know off of Alamo south Alabama no right\nSo where do they live they live in the suburbs they live in ... and by that I mean they they may live in the city of San Antonio but they live in district nine or district eight or district\nTen I'm generalizing of course but you get the idea if you don't really relate to\nDowntown\nOr the city if you don't live there if you don't spend a lot of time there then your interests are elsewhere and when it's time to organize and draft candidates and hum organized campaigns\nYou may be looking at other things where your interests are reflected your local state rep for state Senate race or you may look at your sheriff's race or your da ... and that absence of interested in the absence of participation by

Chuck is on the radio shack morning\nThank you for taking my call I got dropped her of her I'm Sorry about that um yes I wanted to comment on what you said earlier about if it can happen here in San Antonio and ... back about two years ago two and a half years ago ... not at that extent but it did happen when\nSea antifa lied to itself with different groups and at one point they were lining themselves with a\nMembers of the algae Beatty cue community of women's productive rights\nAnd the black lives matter a move that there was a young man\nI don't think they said he was from Ohio and he was down here and like you said he had the right to protest but he was trying to protest something that had nothing to do with San Antonio and they blocked traffic downtown or by the same as nice hotel are you familiar with that\nParticular thing they were protesting the shooting the African\nAmerican mayor of them were in and out of the time I I hadn't remembered it no\n... well they were protesting they were even going as far as saying you know maybe we should kill police officers now\nLet me let me brand new Burke was not there yet but he was on the council and he was he knew where he was added because he had already announced and I can tell you that right after that\nI don't know if you recall this incident but you could look it up and validated there was a shooting a somebody shot out a window at the police headquarters okay that's fine and so they were sending a message basically that you know they you know we're all antifa and everybody else\nI I'm not a political percent native tax ten but I I don't really fair term one side or the other but I can tell you based on what I was seeing on TV with that testimony I thought that Kavanaugh was treated very very unfairly or\nThat it was a a sham that way that thirty six year old issue came up\nJust for mid term elections and I think that it's going to come back to bite the Democrats with the independent voters\nYeah um that is what this new poll from CNN seems to seems to indicate um\nI guess the thing about it though a Sarah is that in mid term elections they they often say that independent voters don't vote as much a that they are more likely to come out in the presidential races do you think a person like use it normally maybe isn't that politically interested\nWill actually take the time to vote based on the cabinet\n[noise] it's interesting that she makes that point because I Do agree with you normally there shouldn't be a time when maybe I Would just skip the November elections coming up\nBut not in this case in this uh based on how they've treated at trapped since he was elected just not a ... day why\nTotally unfair and not even get a chance and the way that's thirty six year old or a issue by Dr Ford which brought up white thirty six years later I it just\nIt just didn't sit right next to me as an end and that and so you can that's your bottom dollar I Will it's crowd at those thoughts when I got to the polls ...\nSarah thank you thanks for calling and appreciate your call again and thanks for those for those points the let me go off and a little tangent here so she brings up cabinet and Dr Ford um I thought this was interesting you we we all remember of course the the letter\nA that Mrs Ford's sent to Dianne Feinstein her senator\nKicked off this whole episode um and then Feinstein chose to sit on the letter [noise]\nAnd then use it at the eleventh hour and a that either she or the legal team she recommended to Dr Ford leaked it even though Ford had written it\nWith a she claims hopes of anonymity\nRepublicans were the ones that tried to protect that offering to go to California and take her testimony privately because she ate feared the spotlight and be feared flying\nA it was Democrats and her democratically appointed lawyers were also democratic activists uh in fact the man Michael Brown which is also Andrew McCabe lawyer um they're the ones that flushed her out and do what was obviously a very uncomfortable\nAn awkward moment for her now ABC News is reporting a that Christine Blasey Ford has no further plans to pursue her allegations against\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh when asked about the possibility of impeachment proceedings her other attorney Deborah cats told CNN professor Ford is not asking for anything of the sword\nWhat she did was to come forward and testify before the Senate Judiciary committee and agree to cooperate and that's what she did CNN's Dana Bash asks or she doesn't want him to be impeached cats know\nSo she wanted to be heard she was heard and now she's moving on with her life um\nI think that underscores again that the worst treatment she received by anybody that we are sure of was the treatment she received by Democrats and I that's why I think when people look at this they're not just disgusted with the way Brett Kavanaugh was treated I think a lot of people are disgusted and I'm One of them with the way Christine Ford mistreated\nUm\nAnd of course the Democrats are promising that they will investigate and some are even saying tried to impeach Brett Kavanaugh so once again they claim to be the champions of Christine Ford but\nThe hell with what she wants they're going to do what they want to do right\nUm but but I think the the um the antifa thing is something to watch if the blue wave fall short I mean there's going to be a blue wave if it isn't enough to hand over the Senate in the house\nOr if a dead locks the Senate or dead locks the house or or or just isn't enough\nTo put the gab all back in the emcee Paulos who's hands I think you may see\nAnother meltdown I think what you saw on friday and Saturday and what you saw in the weeks after the November twenty sixteen election I I Believe you will see that again in fact you may see it again anyway [noise] um and it's worth wondering um how that comes together and how that was pulled\nTogether and you're you I'm Sorry but you're naive if you think that it was spontaneous\nAnd just sort of boiled up on its own uh there are groups many of them funded by George Soros or that were very instrumental in organizing
