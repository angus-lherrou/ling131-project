have to do this we have to act this way because we don't have power the ... the Republicans have power Trump has power\nOr the capitalists have power that's what they say and this used to be a fringe group of people that she used to but we used to refer to them right as the fringe element or whatever\nThe extreme element remember back in the day you have the WTO or the G. seven and these are the people that were smashed the windows of Starbucks and said uh you know garbage barrels on fire and stuff like that\nBut the funny thing happened on the way to the forum this group of people became organized and I'm funded\nThey're not using daddy's credit card to go to Seattle to protest the WTO anymore\nThey're getting funding from established organizations there professionalized if you will what used to be a fringe action is now somebody's job we know for example they were paid demonstrators outside the Supreme Court in the capital during the cabinet confirmation\nAnd they were emboldened because the Democratic party sees the energy in this mob desperate for votes desperate for something to hang onto\nAnd they are tacitly encouraging them more than tacitly when you listen to people like Cory Booker and Eric Holder and Hillary Clinton\nSo the outrage of Democrats at losing the twenty sixteen election has merged with the bought and paid for an organized outrage of mobs like you see in Portland and that's why you'll see no Democratic Party leader really condemn I mean they'll inch issue little limp wrist a\nFaint hearted condemnations but\nThey won't seriously condemn these kinds of actions in fact the mayor of Portland a real piece of work named Ted Wheeler\nA says that he supports whatever the police do all the police are responding they didn't respond with Ken

and this that you see what I see you could see it with your own eyes you know what it\nIs but here's something to think about\nThis is how they act they say because they're out of power what will they be like if their side\nWins what will happen to all of this if they are empowered right this is what they do when they don't have any power they say what will they do when they have it\nTo ten five

going to the trouble of releasing a DNA results that means that she's worried about what the rest of the country might think would say I'm so here's what she did\nShe um hired a guy who worked for um the ancestry industry he's a Stanford professor named Carlos Bustamante\nAnd um\nHe put out a report which she then shared excerpts of with the Boston Globe all the Boston Globe is the most Elizabeth Warren friendly media outlet in the world okay it's like the house Oregon of the Senate you know the senator a war in office [noise]\nSo um she went and she cherry picked somebody she didn't go to an established\nAnybody can use it twenty three and me ancestry dot com whatever\nKind of thing she cherry pick somebody who perhaps like sure as supportive of her I don't know\nShe found this one guy who did this one report\nShe uh gave him a sample of her DNA and um he did this private testing of it\nHe said that the vast majority of her family tree is European but the results strongly support the existence of an an ad mixed Native American ancestor in the range of six to twelve generations\nAgo um six to twelve generations ago\nI mean it could be anywhere from one thirty second two one five hundred and twelve\nNative American\nWill probably wouldn't you think given what we know about the movement of indigenous people across North America we're probably all at least one five hundred I don't know I mean there are probably people halfway around the world that have that much Native American blood and the move never come to this country there's people in Siberia\nWith Native American blood there's people in in uh in Asia with Native American blood\nSo this is like saying I'm a distant relative of the king of England it's almost worse than just lying about it it's saying\nOh well I I'm not lying I've got this tiny little teensy little we'd see little scrap but then at the same time she's put out a video saying\nThat being Native American did not matter to her academic careers advancements\n\nSo on the one hand she's saying look\nI have the the claim I can make the claim but in the other the other quarter mile she's saying but I'm not making the claim\nI'm not using it I haven't used it to uh get ahead um\nAnd of course the problem with all this was really just will people care or not like a lot of things it's all in the eye in the ear of the beholder so if you love Elizabeth Warren and you think she hung the moon then you wouldn't care if she was claimed to be won five hundred Martian\nYou just see those high cheekbones and just you just happy she gets on one of her rants you're just happy\nUh and if you don't like or you know like what you're saying then this isn't going to matter but let's say for the sake of argument that the test is legitimate that even though she shopped around for a geneticists still she found one she liked that somehow he did good work and this is legit\nTen generations ago\nI mean\nI I'm more African American than she is Native American let that sink in the fact\nIs she grew up ... she had all the privileges and benefits that go with that and then when she hit a point in her academic career due to affirmative action which she's a big champion of that would have worked against who she was she just decided to be something she's not\nAnd um she can say now and she can find people who will say now oh no that wasn't a factor but these are all people that like are these are all people that are favorable toward her\nThe fact is if you go back in time and people have done it where she was hired they posted about her ancestry they boasted about who they were hiring and how it was the first\nAnd it was a benefit to her and she used it and she bragged on it and she contributed to a Native American family recipe cookbook and all the rest\nSo she's easily able to turn the sun and turn this off and I I just I have no idea how people are going to take that because again where I grew up I thought people would be wise to her and they love her\nSo maybe she can pull it over a in Iowa New Hampshire and places like that too will see I'm ... and now my question is with the DNA results can we still call her ... and focus on us like is it now\nUh did if she's going to be in this conversation and and there's two things if you're going to be the conversation for president um you you need to know right now she's funny as a free dollar bill but here's the other thing that I Wonder about maybe none of this matters because maybe today you are or whatever you feel\nYou are I mean if\nPeople can ... you know racial does all can come out and say well identify as black woman and people can uh declare themselves to be this and that and I guess I'm In this body but I'm really not of this body and all that stuff but it may not she may have just come along at the right time granny Warren may be rescued\nBy the times that she is a running in because it may be that now I'm self determination self declaration is where it's at and she can say that doesn't matter what the DNA shows doesn't matter what the blood test shows um this is how I identify I Am\nThis is who I've decided to be and um she chose well because I think she's kind of a marginally talented person but she's actually come a long way\nOn this one claim to fame that she is this uniquely advanced Native American woman a woman of

impressive it's a combination of people whose time has come and gone and they don't know it with people who think their time has come and I'm not sure that it has\nSo you've got the Joe Biden was in the Bernie Sanders and ...\nGet the ... the Kamala Harris as in the Cory bookers\nYou can have them okay\nIf I Belong to a political party and those are my choices and those are my prospects I Would be getting ready for another four years of Donald Trump\n\nIt's as simple as this if I learned anything from watching politicians it's that if you\nMake promises and deliver on them you will probably be reelected and that applies\nBy the way to people I agree with some people I don't agree with so one of the reasons Brock Obama was re elected as because he please the people\nThat elected him the first time they liked what they got those first for years they liked what they saw they liked what was coming at them from the oval office\nThey came back for him again he he had a tougher opponents\nHe won by a narrower margin we looked it up one time I think it's been a ... it had been like a hundred years since the president was re elected\nBy a smaller margin than he had won by the first time but that was Obama's experience and twenty twelve nonetheless he he gave the ... what the ... expected and wanted to get reelected Trump is doing that for his tapes he's giving them what they want\nAnd\nCombined with the overreaching and history onyx of the Democrats and nothing suggests they have learned anything from the cabin up hearings at all nothing suggest they have learned anything from the twenty sixteen what experience at all\nI think he's in pretty good shape when you have the hand Democrats have and you've overplay to you know\nOf discriminating against Jewish students\nJewish students in the Nineteen fifties were hitting the same kinds of academic heights that Asian American students are hitting today\nIt was merit based they were doing the work they were getting the grades they were winning admission but the problem with Jewish students was first of all a lot of these schools at a\nChristian tradition and secondly a lot of these Jewish families\nWere ... were you know middle class or even lower middle class income well universities want people that you know they want to admit people whose families can dial the university\nAnd these families these Jewish families were not going to be in a position to do that so for reasons of out and out um discrimination and in order to have a more I guess you'd say affluent a alumni population\nUm these Jewish students were systematically discriminated\nAnd so I'm not sure it was anti Semitic but it was certainly damaging to deserving Jewish American students today it's Asian Americans for many of the same reasons um is it right can you justify it can you defended harbor is going to\nTry and this may wind up going all the way to the Supreme Court Bob is on the TSA Bob good morning\nJak I enjoy your show let's all the time\nThat you I'm a ...\nAnd the college teaching business ... over forty five years I taught at three different universities in three different states and I can tell you for sure and equipment\nLaughing at administrator do what's behind it all is money that may not see it that way on the surface\nBut the ... the the push for diversity and that's and that's definitely happening\nThe push for diversity allows opportunities are much more money to come in because of diverse population I teach at a university right now in this region and I can tell you that every piece of literature that we put out as a black student at agents student\nOr a female or at it but I'll tell you what it doesn't ... doesn't have a white male [laughter]\nWell you know terrible so explain to me how this is about money\nWell the there's a lot of grants that are available and I\nAnd the rats are available to specific groups\nAnd types of people and they have boxes you at\nThe check and why you can check off the right boxes your grant gets moved up and the kids and so so it has\nThat do not just with the people that are applying for the grant but the diverse population of university other words if you have have you have a predominantly Hispanic population and your university right now in Texas\nYou're going to be a ... year universities got to be available to a day and a lot more grant money\nThan if it was not that way and edit\nIt I've seen it happen over the years I'm an older guy I've been teaching for a long time now and you know you know yet the up and I'm sure you do you're pretty smart guy so odd easier to teach smart ... when they pick it up pretty well you know but\nNow the limit let me push back on you with that because ... and I may offend you but I don't\nReally think these universities care how smart the kids are or who graduates or if they graduate you know graduation rates are not something the colleges brag about the way for example\nPublic high schools too because it doesn't\nMatter whether you linger there for six seven eight years get a degree switch your major drop out and never get a degree they have your money\nAnd they they have more than just your money they have the money\nThen they All right so so my point is one of the one of the byproducts of affirmative action was to put a lot of uh of these targeted students in academic settings they were not ready for and they would\nNot succeed and and the universities knew this ... you know when you've got a kid that's in over his head\nUm but they didn't care now how is that helping people to put them in a position where they are going to fail and not even caring about their failing just caring about being able to count them searchers diversity score\nOn not only is it not helping them conversely it's hurting them\nBecause it's very demeaning and very uh demoralizing to be at a situation I actually get all the time in my classes are still teaching I teach in an generic discipline and and and I I've seen so many horrific things happened\nWith kids that are put in situations where they can survive but they're getting grant money to be there and they can't pass a basic algebra class you know\nSome great points Bye bye thank you for the call appreciate it to ten five nine nine fifty five fifty five by the way um\nWe we haven't said much about this but yeah the the the truth is that diversity is something you brag about when you report your freshman class when you report on your incoming students when you when you report on your admissions\nAre all kinds
