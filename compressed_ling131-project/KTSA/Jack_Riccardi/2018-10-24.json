New York police department detective retired as a detective sergeant he's in our K TSA window world news maker line professor thanks for coming on and and good afternoon\nTo you good afternoon Jack Elliot good thank you um [noise]\nYou know it's it's very interesting that none of these devices in and of course Robert grateful none of these devices apparently went off so that gives whoever is examining them and investigating a lot more to work with right\nWell absolutely about the tells us about the ammo of that that you know the modus operandi of a bomb maker it could also provide investigative clues such as ... and being able to put those pieces together about where these ... where they were even bought so with that the U.S is I think I have a lot to go up\nUm does it also suggests that maybe we're going to find out these were not actually going to work that they were meant to resemble a device but that they were not functional\nWell we could find that out there they're going to tell us for sure\nUh I Know that the New York city they've already removed one too will be called ...\nIt it's in the Bronx it's where the all the bombs are caught and they will investigate that nip it is alive device we all know relatively soon because they'll have to set it off or just to just to get rid of it so it's going to be interesting to see what investigators can glean from that the bikes\nOne thing we learned um with uh the news conference was that there was some kind of white powder nonspecific or with the CNN device and I I Know that I I've heard in the past that sometimes a white powder\nIs used because it it has to be you have to presume the worst about if you have to presume that it could be anthrax or or something very dangerous and when it turns out not to be nonetheless has the result of slowing the response and widening the evacuation so in other words it magnifies the effect the terror effective the device right\nWell ... yeah specifically because some of those uh you know weapons so to speak\nCan become ... so you have to actually evacuated much larger area then you would have normally\nThat just that the bomb itself because of that the ability to be able to be dispersed within the air and if it was done in combination so that they put the bomb with the with the powder that is even a bigger concern because now you could spread that\nThat apple and you know it let's just say it is a chemical weapon or a biological weapon much further than you would normally so all of these things or will be awfully answer it out in a relatively short period of time\nHow big a role will of\nThe surveillance world that we now live in where there's cameras everywhere everything is covered a bigger role is that going to play you certainly you think back to the Austin bomber or here in Texas earlier this year you think about the the Boston Marathon bomber a video was very key in those cases\nOh absolutely I think you hit the nail right on the head I mean ... the person who either put these bombed up these locations\nOr or or put them in the mail is a very heavily veiled locations that I think that some of the clues that the investigators neat and then we might even see it ... with let's say facial recognition software so we might see a lot of the new technologies come together just to try to solve each case\nAnd we know already that um because of ah everything from uh nine eleven to even going back to the Unabomber in the nineties a political people uh uh you know prominent targets\nMail rooms at major corporations and media outlets those are already places where there's a lot of security in protocols about handling mail and opening packages is they're really much more security you can add to places that have already been on guard for a long time\nWell not so much really because of the fact that it I Believe the secret service even at the ... the spawn equality and got to\nUh the Clinton residence and the Obama resident so it apparently scenes of the protocols that they ... or ... or the issue that comes down to now is identifying those suspects unfortunately we don't want people to speculate on who is responsible and I know a lot of political talk takes over", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Jack Riccardi", "city": "San Antonio", "day": "24"}
