from thirty six percent in August but there's a divide by opinion by gender the majority of women are more disapproving of the president ABC News chief anchor George Stephanopoulos has more on the upcoming election\nWe've seen it the tremendous rise also in female candidates particularly on the Democratic side and this is I think it'll be the key thing to watching this election if women come out and it kind of numbers we've seen them expressing in this poll right now that is very good news for Democrats Saudi\nArabia is firing back rejecting claims that it's responsible for this suspected death Washington Post journalist ... ... the president is also threatening punishment ABC's Julia McFarlane is at the foreign\nDown in a statement carried on the Saudi Arabian state run news agency the kingdom as it was thought to itself said that it would respond with great action should any political or economic sanctions imposed by the international community\nIs statement also argued that Saudi Arabia was an international and regional dominant flat saying it played a key role in combating extremism and terrorism\nSaudi stocks tumbled today and ties with the U.S strained on ABC's This week treasury secretary Larry Kudlow says he wouldn't go into details on what sanctions the president may take\nA leave what the president says when he says we will take very tough action if they are allegations of Saudi interference prove to be the case\nAt least Seventeen people are confirmed dead ABC's Rob Marcy on always outside Panama City Florida where it's day for a rescue efforts after

News\nAll right just didn't work gardening let's talk for a minute about our friendship stone and soil depot closed today through the winter months they do clothes on Sundays with the exception of the eye can location when they will be open with Christmas Eve ... trees tales starting about this time next but if you can believe that\nBut ah now they're closed a adult older locations but let me tell you what they they are so well stocked on so many things I was over there once again this week I happened to be buying sad this time around for a ... project but I'm In stone a so they pull all the time I don't just talk about him I buy from Jeff nice but a good friend for many many years\nHave watched his business grow because they do it right top quality products in customer satisfaction\nI'm not going to tell you they're perfect but they really really really work hard at bringing you the best all the time great service and great products and if there ever is a problem let me tell you what they'll work hard to make it right but I find most of the problems that occur is when people don't know what they're ordering they the [laughter]\nIt's if you don't have any fruit to start with I don't think it's worth bringing them in my opinion 'cause you have to keep the greenhouse so warm that is going to be\nYou know kind of economically feasible if you already have fruit on your tomatoes\nI leave him outside as long as you can and then perhaps bring those plants in if we do get an early freeze but\nUh if you're not looking at fruit on I'm already I'm going to switch my emphasis to broccoli cauliflower and snow peas and\nCarrots and ... and all the other things that you can plant this time of year it this was just a bad year um fall tomatoes and I I Do encourage people to plant tomatoes for fall and most years we get a pretty good fault crop but ah do you have fruit on your plants now or are they just screamed plant sitting there\nNo other good size beautiful look in a four foot tall or so and and ah and yeah I was not going to have a green house I was just open the natural sun and get a little bit warmer than it is\nWell it would it will keep them alive but you're still not going to get much fruit because the nighttime temperatures need to be up I'm all close to Seventy degrees mid to upper sixties now you have any cherry tomatoes Viet son goals we one hundred Juliet or\nUm those will go ahead and said some fruit is probably worth protecting them but you're bigger fruit and tomatoes you're slicing tomatoes are you going to go to an awful lot of effort for very little return um so I had to get us up to you if you have to space if you\nUh it's just I don't know I'm [laughter]\nI don't have enough hours in the day to get done a fraction of what I really want to get done and so I'm not going to be harsh long tomato plants that are going to give me anything for my effort\nAlright as I say now you're saying question for either what's ah what's not to do list or than August Eighth and bugs and we and fertilizer\nWell bugs are not really much of an issue this time of year um you definitely should do a fall fertilizing with any good organic fertilizer it doesn't have to say whether riser we use the same fertilizers spring and fall when we're\nI'm In the organic business but any good fertilizer will be a good idea the other thing that will really help you is a a thin layer compost over the yard I don't know anything that works better to suppress weeds\nAnd encourage good strong growth next spring quarter to half an inch layer of compost over you're saying Augustine and that should be all you need to do now unfortunately the weather conditions have been absolutely perfect for brown patch fungus but\nGood organic St Augustine that's been in for a while news going to be resistant to brown patch fungus\nNewly planted or stress St Augustine\nI'm going to tell you to put out some corn meal on a preventive basis preventive writes about ten pounds per thousand square feet curative rages about Fifteen pounds for a thousand square feet\nBut uh I'm going to tell you that it's optional for you I Would do the fertilizing I Do the compost if you're able and keep an eye out for ground patch it may show up because of weather conditions have been\nMore perfect for the shirt and they have any time in the past ten or Fifteen Years so it's something we all need to be watching for\nOkay and what numbers on fertilizer your three numbers\nForget about numbers forget about numbers here here's the deal Tony I'm Glad you asked that question\nUm numbers on the fertilizer label tell you how much nitrogen is in there but when you're looking at synthetic fertilizers\n... you know most of that nitrogen is not going to be used by the plant said that has nothing that binds it to the soil is in the form of what we call in and I and it has a negative charge to it it does not blind to the soil and Ninety percent of it probably washes away so if you had a Nineteen five nine\nYou're going to be lucky if you're playing ski at one point nine percent instead of Nineteen percent\nWhen you're looking at an organic fertilizer or your nutrients are and what we call ... state and they bind to the soil and if that bag is four percent nitrogen your plants are going to get all four percent if it's as six percent nitrogen they're going to get all six percent\nA but it I just don't pay a lot of attention to the numbers because they don't tell the whole story um it it it all involves in a you know it all revolves around\nWhat's the what actually ... state\nUh the nitrogen especially is and we don't want my trade I mean it's that's very water soluble goes way in a hurry we want to have an article compounds\nAnd I just don't even look at the numbers anymore because even though organic products are much lower analysis your plants actually get more nutrient because he had a hundred percent of the nitrogen instead of a very small percentage like you do and you're synthetic fertilizers makes sense\nThat yes indeed yes and that's something I never known\nSo appreciate ...\nCome to some of my seminars when you get a chance his kind of things a lot easier to diagram on a blackboard\nAnd or the synthetic nitrogen also increases the risk of brown patch that Ninety percent that dissolves and goes away causes immense pollution issues or\nDownstream is the reason we have all these what we called dead areas dead zones where the rivers of the world under the oceans of the world outside the Mississippi Delta you know there there are thousands of square miles virtually devoid of marine life\nAnd is not pesticides washing down the river it's usually for nitrates them phosphates washing down the river\nIt's gotten so bad that uh this past year I think the governor in North Carolina was begging the farmers to cut back on their synthetic fertilizer use because those ruining the fishing and things off shore for the reverse a dump into the ocean so\nAh we could talk for a long time about all the reasons that you're better off school and organic on your fertilizers\n... thank you so much we've got a nice rain out here in Marion so uh we'll sit\nAnd I was saying do you enjoy it at this time a couple of days your value maybe putting a log on to fire it's hard to believe I was just thinking this you know really

[laughter] well that's probably why you ought to skip\nBroccoli cauliflower cabbage those things are very good I especially like broccoli because it not only allows you to cut that set her head but most broccoli varieties will go on making little side shoots for quite some time after\nYou harvest the center head out foreign cabbage you know which you harvest once you might as well poll the plant something plant something else in their broccoli continues to produce so there's always gonna be a role broccoli ...\nYeah it's been a while that slight gardens and dead for a long time so I just did some stuff this summer and so now I'm hoping to do a little bit of um twelve\nAre named ... able to do so because there's a lot of fun and very productive\nLook yes okay well great thank you so much\nIt's always a pleasure to have a great send me and I will move on top to Cody ...\nWar to morning sir I'm\nTelling you the Florida and about a country okay\nI've got a several varieties out here by again uh-huh\nAnd one in particular it's a native it's got about a thirty and it's based on the tree okay a and there's four main trunk coming out of that two of them are dead I mean like\nRotted falling off so all lies foliage is on one half of the tree right now All right sir\nIs that tree are gone or you think it's got a a bunch of mushrooms grown out of it\nAre the something I can do to try to say are the shell fungi growing out of the healthy side or the dead side of the very the dead side\nYeah see that's that's normal that that little shell fungus as we call it is a breaking down dead wood that is in there\nIt's you know pecan suffer very much from the drought saw that tree could have taken a lightning strike that uh you know really did severe damage to one side of the tree and not the other\nI'm not as worried about the health of the tree is I Am the structural integrity of the tree if this trees out on the field I wouldn't do anything other than just you know take the dead wood out or make pretty good firewood sweater\nBut if that is tree is in a place that if it fell if it's going to tear up a home or vehicles or pose a threat to humans or animals\nI get a good Arbor is to take a look at it I was talking to my friend David von and he was saying that one of the things that are British do a lot of what they call risk assessment\nAnd you don't want some guy that just you know she's just learned just gotten started with doing it you want somebody with a lot of experience and a a good Arbor as you can take a look at that and perhaps\nAh they may suggest taking a little bit of weight off of part of the tree just so it's not quite so prone to damage in a storm but uh\nUm I it that's a cold you're gonna have\nTo make and like I say if it's a high risk area man out of have that guy out tomorrow with a you know the winter weather storms things moving in if it's in a place where if it fell over you know it's just that much more firewood I'm I'm not going to be super concerned about it\nOkay and then uh as far as the rest of 'em I've got about ten here around the house should I be doing like a compost tea in you know the area or ...\nCertainly not going to hurt anything I certainly would be looking to be sure you've got good routes lawyer exposure\nOn those other trees but ah other than that they you know ... there are native there are a state tree because they are one of the most durable long lived productive trees out there and um so they're going to do reasonably well for you regardless of what you do for them\nWhile I was something that someone mentioned they said it's expensive and it's a big mess but they pull up all that stuff well and then treat them on but it may not then you know what is this stone depot 'cause I'm going to use that as\nWell there is the company's call stone and soil depot they have an area that's or they have a location that's out on I ... in a just a little ways this side of Bernie so\nIt's closer than having to fight the traffic and drive all the way in the San Antonio yeah but in all honesty it it just depends on the area\nI tend to use the pattern concrete more uh the the polymer the liquid material which you know which it's kind of like a a flexible blue\nIn effect is more expensive but in some cases it may be the better choice but uh if you're coming into town sometimes I buy stone as well depot this time of year yeah they're open Monday through Saturday and they've had a lot\nOf experience with it and and that's where I buy my decay granted yeah\nI'm On if it's flat it doesn't it doesn't it's pretty slash\nWell if you want to stabilize it again it's work it takes strength it takes a wheelbarrow to shovel but it doesn't take an I.

N E R T eh thinking is Boehner lumber and I do have to say that they have good quality tanks time a big supporter and ... ...\nYeah I needed to I Need to I'm not going to climb up there anymore I\nI don't have a ladder installed they can't get on the you know I'm sure quieter I so I have to live against the same time up there and it only takes ten Fifteen minutes to clean that bachelor out but oh lord I just thought you know I'm going to get someone to get this now for me\nWell you might and I say ...\nYeah there's a bit of a lake when I turn on the um [noise] I I had to leave\nIt off until I Need it that I did on I think\nProbably any well service company is going to be a is going to be more likely to get the kinds of service\nIf you were Bernie I'd be sending you to a ... sons but you've got some uh you've got some good well drillers up there you could probably call your ground water district office yeah and they could recommend a a good job or up there that could help with your with your storage tanks fabulous\n... when I tuned in about an hour ago you're talking about a siege by for this area and good seats we only have ... we had one place where you can buy seeds has died\nThere she could write down there's been nothing in the way of organic is really into full ...\nYeah with a friendly natives up there will have some things\nBut I'm now for feels seeds for good native grass seed and things Douglas King seed here in San Antonio will actually shipped to your door as far as buying package she GM for gardens yeah try troll ... is a ice hardware over there and he probably\nWill have as good a selection is anybody in the area okay\nTell him I said hello I run into him our earlier this week a little get together and ah they don't pay he's not perfect but he's trying to do it a good job of representing a center at Austin so a good gotta support\nYeah they are nice in there I like him a lot she thanks so much\nAlways a pleasure every day you didn't say thank you that um I go by All right let's see here cliff is up next door in a class\nThat bought in love Marta sir I just said the question about some great Myrtle they are\nI guess throughout the cars press cook all equally and get a little bit of rain and they're all starting to grow outgrew the bottom sure and I was just curious if that's something that keeps them from ... at the top\nNo has nothing to do with it a great Myrtle wants to be a big Bush\nGreat models will tolerate drowsy but they're much happier when they get some more moisture and right now they're really happy and they're just putting on a new growth that view like yours is a tree criminal fall that new growth is coming out at the base\nUm if you want a little bit fuller plant and want her to be a multi trunk Bush than just leave it alone but it's a ... at the amount of growth that produces at the base has absolutely nothing to do with the flowers\nAnd we're through a flowering upgrade or just for this year unfortunately so it's it's just up the whether you want to Bush or a tree should make the difference in whether you prune it or not\nMhm so it's a yeah just kind of sit on the porch and watch\nThem grow a man after ... that's what I Do\nIt do it for ... years You're welcome you go by\nAll right you're the second still lose time when we come back David lax and whoever's telling and right now will be my next callers I Will remind you our seminar next week when I'll be teaching is on cruel whether color everything you ever want to know about ... living in panties and Johnny jump ups in\nOh stock and ... says free of charge has nine forty five next Saturday morning over shades your brain next Saturday is also the rainwater revival la ... one day get together up in Austin if you really want to learn a lot see a lot of good suppliers of rain water catchment material\nUh up in Austin in or near Austin and dripping springs that's next Saturday and you get more information on that on line and of course are marketed for all be broadcasting\nNext Saturday morning lungs fun stuff to talk about and will do more of it next hour leave that now where it is on KPSK radio San Antonio Texas\nShelf rant and growing tension over the alleged murder of Washington Post columnist Jim ...

morning Carl good morning Bob one answer\nOr real quick story I don't want to take much your time but\nUh I think you get a kick out of the psychology of maybe three or four years ago and I have this green stuff the take where someone my yard with a little yellow flowers right and I I told you that you said it was horse or and I said well\nMy wife does wants to pull it all up and I said I'm not above that and you're kidding I said well just tell her as wild flowers and\nIt's been a while [laughter]\nIn fact we've got a kick out of that if\nI got to tell you something about the you know but these areas in the winter of course a search word around it looks like a stab at ... with all the dry weather we had a couple of areas that\nWhere it was that was just absolutely barren ground them I thought well that's an do it without all that right is this completely covered with again great\nYeah mother nature's gonna do what she can to keep the soil in place and it's like I say if you would like to call it or if or if you don't like each call Straggler daisy but in any event it sure beats a muddy bare ground that's for sure\nIt sure does and I got a check or that comes back every year or so or any way a real quickly uh I've been faced to doing organic for a number of years I just recently fertilized argues that a pastor girl I was\nOn my grass ... staying but I've noticed or fewer areas where a fairly large or whether grass has got about\nA few degrees are almost yellow and I'm Wondering is there anything else I should do or can do to fix that or do I will\nDo what happens when the soil gets saturated as it is now it literally percolate said brings up a lot of alcohol energy from the ... down in the soil and virtually every body is experiencing some yellow wings some lack of good deep color\nI think the thing that will help it most I you know I'd I'd do good fertilizing is you have but a similar compost especially on the areas that are yellow D is going to do more to turn it around get it back to be in a deep green and you don't choke out weeds and things like that so\nUh composting is the main thing I'm recommending\nA lot of people are putting down iron and nothing wrong with the ... you know ... magic sand or something like that but it's not really gonna change until we get back to a little bit drier weather and I think the the best in the best bang for your money is just a thin layer of compost\nOkay but if if what if you don't put anything on it will it come back\nOr will it will come back I definitely would now has to grow is a liquid and it doesn't last as long as the grand noodles so I think ... probably\n... years I read it out there and I didn't look again but but it wasn't it was a ...\nOkay this is probably going to rain but it was ... yeah you're you're in good shape it's got a lot of iron in it and that is going to carry through the fall\nI don't think there's anything else you have to do again compost is going to do more to uh you know keep the weed free to keep things are really going but his his work and it's not necessarily cheap but uh uh I think you've done everything you have to do if you want to do a little bit more that's what I Would do\nOkay well I sure do appreciate it thank you\nWell it's my pleasure I appreciate the call and we'll talk again Carlos thanks for the call this morning and uh I bring up Laurie now governing Laurie\nHow are you today\nJust another nice and warm day as I said I'm enjoying shorts and tee shirts today and uh it maybe a few more days where we get the big to do that again and might not be till next spring because we're definitely going to take a term for the coup there over the next few days but nothing wrong with that it's October it's time\nYes it is time for that little ... into and\nI got to say that I just heard of that back the or are they is that white chips\nYou know here's the thing about wood chips\nWood chips if they are on the surface they make a good ... they break down slowly the fungi and bacteria that work at a decaying them\nBreaking them down draw their nitrogen from the air I mean our atmosphere is far more nitrogen than it is oxygen even end up on the service I think we'd ships are very good thing to use as a mulch\nWhen you actually incorporate the wood chips into the soil\nOkay two more questions yeah yesterday I so large fetal life guard and while I was finishing up till\n... should I be worried about that you know I\nKnow there are many many kinds of beetles in fact there is a little\nVery innocuous black ... maybe three quarters of an inch long I usually see you know a year I'm seeing ten or twenty of um a day I don't know why they are so prolific probably has something to do with the rain but they're not gonna bother your plants in any way so just ignore them\nOkay next questions just for fun but planet olive tree down here sure\nAbsolutely yeah olive trees um there are many different kinds of olive trees there's a lot to know about olive trees summer Clarke hog cross pollination summer self ... live for thousands of years some live for hundreds of years\nOr if you're gonna plant one tree I'm going to tell you to look for a variety called ... a A R B I. Q. U. E. N. A. I Believe it is a a\nR A RBI our book again yeah\nBut but another another\nYeah another variety to look for is mission mission is a variety of all live that will do well in this area and you know when you get way up in the hill country north of Fredericksburg no I don't think all of us are such a good idea but uh the near hill country an area south of San Antonio\nWhich\nAre about thank you very much I'm Italian and I'll go to plan a couple of Wall Street and I want to send up throughout this seems they sprouts and my family of\nBone on Saturday Night live it up there because the way to save\nHis knee again thanks ... may give I my pleasure alright let's finish up today with John governor John\n... says mom I have a daughter up for the Dallas area uh-huh and and her landscape she's got some of the uh ... you know the ones that make like a cold right you know they're just\nAnd heard needles on hers are turning brown and staying on the tree it's a she probably got five or six of them in\nJail I mean she is a professional landscaper that you know take care of the art sure they used and they use organic uh you know she made him start using our gangster for\nA couple of years now and I was just wondering got any ideas\nWell are these the ones that go real tall\nYeah they well I don't know they're very young trees are probably a ... a foot tall\nOkayed I suspect that they are what are called Italian Cyprus\nAnd in all they are or juniper I'm In all honesty they are not the best plants for the area especially when we get into a really wet time\nUm she should probably have been spray for spider ... we normally control spider my with just liquid seaweed but you\nDon't ... the our our organic guy up in Dallas that I enjoy visiting with every week and just great great great fella and very knowledgeable\nOne of his first book was called plant so the metroplex and his comment about the juniper she said every insect known demand either each or lives in this plant so it it would not have been my choice to\nPlay it up there and I lived in Dallas for quite a number of years in fact my family are among the pioneers of Dallas\nBut um it's they they\nHave ongoing problems in drier whether\nIf they're out and good son there'll be pretty for a number of years and everybody has ever been to Tuscany acts out just has to plant a few Italian Cyprus but at this point I think most of the browning if it's just an overall browning is probably due to spider might damage\nAnd that is easily controlled with liquid seaweed\nUh they are also susceptible to a problem called ... die back and that also will that's where his whole little tips of the branches will be turning brown\nAnd about the only way to fight it is just with good culture I'm Glad or her yard service company is going to organic products but regular organic fertilizing and I'm\nLike I say spring with liquid seaweed and keep\nSome on the dry side be sure she doesn't get carried away with watering because that will cause a lot of problems for all of us when it first\nYeah that is a problem too because they uh they uh they're back a comp against a stone fence to hug and property ... all that way yeah on thinking that might be the the big problem\nThat may be a part of it and in that case tell her don't get carried away with mulching because ... help to keep moisture in the soil in this case she wants to soil to dry out a little bit more what part of Dallas you she and\nShe's in a west lake area\nOkay yeah so she's in pretty good deep black soil which is may or may not green would drain well so yeah I very definitely would work on the drainage issues try to be sure that no water ever stands around there\nAnd be sure that those unit ... different ... of the watering system than or grass\nUm hopefully it was a good company that did the sprinkler systems if not they may need to do some work on them because\nYou're you're shrubbery should always be zoned differently for me to grasp because in most cases it's not going to be need to be water nearly as often as I just want to be sure those juniper stay more on the dry side because that's going to keep Mr pretty said can be for the longest period of time\nOkay Bye bye appreciate you have such a you have a great day\nYou do the same John always glad to hear from you thank you already know by by [noise]\nAll right well

four\nLump sum bumps um lame this you know limping um ... you know a real heavy lame this things if the lame this is more than three days it's reasonable to not only have looked at better X rayed X ray it and as well so\nAnd of course we're getting into the seas and this is truly the change of seasons that you always talk about so really important especially on your neutered Tomcat keep an eye on them if they're going to have urinary tract issues is probably one is going to happen\nWe've had two already this really guess already and um they both have gone home they both did well but uh it was a long haul in a way so they were they were blocked and so\nSo again it's about for some reason it's the cool weather it can be in like in some cases it can be what food you're feeding or you switch food maybe we're on a urinary diet and then he went to a regular diet and then sometimes those cats will build up a lot of crystals mucus and their bladder and in a male cat that it's easy for them to block guts and\nBecause of the opening is so small and yes and it can be come life threatening very quickly so if you see that if you see your male cat struggling at the box going back frequently need to get object out her even if it means go on to the emergency clinic because uh you just you don't want to let that go on because the\nLonger you wait longer it's gonna take for him to recover and hopefully they will recover so catch it early yes what else is going on in the clinic these days\nThere's well there's lots of things and we'll probably at some point talk about paying for ties and cats we've seen a lot of hot spots mhm I saw some uh some ...\nHair loss case and the cat a couple of days ago that was interesting because it responds to steroids but you don't want to just keep it on steroids for Lawson\nThere's things that we talked about um what we would do for that including ... cold laser therapy um we talked about we say we have to a couple of sick birds and the clinic that this at this time and one of the birds has clubs yelling pneumonia it's an older ... and so it but it has a pretty severe bacterial infection\nLots of action going on [laughter] oh yeah lots of aging and Jerry activist ... syndrome we said we had to in a row two Golden's really old and ... and they both went on the same day but one came in much worse than the other\nAnd this is where they're unable to walk there and there\nHave vertigo to ... to the nth degree their eyes are switching back and forth can't walk there can't use their legs and\nYou know it's there most of these are older so one one of the Golden's had hip dysplasia really badly so that made it worse because not only can they not walk with the hips you know if their hips are hurting and then you have that on top of it\nMakes it very difficult to walk so it was a struggle for that one but did go home and basically it's an inner ear problem it's an inner ear middle ear problem cranial nerve number eight something nobody knows what the causes nobody knows still know even if you did MRI's cat scans and all that you're not going to find out the costs\nBut but there's there's a thought that the lack of\nOxygen to that area causes a problem maybe it could be a stroke like thing but nothing's ever been seen ... was a drug that we had around a hundred years ago and it worked pretty well for it but they took it off the market so so we just use a little steroids first day\nAntibiotics to cover and we also make sure we alter sound and make sure they have nothing else going on no other tumors in fact one of the Golden's did have a tumor\nSo that might be added up that could yes it was actually on the front of the chest and then the um [noise] and so in the things we have to look for other causes but a lot of times you you find no other\nThing that's triggering it but then you know we we usually will if we can get 'em through it the first episode is usually you can get those dogs or it it may take two days it may take seven days just depends on the\nEnd is one of those you know I I really enjoyed fact we're talking so much more about CBD Oil these days yes and that's a whole subject in and of itself but it's a it sure is helping a lot of animals out there\nAnd them at many many ways and I've talked to a lot of veterinarians that a vast you know they were kind of concerned about using it in terms of the state laws and all that stuff but but ah it's worked in many ways\nAnd it's still important somebody wants to try this for will talk to your bed about it they'd be sure you know the source because\nYou've told me that there's a lot of variation quality out there you need to get something that is tested that you know the amount of active ingredient is in there and you want to be real careful where you get your CBD Oil but dogs and cats both it's ah I Know it certainly helped in your practice\nAnd the and the carrier agent whether it's coconut oil or something else that's important to third\nAnd then this one is the lucky one I Would probably stay away from it if I wouldn't just applied over and over again because you know you continue to irritate the skin is not good for that cat the cat you know they're sensitive and so um and yet we worry about heart worm we do but I\nI Am your your constantly cause us or if it's if it causes one other them putting it on the back hips than trying a half a dose and seeing if it's causes a problem that's the only thing I Know I Would try before I quit completely\nSo maybe I ought to try and half the day right up near the where the talent that target right above\nThe tail uh-huh mhm okay and just a little bit just tried this test the waters you don't need to be put in the whole thing on there\nNow you know the casket and look at it\nOr not really about marriage is putting a little bit on there you're not putting a lot you're just asking them water that's all and network I've tried I've done it already so I can tell you I've done it before more than once but but not all cats react obviously and so but if it does the ... don't\nDon't use it just don't use it as it's one of those things that you're just limited as to what you can do\nAnd uh I if I had something that I had to put on my skin all the time and it causes sore every time I did it I think I'd stop\nYou know what about something or or\nUm well they make oral products but um I think they have an oral comfort is where I Believe I don't know if they have an oral next quarter not and you could do those but you have to ask you a veterinarian so okay so\nIs there a heart guard or a certain other heart worm treatment for cancerous revolutions in the midst\nOf revolution do best but they have heart card and you can eat it hard

in the show about a fun place for your puppy dogs in that camp out while\nAbout well you know takes care of your dogs a large medium small young you know they take care of all of them and they'll take good care of them and they they um they do like to have something called a socialization interview first because they want to know about your pet and you would drop your pet off for a couple of hours or so and they would work with a camp counselor\nNo charge for the socialization interview and once you pat has passed in most dogs do want your dog is passed a the socialization interview process it's really simple to drop I'm all for an afternoon for a weekend for the longer stay\nAnd you just know that your dog's going to get the care they need they're going to be with somebody who monitors them closely they going to get to play with other dogs if that's what they choose to do what's right for socialization as well as for exercise we love the saying that attire dog is a good\nArea and ... and then they really they they get plenty of exercise they have fun lots of clients to do that\nAnd they um you know the other thing is that we like courses that that they're training they can have board and train where they're boarding and getting training everyday orange plane train for the day but they are getting training and the dogs don't know it and you're at work and you can't you know you can't get home in time to train him at home sometimes\nBut they're helping you get that accomplished\nAnd well trained dog it's a pleasure to have around a dog that is not trained well can

give them a call if you have questions\nA to six nine six men [noise]\nAll right well you're going to get back to the phone lines okay we've got Sarah and Deborah and asked her waiting only got about twenty minutes left in the shows they ask you ladies to get your question fairly quickly if we can and we start with a punch that a little bit harder good morning scarier isn't as Dr Kirby\nCan lining our cat here about fourteen year old and she is scratching a lot um\n... right here and also on your knee turned out\nOkay I'm an indoor outdoor she ...\nShe's an indoor and she does not like to travel the that it's just hard for her and I understand there's something I can do for her I'm without doing that\nWell first of all you know she's indoor only do you put anything on her at all\nI have not get anything just because she um she just gets upset\nThat she was hideous you know most cats are they don't like anything on them or is she clean\nShe's very clean okay so and uh what do you feed her\nScience diet okay she has a French kiss stomach so I I use their plans\nFor okay good and then do you when you look at the skin under the chin and in the ear or whatever you can see for me or do you see any redness\nAnd you know I don't see anything that's just catch it very clean there's just nothing there she doesn't watch any hair she used to be a big cat that she you know because of her age lost a lot of weight and other than that she's I mean she's healthy\nUm issue and she's eating well normal stools normal urine or nothing and you wouldn't say that her weight loss is um accentuated like it happened just recently quickly\n[noise] no it's been over the years the odd thing she does she tends to chew on things\nAnd it's kind of an extended that Assad was gonna say that's not on dateline lots and lots of cats like balloons are like rubber they like rubber bands\nThey like plastic they have little ...\nThere was a fiber I don't know what that is that any rags or tell us I have she loved to chairman\nAnd that's been the whole time she's been with yes okay so and and when you look have you looked inside her mouth\nI had not which he let you have a ... and that would be just the cold\n[laughter] 'cause usually what we would do if ... if the cat is rubbing at their face we're going to check their ears very well we're going to check their face and we're going to check their mouth to make sure there's not something bothering them inside the mouth like a to Z because that can happen\nI Would have the dog coming from there without a tick profile and would have had a fungal profile yes just just almost naturally\nAnd those can be things that may or may not show up but long term might show up in his real good catch them early and get them under your belt [noise] All right well let's finish up her calls today with Esther you're born and Esther erasing it Dr Kirby\n[noise] um Hi good morning I what's going on\nUm well I I just I I just I guess they just have a technical question and I have a Thirteen year old shit is\nUm she's guy she's like ALS um like some kind of nice to just lay it wasn't\nA ... foot ... and ... get infection under her chance sure around her lack of color area I'm Kay um she's on clocks mhm um\nAnd she had been courting I was just curious because I work in a clinic I handle I handle that result uh at at a at a children's clinic yup I'm now usually for people I usually don't see that and that a lot can still in her penicillin medication to treat skin infections\nBecause a lot of a lot of the ... at this place that I've seen at work yeah um are caused by a staff that is written that normally resistant to kind of filling\nAnd that's true sometimes um I Would have probably put that dog one class of ... foreign\nYeah that's what I Would have done and then I Would have made sure we ... that you're probably Thirteen is that correct\nYes yeah so one of the ... what's her name creating this credit\nCrumpet well was Crumpet Thirteen Years old with a crusty chin and things like that are probably scrape that area to make sure there's no Maine's 'cause it it at ten thirty tend to Thirteen fourteen years old and they cheat Susan they sometimes can get the ... not\nCatching from somewhere else but because our immune system is not as strong making it can come out from having had it just in the system\nYou make sure that but if it's responding that's fine but uh you scrape it you make sure there's no mange you um make sure there is no east because they do these dogs are prone to east as well and then um and then of course I'm a good antibiotic could be several is Warren says election and then I Would probably give them a good\nMedicated bath and I might trim their hair around those areas that are affected them that if\nThey did trim the tree the hair and then I gave my sister had a good at that and that is it a chance to to the theater and\nYou know you know what shampoo they gave you I cannot unfortunately I didn't see the ADL\nOkay you don't have a flea collar or anything like that on her to you all\nKnow we use ... good okay and so you're using ... three three month stuff\nYes sir okay and why did you go to Rebecca versus like just the monthly fleet control\nOnly as productive just because it's more convenient uh-huh ticket to get the ... um I get it to my Jack russell is low and I don't I haven't experienced any kind of issues okay what do we give her heart guard because she has been very positive and the pastor she gets hurt card every month right\nFor heart whereas they ever that productive every three months\nOkay and you haven't seen any side effects or anything\nElse can we give it to give it to ... and she we haven't noticed any any stomach as she is a metal\nAnd knew how to do it on different you do it on different days you don't do it at the same time\nHe yelled at how I found out twelve weeks very clean and how good are unlike ever I gave it to her on not on that last week\nGood good well just um keep in touch with me on that but that that it ... probably ... it can work but it's not as well as I Would think with stuff like some and and you're correct in the fact that we see a lot of skin infections are ear infections that used to I wouldn't even\nI wouldn't even culture I Would treat them with an antibiotics and and shampoos and they'd go away this was a long time ago now yeah I Know I have to culture those I just saw an ear on Saturday\nThat was just raw and so I immediately cultured I didn't even think twice about it because we know this is probably going to be a pseudo ... can be resistant to everything\nOh yeah I I'm ... probably see a lot of that don't you get at working at the children's clinic yet ... says it's just it's all commonality yeah they don't they don't that I don't see him off the spelling or or lock sick lobbies anymore\nNo they're probably use and I guess they're probably use and triple sofa and Clinton ... and things like that for you\nOh yeah yes that's getting your Catholic they actually are seeing a thing or the state to that trend that the principal us\nYeah and that and I'm okay with that actually for this office I don't I don't like very much because they're tough on the kidneys and all that so I you know I'm with it and you know a long time ago in the eighties we use ... and then\nThey kind of went by the wayside and we used ... and then it went by the wayside but now Dr cycling has made a resurgence of works pretty good for something like that and so there's just all those things that I think about the\n... makes people very sensitive to son has that same in animals would\nIt would but most dogs and you know they're not really out and they have a pretty good hair coat you know yeah yeah so I I Know you're probably probably does except for the shaved areas\nAnd she has a pretty good here coat and she she is she that apartment puppy style she gets probably in total thirty that's Fifteen minutes of walking time ... says she's not outlook\nOn ... ... a real good apartment sized dog by sure is that right oh yeah the last ... the the pleasure keep is posted on how she does and give us a call back to the doctor Herbie can help\nThank you I Will thank you calculate their by thank you I I get ... seconds here to wrap up the show\nWhere we did it again I mentioned earlier we saw a we were going to talk about pain criticizing it takes too long to talk about that maybe will sort of shrouded next we met because that's a big one that's a big one is kinda quiescent and then um but it sell a lot of hot spots and we're seeing a lot of hot spots in labs on the side of their face\nAnd Golden's as well but they're tough to get rid of those because they get them on the side of the face and they just keep working on with their pads\nAnd a you have to keep them clean lots of ... the early yeah you really do have to work on them so\nShaven a little bit where he shame a little bit and we try to be careful about shaving and too much because you you irritated that way but some don't respond I mean given shots Darren antibiotic and they'll still sit there and scratch and they get deep so it's kind of like a pile German infection within the skin sometimes as well just stay after him and and make sure you don't let him get too far out of hand\nAnd electric take care of it don't don't we try and too much stuff off the shelf or if you get some good veterinarian\nHeld him host frog is going to work on that doesn't work and it does work I'm Glad but I suppose it's time to do it\nBut

community\nMedicare is is a family a group of people that stick with you because the hardest times of your life I just don't know how I could have done it with element of sugar\nIt's so worth looking into their the reason is is growing so fast so if you want to find out more here is a number for you\nEight seven seven twenty six Bible that's eight seven seven to six B. I. B. L. E. three people\nAre teaching them how to invest in real estate and then you chose to have some additional education and mentoring with our challenge program and before we went further with your stories for all I wanted to explain what that program is that the challenge program\nIs available for people who want more education and mentoring when you come out of the financial freedom seminar the two day seminar\nYou have at least one year memberships sometimes to to your membership at lifestyles you can go back to that seminar monthly if you like you can watch it on line you can go live across the country but absolutely in Houston Dallas San Antonio and Austin\nAnd you can attended as many times as you want which is an unusual thing there's no additional costs for doing that because we know that people don't chain all that information and they need to go multiple times to build on what they learned last time and learn more and more\nBut typically when you come out of that first weekend you know more than most real estate investors do and you can go out and buy a single family rental or small multi family property five ten units\nAnd you can do what we teach coming out of that but if you want more help locating properties if you want more help with the hands on mentoring that we do stepping you through the process\nThan the challenge program is our single family program and of course that's your baby sir I'll write in Houston you are you are one of three mentors there\nAnd so why don't you tell us a little bit more about your story and what retirement it's been like for you and why why are mentoring a when you could just be sitting on a beach or on a boat somewhere like you did recently\nAnd that that tell us a little bit about you know your experience with mentoring\nYes well I I uh I order the travel business for the last two years I Love to travel up suit or all of a ... you know about it because the motions or overlooked people in cultures I Love the U.S let's just huge part of my life\nAnd my last job and then when I retired\nI was talking about a year or I\nWatch the whole I traveled a lot and but the the ... the word webs able to retire was rudimentary I\nKnew nothing about real estate investing and the people who walked me through helped me\nGet to where I was able to retire during that period so when the opportunity to stand up I was happy to come back and get back to that should help other people do but but\nBut you know does modeling is not the money is lifestyle and I enjoy the will to continue to live a lifestyle and what you just mentioned or what I was really did I\nI'm In the position that I can make sure that there are a lot of my mind that trying it helping people by boat and by email\nAnd I can do that from anywhere recently took a trip to Greece but\nWith my close friends with charter boat for the week properly or some of the smaller group guy but I was able to respond to or smell in the middle but he can take like cold this members while I was on a sailboat are sitting on a lot of other groups\nSo that's kind of combining both worlds like help people get to the to their financial freedom go and I guess we're going to live a lifestyle while I'm doing that\n[noise] you know and that's that's the interesting thing about people think about retirement and everybody's got a different picture in their head but\nMost people that I talked to view retirement as not working\nAnd if you talk to people who have retired oftentimes they'll tell you about ... seems like two three months it's not very long after retiring they're bored and they don't know what to do with themselves and you might hear them say that their spouse can't wait for them to find a hobby that takes him out of the house [laughter]\nIll too much time together or whatever and ah and then other people who who loves spending their time together but they they want to have a purpose\nAnd what you and I both have been able to do is have that wonderful blend where I asked people all the time and my working our plane right here in front of you\nAm I working or playing do you know 'cause I don't [laughter]\nAnd it's a it's
