and yeah I mean if\nIf you are structurally set up to send people into another country illegally because that benefits view um that is entirely affair matter too\nOver which to negotiate foreign aid

you think\nA wall so I just wanted to comment a little bit revert this little bit back to the at the border wall um I was in the army or\nLast year and a and two thousand six you can get a date yet north mission where we went down to the actual border of Arizona in Mexico\nAre and what exists there is actually just\nMiles and miles of desert but really the border is not even a fence there it's just it looks like a guard rail pretty much and essentially we just had to sit in the mountains for days at a time and watch these people come over and then recorded on our radios over the border patrol the border patrol agents would go and I mean I've seen guys that I saw one guy Joe like\nNot even jumped just step over this little guard rail border and lit fires with on the bushes on all these little bushes and then ran back so that that was created as a distraction and then they had an entire a group of drug mules that were right behind us started\nI hear a lot of analysis about this is what's gonna happen this is going to go down and I would think there'd be some humility\nNot trying to tell anybody else wants to do but I've never been very good at predicting these things and after twenty sixteen I Would think everybody would take a step back and and be more cautious but you have a lot of people really trying to predict the exact number of house seats each party will win and the exact makeup party makeup of the Senate and um I I Want to give\nMe some things to think about as to why you should not jump\nOn any of these theories whether you want the the Democrats to have a big night and you're hoping for that and you're looking at the evidence that that's going to happen or you want the Republicans to stem that and stop that or the tracks and you look only at the evidence that suggests that that's going to happen I'm kind of a couple of things to think about here coming up\nI'm a case of the essay and we were talking about a Senator Warren\n[noise] I'm\nJust as a little background she worked as a uh she worked her way up through academia to Harvard law school and and he stopped she played up and ah called attention to her alleged minority\nStatus because that's how the game is played we talked about this yesterday because diversity has become not just a virtue but the virtue\nAnd it's an artificial standard because if you are going into a for a brain operation you wouldn't say well wait a minute wait a minute before you guys give me the anesthesia\nUm is this a diverse\nOperating room\nI think you would just hope that you had the best surgeon and the best nurses and the best anesthesiologist than that everybody was at the top of their game and and as doing as good as they could do and I don't think he would care if they were all white or all anything\nBut she was playing the game that is played and um\nEven if she had discovered later on that that was that her claim was false\nOr it would have been hard to climb down from that it would have made a lie out of her academic career now I don't know what will happen to her politically I hear people saying oh this is it for her she's dead in the water now listen I I I don't know about that um [laughter]\nI've seen so many people get away with being exposed as frauds and liars and still as embarrassing as it is they still win elections\nDa Nang Dick Blumenthal is one example but there's many so\nI I'm sure that if she ran against President Trump he would torture her with it and I'm sure that our other democratic opponents would tweak or with it but I don't know if voters will accept this or not I I don't I don't pretend to say that I I Know what they will do and and won't do\nI mean Massachusetts voters accepted it but you know that's the kind of an outlier state maybe this is a moment to just stop separating Americans by race\nMaybe this is a moment that shows how ridiculous that really is how pointless that really is like if I have to prove it by DNA if that's the proof\nThen ... what am I proving what's the point\nIf I have to say that tens of generations ago I had an ancestor and therefore I should be treated differently or therefore I should be hired over in

hold a national number down of course and what these congressional race the same thing don't get caught up in the math\nBecause each one of these districts is a separate election is a separate race yeah we have a tendency to nationalize these things in the sense that um the ads and the politicians tend to frame them\nThere's this one house and yeah the windows are gone and there's damage to the house but the house is standing there nothing around it is still standing [noise] and it turns out there's a story\nOr behind that the house was built\nBy a a doctor LeBron lackey is his name and um he lives in Tennessee and has a vacation place on Mexico beach in Mexico Beach Florida and he decided to build a house that would be hurricane\nProof up to now get this ... the winds for Michael at category for where around a hundred and fifty five miles per hour\nThis house is built to withstand two hundred and fifty mile an hour\nWinds and I'm a basically spirit no expense\nSo the goal was to just go overboard to over engineer at to over build it and they put concrete everywhere they could all of the corners of the house or separate are ... are are supported by concrete columns\nAnd um they added one foot thick concrete walls they added these super thick steel cables just to hold the roof in place [laughter]\nI'm Wondering what the inside of the house looks like it must like like I was like like a like a crash element inside I don't know um they built the ground floor a out of these tall pilings and elevated the house above it ah so the ground structure\nUm would ah give way\nIn other words the floor was meant to give out in the storm surge and it did\nHe said they were watching he was in Tennessee and his fulltime house or his main house I guess I'm he was in Tennessee watching the surveillance cameras he had all around as property and he said the ruthless flapping like a wing but it stayed on\nAnd I I admire the engineering I mean this is an incredible story but then I Wonder\n... what's the point like your house is still standing but you can't live there there's nothing around I mean I I'm an introvert but you're talking about having no neighbors there's nothing left\nAnd so if you went back there you would go back to their their there wouldn't be any stores there wouldn't be a gas station\nSo until they until they put it all back I'm not sure what the point was but they prove that it could be done [noise] and um and he says regardless of the price it was totally worth\nAre doing but if you're wondering when you saw that picture and it was very striking this one house is upright and intact\nAnd everything around it as either completely wiped out or you know tipped over on its side that's why and\nI don't know if that will become something people copier emulate or if it's worth doing that I'm sure the house is going to need a tremendous amount of work is like I said the doors are gone the windows are gone some siding has gone from roofing is gone of course everything in the house is probably the last the ... the the ground floor is\nGone but you can say the house is still\nStill standing it's it it can be done to ten five nine

that way um\nSo somebody could be you know hot to trot for you and still be our romantic meaning they just want that\nEncounter nothing else that goes with it and I guess\nOn the other hand a person could be a sexual but still want to be in a relationship but they would have to just make it clear that the relationship could not progress to the point of sex\nI'm\nIs anybody truly how romantic couldn't be at\nAt a ... couldn't you made a certain time in your life you could be our romantic like you just got divorced or you just ... had a really bad breakup or\nYou've been dating and you're

words when you make this claim there is a there is a a\nA threshold that is widely accepted\nUm and if you make this claim and you're making it falsely what is it due to the whole enterprise of affirmative action we are talking about all that right now with a professor bill ... is a professor of law at St Mary's University School of law and on our K TSA window world news maker line and\nProfessor good morning to you I Know that you actually been researching and writing about this for a while now\nI have to check and thank you once again for having me up\nOr what what what's the genesis of your interest in the whole issue of claiming of a person claiming Indian heritage\nOkay I've been a a legal educator for forty years I teach constitutional law I've been interested in writing on issues relating to race discrimination affirmative action in the like and over the last couple of years I've been writing on the issue of\nIndian preferences and a recognition of of Indians and Native Americans in the United states\nAnd so I've had a chance to take a look at the statutes in the law that actually defines who is eligible to claim Indian preference and I can say unequivocally for the reasons I explain Elizabeth Warren is not an Indian and as an attorney she no she is not an Indian and not entitled to make that quite\nSo what is the what is the threshold or what is the number that she fails to hit\nOkay to be recognized as an Indian in the United states you have to belong to a federally recognized Indian tribes there is a federal statute federally recognized Indian tribe list act\nOf Nineteen Ninety four or the department of the interior has this process where they have recognized existing tribes there's even a mechanism\nAnd you are not new tries to they have to show they've been in existence since before Nineteen hundred but there's a mechanism work groups who claimed to be Native American tribes can make a claim\nAnd have the federal government process at the federal government has recognized about five hundred try a little more than that in the United states and Alaska to be considered Indian\nBy the federal government you have to belong to one of those tribes that tries to get to set their own membership requirements and they all have some type of vi of fractional interest of of Indian is a\nBut it's generally much\nMuch greater than the one sixty fourth that Elizabeth Warren is playing I Know some tribes that allow one sixteenth or more\nHow to deal with that background to apply for membership but the bottom line is the Cherokee Nation is they recognized tribe Elizabeth Warren does not belong to that tribe could not enroll in that trial because she has such a tiny fraction of your blood\nAnd so she is not by any legal stretch of the imagination she is not an India as an attorney she knows she's not an end to make that claim is false\nOne of her ah one of her arguing or talking points is her submission of a recipe to a a cook book that was a compendium of Native American family\nRecipes are two things one she plagiarize the recipe from a a French cookbook a but number two she listed herself as Elizabeth Warren comma Cherokee so she claimed membership in that tribe or citizenship in that tribe which as you said she knows\nShe does not have she no she doesn't have it and it's very demeaning to charities and to Native Americans okay so we all know the history that the uh Indians in this country have have endured\nThe United states has set up a government to government relationship with these

forty four forty nine thirty Jew from Enrique custom vision give them a call today [noise]\nPast Sean coming up at four O. five continue fallout from Elizabeth Warren DNA test yeah Hi yes\nWe'll talk about it on his art by fifty K. TSA an hour and a half ... seven ...\nSeven fifty five five fifty K. TSA I found one o seven one K. TSE so um [noise]\nOne of the things we've learned about [noise]\nI guess you would say heredity with this whole Elizabeth Warren story is that\nThe average American the average white American has more a Native American ancestry\nThan she does so she's actually whiter than most white people which I think I already knew just by watching her but uh now we have the the the math to back that up and here's here's my point\nI'm at some point maybe the way we stopped classifying each other by race a and\nDistilling benefits are based on race and ethnicity is to recognize that we're all pretty much\nA blend that most of us do not have some sort of totally pure linear a heredity um where are for bearers you know always stayed\nWithin the lines and always stayed within the the tribe or whatever um\nThat we can move past this because we already have because one more forced to check boxes on government forms which by the way is a big part of this problem the fact that the government counts as this way and divides us this way and encourages this identity thinking\nWhen when we do that it's not really entirely true I hesitate every time I have to check one of those boxes because I don't feel like any of those describe what I Know about my family and my background\nI'm it would be goofy to you know check like two of them are three of something but the truth is that most of us do check more than one a box\nSo we might think Elizabeth Warren Sunday a long long time from now we may say thank God that she was as ridiculous as she was and doubled down on the silly claim that her own report disapproves rather than proves because we need to get away from\nA classifying each other we all have some Native American we all have some\nAfrican American we all have some Hispanic we all have a little of is it a little of that and we don't even know and and most people most people who do ancestry dot com or one of those services find out stuff that they were never told\nYou know it's like the telephone game you only know your family history to the degree that people have told you in your family and people don't tell everything they hold stuff back they forget stuff they get wrong information and pass it along\nThe real losers if we ever stop to this box checking would be the politicians because if they didn't have race and ethnicity to divide us of ... that would take a big tool out of their tool box\nAnd so I I can imagine that there are Democrats who were angry and Elizabeth Warren for the distraction this is creating for the\nMixing of the message that they want to present leading up to the mid term election I I I give them that and I I agree she's ridiculous or timing is ridiculous but I I think maybe the real Democratic Party panic\nIs that if she damages the\nTool of affirmative action the tool of identity politics um it will leave them without one of the most useful tools that they have\nShe has really made not only her claim ridiculous but the claim ridiculous and I'm I'm hoping anyway\nThis this is maybe the beginning of something that's bigger than her and obviously also hoping this is the beginning of the end of her being our next president will see [noise]\nDo want to hear from the first thing you're going to have to learn is until you stop expecting politicians for anyone else to change your life your life is going to change the only
