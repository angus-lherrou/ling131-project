red state democratic pickups\nReally get to fifty yes votes today's JR ... uh the business world rocked yesterday by Jeff Bezos announcing that Amazon ah workers both fulltime in Tempe are going to receive a raise to the minimum of Fifteen dollars an hour\nI was\nTelling somebody this yesterday who doesn't follow the news too closely in the you know\nUm and hadn't heard this and it was just stunned silence\nWow\nWell there'll be two stunned because there's a little background to\nThis\nAnd for starters and we talked about it on the show while back Amazon has been in the crosshairs of Bernie Sanders and company a they have been questioning publicly and doing that kind of a you know that kinda thing politicians do that's a nice big company build yourself there be\nA shame if something happened to it like regulations or anti trust so Bernie and the Bernie boroughs were already kind of you know looking in through the front door at Jeff Bezos operation\nUm but there's some things that led up to this ah\nAnd one of them is the advocacy of groups that were\nPushing Amazon to do something that we're highlighting the wage inequality bays is is the richest guy in the country and yet he's got all these people working for him at the you know for next to nothing et cetera et cetera they got very unnerved by that I think\nAnd that's a tactic that because it worked on Amazon will be used on other companies\nBut Amazon is also in a good position to do this because it's a very tight labor market and they're going to need a lot of people they hire a lot of temp people in the fourth quarter every year and we're we go right fourth quarter so at a time when the labor market is tight it's actually advantageous to Amazon\nTo be in the news for this Fifteen dollar an hour a deal\nBut something else people don't talk about with Amazon is that Amazon is one of the leading companies looking into and investing in automation\n\nAnd there are already warehouses\nI Know the Chinese are are big on this to the Chinese are bragging about how they have these vast huge warehouses your big Walmart warehouse up on thirty five way bigger than that they have these huge warehouses and only four people work there\n\nAnd those four people are so far apart they don't even see each other\nIt's all automation it's all robot arms in you know little um railed vehicles that move around and belts and\nThat's that's where this is all going\nSo Amazon is a big time leader and innovator in automation they need fewer people\nTo sell and ship stuff than they did just a couple of years ago and that trend is accelerating and by the way the four people in the Chinese warehouse you know what their job is\nTo take care of the robots they don't they don't handle boxes packages they're just there to fix the robots\nSo um Amazon was under a lot of pressure they were hearing antitrust talk\nUh they've got Elizabeth Warren they've got Bernie Sanders they've got people that are going to run for president in twenty twenty and are going to run against this kind of thing\nOr is that in in most big and medium sized cities there's no shortage\nOf people and if there was if they had the you know really recruit and and convince people to do this work one way they would do that would be up to pay is that true\nYeah and I mean it it [noise]\nI Know people in in in the\nIn particular that\nCycle through every several years because they love the job but they can handle the stuff that they're dealing with with men will pay and terrible insurance\n... but when they get out when I'm told is there's always plenty of people waiting to get in that that is not a of a job where the providers where the companies can't get people to do the work and\nThe training is not to argue as it's not too long to get certified so if somebody wants to do that fairly quickly they can be qualified to do it right\nUh yeah yeah and I feel like that some of the problem I mean I my\nTraining was anywhere between Eighteen months to two years plus a lot of on the job training\nAnd uh and I\nKept out I I don't do cats game or anything like that I kept that in the high point our a low thirties way what they see I I feel\nLike it's medical feeling ... medical field in general they have enough people to replace run their current employees that they don't particularly care how they're treating their employees\nWhich that it's pretty sad because the truck that trickles down to the patients yeah I ... corridor negativity sketch\nI'm not arguing with you but don't always assumed that what you're paid a is an expression of whether people care about you it's not about caring about you is\nIt every every job is going to pay the minimal amount that it can pay to have the kind of people it needs to do that job no employer pays a penny more than they have to\nFor the for the work that that needs to be done that is true of anything and I I I'm I'm not sure that I mean I I agree with you it's important work and and you know if I'm In a in a wreck I certainly want somebody who's well compensated in well trained but you know I I I'm not sure that this isn't just the way that marketplace works you know\nI I agree I agree I really do but my question is how do\nIn their solution to that or do we just accept that that's the change over that these people do what they\nCan for as long as they can and when they give up they've got somebody to replace them quickly\nI don't know what the solution is but I Would be very wary of somebody just deciding oh I'm In a ... I was just elected and I'm going to come in and declare that we now pay these people\nAre X amount of dollars if that if that is an artificially a you know picked out number if that's the number that doesn't make economic sense\nThen yeah people may get that pay but we'll have fewer EMTs a there'll be longer response times and then people will complain and say well we don't care how much these folks are being paid we're not getting the services that's\nThat's what will happen or if you try to artificially decree it because some politician wants to make points and that's ... that's unfortunately all too often\nWhat happens now in the ... and thank you for the call jak 'cause I don't I don't know the answer to your question but I think that's part of it\nI'm In the case of Jeff Bezos\nUm it's his company he's free to do this but people need to understand the tremendous political um targeting that was going on as well as there's a little bit of cynicism here because Jeff Bezos has a model\nThat is very very um friendly\nTo being automated whereas a lot of other businesses that is going to take some time and that may never be fully the answer but he's going to be able to mostly automate what today is done mostly with people Giovanni a kitchen designed by Giovanni is calling in on this Giovanni good morning to you\nHow you doing how you doing jak good good I Know you have something to say about this\nA lot to say because I I mean there are some political pressure going on here but it is also really about automation and I think Jeff Bezos played this master fully\nYes he's getting pressure but I mean to think that he's gonna you know really take out on the shareholders is is not gonna happen so they played this on average Amazon's\nHouse guy because really talking about where else\nGet gets paid Thirteen Wal Marts at Seventeen on average so there were people they're going to bring it up as a minimum of Fifteen what they are also is what they've been working on and doing studies on this automation right oh\nIt is great for the headlines now for Amazon they looked like Mary Roach today but tomorrow and I'm not saying by tomorrow but is what they're putting into place in investing their money is is an automation Internet warehouse so those guys that were now making a minimum of Fifteen are not going to have jobs anymore because\nThey're looking good now as far as Amazon is because they played it right but really they were working like okay well we're going to be able to cut that will pay for it now upfront will get a lot of good press for it but we're going to cut it because we're going automation and already working with Honeywell but is that right\nWell I mean so I think there's a reason he has the reputation for being kind of a cut throat a guy I mean the the this is how he's been successful he's always he's always several steps ahead of everybody else\nIs way ahead of it and if you look at like Amazon's benefits package they offer a great benefits package at one of the things they do it they pay for schooling\nTo get you a better educated to get better position than the company if you're in the warehouse overt Amazon getting paid Fifteen minimum now you better start looking at that because you need to get a better educated or else you're going to be finding yourself on the curb run it's going to happen and then the next headline that's going to be art might not even make headlines\nIs gonna be how Amazon is laying people off\nAnd their shareholders are going to be happy because not that they're laying people off but it's better for the bottom line all the automation or the next couple of years will be in place and I don't think they should be putting that on other companies are saying that they should go to fifth game because you know not everyone can automate like they do\nAlthough in our fabrication facility just a small business you're down the road we have the opportunity to automate and you go to a fabrication and honestly when over the last year our small company has looked at it now like how much are we paying employee\nYou know how much is asleep or coughing and should we go to an automated system it's a great point got to hold you there but thanks your money always good to hear from you will keep the conversation going right here right after eleven [noise]\nRe imagined to Alamos one step closer to reality details after ABC News delivered o'clock on ... day ban Antonio [noise]\n[noise]\nI'm ...
