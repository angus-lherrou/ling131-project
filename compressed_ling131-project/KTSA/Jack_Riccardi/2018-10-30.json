thing that's coming as well obviously is going to be more stories are more details about the five thousand two hundred or so troops that are headed down to the border with all the arguments that they are taking a razor wire all the stuff that's\nObviously there's going to be more details about all of that that's going to continue to come out of the day goes on\nAnd sing or recorded we'll be all over the hey good morning I'm On how you doing\nYou know you say there's going to be more detail yeah I don't know when we're going to hear the Milan Idaho and I don't even know if they know yeah well that's the problem I mean I I get the Trump kind of gets these ideas\nAnd he picks up the phone and gives the order but we have a long history in this country of sending troops to the border without giving them\nClear rules of engagement without them knowing what they're there for what they can do\nYou have the secretary of homeland security Nielsen all over the place on this issue the last few days she said they they will be armed they won't be armed they won't shoot they'll shoot if they have to defend themselves but I don't think they'll have to do that but well you know we'll let them know I mean the I don't like the sound of it yeah I don't think they've got it figured out\nWell well no not all of it obviously this tent city thing they don't have any of that figure it out because I think he just through that out\nA last night and all they're doing is moving the problem down to the border because the problem is not gonna change they still have to go through the asylum process and all these all these things instead of going through the asylum process wherever you live whether it's Pittsburgh or New Mexico wherever you're not going to living in a tent until you go through the asylum process it becomes a a processing\nCenter so if we're letting them in now why are we worried about reinforcing the\nBorder with troops was part of the issue isn't it I mean we're letting me know what age are sending troops you're saying we're not opening the door you could knock all you want but you'll be on the other side of the line which is what I thought his position\nWas well if that's what I was here it it got us they're not coming in as what he said right that's what he's really tense then they're coming in ... ... and ... and\nLess as some agreement workout with Mexico that we don't know about that there's going to be on that side we don't know\nThat's part of what you're saying is we just don't know\nI Know they know same thing about the fourteenth amendment we just don't know what he's going to do with a fourteen I Know that either and by the way on that subject this morning we're going to present probably the two leading experts on either side\nOf that issue so one will say he can issued executive order and the other will say he can well there's a real constitutional question as to whether or not a president can issue executive order that overturns an amendment to the constitution\nWell wouldn't overturn the amendment he would say that that this specific interpretation does not apply over the fourteenth amendment was written for a different category of people at a different time well you can't make the argument about time because it's either this is a timeless document or it's a\nYou know dry erase board learned liberals would say right hopefully he's not going to make the argument that it's a living document because then who's who's left defending this thing if Republicans are saying that as well as Democrats\nAnd that's why I said that there's a lot more details that are going to come yeah the same moves forward there's there's more details that have to come because it is not completely cleared up we do know what the Pentagon has said\nAnd with the generals have settled Sean as he talked about quite a bit yesterday and the armaments that they are sending the troops who they are sending and what he knows about it right now in their action right now they're starting a Texas than Arizona and then on to California\nAnd on up from there so we do know that they have somewhat of a framework of a plan that the Pentagon's working from we'll see where it goes from they may have a big plant trade but here's what they I don't think they have\nThere is an individual soldier or there's a a unit out there on the border and

remember what the travel order\nA I said I Believe and a lot of people believe that the president was within his authority whatever whatever you thought of the travel order what are you thought it was good or bad policy\nUm he had the authority to do it and the Supreme Court finally recognized that after it worked its way through a lot of uh delays and a detour as in the federal courts\nI think this will go the same way but I don't predict that the Supreme Court will necessarily think that he can give this order so that's what I think about the order as far as birthright citizenship where do you stand on that\nUm is birthright citizenship a good idea or a bad idea\nIs it an American thing is is is the reason no other country does it because we're like no other country\nOr are we crazy is the president would say to let people have a baby here and just by virtue of being born on this piece of soil versus that piece of soil over there now that baby is a entitled to all of the things\nThat come your way as an American what do you think about that\nAnd and so the question then becomes if you want to change that I I mean if you if you don't want to change that that's all we have to say this is America this is a uniquely American thing but if you want to change that\nCan the president changed by executive order is that what you think or do you believe that we ought to have a whole debate political process\nI I think the Supreme Court might wind up saying look this is for the political process to decide you got to go to Congress you've got to go through them either you've got to you've got to pass a law or you've got to\nAmend the constitution in which case obviously it wouldn't happen anytime soon if it happened at all\nSo the president says he used to believe

Party isn't going to do and I certainly don't see the contemporary Democratic Party being defenders of the constitution not anymore not not right now\nSo it's wrong to do it by executive order 'em and you have to you I think you have to go through the process um what do you think about birthright citizenship itself just the idea that um we would recognize a citizenship by virtue of being born\nOn us soil to ten five nine nine fifty five fifty five\nAnd speaking of US soil [noise]\nWe have the ah stories out today about how many troops are on their way to the border with\nMexico Newsweek dot com says it will be a force of up to fourteen thousand\nUm and that there are seven thousand already there with another seven thousand are ready to go or ... in reserve to to put it in perspective we have about Seventy two hundred soldiers\nFighting ISIS in Iraq and Syria so you have a force roughly equivalent in size certainly not in mission but roughly equivalent in size to what we're fighting ISIS with\nOver there so that the actual strength is somewhere around six thousand seven thousand another seven thousand could be going\nUm according to Newsweek they've looked at the documents for what's called operation faithful patriot\nAnd it says that us troops will carry live ammunition\nAnd the forces will include not only troops but ah all kinds of logistical and support units military dogs linguistics all kinds of other things so that number is obviously including a lot of different specialties a lot of different people\nUm what's the plan once they get their\nSecretary of homeland security Kirstjen Nielsen said the other day that there is no intention to shoot at people in an interview with Fox News that aired last Thursday night\nNielsen or said I'm no intention right now to shoot at people we do not have any intention they will be apprehended however but I also take my officers and agents their own personal safety extraordinarily seriously they do have the ability of course to defend\nThemselves um [noise] I don't really\nWorry so much about the bureaucrats in Washington or the or the top brass\nTheir lawn eighth I'm\nNow on a group that we need to be long multiple doing my my main concern that I have is a\nWhile we think there's definitely a table and incorporate into this a caravan personally I think the ones who are actual refugees should be shot like they're supposed to um possible profit but the once it goes there will not start ... one of those not all had some pot shots at our trips\nWe can't she bought without the risk of hitting an actual woman or child that's it that's what makes us let's super super bad we might have to take the hit yeah we get shots come from the other side is my concern about what is it instructs or something like that can just throw the ball it flies over on those table to anxiety was terminals\nWe've got we've got to think about that really did\nI'm hoping that they've already thought about that I just don't hear anybody saying anything about it so I Wonder\nYeah well that's how I got said like you might concern that's that's a tough call for no good\nGood point thank you on that that's what I mean um if if you believe the baton brace theory than the ... rays are surrounded by human shields\nRight and leaving aside for the moment the fact that this whole thing was politically contrived\nFunded by outside groups trying to interfere with this election leave aside for the moment the fact that yes this ... this is a giant manipulative a you know dart thrown at the [laughter]\nThe Republicans in the midterms but just remember that now you're getting to the point now we're at the border okay now we got real people standing across looking real people what are they actually going to do this isn't a video game this isn't a political discussion what are they actually going to do\nUm and maybe it won't come to that you know Trump said he was going to stop them\nI thought that meant they're not coming in then I heard were building tent cities which I guess means they are coming in but we're not going to let them stay but if you're letting them in your not letting them in there's going to be some kind of confrontation in the next several days\nSomewhere along the border wherever that that caravan ends\nUp when that happens what is it exactly\nWe are going to do or willing to do or are equipped\nTo do\nWhen that moment comes it's going to be some young man or woman wearing the uniform of this country\nUm and they're not going to have Donald Trump\nOr Kirstjen Nielsen or anybody else with them there to tell them we want you to do this or we will not want you to do that that's what I'm Wondering\nTo ten five nine nine fifty five fifty five or jak a K TSA dot com and ... good morning\nMotor a ticket for taking my call sure\nI'm I'm just\nI don't think it's a winner to know whether they're going to be a Pulitzer the rifles or not my my concern is a I heard this morning that\nGets we'll reset up watch the uh some of the care of it people get out get up to the border there will set up your cats when they get processed that doesn't make any sense to me what's uh\nBefore uh there was a lot of talk about turning around right as soon as I step on us soil right so what happened to it\nThat's what I'm Wondering too I don't I don't understand that why do you need tens if you're not let them in\nExactly it's it's the same thing all over isn't that works or Obama was on except it was ... an amount of it into the country\nWell it's the same thing we did last year but the problem with the tense is once they're in the tense then the story becomes the tense aren't good enough uh there's not enough food the children are being separated from the parents are in other words this is a Trump and the Republicans playing or by the other teams rules again\nUh it'll never be good enough it'll never be humane enough no I I think you're right I I think I'm Wondering the same thing and retake Jason's on K TSA Jason good morning\n... act I think they're so I called back ... ... ... there are a lot of not show liar and a ferret

college and some of that I think the military in a support role\nWhile we're doing that now is already military down there in a support role\nBut they don't have five thousand come and uh yeah so I I I look up much what's going on\n\nBut beyond that confusion right you understand what you're saying the confusion where ... ... on the one hand you're saying uh we're only going to let a legitimate ones in and only a for a short time and we're only going to augment the border patrol boat then why do we need fourteen thousand\nWell just watch it I don't know how to do her foot section I just burned so you're going to have a wider\nYou lay the care of it was interesting I never heard anybody say this you think the caravan will break up and spread out when it gets here\nYeah they're all going to try a single ...\nI thought the whole point of the caravan was that they were going to create this massive of people and create this crisis what do you do with them all I thought that was the whole point of it why why come up together why come up altogether if you're not going to act altogether\nWell together I don't I don't know I don't think they're all going to go at one point you know

out what's what's happening here with the news coverage of this it's it's a very old routine now the president\nHow you know immediately started tweeting and responding to the attack on the synagogue on Saturday and I'm as is now the norm with American presidents I mean this is a a modern saying this isn't always been true but\nYou know in the last twenty or Thirty years uh it seems like presidents have to go to the site of a tragedy or a natural disaster\nPretty quickly or the or the judgment of the media is an old uh he doesn't care he he wanted those people to die\nThis is so stupid it's so silly [noise] uh that we do this\nAnd I'm Sorry but whether you liked the president or not um presidential visits uh most of them after a tragedy or a disaster are just more work\nThan help\nPutting that aside though it's what we do it's what's expected and so he's going to Pittsburgh\nThe I'm rabbi a tree of life synagogue Jeffrey Maier is has been asked every which way\nDon't you wish that he wouldn't come shouldn't he not becoming isn't a divisive for him to come isn't he you know part of the problem with the rhetoric blah blah blah and rabbi Meyer says no he's the president of the United states he's always welcome I'm a citizen he's the president\nIs certainly welcome well that wasn't enough for CNN and the others so now they found other people like the former a rabbi\nAnd other people affiliated with uh the synagogue to say no we don't want him here it's terribly should he should come later he shouldn't come at all and then there's this group you've heard about this letter right oh there's a letter with\nAll these people signing it saying don't come to Pittsburgh ... letter\nWas set up by a group called bend the yard it's a progressive democratic Jewish organization\nNo problem with that but\nThat's kind of an important detail that's being omitted from a lot of news stories um I read the CNN story this morning made no mention of them well of course are progressive democratic group\nThe week before the midterm elections would try to score a point and say the president shouldn't come to Pittsburgh I mean\nI don't know if this is what modern presidents are supposed to do then I think he's doing it if you ask me personally\nAnd I know this is probably a minority viewpoint I don't know why we have president's a drop down into hurricanes zones and ah after shootings and so forth um whatever help they can give whatever support they can give\nUp I think they could get from the oval office I I don't think Reagan when everywhere that things happened I don't think he felt like he had to immediately go to Cape Canaveral\nOr after the challenger maybe I'm remembering wrong but in the modern American presidents see this is what we do and he's doing it he's going today um I Would think that if you are grieving a loved one\nOr a friend or a a fellow worshiper um you would be so deep in that grief and that prayer that you would be pretty much oblivious to what public figures are doing and what public figures are saying I I Would think it wouldn't matter\nUm\nThe media's attempt to quote unquote protect the suffering it's a bunch of bull this is just another that you know this is the game they play every day what is he done wrong today what what can we\nWhat can we hold up as an example today of how I'll inappropriate he is and how ham fisted\nThe oh he's going to Pittsburgh too soon what if he had waited till next week\nYou know it next week is right\nAnybody Mueller\nIt's the election you know what would happen if he went next week oh my God he's he's he's making an election trip on the backs of these poor slain a synagogue worshippers or even worse they say he waited too long he doesn't\nCare he's part of the problem so\nMr President go today go tomorrow go next week the game was the same\nAnd um I I think for me at least the the best parts of this story it's a horrible horrible story the best parts of this story are all of the um accurate medical unity\nAnd examples of churches and different faiths helping each other through this helping the Jewish community all of these non Jewish denominations coming together I also love the fact that it was Jewish doctors that operated on and save the life of the synagogue\nShooter but those are the best parts of what is otherwise a horrible horrible story

in this company's lawyers he's an expert a purveyor of the law and you can get\nFor anything you can hope and pray for anything in this country\nAnd there was a healthy um debate going on here and I and I do not believe the president to be a big it I did not believe that he's trying to do anything more than that to protect us and at the same time to play political favor into a community that he has developed but this is not the direction Mr President that the law will allow you to\nGo it is Congress has played the fact that Congress and sleeping at the helm\nDoesn't help the lawyers and and the case but it's still not the right or just\nIf it's you know it's interesting as I hear you say that I'm reminded of that speech that Senator Ben Sasse gave at the cabinet hearing I don't know if you heard it or not but he um he basically called out Congress and he said the reason the Supreme Court hearings are so contentious as because Congress punch everything\nOr to the courts and too many things are not decided throughway\nA legislative process but instead go to the courts or maybe this is one of those are one of those things\nRight so this was already established by the courts you should know in the Eighteen hundreds in a very hallmark case called in the U.S versus arc Ryan says the fourteenth amendment case the fourteenth amendment was ratified in Eighteen sixty eight this was Thirty years later friend\nOr a child was born to Chinese parents who were subject to the exclusion act and we're lawfully permitted to become citizens themselves and the Supreme Court ... said that the fourteenth amendment\nGave them your citizenship so it's just solely for everybody and then the Nineteen fifty two and try to fight it into law so if you've already have the Supreme Court speaking on this if you already have the United States Congress speaking on this just because we're facing a different time look we fought pirates in the high seats\nWe did not change our laws our founding documents and mothers and fathers wouldn't be embarrassed every time somebody turns around and wants to change a constitutional provision or law skeleton that we developed and the platform that we developed should enrich our lives and that should not be entered as a political thing\nSo if I can sum up and correct me if I get your Ron I'm you disagree with the president on birthright citizenship but you would at least respect if he was saying I proposed that we amend the constitution as opposed to I'm going to issue an executive order about\nAnybody can propose changes of law that Congress changed the constitution good luck with that Mr President is what I'm going to say\nBut the fact that and it won't happen in my in my opinion but the fact that he would posit this a week before the

I mean they were a having a incest and the illegitimate children and I'm\nA consulting with pirates and criminals and smugglers and\nUm there were aspersions cast on George Washington's land and how he acquired it and I mean just just everything and it was so the political climate at the time of the founding was so hideous\nThat Washington had to have his arm twisted up behind his back to be the first president\nAnd\nHad he not done it people like John Adams believed that the republic would have collapsed there were there wouldn't have been anyone else who could have commanded at least\nEnough I don't know what you'd call it a\nRespect or deference just kind of get this thing started just to kind of get this this new form of government off the ground I'm so Washington didn't want to do it a bowl was the only one who probably could do it in the whole country\nAnd yes it's true the people we lying eyes today in their time were accused of a all kinds of things and and may have been guilty of some of them\nBut yeah I think I think pause right that probably at any time in our history you had the period of yellow journalism or in the nineteenth century\nUm that when I hear people today say oh a radio and TV they're just competing for ratings will look back in the heyday of newspapers when there were several newspapers in every major city what do you think they did to survive or increase their market share you don't think they\nTried to outdo one another with sensational headlines and and uh inflammatory there's the word you know a stories and mud raking I mean come on even without the historian just common sense would tell you that that's always been\nA part of the political scrum or maybe the only thing that's different about it today like a a bill said before the news is that at least at one time you could get away from it for\nSeveral hours\nAnd today you can't twelve Eighteen will come right back to this conversation at five fifty K.
