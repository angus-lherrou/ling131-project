together a for Senate\nThere is a where she says look I Know it wasn't a courtroom and it wasn't a legal proceeding but that's my middle you and we would not have gone to trial with what Dr Ford has

jak [noise]\nSo um what do you say to\nSomebody like me and I think there's a lot of people like me who are concerned about the impartiality of the FBI at the highest levels in the wake of everything we've learned and wonder how that might affect whatever they ultimately report out on cabinet\nWell it shouldn't affect it and that there should\nBe no conclusions drawn\nA as I understand the background investigation simply a the failed agents going out interviewing the different witnesses and then a making a report industrial too isn't that gets forwarded up to the upper echelon that then gets forwarded over to the White House\nSo [noise] excuse me there shouldn't be any marking with the content of the three oh two in other words I what I understood what happened with the\nThat in essence a thrill to be there as the as the background or back up to whatever document that may be prepared by the higher ups\nSo you don't have the opportunity for the higher ups to kind of put their spin on it hopefully\n... if I accept that but um\nIf you go back to the hearings and the number of times I mean you could have been drinking game the number of times the Senate Democrats said\nFall we want is this FBI investigation don't you want it to doesn't ... it it made me think that they believe or know that they are going to get something out of it they didn't ... that didn't sound to me like oh well we'll just see a what happens\nNow I I guess my filter on on how I saw was that it was a delay tactic hoping that they might be able to scare up ah more allegations and but I think it'll you know it comes to a point when people go really\nI mean if they have any more people come forward a I think that most people will go I'll come out with the this is just not believable as new people come forward because of all the media French will be had around it\nI kind of took it as simply a delay tactic because you never know what's going to happen in the future at least they knew that if he didn't get a his confirmation didn't go forward at that point\n[noise] I'm In the memo prepared by attorney racial Miller of Arizona which she sent to the senators and said look nobody told me to write this nobody made me write it I just decided to write it this is my independent assessments\nI Know it's not a legal court of law that Senate hearing but in the legal context or she said this cases even weaker than a he said she said case would not rise to the level she said no reasonable prosecutor would bring this case to court\nWell I think well and partly well number one I always felt that this was going to happen now that\nThe dishes isn't as since the opening argument normally I Would say final argument that's being made to the jury that uh that is the American public but because we got the FBI investigation going on still don't know what that's going to show up with but at least this is the opening statement that a prosecutor would make to a jury\nA but more importantly she didn't say that it was just that no prosecutor would bring\nA the evidence or bring a case because of the lack of evidence because they're not criminal case it's beyond a reasonable doubt she also said that there she does not believe that what was presented rises to the level of preponderance of evidence which is what the standard of proof is in a civil case if somebody was that being said civil aid for sex assault\nOr it would have to be proved beyond a by a preponderance of the evidence and and and her comments or state and she says she doesn't believe that the branches to that level
