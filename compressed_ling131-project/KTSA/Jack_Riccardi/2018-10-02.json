vote on Kavanaugh [noise]\nI Do because these people they talk about a swing votes\nLike Murkowski and Susan Collins and uh the Democrat votes they think they might be able to swing over to the Republican side like a Joe Donnelly in Indiana Joe Manchin of West Virginia [noise] see I I think everybody knows the specially the swing voters they're the ones that have to calculate their they're not even thinking about Brecht nine who he was a newly is\nThey're just calculating the impact back home and\nTheir own political fortunes but I really think the the purpose and I know this is politically incorrect to say\nI think the purpose of the FBI investigation the new one\nIs just cover it's just something that that people will be able to hang your hat on and the only the only interest they have and the scope of it the length of it the the unfettered nature of it is is they want it to be something that they can credibly\nUh use as the reason for their vote here's this here's the truth\nBrett Kavanaugh isn't going to suddenly breakdown on the you know and then have like a a dramatic made for TV moment where he admits that he's a sexual predator\nA and we're not going to suddenly find a smoking gun we're not going to suddenly find day totally believable ten ways to Sunday verifiable accuser we're not going to do it we're not going to we're not going to recover the memories of the doctor for it doesn't have that's not going to happen in a week or even longer\nRemember that the FBI investigation is based on interviewing people it's not they're not going to turn over Iraq per search and empty building or discover a hidden clues somewhere\nThis isn't CSI\n... they're just going to talk to people that have already been talk to and yeah they might jar loose an additional factor detail but chances are nothing that changes the story this is what I think\nSo\nYou could hold the Senate vote today you can hold the Senate vote Thursday or friday or next Monday because it it doesn't matter anymore if you believe he's a predator you have enough to go on\nAnd if you don't believe he is you also have enough to go on\nAnd I'm\nTrying to make this about something more than a political effort to stop Brett Kavanaugh to keep them off the Supreme Court is a joke\nBecause if we cared about this stuff in and of itself\nWe would want to keep people out of Congress who act this way and we're not and we don't we'd want to keep people out of the Senate who act this way and we're not and we don't we want to make sure within our own political parties

really a very specific\nHighly political moment\nA seem more weighty and important and it really is that's that's what this says\nAnd I'm not saying by the when I say that by the way I'm not saying anything about whether other women who come forward about other people in other circumstances should or should not be believed\nBecause that's a that's another live at both sides are telling you

I'm\nAt a a at a strip club I Can't say for sure that she was stripping\nYou see what I mean it's this is a woman telling a story of something that allegedly happened to her and deciding to include Brett Kavanaugh's presence\nAnd therefore guilt by association or presents this isn't this isn't the kind of thing you would\nPut on the air or unless you had already decided that there was a factor pattern and you're just adding more facts to the pattern\nNBC tried to cover themselves by putting out a statement ahead of the interview saying we have not been able to independently verify these

I don't think I've talked to a single person who's undecided about this maybe you are and we haven't talked to but I mean\nWhen I talk to and I looked at the senators and they're all acting like they're waiting for the FBI results I Know they're not you know they're not\nAnd the FBI is interviewing people that have already been interviewed\nPeople who cannot afford to change the story they told before or else they're in legal jeopardy\nAnd I don't think you're going to change the story anyway\n\nAnd so the FBI investigation at our expense is just one more fig leaf for the political

to believe the FBI they did a good job\nAnd if you're a a never Trump Republican senator\nYou're going to say um hey I sorry but I Can't vote for cabinet because that FBI investigation was too short and it was too constrained limited by the White House and so uh we just didn't get the answers we need and we can't see our way through to vote for him\nAnd I don't know what the mask it'll be I'm not

I didn't have a chance to bring it up [noise] um [noise]\nGovernor of California Jerry Brown on Sunday signed a I'm\nA new bill into law that will require publicly traded companies in California to include women\nOn their boards of directors so if you're a publicly traded company you have to have at least one female director by the end of twenty Nineteen and they're going to increase that you must have at least three female directors by the end of twenty Twenty one\nSo other countries have these guidelines or rules but California is the first state to say publicly traded company you cannot have an all male board there must be at least one or more women\nOn the board and brown and signing it even admitted that it may not uh survive it's court challenges but he felt that the state needed to make a statement he said quote in the wake of recent events in Washington DC and beyond men are not getting the message so Jerry's sending a message\nWith his signature on this bill and I was thinking about this um I've never served on the board of a publicly traded company I have served on nonprofit boards and um\nI Wonder now in California when a company announces that it's taking a woman on as a director will everyone look at that woman and say well\nWe all know the real reason she's here are we all know the real reason they picked her\n[noise] I I find it fascinating that\nPeople who claimed to care about\nWomen taking their rightful place in the workplace or anywhere politics anywhere I always find it interesting that they're not making the argument that women are good enough or women are qualified they're making the argument that we just have to put the women there\nAnd I'm not wait for them to rise or send to those positions isn't that like saying they can't isn't is saying\nWell we're never going to get as many women on boards as we think there should be so we're just going to mandate it I mean a lot of people get caught up in the ... oh this is the government selling businesses what to do but you know what that ship sailed a long time ago\nUm it will look like this is the reason why\nAnd this is the same kind of shadow that affirmative action Passover\nI'm African American and Hispanic American women\nUh hires in a company's below the board level there's always that idea that ... is this person here because um we needed it to look rice or they hear because they're the best person and the dynamic civil workplace is such that if you come in under the presumption of\nTokenism or quota hiring that stays with you and and and one ... one of the thing I just quickly mention\nUm\nOnce you start down this road\nWho's to say well we we need a law that requires African American board members and Hispanic board members and Asian board members and pretty soon the government will just give you a chart right and it will say hey you've got a I don't know how many ... what's the typical corporate board I don't know how many people let's say it's ten people\nOr you get ten people here's who needs to fill each seat you need one of these two of those one of these one of these one of those\nTwo of those like ordering doughnuts to ten five nine nine fifty five fifty five but do you think about that [noise] um it\nIt sounds like if three quarters of the boards already are mixed that this problem is sorting itself out or this imbalance of sorting itself out and this is why I was saying before that elections matter more to conservatives because you see with with um when you're on the left\nYou can um fight your battles and when your battles in a whole variety of ways take for example what's going on with I'm Brett Kavanaugh I had a\nMessage or a Facebook message here from Tina she says I listen to your show every day at work I couldn't get through on the phone what to say it looks like the cabinet confirmation\nHas been hijacked by the me too movement like Kavanaugh as the poster boy for abuse I'm seeing all these stories by women of abuse and whatever but this is about a confirmation people are losing sight of the subject matter or many of uh these hash tag me two people turned out to be frauds anyway writes Tina\nTina I think I think you're right by the way that the cabinet thing has been hijacked I think that's a good way to put it I think the reason for that again\nIs that in general leftists fight their battles on a lot of different battlefields so they see the cabin or saying multi dimensional e is not just about stopping\nThe appointment of a conservative justice it's also about fighting this this other battle this me to battle and I'm conservatives tend to be\nMore limited in their thinking so they think well I'm ...\nTrump told us that if we voted for him he would appoint conservatives to the Supreme Court so we came out and we voted for him even though he's not really a conservative and some of us had issues with him\nUh we elected him he won so now we expect conservatives to be appointed to the Supreme Court why aren't they being what's the problem what's the hold up\nWe were told that that's what we need we needed a conservative president and a Republican Senate we gave you both should I mean so elections are very important to conservatives 'cause they take the results of them\nLiterally and hard and then they think OK battle over so if you voted for Trump the next morning for you the election was over\nRight you went back to business whatever that is right what did they do was the election over for them has has it ever been over have they ever stopped contesting it or is this thing it\nThat's the difference between in general I think between liberals and conservatives I'm Still talking about that talking about the California a board of directors requirement Larry's on Katie Sai Larry\nHow are you doing [noise] I I Am amazed AT T\nIs this a governor in California but it's just like what you're talking about I mean liberals are socialist and many of the communist whatever they want to call themselves I mean they just have this and that that they have an attitude that they could\nFind all these battles that are important to them on all fronts\nAnd shore up their troops and they know how to do battle or they know what's at stake even if it's morally wrong it it they they really don't care and bad about that you're talking about conservatives\nI have a lot of friends that are conservatives they'll go they'll vote and then it's it's kinda weird but it really happens they kind of like just dust off their hands and said I didn't like good thing but what they seriously are are are not focus on\nIs that when you're in a fight with a bully or you're in a fight\nAnd he's not going to do things right okay who's gonna what\nDo you think people have learned that now do you think that now after the twenty sixteen election people ... people realized that elections are not over after one side wins and the other side loses or or to put it in another way the losing side doesn't just give in and give up\nYeah no I mean we we we can't okay I'm sure that are on our founding fathers did our constitution or there was there was probably vicious battles but one thing that happened if they found common ground and and I have friends that are liberal and and you have common ground with them and stuff you know we'll get\nA loan let me let me hold you there because I'm running out of the time I'm not ... but but I appreciate your call I'm not trying to cut you short I just I'm literally going to run out of the time here we're

is a separate project\nOr we're seeing a doubling and sometimes tripling and health insurance premiums now why is that\nBecause we've got a top down regulatory approach from Washington that is trying to micromanage a market which is resulting in the enrichment of insurance companies at the expense of taxpayers and the expense of citizens being able to get access to affordable health care that's what's happening subsidized insurance companies were twenty five year old bureaucrat\nNot just the government bureaucrat but at twenty five year old insurance company bureaucrat is sitting behind a phone telling you what's your healthcare costs needs to be instead of you go on to your doctor and just getting care\nThe whole idea of sort of mandating pre existing coverage is not a helping people

Medicaid roles medicate is not the quality of care that we want for all Americans\nWe took the system that was working for the vast majority of the American people that was not perfect and needed to be improved and we up ended it\nUnder this notion of making sure people with preexisting conditions might have coverage instead of going to the root problem which was escalating cost and the regulations prohibiting people from being able to have insurance from one employer to the next so that's I think I think there's a lawsuit absolutely it's constitutionally and legally unsound\nAnd I think we ought to be challenging it just as we've done in the past so I Hope the states were successful but let's be honest Republicans or whoever's in charge of the house Republicans are charged me to have a a solution ready to go as soon as there are other successful in the courts at the state of successful\nErnie thank you for that answer I Know we'll probably get back to health care at some

I think in to my friend why your the cannon\nTo the great\nSaid one of the time you are says she wants to the elevator I gotta do to okay so here's why I'm running\nI'm running for Congress because I think it's about time that Congress works for us works for the people I think they need to reflect our Texas values in Washington\nMy family came to dripping springs have county and Eighteen fifty one my great great grandfather was a Texas Ranger my great great grandmother was born in San Marcus and Eighteen fifty seven they went ... my grandfather to the chief of police if a small town of West Texas My grand my grandmother became the first woman elected county clerk and no one county when she was a single mom when my grandfather died of cancer\nMy dad had polio is a seven year old and she was raising my seven year old polio stricken father my two year old uncle and she needed to figure out how to take care of herself and her dad lost the farm in the depression\nThe very American a very Texans story\nTexans pull ourselves up we work hard those are the Texas values that make us great is why it's thousands of people who they are moving to Texas I'm running to fight to preserve this Texas values that are attracting people from all over the world and all over the country to move here\nAnd woman met I've met about a month ago came up to me and she said chip I Need you to win and she wrote me a very nice contribution and said and it was in Bernie as you said you've got to win because we've got to save Texas because I've got nowhere else to go and I just moved here from California two weeks ago\nThat's what we're facing we need to make sure we save and preserve the state of Texas for our kids and our grandkids the way we know why it's so great we need to secure the border have healthcare freedom balance the budget\nMake sure our men and women in uniform and the tools they need a clear mission and the care when they get home and then get Washington out of the way and watch taxes succeed and do what it's been doing for well a hundred and eighty three years ago today we were in ... saying come and take it and that's what we need to do\nAll right thank you for that our next question for you as a news director Dennis folded\nBack on that question um\nThe district covers a pretty diverse area and we have little pockets of Austin the positive San Marcus New Braunfels San Antonio in a bunch of the hill country\nUm you just spoke about your own personal history and he's counting how would you as a candidate tell someone here in San Antonio that you represent San Antonio values over maybe some of the represent downtown Austin you how you had to cover that gap there while you're not\nYou're not of the belief that Austin is my passion of conservative support ride this remedy got his want me to get the bulk of my core support is right there in downtown south Boston in particular now\nUm I used to live in South Boston back to law school and I think I was the only Republican in one mile radius when I was there\nOr the continental club you know a this district does reflect to Texas in many ways right as a whole you think about in terms of big cities small towns medium sized cities got military installations academic institutions big corporations small businesses runs the gamut ag\nUm I I tell people that look you want it represented who's going to represent this district as a whole\nIn today's times in particular and it's been this way since the founding you've got gerrymandered district lines get cut off and we know what's gonna happen and twenty twenty and there's three new congressman and taxes working or for whatever we have there's going to be a change drag it'd be nuanced Ron\nRight now this district reflects um that mix of folks in the central Texas area or that you want somebody who's going to represent all of that\nI've had a history of representing Texas is a whole ah I've been in there fighting for everybody in this state whether I was in the attorney general's office whether I was working for Senator Cornyn or for senator crews are working for Governor Perry for three years and the and the governor's office and\nAnd uh you know we know what's important um we know it's important to San Antonio whether it's just whether it's a very specific issue like trying to get direct flights from San Antonio to the to the CIA and Reagan or whether it's a a broader issue about making sure we preserve and protect our military installations\nAnd how important they are in critical not just to San Antonio for parochial reasons they're important for our nation\nAnd we need to make sure we preserve and protect those on healthcare front cyber security all the things are so critical with the Texas military base that we've gotten San Antonio in a hundred thousand active duty that are in the districts here so uh I think you just need to know what your district is about and represent them as a whole there's nine hundred thousand people in the district\nAnd you got to represent Laiki taxes and you've got to represent Hayes county in Austin in San Antonio in everywhere in between\nOur next question for chip lawyers from Tommy Tommy where are you there right over your oh I don't have to go far that's good or near the water question right\nWill have an e P A question what what do you think the role of the environmental protection agency should be and water in Texas\nWell I think that's a great question obviously water is critically important issue for the state and I think if you look at our of environmental laws um\nAh I look and starting to Texas and you know a lot of people don't know the extent to which Texas had a significant number of laws in place in the state of Texas before the pay was even created in Washington to make sure that our air was cleaned make sure our water is clean and try to take steps to do the right thing\nOr there are areas in which of course you've got interstate activity where things go across the air go across state lines air water and then you need to be federal functions to make sure we managed that there's no question about that and I don't know anybody to\nIs that I don't know anybody who disputes and corporate environment or in a you know people when you talk generally throughout the district or public officials who dispute the need to stop any poisonous pollutants for being a a emitted into the air on the water and our environment\nSo those things ought to be done and frankly we're doing a lot of that very well in the United states is helping lead the world in that regard\nI think where you run of vows when you've got a a agency in Washington that's kind of running a mocking going way too far on issues like what is now is I'm very happy to see what has pulled back we're basically you can have the federal government regulating your backyard or your farm because there is a puddle there because it rains that we've had over the last couple of months\nAnd we've seen a lot of that and we've seen a pushback on that\nWe've seen this administration I ... I think it helped lead the way\nTo get us out of what I think would have been a disastrous\nA relationship with the so called a Paris Agreement and the and the so called clean Power Plan which would negatively impact that our ability to have affordable energy particularly low income people were energy is such a huge portion of their\nAnnual costs and expenses we've now done that in a way we're going to allow the economy to continue to forest we've got four point two percent economic growth instead of the one to two percent\nGrowth that we're seeing under the previous administration I think that's the direction we should have\nI think a great question appreciate that you're listening to our congressional town hall events on five fifty K. TSA and if I'm On a set of one Republican candidate chip Roy with us today two weeks ago it was Democrats Joseph Kopser on your website use a promise to oppose any raising of the debt limit\nOf course we know the debt limit today checked in a Twenty one point five trillion highest it's ever been President Trump asked for and got a suspension of the debt ceiling how do you reconcile the position you're taking in the promise you're making with what your party right now is doing so there's the point on the\nDebt ceiling right is it it is the tool and the leverage that you have in Congress to be able to check spending\nAnd when we've been successful in the past that getting real reforms as we've been able to use and leverage the fact that we're now facing another vote another hike\nIn the debt ceiling to try to force those reforms you saw it when they had the cut cap and balance separate and two thousand eleven after we had the one point two and one point four trillion dollar deficits under the previous administration the response was for the people to rise up and the grass roots as they wait enough\nSo what do we get we got cut cap and balance we got a lot of that through and we saw with the BBC eight caps a dramatic reduction in the deficit spending we got it down to course only in Washington which continued would you consider four hundred billion dollar deficits to be a win\nBut we got it heading in the right direction that's how you use the debt ceiling so from my standpoint when I say I'm not going in both increase the debt ceiling I think the language on there and have to check is I'm not going to just vote to increase the debt ceiling as a rubber stamp to vote to increase it\nUm that would be critically important and then you get a massively change our our education system change accreditation rules we've got so many restrictions on accreditation universities you're allowing these sort of ... university as you've been around forever\nTo drive the train and and try to choke out the kinds of things we can have an innovation in this now twenty first century high tech world where there's no reason I shouldn't be able to Seventeen Eighteen year old to go learn\nFrom the best minds somewhere else but be able to do it via technology and and all in line to be able to do it through ... you know different kinds of options in education world\nWe should go by you know you think about our founders who would you know go do under studies right and they go learn for somebody directly and you know if you know you want to be a writer why are you taking a hundred and twenty eight college credit hours at some university there are some people who may have never even been in a\nMedia environment or or or you know an engineer he's never actually gone out and practice and engineering they've got a degree and got a PHD and started teaching\nYou know go under study go work with people around the field doing it right if you wanna geology degree go to work for these great only gas companies that are all over Texas now and uh uh you know kind of work through it that way there's a lot of things we can do to I think restructure our system\nNext question this from Laurel whereas Laurel\nRight here and would you like to read it off your card or do you remember\nHow can we reconcile the expectation that health insurance companies to continuously increase increase profits for their stockholders while the population contributing premiums continues to decrease\n\nI think we have got to refocus our healthcare on care\nEvery conversation that we have about the healthcare system today invariably ends up with a debate about insurance\nInsurance is nothing more than a financial risk management product right it's sitting out here saying something bad might happen to me therefore I Need this thing to help me in that situation I was talking to a friend of mine the other day who works for a one of the biggest law firms in the country\nHis son got an accent broke his arm and thirty places was awful when did he emergency room had he stayed got care in the emergency room it would've been covered by insurance company hosted by the way it looks at an enormous law firm\nAnd said they want some specialist was out of network or whatever and suddenly they eight forty grand out of pocket\nThat's just ridiculous that's not what insurance is supposed to be but we've allowed the system now to get so convoluted that we're now trying to manage our healthcare through insurance company mandate\nEither with federal government subsidies or whatever relationships and contracts are being negotiated with insurance companies were allowing them to control our health care\nThat is wrong we have to end that there are so many doctors who currently today one or provide direct primary care go to your doctor pay\nAnd then you have all of these mechanisms that if we freed it up so that we can help each other in our communities have health savings accounts so you can save money to pay for it tax free or be funded through your employer or government if you want you to resort medicate tucked programs\nWe get out of health sharing ministries I have a buddy his dad lost his a as a health insurance under Obamacare lost it had nothing but if they went and joined a health sharing ministry where they defray costs in a in a in this happens to be a Christian environment\nAnd what happened you went to Andy Anderson last year with prostate cancer and they took the hell sharing ministry coverage and they were able to get care now we can make that even better and more competitive there were more options it's restricted under twenty year old laws and the federal government right now freed up\nGo to your doctor health savings account how sharing ministry and then we have high risk pools at the state level to for anybody who falls through the cracks but if you free up your insurance a lighter homeowners or your car insurance you possess it so you go from one job but the next in the twenty first century your insurance\nThat would ease about Ninety percent of the pressure of people feel about losing their insurance\nBecause then you're just dealing with folks to end up with bad luck get sick you know lose their job and then they can't afford their insurance that's when safety nets ... step into the breach that's when a high risk pool step into the breach to help people\nAnd everybody I Know wants to do that I don't know anybody any person any ideological stripe that doesn't want that to be the way it works but if you don't have\nCompetition and the ability to go to the doctor of your choice\nAt the root of it all you'll never lower cost and causes the entire problem with the health insurance situation\nAnd unfortunately my opponent and those and the other side of the aisle they want essentially the DMV providing health care\nThey want government run health care I just disagree that provides too many barriers to you and your doctor puts too many here are crowded control of the decision making it provides rationing and it will increase costs in the end for the country and individuals\nI got to say I don't know how you all filled the room I mean when you talk about this you're very knowledgeable very detailed I Know you've had a personal experience with your stage three Hodgkin's lymphoma I'm having a little bit of deja vu and I'm following up on laurels question here because\nI can remember back in twenty ten we had Republican candidates speaking very passionately about market based reform which is what you're\nTalking about um we elected them right\nWe thought we knew what they would do regarding the Affordable CARE Act and then they went to a town hall meetings they got yelled at there were a lot of very emotional and hearts hugging ads that were run by interest groups against them\nThey basically caved they basically a choked at the moment when they were supposed to do what we elected them to do you remember it\nWhy is this going to be different why does chip really going to be different from the ... Republicans who also made a very good argument for market based reform and then didn't do it\nI've seen the models that work which is working with outside influences to have an outside inside game to drive pressure in Washington and get them to do the right thing that's what happened was cut cap and balance we force them to a degree spending the out people rose up influence them suffer\nEvery time there's been a bad idea in Washington which is most days\nYou you have a situation where the people rise up and say no we don't want amnesty so what do they do they rose up said no melted the bones down Mel Brooks offices whatever you want to say and they were able to change that you\nGot to have the ability to figure out how to work outside and inside to change the conversation look at the end of the day those guys run to the hills when the American people speak or when the people in Texas speak\nI've seen it firsthand if and so the idea is to have people in Washington willing to stand up and make the argument and to get people on the outside you know what they're actually doing so last year when the Republicans were trying to sell their so called replacement\nAs repeal of Obamacare people like me and others were saying no it's not\nIn Congress I'll be stepping up and using my voice to say this is what's in the belt and this is what's not because nine times out of the time what they're trying to do is figure out how to maintain power this is both sides of the Ott they're more interested in maintaining their own power more ...\nIn her committee chairmanship more interested in the perks and the privilege of being a member than they are an honoring their commitment to the people that they ran to represent\nAnd actually risk losing their seat in order to do the right thing for America and the right thing for America is to have affordable health care and not hide behind this false notion of providing care for people with preexisting conditions winnable duty exact opposite\nIt will provide substandard care for millions of Americans still eating a lot of people on the outside looking in on waiting lists and everybody will then claimed victory and say like Obama dead by putting Fifteen million people on the Medicaid roles and saying look at me and how awesome I ... and that's on\nA unacceptable in my view and I think Republicans a bear the burden of actually stepping up leading a getting this done I agree with\nThat you're listening to our town hall event with congressional candidate ship royal Casey essay and Gilbert as our next question from the middle\nOf President Trump has imposed tariffs on more than two hundred billion dollars of Chinese goods when they get a sense from you as to whether you support or those terrorists and generally speaking when you think that the imposition of terrorists uh makes sense for the U.S economy\nSo obviously I'm I've been very public about believing that free trade is good not just for the United states that protects as we've seen give her the exact number two hundred and Seventy five or ... billion dollars of trade related or economic growth here in Texas over the last Twenty years since NAFTA was put in place\nUm I think it's critically important that we continue to maintain those principles and all that we do\nAh I Do believe that whoever's in the White House and Senate truly on a nonpartisan basis drivers in the White House\nThe president has an obligation to go out to negotiate the best deals they can for the country\nAnd as long as we're operating under a good agreement and I you know we've gotten apt in place we've got a lot of good things in place and I know you're asked about China but she will give it out a minute but as long as we got good agreements in place that we're operating under in our economy functioning\nThen the the president ought to go out and to go she ate for better deals like we're not going to be a no matter what happens with the NAFTA deal we're not going to be operating under it in two thousand Seventy four right there will be changes in evolution is to it\nSo I think the president to go out and go shade on it I haven't seen the details yet right I Know he was arguing on behalf of some of the dairy farmers in the north I Know that there's some changes in that respect the auto imports and things I was probably some good things probably some less good things I think my job in Congress will be to review its\nAssess is this better or worse for the people are taxes and for this district and if it's worse don't support it if it's better supported and explain why\nSame thing with any of the other trade deals are talked about that because it's near and dear to Texas\nBut whether it's China whether it's any other\nCountry upon which ah were you looking to oppose or impose tariffs you know you got to look at whether we're getting an equalized playing field so that we're actually getting where we ought to be which is really true free and open trade or are we imposing tariffs at our detriment\nAnd you know I'm looking at this closely and and frankly I'm not sure I've come down a hundred percent I think I Need to look at it a little bit and see the president's in his rights to go out and try to negotiate on our behalf to make sure we've got the right and there are many deals that we have", "show_name": "Jack
