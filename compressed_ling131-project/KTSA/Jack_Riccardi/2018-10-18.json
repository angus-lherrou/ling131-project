suppression\nAnd um\nThe story goes like this a I'm a get out the vote group called black votes matter\nRented a a bus and organized an event\nTo get I'm African American seniors who were at a um county operated senior center so they didn't live there they were just there they had been dropped off for maybe gotten themselves over to the senior Center for the day\nAnd uh this group came in and said well we want to take African American voters are out too early vote and they said the group says we got permission from the senior center\n\nFrom the management or the the manager of the senior center a but when the bus showed up to take the um seniors and I guess African American seniors it sounds like from what I'm reading\nSomebody called the county Jefferson County and they in turn called the senior center and said\nNo ah that's not where we are not going to permit that uh it's a partisan event number one and number two um we're not comfortable\nWith a third party coming in and and taking senior center patrons out of the facility\nOr so\nThey said simply you can't do the bus trip people are saying oh this is voter suppression this is\nGeorgia or Republicans or whatever you know trying to prevent a African American seniors from voting\nAnd\nI got to be honest I I Know there's a whole sub text to this because the governor's race there is an African American woman versus a white man I'm and Georgia is one of those states that has the the controversy over voter ID laws and whether or not those are suppressing black voters or minority voters\nSo the group black votes matter is saying this was purely intimidation of these African American seniors and the county is saying no this was just we don't let third parties come in and take people out of the senior center\n[noise] um what do you think\nGreens are hey TSA noose on\nYou can five nine nine fifty five fifty five jak society fucking about [noise]\nThe mob mentality in politics [noise]\nWhat's going

morning\nA answers absolutely positively without question voter suppression is going on in the United states\nAre blaming a the a\nRepublican candidate in Georgia Brian Kemp who also is the state's secretary of state Biden says the United states just have automatic voter registration and we shouldn't have voter ID laws restricting people\nAnd uh the stopping that bus was absolutely an example of intimidating black voters dozens of black voters who were getting on a bus to be taken to the polls were told they could not go buy a county operated senior center because the senior center says we can't take responsibility for that it's a political event\nUm we can't have that\nThe group that organized it says hey we got the permission of the administrator at the center but this was apparently his or her boss at the\nCounty that said no your thoughts about that to ten five nine nine fifty five fifty five Paul is on the TSA Paul good morning\nAt ... I think uh I was just trying to drum up support and let me no no you can't let me at\nAll and explain Clinton wanted I Clinton won the election that'd be a cat or large black population that voted for him and Obama office where you live on a large although I I I remember I think it was like Ninety percent\nAnd I think are going the Hillary\nI think she would have on most people think if we had a larger black turnout so given that all all that history I just thought that it realizes that if it gets the black vote out of the controversy and get that rate one oh well that they need it\nAnd they get more support yeah and you can get a better turnout\nYeah no I think I think that's probably pretty much the math on Paul thank you Steve is on the TSA Steve good morning\nYeah good morning and thanks for taking my call\nJust as this uh organized bus trip\nVery well funded and paid for by very powerful forces inside and outside this country so too are the well organized a riots\nThat are occurring all over the country and especially in places like Portland where they're just allowed and cheaper to run wild so too is this caravan of\n... I call it an invading force there they're funded their their bought and paid for this is organized this time\nAnd and and and there's\nThere's more than one way to take over a country\nYou don't have to use a a firearms there that this is this is this is going to lead to bad things that I Believe that it is an invading force I Believe they're funded and pay for it and therefore I Believe they are a band of mercenaries it is a\nMercenary force that's heading to our borders\nYeah I I mean it it it could be it could be all of that it could also be that it is simply the manipulation of\nOr something that was going to happen anyway for the purposes of timing or in politics because I I as I said yesterday and Steve thank you for the call as I said yesterday these countries in central and South America vent\nPeople to the United states and what I mean by that is that they can't they can't employ they can't uh support or their own populations\nThere failed states or failing states they count on structurally count on people leaving for the U.S that's why they're governments publish and publicize how to go how to get here and when to come and what to say when you come here and how to declare yourself\nOr if you want to seek asylum what language they use\nSo we know all that we also know that that by and large Ninety plus percent of these people really just want to a better life so I I think they are manipulated and they are um if you will a handled\nFor political purposes by the people Steve was describing I don't necessarily think the people in the caravan are all bad people there may be some\nAnd it would be very easy for a would be terrorist or an artist a or drug dealer or smuggler would be very easy to win seniors insinuate yourself into a group like that which is

of getting into the country is part of a wave or group of people than you would have on your own under scrutiny of just yourself I mean come on use your commonsense so I think\nUm I think there is but if you'll Asian and timing to all of this um by the way I think Trump gets it and he's reacting emotionally he's saying well I'll call out the troops I\nThink he gets that people\nLike Steve and a lot
