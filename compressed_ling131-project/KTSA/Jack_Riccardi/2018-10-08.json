at the the L looks do you are but we're going to take your calls on that we're gonna bring into the conversation here right now\nA professor of constitutional law St Mary's University School of law built pie and he's in our K TSA window world news make her line of professor good Monday morning to you thanks for coming on with us\nThank you jak for having me on once again\n[noise] first of all I'm what stood out for you on a Saturday with the Senate bode\nWell I think optimistically looking at it I think\nMaybe what stood out is that ultimately we've all come to realize that while we have to take all allegations of sexual assault serious just as we have to take\nSeriously allegations of order and other violent assaults that doesn't mean at least in the view of fifty senators that we should throw out all concepts of due process fairness and a basic beliefs and the presumption of innocence\nOr even though allegations are serious you don't automatically assume\nThat they are true to the extent of depriving someone who might have a chance to respond to their response um I think it also might optimistically looking at it means that maybe we're coming to realize that one category if human beings\nCan't automatically be afforded credibility based solely upon their membership in that category I mean that's that's the definition of prejudice we had some historical examples to to kind of reminds us of this one is fictional and one unfortunately wasn't a think back to the Nineteen sixty novel by Harper Lee\nWearing a fictional attorney Atticus Finch was called upon to defend an African American who is unjustly accused of rape a\nHorrible set of circumstances purely fictional\nAnd yet it was probably based on some other instances that weren't fictional in Nineteen fifty five we all recall the Emmett Till right a fourteen year old young man was murdered in Mississippi after being accused of sexual harassment by a woman who now admits that or at least part of her story was fabricated\nRight\nSo I'm hoping that what this means is ultimately that there will be some recognition that even though in a confirmation process under the constitution it's totally up to the Senate advise and consent\nThey're not bound by the rules of evidence that are not bound by formal rules in a civil or criminal proceeding that maybe somewhere there is still a due process in fairness in a basic belief in the presumption of innocence that has prevailed\nIf you had to guess about Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court um ... where would he be likely to make the biggest difference on what kind of a case on a case involving which a constitutional principle which you most likely see him make a difference\nWell or the\n... if it's if you take a look at his past record he is a conservative in the sense of applying the constitution as he believes it was written a I think you might find him that hearing to precedent because he's conservative ah but I also think you might find him\nMore willing to be involved in tipping the balance and social issues where he feels the court shouldn't be making these determinations that should be up to legislators out until elected officials and\nAnd that means if I had to guess he won't overturn roe v Wade but he probably would vote to uphold state restrictions are based on the notion that the state legislatures have a role even after roe and making some determinations about restrictions or the interest of the health of the mother and the unborn child\nIsn't simplistic to think well I'm Sorry I didn't mean to interrupt you out of it had simplistic to think that his experience of these last several weeks and particularly these last two weeks\nWe'll color or effect um how he hears cases that's something that a lot of his opponents are still saying now that he won't be he can't be fair after what's going on\nYou know we had other members of the Supreme Court who exercising their First Amendment rights roots are bitter Ginsburg for example is openly critical of President Trump\nA and yet nobody is accusing her of biased when any case involving the federal government comes in front of her I think that probably\nJudge now justice Kavanaugh has served long enough on the bench or that he probably is going to be able to participate as a judge I mean no human being in a race the memories that's pleasant situations\nBut I really don't think that somebody would be so petty as to having survived confirmation battle and turn around and decide okay now I'm going to use my power to get even with everybody in this whole process\nIt just doesn't he doesn't seem to be that type of a person\nI Would agree with you there and a time will tell and professor you been a great a help to us these last several weeks thanks for always being available and look forward to speaking with you again\nThank you are we going to take some more phone calls here now to ten five nine nine fifty five fifty five I I should mention by the way um\nBut the truth is that today's Americans couldn't take communism for five minutes they hate it um they they they can't\nBelieve what they would give up what they would lose personally I don't mean what we would all lose but what they would lose personally I I guarantee you not a single person in the Occupy movement not a single person or in these George Soros funded marches and protests\nAre not a single person who was running up the steps of the capital or clawing like wild animals at the door to the Supreme Court not a single one of them would want to give up the material things\nThe creature comforts\nThe stuff that they bought with their own money that they enjoy whatever it is we all have our thing right\nNot a single one of them would be anything other than miserable\nIn a truly collective is no private property common ownership\nA system they would hate it\nSo the only thing that makes me more angry then the idea that they are advocating for something the crushes human beings is that they themselves would be willing and moaning the loudest you think they're willing now\n... you\nYou can take the noises they were making on Saturday multiply that by five or ten so

basis is for our laws for our system of electing a president then then you would think oh some old crusty old guys that have been dead for two hundred years\nIt's just kind of made this stuff up and maybe it worked for them but we don't have to abide by it but that would that would mean you did not know the the the the deep roots\nA and a basis for all of this um and I think that's true I in fact part of a relative is secular educational system is that it it's kind of a mystery why do we why did we carve these guys in the mount Rushmore and why did we revere this\nThis uh yellow ... two hundred and forty year old document and\nWhy why is this important why do we need it where did it come from um\nAnd cs Lewis writes about this in his books that if you don't believe in something

can't I just do whatever I Want if you don't believe in anything bigger than yourself then you believe in yourself as the biggest thing your God and I I truly believe people will say there is no God

I didn't think it was believable but it was for a TV event it was very persuasive or at least superficially and yes I thought he was in real trouble after that he needed to come out and he needed to\nTo let people know that he is somebody wrongly accused and he did that and I I don't think he was too aggressive everybody's all offended that he actually asked questions of the senators well since winter the senator so sacrosanct\nRise you're not gigantic ... why can't we why can't a citizen in Afghanistan or to question during a hearing\n[noise] getting back to senator Collins I I I think it's sad and ironic that he or she gave this speech which really I think will go down as one of the the great modern day a moments in the Senate which has had many of them\nUm it was principled it was a measured she's not normally one of those people that's the face of the Republican Party\nUm and the things she gets is insults from her fellow democratic uh women senators are like ... Hirono saying the speech was insulting in other words even in this moment where supposedly we need more women's voices and we need to hear women apparently we didn't need to hear that woman\nThat's right and that has been the hypocrisy of the me too movement that\nThey want they keep saying we're our voices aren't being hurt but yes you are being hurt the people just disagree with you and even when a woman disagrees with you they repeat the same thing about women's voices not being heard and what they mean is that\nLeft wing liberal women's voices should be heard and anybody who expresses doubt about what's been accused or what's been said is all the sudden smeared and I think that they're they're doing it to Susan Collins and they will do it to any woman who does not agree with him and I think what they have spark\nI guess we would now call them I'm native or indigenous peoples and yeah under ... British colonial rule\nOf you had every kind of atrocity you also had every kind of civilization every kind of education every kind of\nUm advance\nCall the colonial era was both the worst thing and the best thing if you can understand that that happened in a lot of places around the world and Winston Churchill was also a man of his time she was not a man of twenty Eighteen um were\nSmart man of Nineteen Eighteen\nHe he reflected the times he was in he was an able uh statesmen of his times um he accomplished many remarkable things not the least of which I'm perhaps the greatest of which was the war time leaders\nThe ... of not only\nEngland but arguably of western civilization itself it's probably no exaggeration to say that Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt in that order\nSaved western civilization with their leadership\nAnd um I don't\nKnow that I Would I I I Would say in in the course of Ninety years in life and probably sixty or Seventy years of public service I think you would probably find pluses and minuses but you'd find a lot more pluses and the idea that you would quote him and then apologized for quoting him\nIs sickening but what really got me in the Scott Kelly apology was where he said I Will go and educate myself\nFurther I've heard of grumbling apologies before but the whole getting educated thing is creepy that has that kind of\nAgain Orwellian we must re educate people remember remember that was the term even in the in the Soviet system when a a dissident was put in the gulag ...\nThey didn't say we threw him in prison because he is the wrong ideas or because he opposed the government they said we're re educating him meaning his first education was flood now we're giving him a a a better one we're going to fix his knowledge\nSo Scott Kelly is basically saying I've got to go fix my\nKnowledge of Winston Churchill I doubt that\nBut they use of the word is interesting\nSo apparently he got some blowback for quoting Winston Churchill he backed off which you you know and if you're gonna if you're going to quote somebody stick\nBy it or don't do it and you know\nIf you if you made the statement and he made the statement you quoted Winston Churchill I didn't look up the quote I'm going to presume that it's an accurate quote\nIf people give me a hard time about it just say well that's my opinion [laughter] I'm Scott Kelly you know I I I\nI've lived my life you've lived your is this is where my life has led me this is what I think\nWhat is this business of of grumbling in ... favor and being afraid to step outside the line\nThat's why people notice Susan Collins because they thought she of all people would want to stay in with the beautiful people she'd want to stay on the politically correct side of the fence and that's what shocked everybody and surprised everybody many of them pleasantly surprised\nTo Susan Collins in that speech that she gave it was masterful on friday afternoon was saying I have no more apt to give about that I'm going to tell you what I think and you can like me have me throw me out of office in two years this is what I'm going to do\n\nWhen Scott Kelly I don't agree with him on many things but he's he's had a very accomplished life why is he apologizing recording Winston Churchill do you see how how out of control is getting\nAnd if you're afraid to even use a quote from a person because the entire life of that person has not been exemplary then who really can we quote\nIs there any human being I'm not talking about Jesus Christ or [laughter] about any human being who is ever walked the earth in our times or anytime\nWho you'd be safe quoting and the knowledge that they never ever said or did anything that was off you would disagree with I mean even the saints of the church when you learn their stories many of them not all of them but many of them\nBefore they did the things and live the way that made them saints they were centers some of them pretty spectacularly I mean they were they were just bad they were bad\nAnd with Winston Churchill there's there's so much there the idea that just mentioning his name just quoting him at all would be something you would have to objectively apologize for really say anything about Winston\nChurchill ... says a lot of times we live in a lot of you and me [noise]\n\n\nAttention homeowners there's
