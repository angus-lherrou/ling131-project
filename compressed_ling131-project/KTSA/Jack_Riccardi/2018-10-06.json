to the K TSA home improvement show\nUm I ... well thank you so much for taking my call uh thirty two years an automotive know nothing about holding their windows\nI'll just call and ask you what we're happy to help you with that\nI don't know why you're in windows aged you they no longer\nA ... well that's ... that's a pretty simple explanation I not knowing the age of your windows are quite simply it's it's a failure in the balance system and\nA little ... me on the left hand side yes ma'am okay okay\nThat's a spiral balance which you currently have in your windows it's called a spiral balance\nAnd unfortunately\nA over a year's time and and grime and dirt and sand grit sand particles getting into the mechanism\nOr it erodes in it and it wears away at the lubrication that's that's originally put into those and you can you can re lubricate them over time but unfortunately eventually they spin out and when they do spin out there was a ... tool that you can use to redo it but eventually it will happen again\nAnd and spiral balances are are one of the oldest balance system still in use today you've got your your a block and tackle system\nUh which was used back in the in the twenties thirties forties fifties and and still today they have a version of it that I call a string and spring balance system it's not really a block and tackle it's a little different shutting it\nSo that sounds like you're ... what's that\n... that sounds like something out of luck\nDoes it does kind of sound like that does kind of sound like that but it but it refers to more like a block and tackle that you would you would stop something with your voice up an engine with their their their blocking tackle systems Jews to waste a heavy machinery and things like that and mechanics shops\nBut uh in this case it it's not that it's well it's similar to that it's it's a it's a tension and police system that does you know does the work for the windows going up and down but in your case\nIt's a spiral balance system and and truthfully it's it's an outdated I'm a technology that that was replaced probably Twenty years ago or so\nWith a a with a a system called a constant force balance system which is a coil\nOf metal typically a stainless steel or or an aluminum aloe if some kind that's kind of like a tape measure and the way that it coils up onto onto the keeper\nThe other piece is attached to the window itself this the Sasha moving part of the window and it keeps a constant tension no matter where you put it so it's a more reliable way to to a raise and lower and balance the window than the spiral balances much easier to replace him work on than the spiral balance it's\nVery chilling in it just yet a window in my house or probably Twenty years old and it's time to call you\nWouldn't be a bad idea if you have your windows house spiral balances ... chances are good they're aluminum windows a chance to have good that they are at least Twenty years old and yes ma'am that would be a good time to talk to us\nAnd the Ames here show to solve anything even simple things they know that you don't have to be afraid to call it just explaining that\nWell I I

fifty five\nAs we go to Chuck Chuck good morning welcome to the TSA home improvement show\nThe morning I was going to make some deliveries at a local area Sheriff Joe Arpaio was suddenly they so let's let's say maybe their houses and it probably maybe a thousand ...\nAlong the oldest shut wishing for about four years but I Know those so a lot of low though on they well they might at\nIt a little but they will edge which Colo street and it took so horrible all age it gets more of a rancher apple or they all take care of [noise]\nI think that's more of like you said it's it's a renter mentality it's not their house they want it to look half way decent but they're not concerned about impressing or [noise]\nUm yeah I think it's more of an ... of the mentality of of it being someone that rent a home rather than on that and then of course you've got some homeowners they just don't care either\nOh I I've lived in neighborhoods very very nice neighborhoods where\nNinety nine point nine percent of the owners kept their homes and their yards and really excellent condition I mean as you were proud to live in that neighborhood [noise] but you always have that one always had that one and I happen to live next door\nThat didn't mow the grass didn't fix up whenever something was in disrepair\nPut their car on walks in the driveway and they would get letter after letter after letter from the H away and the fact of the matter is that most H always although they have a whole lot of ... don't have a whole lot of bite no a which is which is unfortunate because many people buy in in our neighborhoods that have a choice for that very reason they want to have that\nAssurance that their their property values going to remain high and that you know that that the codes and the rules are going to be enforced if you didn't want that you should go get yourself twenty five acres out in the country\nAnd do whatever you want to do exact uh and when I and I'm and I had the opposite reaction whenever I moved into town from out in the anti Texas I had a place ... and lived on a ranch out and Yancey\nAnd there was nobody for a mile and a half from our house I could do what I Want live how I Want no restrictions whatsoever it was awesome\nWhen we moved into town I thought man I I just don't know about this aid to waste off I don't I don't like somebody telling me that I can and cannot do this or that with my house but I'll tell you what after about sixteen years of it now I appreciate why they exist and and uh in in in a lot more on board with it than I was whenever I first moved into town\nYeah but there's a few of them they can do a little overboard I had some of them are oppressive I had an island that was pretty impressive to the point that they even had the local police department an officer that lived in the subdivision tried to combine patrol car she give the illusion that he could enforce say Joey rules [laughter] [laughter] no he can now\nNow that that that's not no you can't uh but but to answer your question real real simply is is unfortunately if you're a renter and this is not all renters so if you're a renter out there and you take great care of the property that you're renting from you're doing what you should be doing and congratulations\nUm you owe it to the person who you're renting from to take care of their property and respect the place that you're living it however there are many renters who don't do that unfortunately because it's not their place they're not appreciating their place their depreciating somebody else's place and it just doesn't matter to them so\nAnd even if it is they're renters mentality a lot of it can still go back to the homeowner because\nIf there is a homeowners' association and play where they're ... required that the yard the manicured are kept in a certain in a certain order and of course they can go out and knock on the door and sent all the letters they want it that's a rent or he can ignore those letters he didn't sign those papers\nBut the homeowner did so at the homeowner's association would hold the homeowners feet to the fire and then the homeowner ... you know if ... if I had to rent or that they didn't take care of the grass and I don't want myself I'd go ... and then I charge that runner for a\nWhile it's just\nYou know the area could be really sure it's probably about maybe\nSeven eight Seventy five dollars is a real nice little ... it was sort of deal but it just your average just wondering how sometimes that grass is gone out\nOn it to a long road but you know like grass street is there anything else so um I don't know what he said it is but if it's right or out of the I guess so I\nI read it says it is\nYes and and another thing to keep in mind to us before we step out and say things you could have some houses in there that are vacant\nAnd that's why the yards get to that point and or could you could have elderly elderly couple that they just can't keep up with their yards anymore so we don't want to they want to make sure that we don't offend anyone or upset anyone because your yard gets overgrown there are reasons that that cannot be avoided\nI thought I'd call in and see if I could get some input from you as to\nYou know what might be the best way to manage all of that in in what would be some reputable companies or some mistakes not to do and in finding a company to do that kind of work\nGoing at the ... you know uh the best thing that that that I Would recommend when it comes to to finding and you'd be hiring a concrete contractors what should be doing 'em and you you definitely want to find somebody who's got a good reputation preferably somebody that can give you some references released point to some references\nOr somebody that's been doing it for a good amount of time and and buy a good amount of time I mean a company that's been doing this for at least at least eight to ten years okay not somebody that started last week or last month or even last year\nOr you want somebody that's that's the you know that has some work out in the field that uh that has a track record and has some longevity behind because if if you do have a problem in the future\nOr you want to be able to call them back out there and get them to address it\nUm whenever and and this was coming directly off the house is what I'm understanding\nA yes\nUh-huh yeah there's a couple of different ways you can do it you can tie it into the slab of the home by dialing end of the home uh and and a tie in with rebar you can also do a separation from the home where it's a separate floating slab that's away from the home\nUh and I would defer to the particular company that you would deal with as to which they're recommendation would be on that because that would be the ones looking at it looking at your particular topography and and making the determination at that point\nI see a very a a a slab or a type of a patio like that that if he gets ready to sell the home of years down the road that you know probably would be most attractive moviegoer\n... you know I Would do I would either do a a a a a pebble finish which is ... you know probably the most popular patio finished you don't want to do just straight a straight brush concrete that it's a it's a little too plain either want to do some kind of a an overlay\nA stamp or a pebble finish one of those three\nOkay All right I'm All right so um\nBut no specific contractors that you work with the companies that you work with\nYou you know I've worked with different concrete contractors in the past it's been several years since I've I've used them and I hesitate to you know to recommend anybody that I haven't used in the last couple of years\nUm just because I don't know if they're even still in business or if they're if you know what the quality of the work is right now ah but but just Google it uh just Google concrete a contractor San Antonio look at their reviews and and and pay attention when you if I Want to caution people when you read reviews\nBe sure to look at the good ... good reviews and the bad reviews don't just look at the three three bad reviews are too bad reviews of the company has and then ignore the fifty great reviews that they have and when you do read a bad review on any company read the response of the owner that's going to tell you more about that company than the review will\nBecause if the if the if the owner does not respond that's a problem or or the owner respond angrily also not great um but there are many times when you hear both sides of the story that you might get a picture that you didn't get whenever you just look at the at the bad review\nThat it got it All right very good for your time create the show thanks again\nYou're sure welcome thinks lot pre shape that very much Paul and let's try to Tony in here before we go to break Tony good morning welcome to the TSA home improvement show\nOr good morning great show thank you certainly I don't I don't know if I'm calling you get a music or ...\nOr ... some ...\nI have a foundation problem I have had a tray companies come in and the gas and that they were all within oh maybe\nA half and ... and determining the elevation definitely there's a need for off\nTwo of them sad I've got broken pipes and an eight and the water cause the foundation problems and the third one said now it was a foundation that broke the pipes how do I know\nYou don't you never will but you what you want to do of course is you want to try to coordinate this where it can be done almost simultaneously\nTo get the slab fix to get the the that get your level done but you also want to fix those ... before you causing him any ... any further damage to the newly leveled foundation\nCorrect a big question is if the pipe broke first then acting file a claim with my insurance that's the foundation relative pipes am out of pocket\nYou you need to get an independent uh insurance adjuster or to look at that on your behalf or as an as an unbiased third party\nAnd give their opinion on that because I I certainly understand the amount of money that is at stake here when it when it comes to repairing that and who's going to pay for it and I would want that assurance it'll cost you a couple of hundred bucks to get that done but it's worth every penny\nOkay okay I mean Joe eight he'll be able to tell me what change that chicken or the ad came\nOut so he should be able to give you at least a really good opinion on it you sir\nAlright

Spanish which was used for years and years and years which uh which was a pig minute I'm a plaster finish\nBut now the the most prevalent use is a is is a A N acrylic finish that comes in buckets\nAre still traveled on just like the ... Spanish was but it has a Latin America properties to it and the color a consistency is unparalleled you never could get the consistency in ... finished that you do\nWhenever you go to and acrylic based finish which is what we've been using on a hard code base for probably the last Fifteen or Twenty years\nUm unfortunately ... Spanish and became very inconsistent in color and you might do it twenty square house and Eighteen of squares one color and then two squares or just a shade different because of just a little difference in the mixture and and that's been virtually eliminated with the acrylic finishes just adorable tough finish\nThat help span those those here why it's a Jim was talking about so um yeah

we're course playing the music or future and Paul McCartney on vocals today because he's in Austin planted ACL this weekend in next weekend\nUm but this week also mark the passing of John Lennon right and uh so that that was a a big turning point in music whatever John ... was was shot and killed\n'em so lots of people remembering that ... on different radio stations in different a different venue so ah remembering the Beatles today lots of fun lots of fun uh back to the phone lines to ten five nine nine fifty five fifty five to ten five nine nine fifty five fifty five let's go to fill up good morning welcome to the K TSA home improvement show\nHey Philip how are you\nA good job and um it took that popcorn up seeing a ... billion up they're not for a a what's a good way up there now for next year\nOh that's that's easier you can grow up with an orange peel to actually in global the moderate knocked down texture of it pretty much anything but popcorn\nYeah pretty much the only thing yes you can you can actually rent the hopper I'm at a big box store if you don't have a hop or you can mix your own one thing that I I I Love and it's kind of a moderate but it's a homemade home style you just take some drywall mud and makes it a little sick\nAnd you put it in your hopper and you point that operate ceiling and you start spraying and it gives you a nice splatter texture um it was ... when the ... hits the ceiling and spiders out flat\nOkay how about the wall going wild now\nNo you definitely want some kind of ... at least my my opinion a lot of those opinion but I always want at least some context or on the wall because it helps hide in the imperfections that might be in the taping and floating in the sheet rock\nYeah more popular now is probably the the light orange peel texture now there was a time whenever the Monterey texture was a you know as it was a heavier texture was really popular and then certainly a Mediterranean homes in Spanish style homes it's still very popular but in most homes or an orange bill textures going to be what you want to go with\nHow many children do you do have you have young children no\nOh okay okay I was just going to say we did uh my uh we did a house one time and when did the bathroom and it and we just thought it was the idea we took and had the kids get their hands in the drywall mud put their hands on the on the wall and turn their hands like flowers\nAnd we just had all over the bathroom and painted over it it was a nice texture appearance\nJaycee feel the need and the walls\nAre you you can do it on the ceiling but on the ceiling I Would I Would rather go with some type of a really light a Monterey tech strongest feelings but certainly a orange bill could be done on the ceiling but uh some type of a light Monterey tech should be or or you can go flat on the ceilings you don't have to have a texture you can go flat\nI see okay but I Would definitely make them different you want an offset the I mean the feeling in the walls you don't want the same thing it's going to make them roam well as you want to continue as room\n... that's ... I Would jump on that when you want something different on the ceiling maybe no texture on the ceiling orange peel on the walls or Monterey on the ceiling orange peel on the walls or or vice versa\nYeah okay okay I appreciate it\nThanks Phil appreciates being a part of the show this morning\nYou know I saw a really really neat texture and on a house in Corpus Christi on ocean drive and what they did is you know the towel trial let's get the teeth on one side uh-huh okay\nThey would take him trial they traveled the um the guy Wal Mart on to the ceiling and that would take those teeth and pointing straight up in and give 'em attorney\nAnd they'd go right to the next side and get the kind of given it a fan look right and you have to turn and they went through the entire house doing this in the entire house was done and the reason that I Am familiar with is because I had one of my see guys in corpus fall through the ceiling\nAnd when we tried to repair that feeling I had to pay to have the entire stealing in the entire house\nOh no I mean done because you couldn't match it oh you know up that you couldn't ... yeah ... to ... I had to redo had described the entire ceiling in the house and had to have the entire stealing and house redone so there's your downside to doing something that unit yes there's downside of doing unique stuff yes\nSame with uh with with the Venetian plaster finish inside the house or your gas gorgeous but you can't repair it it's almost impossible to ... to a full wall are full Roma yeah and I love it if it's gorgeous but just know that if you ever have to repair it a patch it you're going to have you're gonna have an issue\nUm there used to be a squirrel finish that was really popular back in the seventies and and and it was around brush a really heavy Brussels Brussels around brush that you would use them in plaster work\nAnd they take it and its spin it in and give it that the give the plaster that swirl finish that was very popular for a while I'm Talking about stuck going in and Rick Stone in particular\nBack in the in the sixties and early seventies one of the most popular things that that we did down in Corpus Christi when when dad had a brick stone in Corpus Christi at that time\nIs a brick that we would take seashells seas seas sea shells\nAnd and uh and put them into the brick and I you talked about a labor intensive arduous process oh yeah individually placing seashells into the brick\nAnd then having the brick pattern so it looked like these were all see show late in bricks right incredible look very very expensive and labor intensive and time consuming and the amount of the shows that they had to buy to do this\nI Can't even imagine right but I remember growing up that having several samples of it and I think he probably did five or six jobs\nMostly on restaurants and commercial buildings\nUm but it really turned out pretty cool and for a while that was very popular so yeah Trent trends and and things and times change but a\nA N as it is what stucco with finishes on walls there was a time when when popcorn ceilings were everywhere\nEverywhere okay but now a nobody likes popcorn ceilings for the most part I mean it's ... you want to do everything you can to get rid of them in your house down such a mess to do it but um but it's just not the style now not even not even close\nYet they're the pop and uh [noise] you have to be careful taking that step off it is so messy oh a guy the AIDS or a it\nIt's nasty and you definitely don't want to do a dry you you want it you want to take a pop up spray or what it down and and do all what removal because if you try doing a dry removal you're going to cause a\nLot harder to remove it's really not you just take a flattened out scraper look I'll hold that you flatten outskirts straight yeah you take a pop up spray yourself to stealing down and you describe it off\nAnd you can if you have eight foot ceilings you can even put it on a on a broom handle and type it onto a broom handling scrape right or you don't have it on the last ... just ... oh my goodness it is and and and I've had to do it it's it's a bit is a terrible mess\nUm you know we were you said that we're going to talk a little bit and and we thought we had gone to this one week but maybe we only talked about one or two of these a couple of weeks ago [noise] um but we're going to talk about getting your home ready for fall and and we will get back to your phone calls to it to ten five nine nine fifty five fifty five to ten five nine nine fifty five fifty five [noise]\nUm but uh let's talk about getting your home ready for fall I think that we talked about two of these on the list but will kind of read um you know we visit those and then move on to the next one's a one of the first things that you want to do to make sure that your homes ready for fall a these are ten tasks that are going to help protect your home and save your money\nOr whenever the whenever the cooler weather gets your number one is repair your roof\nA number four on the list upgrade your windows selfishly this is one of my favorites\nAbsolutely it it it truly is and and now if you you would not believe upgrading your windows is going to your windows not only keep the heat out in the summertime they're going to keep the heat in in the wintertime yeah um it's just that simple\nIf you have problem with compensation and and if you have aluminum windows you know exactly what I'm Talking about if you have aluminum windows and it's cold outside and it's warm inside condensation builds up on the inside of your windows and eventually it makes its way down to your cells and it causes damage to the very least appeals paint\nA the very worst it causes rot a draft of course are a huge problem with with uh with older windows your your heating bills show the damage that they're doing because you know that goes up and up because you can keep turning that heat up\nBut the draft don't stop and the bill keeps going up um besides improving the overall comfort of your home we talked about this every week to new windows will also improve its looks and its value so\nUh one of the very best investments you can make in your home this is not an expense this is an investment because it does pay back return on investment when you sell your home or not to mention the comfort level of your home while you rented\nA number five increasing insulation\nAbsolutely ... this is something that hey if you're insulation in your attic is starting to compress down a little bit dust or they just completely kills the inflating factor\nThe only way you're going to get the good insulating factor and the the true our rating of it is nice fluffy insulation if the inflation is packed in a lot of folks believe will the more inflation you pack you know the better and sledding you get\nNo the the the fluffy and this is what gives you the insulating factor\nUm it may be where all you need to do is go rent the hopper and go up there and add some more blown in inflation but if it's really just lighten and there's a lot of dust and you may need to back him all of that out of there\nWell and and if you happen to get into your addict can kind of look around and you notice that your your insulation is black a number one that's an indication that it may be an older insulation it could be I'm an ... um\nWhat what is the rock hall ... could be old rock will insulation if if you itch like the Dickens it probably is Rockwell insulation uh if you touch it and by the way don't um touched the insulation wear gloves were long sleeved shirts or because if if it is fiberglass or rock or what's going to be irritating to your skin\nOr you don't want to do that a blown in insulation is the most popular form of insulation now and and probably the most effective form of insulation you can do the cellulose or blown and fiberglass and the fabulous that they use now is not nearly as itchy is what they used to use I don't know what they did to fix that but\nThey didn't write write a ... [noise] I I Can't remember the term that they did um but actually I think it's it's just because there's longer fibers maybe that's it it's longer fibers fiberglass\nUm but and just remember if you do decide to blow in inflation yourself if you have the flex spider in your attic from your air conditioning ducts\nIf it's the the silver tubes and the great do not isolate over that no it when you blow in your inflation go through and take all of those up pick him up shake them off and put them back on top of the inflation yep do not insulate overeating I you would call your costs a major compensating issues\nOkay real quickly we're going to get through the rest of 'em 'cause we've got short time here uh interior painting if your interior walls were looking worse for wear you simply want to change the color follows a great time to do that\nCarpet cleaning I'm definitely you can go through in the fall and get all those carpets getting clean the nice and clean for the holidays course by the end of the holidays are dirty again but you can wait till next year before the holiday to them again\nAnd if it's been awhile since you've done it get a professional out there and get a get a deep deep good cleaning\nAbsolutely absolutely not right higher handyman yes any of those little projects around the house did you have not been able to get to\nSimply because of time or physical ability higher handy man don't be afraid to hire somebody to do it um I've I've hired handy many even as even with what I Do because I guess it's there's times when it's it's more cost effective me to pay someone to do it in the takeoff take away from what I'm doing to to to to do it\nLet them do what they do you do what you do a and and be sure as ... with hiring any contractor do your research check references and check out their better Business Bureau rating\nA remodeling your bathroom right time to do that if you're dreaming of remodeling your bathroom it's great to be doing stuff inside and fall is the best time to finish that project\nClean your gutters folks but I strongly recommend I don't care what kind of physical condition you're in you hire somebody to do that that's a dangerous daunting task so many people you hear about every year fall up a letter from cleaning gutters\nThey hire a professional absolutely and and and if it's if if it's possible in it's in your budget consider\nA at this time looking at your gutters if you need to replace them great time to replace the gutters and if you do have gutters are filled with leaves consider a strongly putting a leaf protection system on top of those gutters when you replace them and it when the world would be happy to help you with that too\nUm want to get in one last little a little bit about when the world if you're in the market for a energy efficient windows if you want to keep your home comfortable this winter time and not lived through another ... terrible cold ... give us a call them when the world are checked us I don't mind it when the world T.

I have a two thousand for it up on their ... it's a two thousand and I bought a\nThousand or we can handle a it's been a just a really states will face a truck and it just single cab six cylinder a you know regular regular us you know regular cooked okay and um [noise] or just recently started doing spider ... started sputtering and then it backfired and then it turns off\nAnd um and it did that at times and what I did was I\nChanged the spark plugs up close it was a smart but changes Barclays out first and then I chose that fuel filter very close and\n... and then we are and then what we did is we had to ask ... why these a new place as they do ... and then that's what she calls and then we took it to a professional electronic mechanic had it for a whole day and we put all kinds of shows that it couldn't figure out of course it didn't do it with him\nAnd and so he said that he couldn't find anything always turn it back to us and so then I took it home to do with a couple of days and then it started and then it started doing it again\nIt's only while you're driving right\nAfter it gets actually act after it gets warmed up like after about twenty miles uh you know in a gang Fifteen miles then it starts to get a second it's warm and then I stop at a stop sign and it starts with spiders it starts this butter and then it starts to backfire and then it turns off\nOkay do you have a do you have a check engine light on no does your fuel gauge work yes okay\nUh and that was only a slight indication but in my opinion and and I don't know what the shop looked at what they tested in what they checked but the very first thing I Need from you or need you to check and you can do this this weekend yourself\nIs the fuel pressure okay the fuel pump pressure you need a key on engine off test that's where you turn the key to the opposition but you leave the engine off\nAnd you hook up well first you hook up your pressure gauge so you can go to any parts store and you either by a pressure gauge or you rent one if they rent them I don't even know if they do\nBut uh on your forward it has a very easy Schrader valve under the hood and you're screwed on there it's just like a bicycle valve almost\nAnd you're screwed on there and you turn the key to the opposition and you watch where you're feel pressure goes hey turn it off and maybe new at one more time just to make sure because you'll have a tiny bit of air on the line they have a little purge button on the side the purge at one time and then and then you'll get the true accurate reading\nIn science who called that they control the control I Need to control I Need some control here in\nThe studio but uh anyway so if you will do that you have got to check something first and you've got to have a baseline so that uh right now if you check it in your fuel pressure is perfect then you don't have to worry about your fuel pump but [noise]\nI mean by perfect is I'm going to say that your feel pressure specification and you can\nI don't know how you would get this other than doing a little Google researcher maybe calling the factory for calling Ford or if you want to call me on Monday you can do that but if you want to do that this weekend a you look up for Ford F. one fifty six feel pressure specification\nI'm gonna call that number forty five fifty five PSI on years it may be more like forty to fifty or thirty five forty five whatever but let's just say forty five fifty five\nIf you're PSI is forty four PSI or below its bad okay at forty five PSI it is within manufacturers specifications but it's pretty low okay it's like a ... yeah I got my sister she's a teacher right\nYeah so the kid will pass right but it's not real good nobody's happy that nobody asked me about it\nIf it's below forty four then that means that you'll you'll or the feel okay I'll do it\nYeah it means you feel is going bad and it's only given your symptoms after it's warmed up okay and you don't have to catch it while it's acting up to test the fuel pumps\nYou test the fuel pump just go out there even after the truck hasn't been driven or anything just go out and do key on engine off test and then if you really want to do something then you can leave that gay John there if you borrowed it for a little bit stick it out from under the hood up near your wipers and shut the hood and then you can watch that feel pressure gauge\nUh while you're driving or don't stare at it the whole time but if it starts to ACT UP you can watch the gauge and if it starts to fluctuate you've got something going on with the fuel system now the only reason that I I went straight to that and jumped in feet first on your fuel system is because of your symptom\nIf you're a symptom of it dies I'm sitting there and it's running and then I don't even notice it but it's not running anymore\nBut you didn't say that you said it ... and then it dies\nLet me just running out of fuel okay so you're looking at a fuel system issued the most common problem on a ... Chevy is the fuel pump\nOn Ford's a lot of the times you can fix it by just replacing the fuel filter but you've already done that and it's still acting up I think you probably have a very weak fuel pump or a lot of the times forward they'll have like a fuel pump module a but either way you're looking at a fuel issue\nI it's not it's too\nIt's way too far to gas and say okay so I have ... I Can't Lee it and I think it's going up the tailpipe so I Need about John how much is that a that is like the worst case scenario that like when when you're sick and you Google a headache and and oh my God you get women be or you get something\nElse and you're like wow I have a dying ... ... ... what's the one that they haven't had an a year's liberal area have leprosy how did that happen you know and so a an ox in Oregon Trail that's right [laughter]\nSo that was a that goes a little bit too far so the cooling system is fairly easy to check okay and so pressure tested all the\nRated or to itself to the top\nFilled the radiator itself to the top that's where you're going to put your adapter and you're going to pressure test they don't go too much over your your radiator caps back so she'll be Thirteen to Fifteen PSI pump it up to about that and just let it sit and see where the leak is and hopefully there's leaks\nHitting a splash guard underneath and it's catching there and it's not hitting the ground which is why you're not seeing it on the ground\nOh yeah yeah that\nWas All right All right okay good luck you're lugging all call back ah maybe you're I mean you can call back today if you want to call back next week and let us know what it was All right very good thank you All right thank you and\nWe got rain on the line Hey Ryan what's going on\nAll of those old he was gay and lately a\nWeek or so on deadline neighborhood after an hour or one of its celebrate K. L. shake a little bit you know I always turn it off her back on the set us back up like nope nope I'll never\nK uh how many miles hundred dish one twenty but like the eight Ninety eight okay have you done the tune up the spark plugs yet uh no not yet okay you're probably about time for that I don't know that this is going to be your issue but do you have a check engine light on\nA what a what I wanted it went away so\nOkay so we want to gain it in the because for ... excellent about retaining the memory on what that chickens and light was okay so if it's something electrical we're not going to go down the path of maintenance but on that eco boost engine especially okay Ford has for not just for a\nAny engine has the Judy I type system\nUm you're going to want to make sure and maintain the spark plugs but you're also going to want to do the GED I service okay uh and so have you done anything like a throw the body cleaning or fuel injector cleaning as a maintenance no\nOkay you're probably looking at that so what are ... are marked down and told me one time is that you eat by the time a Ford customer has gone a hundred hundred and twenty thousand miles they should have done about four of these services maybe even five okay so about every twenty to thirty thousand miles you should be doing this\nAnd so what happens is as you get up to a hundred or a hundred and twenty\nEven after you replace the spark plugs you still have like a a runs rough miss fire possible stalling and it's because there's carbon on the back of the intake valves and it's not allowing it to run correctly based on the air fuel mixture OK okay and so you're probably looking at some heavy maintenance to do in my opinion you're probably looking at doing spark plugs\nAnd doing a a intake system cleaning and if you wanted to do to you could or if you wanted to do this work clothes intake cleaning\nAnd then it a hundred and ten thousand go ahead and do another one and then you can catch up and just say okay now I'm going to do it every every twenty thousand miles now and so okay but you're probably just looking at maintenance on that one which is which is good that's very good on the intake cleaning don't don't\nDon't you to that one at home okay uh that is something that I only recommend using the right product for and the right machinery for ah because you can ... a few little things up here and there that that will make it a worse instead of better\nOK okay and so that that I Will recommend and and you know I said a lot on the show I I Do get to recommend ... products on calls like this because this is exactly what they're designed for so you're going to be looking at spark plugs only use motor craft and then go to be do you find a sharp and find a shop that carries the Judy Judy I service\nNow if I eat eat all they have all sorts\nBecause they are up for ... for professional use only\nThere are certain chemicals that carries that anybody realistically could install in their car like forty four K. for instance the fuel additive that you put in the tank you could put that in and it's no big deal but uh on the transmission cleaner if you're going to put the cleaner in your car\nOr you have to get that out okay and the only way to get it out is to use a proper machine\nMe gee will only sell to shops that have the proper machinery doesn't have to be BJ machinery but\nThat is the best of course but uh but they only sell to their shops and then on this intake system cleaning you can do damage more than you can do good and so they can't sell that to the consumer because you may be smart enough but not everybody listening to me is going to be good enough to to install these products correctly on their vehicle\nGotcha okay above it\nAll right\nWell thank you so much for the call Ryan I Hope that helps and uh let me know you know hopefully you'll get that maintenance than this week and and come back on Saturday and say hey it worked great Julie

you Dan yes happy birthday to me I'm turning Thirty years old so yeah\nYeah ... yeah we had at that but [laughter] uh let's get some\nCallers okay stopped talking about my age and we have uh let's see we've got Tom uh we have a special color and we have mark on the line so let's go to Tom first what can we do for you Tom\nWell first of all congratulations on Thirty years\nYeah snakes All right here's a million years ago\nThat's right I think I did too like the ... annual thirty days that's right a thing\nYou want it as much as you can I Will for sure thank you I've\nGot a a two thousand nine Ford Escape four cylinder\nAnd it's got right at Ninety five thousand miles on it and a couple of weeks ago I went out to start it and it was dead and I took a low test or check the battery and a battery was completely dead\nIt and it wouldn't take a charge so\nI had to wait about a week and I got a new battery and put it in and now I constantly have on the brake light abs light and the stability control lights they won't go out with everything in the car works there is it just those street lights are on constantly\nI'm going to guess but is the check engine light on as well no okay you're still to rewrite stability and traction control uh what what you may need to do is just go somewhere and having scan it and then having clear it okay if they'll do that that will turn it off and that will let you know if there is actually an issue\nI doubt that there is I don't know why they would not have a I don't know why they came on and the first place but the code would tell us\nAnd the only way to actually clear those off on on that system is to clear it using a machine a scandal okay I don't know that part stores can do that but if you have a good relationship with the shop called them and say hey can I get you guys just to read this and clear it for me and most of the time\nI shop will do that at no charge because that's just a that's a little courtesy right you're not asking them to diagnose it you're not actually asking them for an estimate you just want them to scan it may be right down the codes and clear and then if they come back on\nThen you can get diagnosed and see what's wrong but I don't think they will turn themselves off\nOkay well I read on the Internet they said let the engine idol for two hours that seems insane to me\nDon't do it because you know depending on the code All right let's just take the fact that check engine light on certain codes can clear itself off\nIf it runs the tests that it's supposed to run and it passes a certain number of times and what I mean by that is different codes and there are two thousand different codes have different parameters for setting the code and then if it is one of those that will clear itself it will have conditions under which it will clear the code\nSo sometimes it will be the vehicle must be driven for Fifteen minutes of the speed of about thirty thirty miles an hour\nAnd a and that must have happened a during for Dr cycles and it must happen after three key cycles if you let your car run for two hours you're just wasting gas you're not doing any of that okay\nSo I'm Out in India and so don't now if there was a if you're a code out of the two thousand different codes was\nA code that says turn the car on and let it run for two hours and it will reset the light then yes you would meet the parameters for that code and it would turn the light off but the odds of you having that light that that code on there\nAre astronomical one in two thousand okay and the odds of that even being a parameter let the car run for two hours I have never had a drive cycle that says turn the vehicle on and let it run for two hours to verify that you referred to a vehicle that it's not it's not a\nNot reality and so that somebody on the Internet they posted in opinion but that's a wrong opinion\nLA find Ninety percent of the information on the Internet so wrong\nYes I Do too yes but the second\nQuestion is the low tired light is on K and it's been on for a long time I just been ignoring it because I checked the tires diary all OK okay and so I was told that one of the sensors that one of the tires on that is that true\nHe did have a question yeah go ahead what do you have a spare tire yes have you checked to see if it hadn't sensor on it and is it is it full\nOr the spare tire I got I just hated it a little tired and I bought a regular tier of the same rambling tire size good does not have a ...\nGood okay and and the doughnuts rarely do but if you had a full size a lot of times they will especially if you're driving a Toyota that's a big deal but um okay so on your on your a T PMS again what you received as an opinion and it's not a terrible opinion but\nThe light has not turned off and somebody said that you may have a sensor that bad right they may be right but they may also ah another opinion could be you need to have the sensors reset we have two different tools are actually we have three different tools at our shop\nThere will reset a set of tire pressure monitors right we had another shop stopped by our shop because I I\nLove tires I I'm a automotive repair place with a tire problem right uh so I Love tires for some reason even though we don't sell a ton of them but um we have a lot of different tools to do this so we had another shop stop by and he said I've been trying for two hours trying to reset the tire light\nAnd we literally went out there and we re set it in like ten minutes or five minutes or ... it was just\nHe said it's unbelievable how fast that was and he's going to go out and buy that tool right and so a lot of the times all you've got to do is filled the tires to the exact known them out let's call it thirty two PSI all the way around\nAnd then you reset the tea PMS and sometimes the car will do that itself sometimes\nYou have to reset it and you know what going back to you Dr cycle thing on Toyota's especially sometimes you reset um and it says you must drive the car for ten minutes to have it reset after you have told the car\nReprogram and so anyway there's a lot of details to working on cars nowadays but I'm On yours I Believe here's the two things you need to take away from the phone call go get it scanned right the codes down clear the codes\nAt the same place hopefully that shop has a ... tool and you can get them to check all your tire pressures and reset it and then you get on the road and if it comes back on yes then you might have a tire pressure monitor that's bad but I wouldn't just go by one and say find somebody to replace one\nOkay well I actually I Wish I could just disconnected altogether\nYou have no idea how many people say that about ... pressure monitors and abs and unfortunately they're ...\nLike go anywhere I checked water oil entire pressure", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Jack Riccardi", "city": "San Antonio", "day": "06"}
