C. S. A. dot com [noise]\nSo I kind of have the same take on [noise]\nThe president's executive order talk that I had about when he talked about the wall I I think it's his\nWay of having the conversation I think it's his way of dramatizing his commitment to a big issue but I don't see the wall being built I don't see the executive order being issued and um ... it's funny how no matter how you approach this\nUm executive order or a Lindsey Graham's bill in the Senate that he says it's going to introduce you kind of come to the set you're going to get to the same point which is you're going to get to a a a Supreme Court revisiting\nOf the uh one Kim arc case from Eighteen Ninety eight um you're you're you're going to wind up at the fourteenth amendment and then if you do and the Supremes come up and say I hate it it it means what we thought it meant it means whether it's always been interpreted to mean\nWhy then I think you you have to go with a new amendment that's how we have a negated pass constitutional amendments\nUh and that's how you would have to navigate if you want it to this one but but more importantly if there is that much support for doing it then a constitutional amendment should be a pretty easy to do it takes a little bit of time but when something is overwhelmingly logical and widely supported\nUm you can get the requisite number of states to sign on and ratified to ten five nine nine fifty five fifty five basses on K TSA basket morning\n[noise] oh hey Jeff hey how are you I'm good how are you doing just about to get\nTwo for one in math and you cannot tell her about it and she had completely uh an additional ... not point is I think ... ... and they're competition\nThat when people are born here they were here legally we're talking about people who are here illegally and I don't think it they had the same right they they were right\nHere you do know that ... birthright citizenship doesnt just apply to a legal immigrants that applies to legal residents who don't have citizenship\nYou know that right I yeah so we can say\nAnd everybody that as well and we can't if\nYou're not here legally and uh I don't see why you should be a citizen of this country and we should follow the late that Ireland and uh I Can't remember the long list is country that already had that in spite\nOf had an aunt and I think Kathy is here and she wants to say of larger to cater put her on I\nGot out and this is Cathy I uh I think that I agree with that point but I also would say when you got almost Seventy five hundred people storming the border and we saw how violent they were and knocking down the fence and Mexico we have to protect our borders\nAre given taboo that has nothing to do with birthright citizenship\nWell when they get here believe me some of them will be delivering\nAre getting pregnant as fast as they can because it you know finishing kids in this country is such a huge friendly\nYes can I ask you a question um why do you make no distinction between\nFour or you just best to maybe you do why is there no difference between an illegal immigrant meaning somebody who came in a under\nThe law under the the the the line\nVersus somebody who is a here legally but not a citizen if you've ever traveled through a foreign country\nMany many times a day so\nWhen you're in that country you're not there illegally right\nRight right okay so\nWhy are we making a distinction between why why aren't we seeing a difference between the illegal immigrants and legal residents\nI totally agree with you on that one there is a big distinction and that's a tough call a different point so you know I agree with what I heard you say well I was told the song for that\nAnd that baby will be a US citizen I I I'm sure there are people there have been people that have thought that I don't think that's what most people are doing\nI don't think that's what the caravan is\nUm but if you want to talk about something that's urgent and and we got to figure it out deal with it yeah the caravan of something that's right now but the birthright citizenship thing I've\nHeard this argument for years and years and years and\nWe've had a politicians and presidential candidates say they would do something about it and I think he brings it up because he wants us to talk about the bigger issue\nUm I also think that if there really was widespread support for ending it if that was what the will of the majority of the American people wanted then you could do the amendment the amendment process is designed to only work for something that is broadly\nI'm supporting Marshall is on a K TSA Marshall good morning\nJak I Love the show um ah yeah so I definitely agree with you that this is probably a tactful I'm at on a jump start a new ...\nIs that birthright citizenship should not be extended to everyone within our borders um I think it should be extended to those were the vested interest in the United states um\nThe fourteenth amendment states that it um it applies to those subject to the jurisdiction of the United uh of the United states but people just come within our borders and have a baby\nUm a lot of them tend to go back home and later bringing family and extended family um\nWhich is not sustainable um I I Do think you're right in terms of his intent\nI just think we would be better off if this is this is really not that important to me but if it's important to you or to another person or group of people I think we we would be better off with a constitutional amendment that defined\nHow uh and when\nYou become a citizen rather than trying to you know read the tea leaves of a one hundred and fifty year old amendment was written for freed slaves\nNow I think that's right I think that uh I think some clarification as an honor I also I also try to stay careful I'm On a referring to ... foot the left tends to do and they talk about about the second amendment\nRights will see that's what I mean I I I think we've got to be very careful here because one of the things everybody loved all these conservatives loves Brett Kavanaugh and love Neil Gorsuch we're talking about being original lists\nYou can't now ask them as their first business on the Supreme Court to to throw out an Eighteen Ninety eight presidential ruling that's just not going to happen they're not going to do that sure so ...\nSo then it sounds like a it wouldn't be it wouldn't be a matter of redefining the fourteenth amendment but it would be a new reminiscent of itself then\nI mean we were at least like we replaced the prohibition amendment with another amendment we didn't say on second thought that's not what it meant or we were a different country back then and now we need a different interpretation of these words we knew we knew we needed a new amendment and we got one and and that's what would have to happen here\nAnd and yeah that'll be very hard to do is supposed to be very hard to do right so right Marshall hang\nOn I Want to get you an imitation to our uh let's get Marshall on our list for the a watch party on election night if you can come out and joined us would love to have him in the animal lounge you in a guest and you'll be right in the middle of our election coverage here on K TSA\nSo I'm just a refresher memory Neil Gorsuch and it it's easy to forget about Brett Kavanaugh right we we it's it's hard to remember that Brett Kavanaugh ever talked about anything but beer and and uh\nYou know his calendars and all this other stuff but before the\n... the insanity set in on bread cabinet or during the adult testimony portion of the hearings\nUm he was very very strong on the idea that it would\nBe very rare or that he would consider as a Supreme Court justice overturning a prior Supreme Court decision do you know why they asked him that do you remember who asked them that it was Democrats who asked them how to do you remember why roe v Wade\nThe answer that Gorsuch and cabinet gave to roe v Wade even though both of them are personally pro life men is uh the Supreme Court ruled a it would be an extraordinary and it is in our history an extraordinary thing\nFor the Supreme Court to throw out of one of its own prior rulings it has happened it can happen but it's rare and people that claimed to be originalist ... have not only respect for what the founders of our country road\nBut they also have respect for what the founders of constitutional amendments wrote so the founders quote unquote didn't write the fourteenth amendment but the founders of the fourteenth amendment wrote it and what you would have to do is you would have to have a Supreme Court would at least five people who were willing to say either\nUm we've been interpreting it wrong all this time or the justices in Eighteen Ninety eight were wrong and I think it was a six to two decision back in Eighteen Ninety eight\nSo three fourths of the of the sitting Supreme Court justices\nHundred and Twenty years ago I got this thing wrong that's what you'd have to hope [noise]\nI've had allergies every day of my life that's Kelly like so many others he's used over the counter medications for his
