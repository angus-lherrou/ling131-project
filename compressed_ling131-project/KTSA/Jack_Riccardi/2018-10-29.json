about the ah [noise] the\nGuy that was sending all of the bombs are bomb like devices or to the Democrats\nAnd um I think it's interesting that what I heard from the media over the weekend was this drumbeat of\nThis having something to do with Trump being president's [noise] apparently there were no hate crimes there was no bigotry\nThere was no violence there were no mass casualty\nAttacks before he became president\nApparently although he had sixty two million people vote for him only two of them were able to uh decipher his dog whistle code in which she is calling on people to attack\nA and kill and maim the other sixty two million leftover voter did apparently can't decipher the code only these two guys are able to do that\n[noise] um\nAnd apparently it doesn't matter that the Pittsburgh shooter hated Trump\nAnd went on and on and on about what a jewel every was in a global is the was\nUm apparently the fact that the president's own daughter converted to Judaism and that a son in law is one of his closest advisors apparently that's just cover for the true anti Semitic\nOr Donald Trump apparently moving the embassy to Jerusalem as just a ruse you would expect that from the leader of the fourth Reich you know I mean I I I think if you continue this drumbeat and I could be wrong and maybe I'm over reading it but if you continue to tell\nThe American people that they are to blame because of how they vote for this stuff you don't change how they vote you confirm how they vote you you actually help him and help\nAh his voters see\nWhat they are up against how they will be maligned how they are blamed you know under President Obama it became common for him to deliver these finger wagging lectures about how disappointed he was in us and how this is not who we are\nIt was always a lecture from President Obama when he was disappointed in the American people and now that he's not in office to deliver the lectures it seems as if the anchor people on the cable networks have decided to deliver the lectures for him so now we get this sort of it's the fault of the climate is the fault of the\nWhen things like this happened\nOn President Obama's watching that was being sarcastic and minute ago because of course they did um than what we heard was oh it's not the climate it's that ah you know people hate him for being the first black president\nAnd I just think you can only you can you can keep ... you know it's like that silly potty stuff we used to play with his kids when it first comes out of a little a container is it's very malleable and elastic and it snaps back into shape but then the longer you play with it the more it's just sort of lays there right it's it's it loses its ability to read\nTo be reshaped and and that's what I think is happening with this blame game you can only\nKeep moving the goalposts are changing the definition of blame so many times before it doesn't make sense to people anymore so you know who's to blame for the a serial package mailer the serial package male or you know who's to blame for the the shooter in Pittsburgh the shooter\nUm they have a stake in these other elections because they live in these communities are right alongside us and they are affected by the decisions that the elected representatives make et cetera et cetera\nUm and I'm One of those people who's who thinks that I I Do think that this is Norman us for widening out the franchise and and I think the Democratic party here in Texas has been caught red handed\nUh trying to get illegal immigrants on the rules and probably succeeding\nA and don't tell me that Joaquin Castro is in thinking that when he's trolling LS promise\nBut\nLet's just for the moment talk about the school board election\nSo\nIn this country the children of illegal immigrants can and do go to our public schools\nAnd um\nTherefore goes the arguments are they should or their parents should have a vote\nThis is being done in a number of uh cities and towns on the east coast as well as in uh San Francisco\nI think it's I think\nYou have to take the child part out of this I think the child is this what confuses this issue because as you probably know\nUm\nWe we already have people voting in school board elections who don't have any children\nIn that school system why don't we invalidate those voters and say well they shouldn't be expressing an opinion they shouldn't be choosing school board members because they don't have kids they're childless or their children have grown up and moved away\nAnd then we have people who live in school district center paying the school district taxes\nEven though they don't have any children in the schools or their children attend private schools [noise] and we should say well then they don't pay any taxes this isn't the that they shouldn't be billed for a system that they're not using\n\nBut of course we do those things you do pay your school taxes and uh you do get to vote even if you are single or a childless couple\nBecause it's not about having a child your child is not the reason you're voting or or getting the vote in the first place citizenship\nIs to me I'm\nA necessary ingredient or threshold for voting\nAnd if you care about the process and you care about the decision making that tells me you care about the country which tells me you you want to be a citizen of this country\nAnd that's what you should pursue and then your voice and your voter welcome as everybody else has is\nBut there's a reason no other country would allow a non citizen to vote it's a rule of law thing it's because citizenship has to have value it has to matter and it has to matter more in this country than any other country because\nIn our country citizenship and our democratic ideals are the only thing that unite us\nWe're not United by a common ancestry or DNA we're not all French are all Japanese\nSo the idea of America\nAnd the ideals of America have to be upheld and half to matter or we don't have anything that unites us we're just a bunch of people who've decided to set up shop here like a flea market\nAnd that won't work that won't hold you see that around the world to

A. dot com says uh jak people forget that many faith communities\nHave missionaries that go into danger zones to help people they sacrifice their way of life to be in these other countries to great point and it's it's part of why I think that whether it's a this Jewish congregation I'm In I'm In\nPittsburgh or Sutherland Springs last year or anywhere up\nPeople of faith are attacked um they will not wait for politicians political solutions promises they will go about the business of\nSecuring their campus their buildings there flock their activities um\nI think the bigger the church probably the further down the road they've already gone with the ... you look at some of the so called mega churches and done non denominational churches around San Antonio like cornerstone and CBC and they've got some pretty you know I'd be a security already but it it it's it's a little bit of a\nSlower thing for smaller or less um the flu in\nChurch communities but that there will be more security and it will be security that's consistent with the idea that churches synagogues still has to be a welcoming place place it's open a place that doesn't exclude you because they don't recognize you\n[noise] um\nAnd they'll go about this and they will do this the way they go about solving all kinds of other problems that's that's the thing about states people I Know I'm bragging a lot about them this morning about trying to be aggravating are annoying but faced people just our doors you know\nThey feed the hungry they don't talk about how somebody ought to and um that's why it's it's a really ignorant sound\n[laughter] or or ... or attitude\nWhat do you hear people say well all these religions all these religions all this\nMoney ... one of their oil what we're doing\nNow they're doing way more than you are that's what they're doing\n[noise] um\nI don't know I mean the idea that that that this incident or the [noise]\nCereal package mailer this is somehow going to get people to rethink their vote I I don't I don't see that Peter's on the TSA Pete good morning\nHey Jack I'm Jewish um\nYou know I'm Sorry for what happened over there in in Pittsburgh and [noise] you know a a you know it makes me think about you know each time I go to show you know the times I did go but at the same time to you know it's not going to change my vote I voted for Donald Trump I voted mainly Republican\nMainly libertarian and I'm a gun owner so you know to me uh I don't know who's doing all these crazy things around the country trying to sway the votes but\nIt's you know most people are going to work you know we're already set on on who we are going to vote for a Republican or Democrat you know\nI think you're right I I think that the their minds were made up of most people's minds are made up by by results right did they\nDid they like the result of the last vote they cast they liked the result of the people they put in and they if they didn't then they're going to change that vote and and nothing else really matters for the under for the for the few that are truly undecided I think they're undecided over other stuff I don't think this is what they're waiting for\nAnd you know what makes me mad is the Democrats are saying Donald Trump income gotten your rhetoric how about the Democratic party calmed down their rhetoric\nThey've said a lot of things I mean look at Hillary Clinton's managing waters and I used to be one of those Jews that that voted Democrat and you know I'm Sorry I see the Democratic party working against the Jewish community and and all sorts of passage and I just felt compelled to vote Republican I'm just so sick and tired of the Democratic party thinking they own the Jewish vote\nYeah I I I Would never tell anybody how to vote but I've always been a little mystified by that too I mean the Republican Party has a stronger record on Israel it just doesn't actually\nWhat the reformed Jewish faith and I I don't know what it is what the foreign Jewish faith in in in you know and\nI just don't get it I mean ... you know these people are saying hey you know anti Semitic things that Donald Trump is done and I don't see anything anti Semitic if nothing else shoot him outta the capital for from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and something that no Democratic president has ever done\nI I still don't think all of the signs and all of the stickers and all of this I don't think it tells you anything about what's going to happen next Tuesday night\nSo we'll see [noise] um\nPeople ask all the time what do you think's going to happen or what's your prediction I I don't I really don't know I think the Republicans are going to keep the Senate and maybe increased their numbers but I really don't know what's gonna happen with the house because that's so many races and even when you just boil it down to the so called battleground races the ones that\nAre in state ... there's two kinds of congressional districts there is a congressional district that has drawn and built to be\nAlways or almost always Republican or almost always\nDemocratic but there's battleground districts we have one here district twenty three will hurts district\nUm ... and it's going to come down to those battleground districts where it's always close and it's especially close right now and um\nYou it's hard to generalize and some of those districts Trump is popular in some of them he's not he carried some of them in twenty sixteen some of them didn't\n\nThe math favors Republicans in the Senate because most of the seats that have to be defended or democratic seats the map favors the Democrats in the house because most of the seats that need to be defended in these battleground\nDistricts are Republican held it also makes sense that Republicans would have more to defend because Republicans have been winning these elections going back to twenty ten so starting in ... which was the Obamacare election Republicans started raking in\nHouse seat Senate seats governorships statewide offices state legislatures and as they\nBuilt up more and more in a mass more and more in twenty twelve twenty fourteen\nAnd twenty sixteen it only made sense that some day they would have so much to defend\nThat they wouldn't be able to hold it all this is the nature of all political parties and how the pendulum swings back and forth so twenty Eighteen is the election where you know they're going to start dropping stuff because they are trying to carry more than one party can naturally\nTerry [noise]\nBut as to how much I don't know so I I'm the only talk show hosted in America that doesn't have all these predictions and this crystal ball and\nI used to do all that\nI thought I read enough I thought I knew enough I thought I listened enough but you know it's just some people have the gift for it and I don't so I'm Still listening and reading and learning but I Do not know what to tell you about next Tuesday night we'll find out together and we'll\nKick it off our coverage at seven will be in the Alamo lounge will have an audience their hope you'll be in that audience will get more invitations to go out on that to ten five nine nine fifty five fifty fiber jak a K TSA dot com and um\n\nIt's probably safe to say that both sides will claim some kind of victory after\nNext Tuesday night like Republicans if they\nHold or increase their hold on the Senate they'll point to that and they'll say look that's that's where future Supreme Court nominees will be considered that's where the president's cabinet appointments and treaties and all the things that that go to the Senate if this is very important and we have a um\nDemocrats will say look we we swung the house and we had a blue wave and we have more governors and we have more stay ... legislators in statewide offices so they'll point to that\nBoth sides will say it was about Trump and they'll both the right and they'll both the wrong about that\nI kind of go back to this is the the X factor in this election and every election it's the it's the quote people say it all the time but they kind of use it as a throwaway they don't really\n\nSay it with with meaning they quote Tip O'Neill the former long time former\nMassachusetts congressmen and speaker of the house in the Nineteen eighties Tip O'Neill once said all politics is local\nAnd\nI think what that means is that\nAfter you get all the messaging and all the you know all the spin and all the ... the tree and also the stuff there are voters who vote for their congressmen because even though Congress has a bunch of bombs in their corrupt and their crooked\nThis is our guy right I mean he's he's our crook he may be a correct but he knows our town and he takes care of our stuff and he brings home the bacon for us\n\nAnd so they miss that when they try to gay gauging\nGas if these things whether it's modern day punter three like five thirty eight dot com or whether it's the talking heads on TV and radio and you know\nAll of that\nYou can only knows so much about who's voting and why they're voting that local factor you you you can't know that if you're sitting in a newsroom in New York you can't know\nHow many people are going to vote for that guy in Kansas so that lady in Illinois because they know them or they met him once\nOr whatever it might be you know my brother in law is a friend who works for the guy or you know whatever it is\nAll politics is local and that's the part that will\nKind of screw up or screw with the national predictions\nAnd they will be a lot of I've not be adding to that already long list will get the news here from ABC News and K TSA next [noise]\n\nI was not happy to find out I had to go to probate courts to settle my wife's this day

don't think that these events\nLeading up to the midterms really are factors I I I could be wrong I may be proven wrong but I don't think that's how this works what do you think to ten five nine fifty five fifty five to talk about it with me right now and and maybe it's just because I Hope that's not true\nUm and when they captured the serial bomber package mailer guy and he had the Trump will deal and he had been at Trump rallies and he had posted on line about Trump there was a ... a kind of I told you so smug this to the coverage that was weird\nThat was weird to me can I just point something out he may have sent those two Democratic\nPeople that don't like Trump and the Trump doesn't like but you know who was gonna get hurt if one of those things went off\nSome poor slab that works in a mail room or delivers male or just handle the package not not a congressman or a senator or you know what I mean I could we just stop and recognized for a minute that human lives\nWere at stake not democratic lives\nAnd ask for the\nSynagogue shooter I I you know people that want to make that about politics that want to make that about Trump I feel really sorry for them\nTheir entire world view is that shallow how will they ever make sense of anything when Trump is gone how are they going to figure out the world what's there what's their ah decoding key gonna be once they don't have him
