reports on hurricane\nMichael unbelievably disruptive powerful\nThe one good thing we can say we were just discussing is that it was the fastest hurricane anybody's seen it just was speeding him it wasn't that would be absolutely nothing left a it was and it was incredibly powerful you've seen the destruction\nUh it's moving through Georgia now at a much lesser pace both in terms of speed and the tariffs of its power fifty sixty mile an hour winds but\nSome of those winds reached almost two hundred miles an hour which is unheard of paper saying it's a third most powerful that they've seen hit our country anywhere\nUh we've done uh I I tell you a FEMA has gotten the river is the first responders law enforcement everybody's got rave reviews I just spoke with Governor Scott\nThey're very happy or food is paying now following hurricane being brought in a way of unbelievable\nLarge amounts of water and food and everything that\nPeople can live on the electric companies have been a\nTerrific they're already working on the roads are being cleared out many trees are in the path of the electric companies now the roads are being claimed right now they're being ah for the most

for\nA lot of water will be in North and South Carolina added to the horrible situation they had with Florence\nTwo weeks ago about a credible people and they know how to do what they've done it before they'll do it again but they know how to do it so uh we've had a\nGreat reports and everything the only the the big problem with this hurricane which the tremendous power and fortunately it was very fast it went through Florida very very quickly it didn't linger didn't come back as we had in Texas where it actually came back\nA second time and then the third time I went out filled up came back\nThis one went very quickly but er it's tremendous destruction the areas where a as the path that had it chose as a incredible that kind of destruction we've not seen destruction like that in a long time\nBut it's a the rebuilding I could actually say the rebuilding process and the the survivor looking process we hope we don't have too much of that uh the area most affected was\nHopefully a hundred percent evacuated but there's always somebody to stay in this case they would have been in big trouble\nUh but so far the report says you know a very good so I Want to thank you for that and I

between he and\nA Hillary Clinton [noise] what do you accept what he concede if he lost an election night I'll let you find out I'll keep you in suspense\nTrump miss she be asleep said so I'm the Obama White house according to interviews with former aides Ben Rhodes and Jen Psaki or came up with a plan\nThis is so funny I mean if you can't make up stuff like this\nThe premise of the plan was that if Trump would not accept the results of the election there might be a great number of people\nYou know die hard Trump fans\nWho also would not accept as legitimate the election of Hillary Clinton\nTherefore and this was too big a job even for President Obama himself as much as his aides you know idolized him if they even they had to admit who he's going to need help getting the American people to swallow\nThis this pill of the election results so the plan first reported in New York magazine was to um recruit prominence Republicans\nIncluding ... rice and Colin Powell as well

you think about that to ten five nine fifty five fifty five at first blush I liked the idea but then I have to stop and you have to catch myself because this is me being spiteful and petty [noise]\nUm I'm actually against a mandatory drug testing for welfare recipients anyway it sounds good it sounds like a great idea it gets people very excited\nUm but to me it's\nBig brother it's intrusive government if the government wants to help people help them if you don't want to help them don't help them but using the fact that you're helping them as an excuse to be big brother is just creepy and and not necessary and\nUh I wouldn't do it so I'm not in favor of that um as far as mandatory trusting for a mandatory drug testing for our politicians I I'm almost afraid of what we would find out to be honest I think we would probably not be\nHappy with the results may maybe it's better if we don't know in this case but we'll see what happens he's apparently I'm reading here this guy's propose this before and had no success and of course not because\nThe people he's proposing to test of the people whose votes\nHe would need for the testing and that is not going to happen you know what you don't have to test these people for drugs clearly a number of numbers high as a kite okay look at the politicians look at the politicians we have look at the at what they're doing\nAnd you already have your answer the damn well better be drunk or high for what some of them are doing for just for the way some of them sound\nYou know you you don't need a urine test for that kind of like you can
