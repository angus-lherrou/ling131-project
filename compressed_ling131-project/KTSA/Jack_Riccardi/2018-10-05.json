{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KTSA", "content": "On the second amendment specifically in districts\nColumbia vehicular judge Kavanaugh wrote in deciding descending opinion that are less guns were regulated either at the time of the constitution was written or traditionally throughout history they cannot be regulated now\nAnd ... and his own words gun laws are unconstitutional unless they are quote traditional or common in the United states and quote\nJudge Kavanaugh would have struck down D.C.'s assault weapons ban\nBecause they have not historically been banned\nThis logic means that his weapons become more advanced and more dangerous they cannot be regulated at all\nWhen I ask judge Kavanaugh about his views that if a gun is income and use it cannot be regulated he replied this way and I quote there are millions and millions and millions of semi automatic rifles that are possessed\nSo that seemed to fit common use and not being a dangerous and unusual weapon and quote think about that\nJudge Kavanaugh made up a new standard that had nothing to do with common use\nBut instead relied on whether a gun is widely possessed and owned as determinative as to whether it is subject to any regulation the United states makes up four percent of a worldwide population but we own forty two percent of the world's guns\nBy judge Kavanaugh standard no state or locality will be able to place any limitation on guns because of widespread ownership in this country\nI'm also concerned about his views on presidential power\nSpecifically he has said that sitting presidents\nCannot be indicted cannot be prosecuted should not be investigated and should have the authority to fire a special counsel at will in other words\nThe president of United States is above and outside the law these views raised serious concerns\nThat should concern us all especially at a time when the president continually threatened was to fire the leadership of the department of justice for failing to be loyal and raining in the mall or investigation\nThese news alone or not sufficient for me to vote against judge Kavanaugh\nBut what we have seen and experienced in the past several weeks has raised serious new concerns concerns I Believe shouldn't worry is all\nJudges are expected to be quote even handed unbiased impartial and courteous and quote\nHowever at the hearing last week we saw a man filled with anger and aggression\nJudge Kavanaugh raised his voice he interrupted senators he accused of damage Democrats of quote lying in wait and quote and replacing quote advice and consent with search and destroy and quote he even went so far\nAs to say that Dr Ford's allegations\nWere nothing more than quote a calculated and orchestrated political hit\nFilled with pent up anger about President Trump and the two thousand sixteen election and quote\nQuote revenge on behalf of the Clintons and close\nHow quickly this behavior revealed hostility and belligerence that is and becoming of someone seeking to be elevated to the United States Supreme court his display was so shocking that more than two thousand four hundred law professors\nFrom around the country have expressed their opposition\nThey wrote and I quote instead of trying to sort out with reason and care the allegations that were raised\nJudge Kavanaugh responded in temperate inflammatory and partial manner as he interrupted and at times was disc courteous to senators and close\nThe professors concluded and I quote we have different views about other qualifications of judge Kavanaugh but we are United\nAs professor of law and scholars of judicial institutions in believing he did not display the impartiality and judicial temperament requisite to sit on the highest court of our land\n... madam president I asked unanimous consent to enter a full copy of the letter or in the records without objection thank you\n... speaking I don't want to say San Antonio\nCredible allegations raised by Dr Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez the two women who came forward to tell their experiences facing sexual assault\nWhen Dr Ford decided to make her story public she faced all her worst fears she was harassed\nShe received death threats she had to relocate her home her husband and two children and yet in less than a week she came before the Senate and told Twenty one senator she had never met along with millions of Americans about the most tragic\nTraumatic and difficult experience of her life\nAnd she did so with toys grace and most importantly bravery\nUnfortunately she was met with partisanship and hostility my Republican colleagues have largely chosen to ignore her powerful testimony senators weren't allowed to hear from any witnesses who could corroborate or refute her account\nThey refused to gather evidence or doing impartial investigation into her allegations\nDeborah mirrors also reluctantly came forward to tell her story like Dr for Mr mirrors offered to speak to the FBI bowls\nFord and Ramirez submitted evidence to support their allegations including naming over two dozen witnesses each\nUnfortunately the limited investigation that was conducted by the FBI failed to interview any one of the witnesses these two women identify who could support her account\nLet me say that again they refuse to investigate to talk with any of the twenty four witnesses that could have supported their account\nMr President I think it's important to remember why we're here today\nWe're here to determine whether judge Kavanaugh has demonstrated the impartiality the temperament the even handedness\nThat's needed to serve on less grades high court of our land KTBS ... joined eight other individuals\nWho are charged with deciding how the laws of our land are interpreted and applied he would be a deciding vote on the most important issues affecting our country\nAnd every American for generations to come\nMr President madam president based on all the factors we have before us I Do not believe judge Kavanaugh has earned this seat thank you\n[noise]\n\nYou've been listening to Dianne Feinstein up talking before a key votes in Nebraska Kavanaugh Supreme Court battle\nThat's about to take place isn't it will hold a procedural vote this morning at nine thirty our time which will determine whether the nomination advances to a final floor vote and all eyes will be an GOP Senator Susan Collins of Maine Lisa Murkowski of Alaska\nAnd Jeff Flake of Arizona they have not indicated yet which way they will vote West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin vote\nMay also be in place in Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh defending his testimony in a Senate hearing to address allegations of sexual assault\nWriting in the wall Street Journal cabinet noted that during last week's hearing he was more emotional than he's ever been and he admitted that he might have been too emotional at times and then he said a few things he shouldn't have\nAnd other news this morning the nation's unemployment rate is low lowest in almost half a century the Labor Department reports this morning that the jobless rate fell to a three point seven percent in September\nThat is the lowest since Nineteen sixty nine however job growth was nothing to write home about the economy added only about one hundred thirty four thousand jobs last month\nHere at home I'm an faces a de W I charge after crashing into one on one side of home the driver veered off the street had to carbon crashed through the front of the home unclear like Dr near Scarsdale happen around three thirty this morning a woman was sleeping in the bedroom and the vehicle hit her house nobody was hurt\nThe firefighters union boss called a news conference but then failed to answer questions from reporters listen as Chris steel ignores a reporter's question about the recording in which seal called Greg brought house our die as the next mayor\nAnd there's a lot of reasons for that and we won't get into it now but one thing that's becoming clearer and um this may come out after the vote on Kavanaugh so cabinet may already have been voted on and some days may go by before we really get full clarity on this and maybe we never will but it's now starting to look to Wall Street journal did a story among others\nIt's starting to look like I'm One of the things the FBI investigation discovered was that\nAllies of Christine Blasey Ford were pressuring the witnesses to change their stories you remember that the witnesses are not corroborating Ford's account of what happened that night in Nineteen eighty two\nAt least one of them Leland teaser or Kaiser who was for its best friend uh two years younger than her so but Thirteen [noise] uh was apparently pressured\nTo say that she remembered the party\nAnd there's a woman that used to work for the FBI named McClain who was working with Dr for his legal team who may have coached Dr Ford in her polygraph test and who may have also been used to try to pressure\nWitnesses to change their story other words during the ... extra week that Jeff Flake roof requested in God\nThere may have been an effort to\nCause people who had already given testimony who had already said wasn't there didn't happen don't remember it didn't see it can't corroborated don't know Brett Kavanaugh\nTo change what they would now till the FBI agents in this past week\nWhen all is said and done\nJust like with the Russia collusion investigation I think we're going to discover that the people who called for an investigation are the ones who need\nTo be investigated\nAnd this is becoming a pattern I I hate to say it but it does begin to look like when Democrats demand\nHearings and\nSpecial prosecutors and investigations it is a distraction it is a deflection from what they know they have done\nThey looted against Donald Trump in the twenty sixteen election and they may have colluded with one or more of the potential witnesses and Dr ... testimony is very serious stuff is this the kind of thing that needs to be\nYou know solved and brought out regardless of what happens to the judge and his vote on Saturday to ten five nine nine fifty

Carlos ... um I Want to talk about the actual debate over cabinet but first there's a lot of speculation that the outrage over this might actually awake in\nA Republican voters who have been lagging democratic voters big time in all the generic ballots in voter enthusiasm um how do you see that playing and does it matter\nWhether or not he's confirmed as there were two people stay angry for the next month if he is confirmed and are there really that many people who will be that angry that they will come out and say I may not be crazy about my local Republican but I just I got to send a message and this is the only way I Know how to do it\nWell when I ah this past week I'm One of our family friends came over a to pick up some ... she and she would never talk politics and she said oh it's horrible what they're doing to him you know how can you be taken out stuff from\nFrom when you are and kids you know where we all that crazy stuff like you know what's the point of that and I had never really heard her talk like that and so then I thought okay that she's she doesn't like the ... I don't think she's I don't know what what party she's only I didn't even know how she votes but she she brought that up\nSo then I just said well you know people are noticing so so then I said but do you know that you know he's not too good on\nThe Fourth Amendment and he might not be too good on torture and he you know um he doesn't ... you know you're talking about the procedures and due process he might not to be good and then she kind of was like\nOh I didn't know that was like yeah so I was like you know it's karma sometimes I mean there's just the way it goes it and then I kind of but people aren't getting that message what I'm saying is that people are are like upset about it so yeah some random ... some random conversation that we've never talked politics she brought it up so yeah there's that will have\nAn adult and White House read your your book to you on national television is karma for all your role in the Fourth Amendment that's just flat out that bleep crazy is what that\nIs the argument is not God the arguments being made that oh there are innocent until proven guilty but uh you know I mean the fending on you know no I Do kind of see it like climate yeah yeah you can't go out there a voting or or or or having rulings that aren't that that that that are in favor of the Fourth Amendment as much as it should be and then you want to\nStrike down the Fourth Amendment I may have had a ruling that you disagree with on the Fourth Amendment for the Fourth Amendment still exists ... re innocent until proven guilty if idol is still the premise here\nBut I mean he was still okay for the ... end up in a detention he was there during the Bush era torture stuff I mean he's not like the Trump can pick somebody better like I'm not I'm not that impressed with the with what the pick\nI understand that I read your Facebook posts about that but my question is really and and so you started to answer it are there are people noticing the wave is has gone yes the will of the\nUh motivated more motivated um because clearly without that this was shaping up at the right to be a a a not a good year for Republicans\nYeah well first of all I I feel guilty hearing Capitol saw because my Facebook posts are about how the grill with my car to become a graveyard for butterflies\n[laughter] while at a set with it okay [laughter] um no it's it's it's been yeah it's a difficult it's a challenge on the Republican side you know the\nHistory working against them plus a lot of broken promises not really getting a lot done\nAnd there have been a couple of candidates on the Senate side in states like Indiana and Missouri where they thought those would already be put away and the Republicans would be way ahead and they might be a head they might be tied but

you um would you be comfortable please do not be specific [laughter] would you be comfortable with an examination of your youth to the degree and detail that Brett Kavanaugh's\nWas um [noise] explored for for a lifetime\nPosition and I've been don't matter what doesn't matter what I just if if we if we did this is your life right now we brought in everybody and we had all the ... would you be

did I looked at my you're where it's been very but I Would not mind to not be in for him and I think you know I had a lot of friends but uh no I I have no no scale carry I Would be that there's always some things that you would be uncomfortable and embarrassing but nothing that would I Would make me\nA field that I Shane my family anything like\nThat so how should they have handled this um\nWell there's conflicting information because some people said that the FBI normally doesn't go back to prior to your Eighteenth birthday I'm but yet they did go back you know with him in high school but that I Believe that was because that's when the specific allegation occur\nBut I'm saying though is okay so you're up for Europe for a lifetime appointment\nAn accuser comes forward or accusers come forward\nUm could we all agree that there's a better way this could have been handled that safe to say and I we don't all agree on him and ... but I mean ... this could have been ... so what are some things that would have been better helped me out here how could how could this have been less digesting\nThan it's been I guess with three accusers I Would question I mean the vetting that was done on him before he was appointed\nUm [laughter] because usually with that sort of thing now maybe none of them made any of the allegations public until they saw him on the short list or until he actually became the nominee I'm\nIn fact didn't Dr Ford say she wanted to um put this out there before he was chosen when she knew that he was on the short ... yes I Believe that the the controversy about about Feinstein sitting on it it it you know had had it been dealt with sooner or in theory we would've known this before he was chosen\nRight away to college I mean you're trying to say like what to to to how how would you handle it meaning like behind closed doors and stuff like that but then he said if you\nIf this turned up in the vetting chances are they would have just moved\nOn to another name on the list I don't think they would have got I don't think they were all in on Kavanaugh they just he looked like a loud I on the list on that list and you you know if one of them was a\nBoy Scout versus I'm somebody who had something come up in their FBI background then you have to weigh how badly do I want this\nPerson was he the best and the list I mean I thought he was like a package deal with Kennedy resigned what I'm saying is\nWhat I'm saying is if for my understanding is that FBI background or reports go to the Senate they go to the White House and they go to the Senate or the White House gives them to the Senate they're usually confidential\nThey're not made public they're not discussed in the public sessions or the ... committee has ... ... is that for example or a for

Saturday and things yeah I'm right here on ... [noise]\nAnd he said these are people by the way some of them voted for um Obama in two thousand and eight and Romney in two thousand and twelve and Trump in two thousand and sixteen and to the meaning of people that would make no sense that's total incoherent but he said to a lot of people that made perfect sense they have their reasons they knew what they were doing\nThey were voting their pocket book\nAnd um the reason I bring that up is because I think that that is what is being missed in both the cabin a story and in the city charter amendments\nLet me talk about the Kavanaugh story first\nWith all due respect to the folks we haven't been doing for today I don't think they get it uh people are way more angry about this than they realize I'm not predicting numbers or any particular races but on election night where there are surprises the surprises will be\nPeople that are fed up sickened\nWhat happened was cabin up by the way it has nothing to do with believing Dr Christine Ford it has nothing to do with believing Brett Kavanaugh or I shouldn't say it has nothing\nDid did with it may not have everything to do with believing them\nI mean people all the time who say I don't know who's telling the truth but what they did to that man was disgusting or the way that the Democrats used her this broken woman this this terrified to be on live television woman the way they used her\nThe way they smeared him the way they kept moving the goalposts first it was about the jurisprudence then it was about sexual assault than it was about drinking then it was about temperament\nNo they've made people angry\nAnd then rubbed salt in the wound by telling them that if they are angry and if they are not opposing Brett Kavanaugh that means they're rape enablers\nYou can't tell millions of people in Ohio and Texas that their sexual deviant some perverse because they don't see this the way you do but that's exactly the messaging of the Democratic\nMedia now about the charter amendments it\nHas become clear that the firefighters union and the union president has his own agenda here\nOkay\nIf this is a surprise to you where the hell have you been poor yourself a big strong cup of black coffee and wake up because people that run public sector unions yeah they're they're looking out for their own interests you you didn't know that you you weren't aware of that okay now you know right okay\nHere's the thing it doesn't matter why Chris steel is pushing these things it doesn't matter that Chris steel is pushing them it doesn't matter that he got outside help doing it what matters is when people hear about the charter amendments they go yeah\nHell yeah we gotta we gotta put some kind of cap on the city manager salary or it's going to look like we're paying a major league shortstop\nAnd yeah I Do want there to be a ... government by referendum I Do want to be able to challenge things and put things on the ballot if I Can't get people at city hall to listen to me\nAnd yes I Do want some answers and I do want some accountability [noise]\nAnd when you look at the way that the charter amendments are being opposed it's all the usual suspects no offense\nBut it's it's the beautiful people you know it's the movers and shakers the politicians the perennial candidates the they used to be in office the still in office the people that pay for these campaigns the people that\nYou know go to the right oh nine parties and I'm not against them and I'm not hostile I don't mean to sound that way every city has you know kind of an aristocracy in San Antonio is no different\n[noise] but when you see all those people come out and stand shoulder to shoulder against the charter amendments what it says to a lot of people is oh I must be barking up the right tree because look at who have made angry look at who I've got stir it up\nAnd when they're telling me you better not do this it will be the ruin of our city that sounds like desperation I must be I must be voting for the right things these must be the right things to do because look at who's upset look at who's worried and they don't even know\nHow that looks they don't even know the message they're sending and instead of meeting people halfway or acknowledging the anger they dismiss it they'd be little it\nSo I don't think anybody here in San Antonio I don't think the mayor or any of the the big money people that are fighting the charter amendments I don't believe any of them have used the word deplorable\nBut you can kind of hear it right just like with Brett Kavanaugh if you didn't swallow the\nCNN MSNBC version of this hook line and sinker oh well maybe you're a rapist maybe you're a rape enabler maybe you don't believe any women maybe you don't care about the women in your lives maybe you just want to hurt women I mean this is when you were given that choice\n\nAnd you have to choose one or the other you know what happens you choose one or the other so I think the opposition to the charter amendments is driving people into the arms of the charter amendments not making any predictions but I Do think that's what's happening right now and I do think the opposition to cabinet is driving\nPeople to the polls who might not have voted for might not have voted the whole ticket and now we'll see something when you think about that will come back after the news get some phone calls [noise]\nHi straight we're living in San Antonio where we have hard water an aloe water self interest is all about taking care of that for you these great water soften areas

Democrats to the latest chapter ...\nWell I think one thing they did was they really over promised and under the under delivered you know they they they made it out like if we gave them all this extra time we'd find out that we had Jack the ripper you know are here for the Supreme Court and and they they fell on their face\nYeah I agree and and you know it's unfortunate because it's cause so many

qualify\nIt is called a ... a because he was angry during his testimony and who the who plays the guy um it's just these these silly excuses by Democrats there so that they lost twenty six team that they have just gone off the rails\nYeah thank you Brian appreciate hearing from you or have a good weekend you know the the anger of Brett Kavanaugh was authentic to me I don't know how it struck you\nIt may not have been the right thing to do or he may be reconsidering it now I'm Wondering if he wrote the wall Street Journal piece where he kind of walks back a little bit because he was told hey there are a couple of Senate votes you might be able to salvage if you express some remorse and so he did but I look I thought it was authentic\nI was waiting for it I was getting a I don't know to me and I don't know the man and I I you know I'm not saying I Do um I was waiting for a reaction that I Would recognize as\nAs a father and as somebody that um would be outraged and a furious with people ... you know playing games not seeking justice but playing games ... who thought the smearing me and ruining me\nWould be in good fun and would be the means to their end and it would be no different than if you killed somebody because you wanted to achieve something or get somewhere\nUm\nAh to me they they over promised\nThey under delivered when they tried to bring forth more people to say look there's a pattern the only pattern they brought forward was people that were less and less believable and less and less\nUm corroborated it didn't make Christine fourth story look better at
