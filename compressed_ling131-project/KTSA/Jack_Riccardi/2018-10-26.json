I don't know um\nI'm I'm I'm I'm looking at the pictures the fact that the pictures came out every expert we've talked to says you would not release photographs during the investigation going on here is going on here what is going on you know almost like the people handling this already know that these are not yeah ... yeah\nWell NBC has reported that they already know that several of them are not functional and I you know I I'm sure you're getting emails from your listeners as well I'm getting them from mine that are saying things like this is another Democrat ploy on the election and once again because now we're up to twelve ...\nOnce again or overplay their hand I Would say ... it's it's wrong to blame Trump and it's wrong to blame the Democrats because we don't know yes right but it could be that grabs certainly keeping an open I might as well my answer to them so far has been I don't know it it you know a body well really though it's it's whoever it is\nIs I'm responsible for sending these and we're not going to have this whole class action\nEverybody with the same last name is to blame or everybody from that state is to blame or everybody that voted that way is to blame\nThat's not how this works what ... what do you think the chances are we ever find out I think it's a pretty good chance I mean you know a lot of these hoaxes around college campuses where people say oh racist stuff was print was painted on my dorm room door or my office door\nHow often do they find out the person complaining is the one that did it\nSo if these things are an art so far they have not gone off thank God\nAnd if they did not have the ability to go off that somebody is either playing a hoax and they're getting their Jollies watching the television right now right oh no I'm just only out of possibilities right or they're doing it to benefit whom ... who does this benefits so ... if that's the case now you've got to consider some some other options out there and you get into\nSome wild conspiracy theories at that time but everything\nHas to be on the table the problem we have today is we always have to have a narrative or jak\nSo I was listening to Liz monitoring ABC 'cause my officers right behind where's your assets\nAnd NBC has asked keep correcting its own reporting right because they keep rushing on the air ... restless sleep with another advice and they lose count All right and and basically and and and and it's not just them I mean a lot of people are losing count but\nWe we have to have this ongoing narrative where we don't stop and take the time and do the journalists well and that's the other thing that feeds into the conspiracy theories\nHere because the media immediately and I got a press conference a parent a few minutes and YPG they immediately had a a narrative that they went with and they all seem to be having\nThe Senate why some to me that's why people are wondering if this is self inflicted because the narrative sprung up so quickly I was like it was waiting immediately they had\nTheir talking points and they were all on the same talking points and then immediately other schools on the TV where Trump targeting rush are receiving these these are Trump targets so I you know that's what ... that's what feeds the conspiracy theory out\nThere um I Hope we're going to find out I Am content to wait until we find out I hate to think that we might not find out as was the case with the Unabomber for a long time also hate to think that maybe there are people in the federal government that will not let all of them out because it damages their agenda\nAnd possibly damages the president you know ... as well\nUm the other thing real quick is a ... when you and I spoke twenty four hours ago um we were taught about a clarification coming from essay pd we had a clarification didn't weigh right the chief backs this whole thing about ban on cops from the bowling ... he didn't back it up you didn't say no we got to let these guys do their patrol\nIt was the opposite of that you guys stay away 'cause you're intimidating voters possibly just\nUnbelievable I I've tried I've tried and tried to give this the benefit of the doubt and give him the benefit of the doubt but just unbelievable right\nAm now putting it my own personal ... in a stack over here that says San Antonio's a sanctuary city yeah that's where I have no and number two that there is a congressman this is my own personal opinion looking for a fall guy and it's very convenient for the cops to be a democratic congressman is fall guy right if

fifty K. the essay and if I'm On a seven one gang for for a friday morning\nWe talk about all of the stories of the week and anything that's going on as we get on the air which today has been a lot there is a suspect are under arrest in plantation\nFlorida and a white van covered with some kind of stickers that was parked outside an auto zone a like a white like a like a passenger van a doesn't look like the commercials and it looks almost like a conversion a van\nA that's been covered with a blue tarp and loaded onto a flatbed presumably just as an abundance of caution and cases anything in there that would be dangerous and no details yet on the identity of this person\nTaken into custody and as you just heard from ABC News uh there is also now reports of a of a thirteenth device that may have been addressed California senator Kamala Harris\nA backup gang of four um will continue to follow the story and watch what's going on another big story this week here in San Antonio was the Joaquin Castro tweet about seeing a police cruiser in the parking lot at Les ... early voting was getting under way on Monday\nThat then lead to we're not exactly sure how a policy directive from the\nAh San Antonio police department brass to their officers to stay away from patrolling through or parking near early polling places um even though a in researching this there is absolutely no guidance from the secretary of state's office\nThat would suggest that a police officers aren't supposed to be near a polling place in fact\nThe secretary of state was asked in February or if it is a okay for a police officer in uniform to go and vote\nAnd it is seeking park has crews are in the parking lot you can vote in uniform so um there's two parts to this story first what is walking Castro's beef with seeing a police car in that parking\nLot well I mean he clearly overreacted in in this case and I think it was a mistake on his part um and uh I yesterday I talked with Jackie ... who's the mayor county elections administrator and um you know my my understanding is that\nUm ... the police officers for one thing they have a substation like down the street so they are there in that area rural area property crime problem in that shopping down as right and so that's one thing but for another thing they are they're actually doing the elections office a favor or when they go to that that site because\nThat a lot of ... a polling side is known for having so many campaign signs out there day becomes a visibility problems for drivers coming in and out they've had a lot of accidents with people trying to exit and or come in\nAnd so police officers have routinely over the years\nAnd it made the rounds there just to make sure that everybody's getting in and out okay rather parking no parking issues or as you said to me with ... we had long lines early this week he was there on Monday and if you've got people waiting in line for two hours you might want to check to make sure that no one is is that there is no fat or are you\nGuys around now I I passed by the recall a library routinely on my way to work then I mean today this morning was at seven thirty this morning and there was a line out that yeah right okay so I mean there are traffic issues because a lot of these early polling places like propel library\nSalt two lane streets around there and all residential parking is not there is not expensive parking that area that bad\nParts of the issues for that early polling places from time immemorial [laughter]\nSo it would make sense that there should be some presence in that manner so that they can they can provide for some order we let my mother on eight let me let me bring this\nBack to before we get to the piece about what the police do it or not doing I don't want to leave ... a walking Castro just yet\nLet's remember that this tweet\nComes right on the heels Gilbert of that bizarre appearance he made on one of the news networks where he said that Jared Kushner had created a hit list and\nUh that got to the Saudi kingdom that led to the Saudis killing a hug ... like that was a that wasn't overreacting or heat of the moment\nThat was just a bizarre overreach in my opinion by somebody who I think is trying to just step up to the next level and in his party right now that kind of extremism is in vogue I think he's trying to to to sort of you know\nBut he came to the attention of authorities of who we are tracking cell phone calls so whether this means that he was in communication with somebody else involved in this plot or or what I don't know is somehow guys when I hear that I think that well if they're tracking you\nBased on cell phone communications then you're talking to somebody about what you're doing which would sound like there's more than one\nPerson involved and although it's believable that one person could make all the devices it is a little hard to believe\nThat one person could also be ... you know personally handling or delivering a some of these as is rumored so again more answers coming up at a news conference this afternoon and it'll be around one thirty our time and we'll bring you that as a live event\nHere on K TSA um so we were a and we're gonna continue to follow that story we've been talking about the order to uh stand down from a polling places that are cheap McManus confirmed again this morning is the is the policy\nUm and ah Gilbert we were talking about the history yeah it's it's a fairly long ago history of police officers being used in Jim Crow states yet to intimidate minority voters but I mean realistically in this day and age with what's going on right now in the news with the with the the political\nA heat turned away up um it seems to me that a more ... what's offsets the\nAncient history angle is you want to keep polling place is safe you want them to be safe traffic wise you want them to be safe from anybody that might attack those long lines outside the buildings I just don't know how you make the argument whether you're the police chief for the congressmen or that we're better off with the police staying away from\nUs I was I I think that the police have some you know some simply way to do what to do their jobs\nI I don't think anybody really wants to see police officers standing in front of a police that in the building spelling of voters or something like that I don't I don't think that they ought to be in the position of enforcing a you know the\nUh you know the the voting laws I mean these are ... administrators and if an individual police officer cross the line which we have not had in San Antonio that to my knowledge or this year or ... recently\nUm then do you deal with it you deal with that one is that here but just simply see a couple of police officers patrolling around the parking lot just making sure everything's okay and then to immediately say will do to make the assumption\nThis is this is bad and anybody else who sees this you know let me know because that I think that was was wrong and and I think ... the police chiefs response\nWas wrong now where I voted and I don't know if this is true with other polling places I kept going at the same place conflicted in there and yesterday I finally started as from what I'm saying we're more days trying to get into the job and then finally yesterday I got in\nUm there was a table in a tent set up by the fire department or the firefighters and not the fire department but by the firefighters\nUm hello\nWhy are we not talking about that that to me has more bearing on the vote that there is no police issue in this vote the police are not on the ballot so I think we're missing the story here trying to keep police officers and directing traffic or maintaining public safety around polling places\nI Wonder why no one is questioning that there they were they were\nYou know they had the fire department logos and clearly they were there and supportive ... out right now this election nearing the end and simple after you know I don't I didn't notice if they were I think\nThey were outside the string or the line or whatever you have all that they work yeah uh but I mean you know you could make that argument I just don't see how you make a credible\nModern day argument that police or intimidate\nVoting with you guys were ... we were talking about before I mean he was a large gathering of people here's a parking problems access problems visibility problems all kinds of what is not what's the reason why we shouldn't keep\nEye on that front ... earlier point I get what you're saying about voter suppression many many years ago but most people\nI I Would be quite honest most voters are ignorant to it they're not students of history like yourself or like the Castro brothers or whatever they just don't recognize it\nAnd and know that it was commonplace in the south so I don't really know that that's an argument that ... that people could use to say don't have the police there\nI really don't see any reason why there ... routine and regular patrols yes I don't want them standing in\nSide [noise] trying to keep order or whatever but I Do think there needs to be some kind of visibility so people know that seems seems completely natural\nIt also and it was ironic that we just went through a whole period in this country after the Stoneman Douglas shooting where many people said we need more police officers and more police presence around schools now there's also a history if you want to talk about history\nThe south of local law enforcement enforcing the segregation of and the bar against black students at the public schools so now do we have to say oh sorry because of that history they can help provide security they can no longer be part of the security picture at a high school I mean that's not actually there's I mean I think there's a there's\nThe school of thought that that if you have a you know that a police presence if it's that that it can be there they can be a feeling of maybe even intimidation for some voters ... and I I I think it is possible it that that can happen\nBut I don't think that simply having a couple of officers patrolling around and just checking on things um and they're not really getting in the way of voters are doing it you know I\nI just don't think that's the problem is it a bad look for the department Gilbert that\nWhether or not we ever can determine that that phone call was made it ... it's it's hard to avoid the judged opposing of his tweet and the issuance of that order it looks like they took orders from him it looks like he said jumping they said how high\nYeah I think I think that's right and and uh it is you've talked about on the show I mean there there has been a no love lost between the the uh you know the the the the rank and file a police officers and the police chief and um and I mean I think\nThis is ... you know this is another incidents where there's things that seemed to go on and the command level in the police department that they're not transparent about this year we had the issue before with the illegal aliens that were found in a truck\nA and they just assume I mean we at the chiefs direction were let go a but there's been you know there really was no investigation or accountability there now we have this issue where there were going to have no accountability again\nWill get the news will come right back yang for continues on our live coverage of this breaking story in Florida

TSA dot com story is moving very very quickly or as you just heard ABC News and\nSome other news organizations are identifying this suspect is fifty six year old says are say ... rock\nOf adventure of Florida a and that he is the man who owns this white conversion van that is literally covered with pictures photo color photos portraits\nAnd it'll get everybody that's connect this guy if there's anybody you know I basically anybody that they have a cold and it's going to be contacted then they'll decide you know whether they're really um a helping them or not or it's just a buddy who is working on his own\nYou know I'm just this case a reminds\nYou of any other recent cases I was thinking back a little bit to the guy that shot up the congressional baseball practice or he was very intensely political people who knew him thought he was kind of weird and his obsession he uh he ... he wars opinions on his sleeve\nUm he drove a van out there and and lived in the van before he attacked the baseball practice\nUm and the most salient thing about him was not really has political affiliations are connections but just that he was kind of off and and I don't know I look at this van and I just see somebody who doesn't look\nLike they're put together too tightly\nClearly this guy I mean if he doesn't have a mental his job to shock but but we got it already know he does because ... is a myth that they have said that he was somebody that was those in Florida to write letters to judges about crave it says so so that you know a profile somebody who's got\nA lot of issues babysitting paranoia psychologist but based on my long years of experience um that's that's more than likely true\nThey are the one thing that does remind me of it and I don't want to go off the reservation to for here but I always use the the Oklahoma City bombing as engaged because it was so horrendous and\n... remember Timothy McVeigh complaint basically was just that they felt that the current government at the time was\nYou know destroying the constitution and was going to let\nYou know I'm an ... basically let the UN come in and take over the country and those were his complaint says and and and the point I'm making is is that you know\nThis this person who's doing this is complaints may have been that these\nParticular politicians were doing stuff that he felt was detrimental to the constitution\nIt does I'm not saying he's right I'm saying ... you know this is one of the things that they thought that that that basically the Clinton Administration that he was punished and after the way they treated the um the Reverend down in Texas the incident where I'm I'm ... my mind what they is that it was gone\nYou know really rich ... and the other one um Waco\nWaco jail several so you know it's that mentality that somebody clearly he's going to have a lot of issues once they start release that his name the information it's going to be some calling us from that perspective is going to be fascinating\nYeah no it it does definitely a lot more to come out we're just at the very beginning of this but very burn thank you for your time and now it's a busy day few

news maker line All right so to catch you up if you just stepping out the door to grab lunch and you're hearing this for the first time all over the course of the last hour plus\nWe have been hearing about a a law enforcement operation in plantation Florida it's centered among other things on there were a few places on which centered one of them was the parking lot of an auto zone a down there\nOr where they uh had surrounded this white a conversion van that was backed into a parking space in a tree shaded parking lot\nA man had some kind of motorcycle or motorbike or dirt bike or on a trailer behind it\nAnd that was a covered with a tarp and taken away on a flatbed while they were driving in a way the tarp which hadn't been put on to well came off\nThe law enforcement convoy had to pull over to the side of the road to re attach the tar it's like you're taking your boat you know the lake and you don't put the tarp on right\nSo they pull over and with the ... you could clearly see and the Internet is a is now full of images of this van it has big a conversion type windows in the side every square inch of every ... piece of glass is completely covered over\nWith pictures of Trump a with a political slogans writings looks like some homemade stuff\nSome anti CNN an anti news media are stickers or stuff\nOn the back windows everything you look through the windshield and it's loaded over uh the dashboard is loaded over with some kind of I don't know debris or or stuff\nUm so ... ... a little bit of an insight may be based on that uh and then what little we know about this man is that he has a record of making threats against local law judges or politicians in his communities from aventura Florida\nI'm fifty six years old and we're expecting into what we have a news conference coming up around one thirty or one forty five\nOr where we'll get more information about all of this the president announcing that arrest at an event that was pre scheduled at the White House are

that would suggest to the radio hosts for example what little tad event so that's where I Would think ah the idea of bringing up what happened with somebody else Bartlett senator somebody else is kind of silly\nOr less focus on what is and that's it we don't have to go to all these other\nThat may have reason I brought that up was because of the reason I brought that up bill was because um when it came to light that the guy that shot up the baseball practice was a Bernie Sanders supporter there were people who said\nAhah well there you go uh he uh he did this because he supports Bernie Sanders but when we look more closely at his record or his biography\nWas more salient then has supported Bernie Sanders was that he was pretty unhinged or he had an obsessive a way about him he was known in his community for saying some wild things are writing some\nWild letters to the editor he lived in the van while he was stocking this baseball practice\nAnd so to me that made those things were more I think salient and understanding what he did then how you voted in the last election and so what I'm saying in this case is rather than make this guy in the white van a stand in for Trump voters I think you can look at him and say he's a pretty odd ducks from what we're seeing so far\nWhile I Would agree I I Would think that right and let us to the edited a say in the wild things a lot of

the same thing we're both saying that when you look at a person who's conduct seems a little off beam\nThat probably explains they're resorting to violence rather than how they voted in the last election I think we're saying the same thing but as usual with you you just want an argument and I hope it made you feel better that you got one\nUm you started out by saying like politics aside
