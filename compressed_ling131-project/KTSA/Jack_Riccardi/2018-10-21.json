the landscape let me tell you fall fertilizing just cannot be over emphasized is the single most important time of the year and that takes a lot of people by surprise because you think oh spring when everything's just coming out\nThat's the time to fertilize well it's a good time to fertilize and the spring as well\nBut fall by feeding in the fall you give your plants the nutrients you allow them to process the nutrients to increase or cold hardy nest and to be ready for that spring birth to grow shrink fertilizing actually does more to benefit your summer growth and it does this spring borough so don't put it off\nMedina has other growing dream fertilizer certified organic good for everything from the vegetable garden your shade trees and everything in between easy to use certified organic non burning can be used for the leaves are wet or dry it just didn't do any good in the bag you got to get it and put it out\nThere there are lots of different varieties and every one of them are wonderful flavor and wonderful tree\nK winter gardening with kids what are your top three or four things that'd be fun for them to do that'd be the first\nOh radishes radishes or at the top of the list any kid can grow a great crop or radishes and thirty days and that has to be\nYou know right up right up close to the top uh broccoli is a great\nI'm planning to grow where they can harvest that one central head and then have a little side she's come out for weeks afterwards they can be harvesting and a and there's some fun things to do with broccoli if they don't think they'd like broccoli learn how to make a good holidays you'll get them hooked on broccoli\nI'm a you know other root vegetables everybody wants to grow carrots and carrots for fun but that can be a little bit more challenging because you really have to than them out um leafy vegetables like a lettuce and spinach um bright lights charred would be a fun one to grow for kids is a\nA chart is good to begin with but uh the bright lights form some of the plants will have leaves for the veins are brilliant goals some of them will be orange of them will be yellow some of the be ruby red\nA bright lights charred is one of the most colorful plans to kids could plant and it's also ... you know other than the potential of staying too wet it's a very very easy garden plant for fall quite cold hardy I'm actually headed live as much as two and three years in my garden\nOh flour and options\nCauliflower is an option the thing about cauliflower unlike broccoli is you get one nice big head after you've cut that off pull it up and plant something else uh the only reason I suggest your broccoli is it continues to produce little edible side shoots after you harvest the main head but uh\nUh cauliflower is a good choice and you can teach the kids something with it in that as the as the cauliflower head start to develop you need to take the leaves surrounded and pull 'em up over it to make sort of a sunscreen\nBecause the developing portion of the cauliflower that we eat is very very sensitive to some burn doesn't change the quality but it sure does change too much less attractive thing when it gets brown sunburn spots on it on the other hand with cauliflower you can grow\nSome fund new varieties there's an orange from coal cheddar there is a purple one\nAnd uh you can you can create quite a colorful pilot in the garden with some of the different cauliflower variety so yeah it's a fine went on and there there's not a plant out there that I don't think has some good characteristics uh to it but um you know it's just\nYou choose what you think the kids will eat so that they can enjoy the benefit\nOf a growing in the garden but um you know for a good gardener like yourself you should be successful with any of them\nWas the best time to destroy ever get them in the ground\nOr ... ... the people tell me the best month to plant them is November but I think October November you're not going to get production till spring but if you plant this time of year they are totally cold hardy you'll get a lot more berries next spring than if you wait until February to plan a\nVery good thank you so much for\nGreat questions good luck with kids good luck with your project bearing appreciate the Gulf\nBy All right I got to do a little break here's on is up next and then they end up with

thing there say and will they heat it so much to put it through the screwdriver to chop it to make capital and is just is taken all the nutrition out others making super hard making it super hard to digest\nAnd you know the way the article presents it\nIt makes it sound like your dog your cat just really can't live long if a writing kibble and I'm sitting here thinking gosh you and I and many friends have had both dogs and cats it lived long healthy totally normal lives eating Campbell row it couldn't be all that bad but I just wondered what your take\nOn that I've had that I've had that conversation with somebody actually on air one time for cats would dry food versus wet food and the concern about that in the car carbohydrates big time right and then and then I had the ... station with somebody they in him about it\nUm but you know ... you know you and I know we've seen animals on\nCable and we see animals doesn't mean that ... great for every animal some cats that I put him on canned food for a reason right but but I'm In the real world it's it's the reason they may Kimball was to make it easier in some ways to people to feed their pets and get them nutrition in a\nIn a compact form and canned food is great unless you leave it out all day and the cat does need it and then it becomes spoiled exactly so there's reasons we feed canned food um gosh you see all the answers we feed at the clinic\nWell that an animal is digestive issues that their teeth issues it can't chew and managed to cable anymore it's it's a great thing as ... animals I mean they just absolutely love it but\nBut it's too broad spectrum of our response to say no to cable that just ... you know it it doesn't work that wouldn't work it wouldn't work anyway but but now it's it's not that bad because I we have dogs that lived Fifteen sixteen Eighteen years on cable\nAnd that's what always you know makes you wonder I mean they present a a very scientific explanation this is why it's bad here's the protein that it destroyed and blah blah blah blah blah and you're thinking but in the real world the animals seem to do fine\nWriter and I do agree that there are probably some destruction of different proteins and things when they feed it and they have to these diet these science diet and ... and all of them they have to they've been around a long time it's not like they haven't studied the foods to try to find out what's nutritional\nIt wouldn't be very good for a diet and it wouldn't stick around very long and if that if I die was not nutritional and the animals did poorly that I wouldn't stick around them that arrangement tell people not to feed it and the owners would notice it\nExactly well and to you know is organic is I Am I\nKnow of some animals that have moved to a totally organic diet and gotten fat\nAnd asking somebody about it and they said oh yeah that's the highest calorie diet out there and um you know putting them back on and then there's so many different things and of course\nYou know there's so much research out there that\nI always remember that paper voucher professor gave me that was how to interpret scientific papers you know what it said and what it really mad\nAnd if it said samples saying see were chosen as being especially representative what that means is the others did not work out and therefore will be ignored\nYou know it's just different food to write for for for animals as and I'm treating each one is an individual yeah there is no if there was one dog food that worked for every dog one cat food that worked for every cat one bird seed that worked for every bird your life would\nBe a lot easier yes it did in my inventory would be better [laughter] yeah it will be a lot more manageable yes well it's just something that had come out question now and I have heard that and read about it and I've had people call me about it as well you bet ya well and the fact that it was the subject of a recent Merkel opposed to I'm\nSure there are a lot of people out there reading it scratching their heads that may or may not have access to someone that can give them the voice of a lot of experience and it was worth for him that started one fifth of course that's one reason we recommend top dog Diana because she knows nutrition and she can just tell you they will discuss the halal discuss it with you and\nThere may be animals that are going to do better on one diet that on another but ah surely you'll you'll get kind of information you'll never get the standard pet store\nThey're not going to get it all with radiation I can promise you won't happen and and the ... if they do they're going to burn something else that makes sense\nBecause you're you're having to treat all that area so\nThat so that'd be Seventeen immune support and at some point when they needed Rehman do I'm not sure about the ... and I'm not sure that I Would have ... they may have some other thing going on that they need it for that I don't know about\nIs there any risk a stitch shutting off the air way\nNot typically I've never seen that happen but if it got really really big gifts or would it would it would the where it sets it it can be so big that it would in Roche pond or a encroach upon that the trachea and put pressure but that's never really been our uh issue\nOkay and so the question is is this your daddy\nThat's why I can tell you what I Would do I do that I wouldn't first of all wouldn't cut it I wouldn't do radiation therapy and I sure wouldn't put chemo and it's not that you know chemo has its place I'm sure I just wouldn't be the one doing that I wouldn't choose that for my dog\nI Want my dogs do you live quality of life and linked live as long as it's comfortable um they don't need to be put through stuff just to put through because they'll tell you\nThat that chemo is palliative and radiation is palliative you're not going to cure especially if it's if it's too big to remove I think the longest living when I had was one that was small and was removed and live like four or five years I mean it did okay\nWhat would it be it'd be correct to say that you have a standard the life of a dog's with this problem as much with the Seventeen is you have seen done with the chemo and the reality show that has many many many fewer side effects ride much higher quality of life an\nEasier for everyone use it for the dog for the owner the whole bit\nOkay so there's nothing that shrink this\n... you might shrink parts of it down with radiation therapy and kill it with some radiation therapy but it's still there it's still there and so um you know they might want to if they want other opinions they can call the specially clinics for the radiation they call a and M. for ... therapy 'em and see what they have to say\nUm but if it's a too big to remove they're not going to get it all with radiation or chemo and it's going to be tough one without twelve year old dogs\nThere at diet you recommend\nOh you know I Want him on a good diet that they like that they will eat is there's no problems with eating right now and then whatsoever\nYeah so you know the the diet that they like I mean they do make indeed made for tumor dogs dogs with cancer and stuff like that but I'm In this case I just want them to eat I Want them to make sure they stay with something I don't want to be switching them and then they not like it\nAnd and um as far as you're not as ... as far as that be Seventeen um\nCan they can that they any vaccine get that and they can talk to their veterinarian about that and making you know still if they want to get more ideas they can call the specialty clinics and they can say well they'll do chemo or they'll do though like Austin will do the radiation rain and will do the radiation but um they they do want to look at\nThe ask him really about the quality of life with them and how much life they've given them with those with those modalities\nAnd you have the benefits you've just seen a lot of dogs you are very experienced that you're not an old man but you\nHave ... of all a lot of salads and I remember star now with our roads are a long time ago where some of them are just they're just so difficult I mean even if you try to cut them they just they're difficult tumors period just difficult\nWell I remember way Dixie was diagnosed with bladder cancer like remember cursing your name a little bit because he told\nSee and I have to now is the best advice\nYeah in that case was yeah that was already you know there's

[noise] they're not mad at you\nThey're mad the overpaid on a used car because they didn't go to ...\nDot com [noise] our facts has a better way\nTo see if that would work for it um doesn't work for all of them could work for them for sometimes I'll just tell you that if my cat does it consistently and it's in my house he's going to go outside 'cause he's going to ruin your house\nThat that's what that's why I'm almost\nYeah 'cause it 'cause it it does happen I I Love cash my cat but about two years into it he just started marking the house and you can't do that you can't\nYeah and you know there's nothing worked for him so perhaps it in all those pheromones and all that stuff nothing worked for him and typically they don't um and so again if if you want to use ... and you can ask\nYour veterinarian to try to name his main sometimes in the literature says sometimes it'll help and then there's another one another anti depressant that you could give I wouldn't give it but you could um\nAnd then in ... those don't work then you you make them an outdoor cat not because you want to but because there's no choice I mean they're going to mess up the house\nBut sometimes they can become an indoor outdoor cat sometimes he outside time will mediate that behavior to where they can behave themselves when they're inside so it's not like they're banned for that from the house forever\nAnd yeah that's and it works for most did not work for my cat if I can always out or if I let him in for a little bit he will do it I mean as soon as I like and so so usually something triggered this and this cat\nSo something like something changed in your household either you you did you have him first and then the end of the other cat oh\nNo no no my I had I had my old lady and [laughter] at our our our other inside cat passed on and I um\nHe when he said he was a rescue cat and about and that goes to couldn't keep them so it's like okay I had I had a lot that I had two cats already and it's like I said I have ... household\nAnd we all know that one [laughter] you know they're there to that\nI and he's adorable loving it wants to sit on your old\nYeah oh no I I Know and what color is what color is he back he's black okay yeah um\nAnd he's got a standing valley so I was right that there was something else going on ... he's got he got very round ... belly\nDoes he neutered yet yeah so neutering sometimes we'll do that too and he and he's been and he's on heartland prevention or young revolution or\nA yes or\nSomething like you know revolutions good for them you know protecting his heart worms and fleas and all that stuff ear mites yeah mhm yeah\nSo okay so so if he's on that and then you know of course have your veterinarian check them out to make sure but um if if he gets a urine culture and its negative\nThen it's all behavior period and then you then you decide you can use a sip or ... or you can just make him an outdoor cat and it's just that it held as a pill mhm they can probably haven't made up in different ways and you ...\nDo you think I can get a failed out there in the background for giving a cat a pill is a unique experience\nAnd that's the things you can have it made and you can have a compound it into something else but but but you know\nI'm not saying that one will work for you either because typically cats that are prone to that they keep on doing it they do\nI Know I I Know I just I just I knew when he first came many I didn't it didn't happen\nYeah yeah and then if they got into a couple of fight\nThere you go from something kind of set it off and then it then it becomes a behavioral challenge you know 'cause they're gonna like okay I'm Mark the area this is my area\nYet it's partly from having spent some time is probably a feral cat as well sometimes you can do it and that doesn't know anything except a a gentle home life and and then make the transition a little bit better but when they've had to fend for themselves outside they they develop some personality traits that are going to be very hard to ever change\nYeah oh boy you just kinda like emphasize what I was just they just acting\nOr no I'm Sorry to have to tell you that 'cause I Know how it is I mean you know you don't\nAnd then you might try that in and out routine wary you let them out like most of the day and then they come in at night maybe they won't do it that that is the only thing is is sometimes where they marched now becomes a prime target\nSo um there's uh what was that stuff nature nature miracle that you have I\nHave another and you're in a way they're three or four yeah grows better than average couple of days yeah\nOkay good good where you've worked on it I mean you've you've done it I mean uh it's just whether it'll work for you the again I wouldn't I wouldn't mind if you did talk to your veterinarian about ...\nI Would be interested to know if it worked for you or are they even recommended it there's another one you know anti depressant but I'm I'm not giving my cats and the other person's okay and then now they're already\n... you know unusual as it is and gives them the way they think and you give them an anti depressant I think you're just adding to that so yeah but the zipper ... reaction and it works on the main centers in the brain and\nSome sometimes that might help them in their thinking and so they're not as likely to Missouri toning centers to mark an area and but I Know that the feel away and\nI it you know it's scientifically it's very interesting to to use pheromones but it doesn't seem to work for us when these cats when mark where did he mark otherwise just real quickly where did you mark that\nThat I had a couple of thoughts by it was almost like he hit the\nBy the front door uh-huh because I said it's like the puddles of yellow on all day and then in the kitchen same kinda thing under the cabinet mhm uh and every once in awhile I'll find some in the bath tub yeah uh so\nThere for some reason there was an affinity for bathtubs I don't know what that is but there are just as the nation's project mind yeah that I can walk you know what you mean I don't\nKnow how I can handle it about that a lot to do it the same time they thought the honest spray it down\nThere you go ... go keep us posted let us know what works or doesn't work and what your vet says will always be interested in hearing back from you\nThank you so much salads had a great Sunday\nYou thank you and we'll do this again next week right here on K TSA radio San Antonio Texas\nFrom ABC

gotten into with them in southern Mexico\nTo I don't know exactly where they're going they say they're going towards Mexico City and maybe beyond many of them say they want to stay in Mexico not go north\nTowards the U.S but they still have at least Eighteen hundred miles to go before reaching the U.S border many well obviously stop long before they reach it they say and they are chanting we are

I\nI think everyone is aware at this point that if you're going to try and live our Social Security you're going to have a lifestyle vastly reduced from what you're used to living\n[noise] so she goes on to say that if you think you'll need a total of fifty thousand dollars a year to get by on retirement and you expect to get twenty thousand from Social Security so already\nShe warns us to be conservative and then she's bumped up that average is Seventeen to twenty thousand that's an Eighteen percent increase\nSo she's already using a number from Social Security that's Eighteen percent higher than the average Social Security benefits but we'll just go with her numbers for the sake of of this analogy\nThen you need to figure out where the other thirty thousand is coming from\nAll right and remember the fifty thousand dollars will be taxed at regular income income tax rates so in twenty Eighteen the effective tax rate on fifty thousand dollars the federal tax write forget state is just over eleven percent\nThat's five thousand five hundred dollars so now you're actually living on forty four thousand five hundred dollars and we began the exercise by saying you need fifty thousand to live on that should be what you clear after all expenses right all taxes and and insurance and\nMedical right but already\nWe're down to forty four thousand five hundred because you're going to be taxed on your Social Security and you're going to be taxed on the money you take out of your ...\nRolling cat that's the whole point is deferred taxation not tax free money\nAll right and then\nTo get an idea of how big of a nest egg you need to generate the income you need you can use the imperfect but still helpful four percent\nRule except for those of you haven't heard this from your financial planner the ideas that your going to live off four percent of your IRA every year so you're going to start drawing down that IRA by four percent a year\n... you're going to have inflation\nBut hopefully you're making something in that IRA and uh hopefully you won't hit a market crashed but just for simplicity we won't talk about that at the moment so then you're going to calculate that nest egg to generate the income you'll need by multiplying you're needed annual income by twenty fight\nTo get your savings target All right so I suppose after twenty five years we're going to die that's the plan\nI bet assuming at a four percent withdrawal rate if you need to generate thirty thousand dollars in income to add to your Social Security\nThing you'll need to say seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars as sending a four percent withdrawal right\nOkay this is all kinds of wrong and we're going to come back and talk more about it but it's time for a short break

R. IRA at a rate of four percent a year\nAnd before we get back into the details if you'd like to ask a question on the air you can give me a call at eight seven seven seven eleven fifty two eleven

multifamily\nFor retirement and uh so you can decide how that works out for you based on your current lifestyle and they're going through the numbers and and recommending\nThe best path for you to follow which is a four one K. investment they're assuming that you're going to make eight percent a year\nEvery year for twenty five years and that if you do that you'll have about seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars\nIn your IRA when you go to retire and you'll drop back down at four percent a year now hopefully you've got that invested in something that is still making some money through your retirement ears and hopefully you haven't run into the cyclical\nCrashes that take anywhere from twenty to eighty percent\nOf your money and evaporated overnight and we've all seen that happen baby boomers right now are suffering big time because they had been through multiple crashes and a severe recession\nSo we're going what they really pie in the sky a example here and yet it still doesn't work so you've got fifty thousand dollars right and that's going to be taxed\nAt eleven percent so that's going to bring you down to forty four thousand five hundred dollars and then I loved
