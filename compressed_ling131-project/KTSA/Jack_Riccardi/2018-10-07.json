in September with all that rain they start\nPercolating up a lot of alcohol energy from deeper down in the soil we we all are sitting on top of college heat and it's just this material that is coming up works the soil is very very ...\nWhen your ph goes up that much it makes it very hard for the grass to absorb and process a iron and things like that\nAnd virtually every yard around is showing some of that yellow ... the only thing that well two things that will bring it up again one of them is a little bit of patience you put it to grow and green on now we just need that I you know to get the ph back down to a little bit more normal level\nCompost because it brings in a fair amount of acidity with economic acids and the ... and things that are in it it will tend to green things up probably faster than anything else but it's just it's sort of the the bad side of good rains and it shifted it's all about\nYou know the too much moisture hollow I hate to ever say that we have seen this country to dry a whole lot more than I've ever seen it too wet but all the moisture is percolating up a lot of alcohol in it he this deeper down in the soil and that's what's leading to the yellow line you and it's simply not than a turnaround until we dry out a little bit until that\nPh neutralizes or normalize is a little bit and the grass you know is able to take up the nutrients once again so it's not anything you're failing to do but it's a it's just the the bad side I'm getting Fifteen to twenty inches of rain and it will turn around [noise]\nOkay so as you suggest cutting

country ABC's Jonathan Karl says that could play out next in next month's midterm election\nIn the polling that we have seen before and after this confirmation battle you've seen a clear shift\nRepublicans are now more intensely are paying attention and enthusiastic about the mid term elections\nThe gap has narrowed in several key races especially Senate races there's no question that at least right now one wants out the momentum has shifted back towards other Republicans are that said uh they they still face a very emotional pill battle and keeping control of the house\nNow that Kavanaugh has taken the oath and the Supreme Court what are some of the cases that the justices may take out the Supreme\nCourt has about forty open cases currently some of those have already been heard but looking ahead there are some key cases already on tap\nOne of the most watch will likely be gamble the United states a case concerning double jeopardy and whether the court should do away with the separate sovereign exception\nThat mean someone could be tried for the same crime in different ... for example being tried for the same crime in federal court and separately in state court the question being whether that violates the fifth amendments double jeopardy protection Mark I'm alarmed ABC News\nIn Haiti at least eleven people confirmed dead following a magnitude five point nine earthquake that hit the northwest part of the island Saturday and in Indonesia following the earthquake and tsunami the death toll now tops Seventeen hundred marks down with our partners at sky news has more from the devastated city of\nA little weak on the possibility of finding anyone else is still alive in these buildings seem very remote indeed the focus now on recovery of the dead places like this that is very hard and it is a very dangerous Fishell\nSay as many as five thousand people may still be missing you're listening to ABC needs\n[noise] All right let's talk a little bit about our friend said Medina agriculture makers of fine quality products for over fifty years now right here in this area but air products are used worldwide\nI'll never forget going over I was visitor Frankie over there ... all one day he had to stop taking calls from Sweden from somebody asking you about some of the ... products then we got back to ... take a call from somewhere in the middle east but Dina products argues worldwide they are that\nGood but you know I still think they were best right here in Texas where they were developed and methane is a good company to do business with not only do they make top\nQuality natural and organic products but they do it with a conscience say they have done so much work worldwide environment ... cleaning up all sorts of a natural disasters chemical spills oil spills things like that they don't ever brag about that but I'm just here to tell ya\nI like doing business with good people and the data well they're just good people and they make great fertilizer it's like to grow and green or liquid products are\nCoffee for for later and it's bringing out so much ... from down deep that this ties up the iron and ties up Bob [noise]\nYou know the things to keep our bras good and lush and dark green and the thing that will probably help more than anything else is a thin layer of compost\nI'm over those areas and it will turn around it will turn around gradually whether you\nDo anything or not I as we get back to dry or whether it's we'd get back to I I never use the word normal\nWhen we're talking about [noise] to sort of talking about your legs is whether normal just does it just doesn't work [noise] but um\nYou're seeing it or where you're seeing it\nIn spotty areas if you could take a cross section of the soil you actually see dome some college that come up closer to the surface and those are the areas are gonna be yellowish or in other areas they shift where you've got a solid mass ... underneath you end up with a yellow again the whole yard and you were ... virtually every\nBody in this part of Texas is looking at the same thing as fertilizing will help the grass but it's not really going to change the color compost will help bring back that darker green color more quickly mainly because the organic acids the Jamie Katz ... things like that that are in good compost [noise]\nRight I was a concern at this time of year I mentioned fertilizer but actually with the cooler weather coming and then the grass at St Augustine centrally doesn't grow very large during what uh I was wondering what would it be wise to to fertilize it at all but I'm Glad you mentioned the compost those college too\nWell the compost will help and I would definitely fertilizer because even though you don't see growth on the top ... stay active all winter wrong and the second thing is fertilizer is not available to to your plants the day you put her on that it takes some microbial activity it takes a little time for those\nUh ingredients and the fertilizer to be converted into things have plants can absorb a news and the fertilizer you put on this fall is what the ... of ... going to use for their birth to a growth next spring it in my opinion fall fertilizing is the most important fertilizing of the year and if you rent only fertilized\nOnce I Would tell you to do it in the fall so ... compost is great doesn't replace the fertilizer though but if the if you want good growth that spring\nYou know I mean you you don't eat that that really good stack while you're out there running a marathon your gets good nutrition and knew beforehand and then you go run that marathon and that's kind of weather fertilizers needs to go on in advance of the time your plants really needed [noise]\nUh ... what kind of a fertilizer would you recommend that and not by name I guess but by type\nI talked about names all the time I [laughter] had side on my daily news good news not good at some of the good brands that I'd like Medina makes one called grow it and green that's an excellent fertilizer meister role makes one called Texas tea that is a very good fertilizer [noise]\nUm the folks that are nature's creation make one they called premium along food that is a very good fertilizer the folks at a small well make one they called plant tone which is a good fertilizer [noise] you know any of these organic products are good they're based on different things to Medina is based on a poultry litter\nThe maestro is based on feather male and a vote meals things like that the ah natures creation product is based on alfalfa they are all excellent products and I've used them all and I like them all [noise]\nOkay a lot of good in through their bottom much British says or\n...

Carol ... first good morning Carol\nGood morning Bob learned my question is another ... live up in the Fort Worth area that was worth area\nOkay well my daughter lives on eagle mountain lake uh-huh and she had two large a shade tree that sat on the edge of the lake and are rich\nWe're in the water may be a third of the year okay we're submerged depending on the corps of engineers are that\nBetty and I'm not against the government where her to help us right yeah\nThey got struck by lightning and most of them died they were only maybe twelve feet apart but those are thirty foot tall and they provided excellent shade against that west son because she was on the side and we need to replace those and I haven't a clue what plan up there\nWell I Would plant ball ... be a Elvie all ... ... just to come as the technical name or they will grow standing water they have the unique ability they make little route\nNursery did this spring and fall so it's so much fun so many great people come and

just from place to be and they're offering twenty percent off air replant third every\nWell every bit of supplies the fertilizers and compost them all the tools everything here ... percent off today that kick off what they call their fall season kicked off sale and it's just not being out here Dr ... joined me and a few minutes and\nWe'll be doing the pet show from here as well\nRight now let's get back to the phone line so we're going to talk to Lisa and Beverly\nCup of open line probably have time to take a couple more calls so if you've ever been getting a busy signal to be a real good time to dial to ten five nine nine fifty five fifty five\nAnd ... will push the button and I will say good morning Lisa\nMorning Bob how are you\nAre doing very well thank you how 'bout you\nDo excellent I'm Out here in the grass and I think I just I think it has to grow grow in green a couple of months ago how often do that\nDo it as often as you want I feel like that day you get the maximum benefits doing it about four times a year I don't think there's really much to be gained by doing it any more often than that but\nYou know wants to seize and even in the cold weather it benefits the roots of your clients and does work to make them more cold hardy so I'm not that poor times years the maximum I'd say averages two times a year and if you're soils are just really really good shape once a year maybe enough\n... second question I heard about the fall Cyprus I don't actually have one that I had had enough hot and it's about a I'm going to say nine feet tall now okay should I plant that has all the water I Know that that might do they say\nWe have six of them uh you know growing around our nursery and believe me they're not there to get plenty of water from our watering the plants underneath them but\nThese are trees we planted that are now probably forty fifty feet tall and I consider to be one of the best trees for this area because we do water rate deal we do have the knees coming up which are something of an issue um models suicide purses gives you basically the same tree but without\nThe knees but I you're you're all five person is going to do better long term in the ground that it will in a pot and if it's better than a pop for a long time when you do planted in the ground you want to check can be sure you don't have any roots that are\nIn effect circling around around at the pop that would might girdle the Trump the long run you may need to clip those but yeah I Would very definitely put it in the ground if you anticipate being in that home\nFor any length of time because it will certainly be easier to maintain and\nIt's going to make a tree that just unless you you know physically bonsai it it's going to get a much bigger tree than you or to maintain it apart I'll tell you that\nNow should I put it north south east west\nWhatever your choices my answer yes\nOh yes yes [laughter] yeah exactly and then last like my husband and I have a disagreement about how can I say now if you want to sit where oh so they become thicker and I travel or trade let the heritage that took mosquitoes out of place [noise]\nWell in all honesty how often you driven has nothing to do with how big it is a valid or how thick it is is going to depend on how you take care of it and how much sunlight it receives and if it's in a shady area\nIs short of cutting down the trees nothing's going to make it a lot thicker but you know\nCutting your hair does it make it thick or it just makes it look different and your grass is a shame the same way people with their the grass by what ought to grow a little longer just like people that are falling asleep challenge shall we say [laughter] but uh\nI Know the the mowing has nothing to do with how ... ... not ... not you know fill out better because you know what I Will tell you that\nBefore you let it get a little bit longer it uses less moisture is more water conservative demoted to a little bit higher level but like many people you know feel like it's a more comfortable spongy your fun grass to walk around barefoot if there's a little bit shorter so what you do whatever works for you\nYeah we don't I don't say that I weighed the ... ... ...\nYeah that was that was that's the uh you don't have to tell him I said so but I think you're doing the right way\nBut if you need any excuse you could tell him I said that I Would I Would do it a little bit more often and keep it a little bit lower your mom's family you are welcome\nAnd are you over your chocolate pie or something or other for taking your side of this argument I've\nJeez you know you're totally right I think you totally at least you get out and have a good study and we'll talk again you know by your welcome Nike next step is Beverley you're part of Beverly\nGood morning how are you this morning and\nI just absolutely wonderful sit outside and walk into a lot of people and just enjoy life\nI think you always do that\nI well I'm not always the outside but I've always enjoyed life if you're not enjoying what you're doing your new at the wrong thing and we all have other things that we have to do but the you know there's ... maintain that good attitude and somebody once told me is impossible to have a negative thoughts when you're smiling so I attempt to smile as much as possible\nI agree with that [laughter] well my question is about asparagus okay I I have this as\nAn asparagus fad that's about five years it's been in the ground that five years okay and uh unfortunately my has been used a treated wood against my wishes for the bad you know ...\n... ... for the bed and race and like I was wondering should I\nJust started a new bed without the treated wood or is there a way to detoxify the roots or\nI doubt that you really need to worry much about it um the thing that used to be really bad in a treated wood was harsh Nick\nThey stop moving the ...\nAh the downside of that is it treated wood doesn't last nearly as long anymore and um but I I Would not be concerned with having you know having used that material Roger asparagus it's not going to\nReally take up or anything that would pose a threat to you now when it comes time to do it again I Would stay away from the treated would evolve would use one of these synthetic woods like tricks one of these ah you know basically plastic wood fiber\nThings you'd never have a place it again and you never have anything to worry about\nIf Habib decides to do something else with the treated would what I Would do is I hate it I Would see let their you know a good paint short can tell you what do you use and you can actually see a lot in the copper and some of the other semi toxic things that are in there\nBut uh I'm not going to show you have to move your surrogates bad\nOh good [laughter] that has bothered me ever since it went in so\nWell the idea and it would not have been my choice would not have been much more than I Would have sealed it but uh\nUh the chances are you're getting anything\nAre now some things I don't necessarily think oh there's certainly want to grow potatoes in there because you might and getting some of this on the edible portion I probably would not rural routes\nCrops like radish is a beach and carrots and turnips but uh it's I'm not concerned about things being taken up by the plants are merely concerned about things bleaching out in the soil and coating the plants are part that you eat a lot going to happen ... so that don't worry about the spheres\nWell very good they are good spears you know\nThey are absolutely BYOR by boys think that I have a terrible Gardner 'cause I never bring any fresh asparagus to work they just assume I don't know what the truth is that very little of it actually even makes it inside my home I I pick it off and eat it as I go where they're just not that much tastier\nThan get ... ad healthy as well is also a you know it's so good for you as well so yeah that's a that's one that's a would not be of great concern to me\nWell with asparagus the planet south of where I live you know it's down I'm close to the um [noise] the coast and\nI'm never really dies black unless it's you know unless I haven't water\nWhich is not a good thing she's got cut it back I got mine and we just have\nMild yours is sometimes it doesn't freeze back if it has not frozen back by about the first of January then I Would cut it back just because it's going to make it easier to harvest issues as they come out\nRight okay well Mary good well Bob once again thank you so much for your information\nIs all you want to try and get out and enjoy your Sunday thanks very rarely will say ... ... ... ... ... by white cream I don't have any of our lives so less run the rest of these commercials and get back and talk to Tom and raised\nRight now at CBS forums you can earn up to fifty extra bucks rewards each year just for filling prescriptions which means the medicines you take just the housing might also do a little something for the\nBut uh if you I Would wait until we are forced to cover it and then if you need to trim at some just do it at that time\nYeah thank you so much about and the other question is about wanting to my type it's how you talked to one of the callers\nYes in Dallas pitch to plant a tree in their late ... song I didn't\nFind any eventually died I can get down from the ... maybe it needs a lot of walking because they they\nThey do require a good deal of water to get started you know probably the first three to five years the renting around that they they do need more water than average once they become established they are much more drought tolerant but yeah I've seen in fact this summer I saw some fibers just\nLiterally turn brown out some of them can't come back out since we got into the super ... period that we began in September\nBut uh that's about the only thing in my experience um how the the nutrients sometimes true on the bark but uh [noise] um they do need water for the first few years or in the ground\nYeah I've seen some going at a live alone for oh yeah yeah so they need what they do that\nRight yeah they and and the ones you see down along the river walk are much more of the bald Cyprus than the ... ball fibers are even more demanding but even monitors ... the first few years is in the ground it needs to be watered regular\nDay thank you so much both and all that information I really enjoy your show I although I don't cause like I listen to your show they\nYou're very good about calling when you have a question as always my pleasure visit with the race thanks so they all this Martin thank you and you're certainly welcome go by [noise]\nAll right well I've got a little

a\nRecent new oil discovery call now eight hundred eight three three Seventy nine forty four eight hundred a three three Seventy nine forty four to find out what this could mean for you All right\nI I Try to tell everybody that if you have a dog it's older and they're slowing down it's not always old age it's not always arthritis\nAnd you you recommend a course I think it's a good idea any age but especially when dogs get to the mid life and that you know six seven years of age that you just make a ultrasound of the abdomen a regular part of your check out because\nThe splitting problems can many times the stock if you catch them early when the was saved metastasized must have gotten into liver and all that it's not so good\nThat uh the thing about it is is that that you know you it should be like listening to your dog's heart was the stethoscope that's how much ultrasound lab work things like that when they get to be seven or so that's the best time to do it\nAbsolutely and and you used to tell us that some breeds like labs especially we're more prone to this clinic to emerged is that still the case or you'll just see in all kinds of\nBig dogs mostly little dogs will see occasionally on the ... or a terrier mix and things like that but most animals it's going to be the big dogs\nThe German shepherd the the lab the goals and things like that we do have to watch and Golden's because we know that now we paid Golden's are kind of number one for cancer so we pay attention to every little upper bump and we had one the other day it was a pit bull that had a lump they said been on the side of the body for a while it was just kind of it was very non\nImpressed if it wasn't it was just a soft lump you almost looked like a fat tumor but not quite\nAnd uh we recommend it taking off when we were cleaning the teeth and we took it off and there was a mass scale tumor again that's why you can't always assume now if you're a veterinarians pretty sure about a lot Palmer a fatty tumor then then that's okay but if there's any question about mass\nJust take it off just take it off unless there's some underlying problem that keeps you from\nDoing it and you always ask is is harder is it soft hard it's almost certainly going to be a problem solved it may or may not\nBe a little bit more than a month and he was a mass scale tumors they'll they'll tell me that the they'll see the growth and they'll see at the smaller one day a bigger the next and of course that's the amount of histamine it's in that thing that they're probably causes swelling to it and because if you actually squeezing ... term or you can actually send the dog into shock you clout\nSo it's kind of one of those things so anyway I was all kinds of things we saw all kinds of um cases we have a little ... with a low proteins that's had diarrhea for four years wow\nAnd and on and off but more on terrible terrible diarrhea\nAnd um and probably because your keys and silky and those breeds

I like that about that and of course we we know that they can also have boarding trainer play and train their account balance\nAnd your dog when she comes home tired and trained\nThat just makes for a real good situation or at home and they have you know facilities for large dogs in the small dogs the important thing is for your dog safety for safety of all the other dogs they require a socialization interview doesn't cost you a penny but you will drop your dog by camp ... questionnaire that of state for\nTwo or three hours we'll get to play a camp counselor forget you know your dog and assuming they're no problems once you've had the socialization interview it's very very easy to drop your pet off your dollar golf for an afternoon or for a weekend or for whatever time in age\nAnd I've talked to many people they've taken talks over there have been very happy dogs are happy and ... and ... you know especially if those people that are working so hard that they can't get home to train them or just to just let him out and play for a little bit it it just works\nFor them maybe have company coming somebody that just can't have a dog run around and jump on them and things maybe have repairman coming to your home you don't want the dog to escape and get out in the streets you're just a lot of reasons that you may\nJust want a good place to send your puppy dog and cat while while they have for locations are found to be what you get to and they will see the dog gets good care you can get my call they just six nine nine six nine [noise]\nAll right well I guess we'd better get back to the phone lines and it is Beverley star Beverly you're visiting with Dr Kirby\nHello I'm a lot the same every time I'm a different Beverly\nOkay All right but just as important as\nAs fortunately I have some more questions about the hot that thyroid is okay and I had her job for years talking about animal nutrition technologies\nYeah and so when my when my dog Thirteen year old dog ... hill very young in many ways and that is just amazed at how did her Ledbetter kissing everything good at all that's fine ... he was said you know even though this has borderline\nBecause that a few other things that were showing up in the blood test I suspect\nShe lately ... right so\nOh he hit a lot in the past years the animal nutrition technologies haystack blood work after them and they said she was right and they sent back a powder and then we got three different things one friend named mia the thyroid drops in the hypothetical and drop\nYou got so you know the liquid formulas uh-huh\nLiquids as a three liquid ... hey you and having a little difficulty in complying with the liquid because the instructions were\nTesting done twice a day has to be done on an empty stomach with the first drops you wait a minute she did the second set of drops right another Fifteen minutes to the third set of drops and then I think you're supposed to wait Fifteen minutes before they eat\nAnd this is turning out to the protocol\nThat I'm having trouble with so so and I answer thing wondering if there is there is the standard treatment like a a level of Iraq scene or others yes there are ... are are down side to that\nNo but when I start dogs for there's a few things as you brought up [laughter] and so on a cover of all first of all animal technician technologies after Seventeen years of being a business has gone\nI heard you say that\nYes that's the first thing and it's very frustrating because I have let me tell you what's the nurse support in the liver sports we have\nThere was the best I'm telling you I Can't tell you how many took care of animals who took care of\nBut because of whatever issues they had they couldn't correct them and so they're now they're gone so um when you use these drops you're supposed to use them twice a day and all those things but it's hard for some people do that for a lot of reasons so\nIf your veterinarian the way your veterinarian could achieve um making sure that your make sure that your dog is not on steroids make sure this healthy looking and then you you check a thyroid\nAnd then you also do it TSA you've ever heard of that yes\nDid they do one of those already and they just didn't standard blood test I aha aha so they might have done the standard thyroid so do it ts age if it comes back and it's not always correct but if it comes back to normal then then you probably don't need to be putting the dog on anything\nOkay whoever's seeing that I was you know if it's because I I see a lot of cataracts I don't do cataract surgery though because that's I think you only need to be doing that if you're doing it every day\nAlive and you're like we might be gone too far we can go to the visual leave I'll do for you well\nSometimes you can remove one cataract and give them enough vision so at least they can see more because if he's bumping into things that's not you know that's not good\nIf not then if I just it seems like it was like I can hope for the fun of those ... doesn't really fit in the Lewis if they turn round and even with as well\nOkay so so yeah you can also put your hand in front of his I like you know have somebody puts his hand in front of your eye and you blink you can testing that why it's called a menace reflex where you go in with your hand\nOr the guy and if you blink than he can still see something if he doesn't blink then you know he's pretty much want\nWhen you go to the I planted you're going to get somebody that deals with the highs and eyes only and you're probably going to get more specific answers and you get from your general veterinarian so when you go a feel for the call ducked Herbie back we'll talk about it's more and see what they tell you about the best treatment for it All right gentlemen thank you so much for your health\nYou're welcome All right you know one thing too that I had a we don't talk about often enough and we'll we'll just momentarily we've talked to Susie but these diabetic animals they need to have the glucose levels checked regularly yeah actually when you first start on that insulin because\nIf you don't get control it it affects everything it doesn't just affect the the the extra foreign cataracts it could affect the kidney functions that can affect other organs causes deliver to be fatty\nAnd I think about my kitty cat it took some time back and forth with the different insulin levels until we got just the right when going and so you know it's not just one time thing if you have an animal cat or dog\nShowing diabetic problems are expected it'll take several blood tests before you really get that narrow down ... well let's go out and finish up the calls with Suzie you're ...\nBy their doctors are being the the mother brought to the\nYes what's going on today okay well I'm a start in ... friday morning and see it was diarrhea and the house [noise] and um so that's been happening [noise]\nUm [laughter] ever since then where have you been have been given or anything for it okay when I when I started doing um yesterday was just giving her morals light right [noise] okay I'm Talking very small amount\nOkay well you can how how much does she weigh I Can't remember she's a fifty okay so you can give her two crops twice a day\nOkay well I was like okay All right\nThrough cubs ... then you don't even have to put any dry food and if you don't want to but if you wanted to put any interest in this white rice just so you can go to ... but if it if it doesn't respond within twenty four forty hours of giving white rice then you know you need some help\nOkay well let me just also say real quick the I'm the one I got her science diet last time I'm told the young man I wanted a chicken and rice\nAnd not the one with ... [noise] well I think he gave me Farley ... does it say on the back\nWell I mean it's I throw it away sense I mean she loves to death but now\nThe problem is that the diets we we get opened diets all the time and they very and colors so that sometimes their dark sometimes they're not in there all the same diet but they've they've very and colors\nWell I never had I mean ... had I mean it smells so\nWhen did you get that did you just started or would did did you just started friday it it's been a month oh no no it would have caused if there was a change it if it was a change in diet which already within twenty four hours of starting it\nOkay well the reason I'm also I you know I've just been trying to pin down why I'm that started\nIn two days prior because she started like fat can offer food yeah\nSo that men are pills so um I gave her um you know some yogurt you know plop it I'm sure sure yeah that yeah and I thought it was the yogurt fat wallet ... fired the week before okay okay so I\nKnow that yeah I Know a week before probably not because we've got about two minutes here so we need\nTo we need in a ... so you tried the yogurt and I would really want you to do is keep it simple not any yogurt or anything but just to cook white rice but two two cups twice a day\nBut after by Monday or Tuesday there has to be no diarrhea and stools or you know semi solid if there's anything at all sometimes you once you get a ... it'll be two days before you actually see it\nBecause of the body will have to rebuild mhm but you know it's interesting that two days before she was already acting slow so I'm Wondering if something wasn't coming on something viral or bacterial that was affecting her you know\nWhen I was thinking of pets when she was in the office with me the week before she really not the week before a four days prior she'll have really bad gas and I was like whoa\nYeah so you wonder if something that kind of changing slowly and the cars how old is she now\nIs probably going to be twelve or Thirteen\nProbably Thirteen yeah so so if if this is something simple like um the rice doesn't work that we know that we usually look closer\nThan that okay so I'm All right so I had that I have saved a stool sample and it's all\nYes it's so so that means of bats are being digested like they should you know that can that can point to a few things that the pants can point to deliver sometimes I just point to what they're eating but I I you know I don't know if if two days rice doesn't help it I Know than than I is this something beyond just what simple you know\nIt doesn't last a blood or that you came out right\nOh yeah it doesn't have to use an abnormal blower can have there was a dog and send the clinic now that has diarrhea for a long time ... in lower exactly normal [noise] it's all intestinal\nAnd it can be anything from a ... infection to parasites to lots\nOf different things so we are at a time and there's nobody to talk to you off the air when we're remote liked it ain't like\nThanks to panics thanks to everybody come by to say hello and we will do this again next Sunday you of course you're listening to your parents helped with Dr

are those expenses looked like over the span of your retirement do you want to vacation do you want to take the grandkids bond fund trips were kind of cars do you want to drive how often are you going to replace them right on and on and on you design that lifestyle so she doesn't go into that here but we'll give her credit for\nUh having the insight that if she was actually working with you she would go into that lifestyle design and you come up with a number how much do you need on a monthly yearly basis in order to enjoy your retirement to have the retirement of your dreams hay\nAnd she goes on to encourage you to be conservative\nHave in case you encounter some unexpected expenses or your estimates turn out to be a little too rosy hey good advice and then she says to tally up your various income sources such as Social Security any pension income well how many people have pensions at this point\nNot very many usually public workers government workers they still have pensions but they're chopping away at those um and to see how much income you'll need to generate on your own\nArt so again her vision is that most of America and she's probably right are dependent upon Social Security\nAnd then a small handful of folks comparatively have some sort of pension coming the rest you got to figure out [noise] so the average annual Social Security she says is Seventeen thousand dollars a year\nThat's fourteen hundred dollars a month ... I\nI think everyone is aware at this point that if you're going to try and live our Social Security you're going to have a lifestyle vastly reduced from what you're used to living\n[noise] so she goes on to say that if you think you'll need a total of fifty thousand dollars a year to get by in retirement and you expect to get twenty thousand from Social Security so already\nShe warns us to be conservative and then she's bumped up that average is Seventeen to twenty thousand that's an Eighteen percent increase\nSo she's already using a number from Social Security that's Eighteen percent higher than the average Social Security benefits but we'll just go with her numbers for the sake of of this analogy\nThen you need to figure out where the other thirty thousand is coming from\nAll right\nAnd remember the fifty thousand dollars will be taxed at regular income income tax rates so in twenty eight teams the effective tax rate on fifty thousand dollars the federal tax write forget state is just over eleven percent\nThat's five thousand five hundred dollars so now you're actually living on forty four thousand five hundred dollars and we began exercise by saying you need fifty thousand to live on that should be what you clear after all expenses right all taxes and and insurance and\nMedical right but already we're down to forty four thousand five hundred because you're going to be taxed on your Social Security and you're going to be taxed on the money you take out of your ... that's the whole point is deferred taxation not tax free money\nAll right and then\nTo get an idea of how big of a nest egg you'll need to generate the income you need you can use the imperfect but still\nHelpful four percent rule except for those of you haven't heard this from your financial planner the ideas that your going to live off four percent of your IRA every year so you're going to start drawing down that IRA by four percent a year\n... you're going to have inflation\nBut hopefully you're making something in that IRA and uh hopefully you won't hit a market crashed but just for simplicity we won't talk about that at the moment so you're going to calculate that nest egg to generate the income you'll need by multiplying you're needed annual income by twenty five\nTo get your savings target All right so I suppose after twenty five years we're going to die that's the plan\nRight but assuming at a four percent withdrawal rate if you need to generate thirty thousand dollars in income to add to your Social Security\nThen you'll need to save seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars assuming a four percent withdrawal right\nOkay this is all kinds of wrong and we're going to come back and talk more about it but it's time for a short break you're
