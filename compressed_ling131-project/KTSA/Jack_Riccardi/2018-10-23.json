I you can count on this this is who I Am\nAnd it literally it this is a sink or swim thing\nSo in other words everybody else in politics leaves themselves wiggle room and regardless of their pre election rhetoric when they get in there and look at Brock Obama when they get in there it's just you know\nBasically\nA little is a little of that a little variation a few more deportations a few less\nBut this president started\nTalking about it in a very definitive way and he got elected\nAnd now he's talking about it even more vociferous Leon strikingly I think it's going to get them re elected because like I said underneath the political labels\nAnd the stuff people don't like about him and the stuff that ah that would lead you to be a Democratic Party voter there are a lot of people who know we can't have\nOn patrol to an secure borders and ports of entry and a visa system that loses half the people that are in it\n\nAnd there's a whole lot of people who will have a dark night of the soul\nThey won't tell anybody and they won't tell their friends they won't tell the pollsters with ... votes\nFor him because he is specifically promising\nTo do something that the others are not doing and and and clearly by their track record wouldn't do if they were elected [noise]\n\nHi this is Dan Patrick proud to be or lieutenant governor there's a lot in the news these days about a so called Democrats Lou ...
