originally put into those and you can you can re lubricate them over time but unfortunately eventually they spin out and when they do spin out there was a ten shunning tool that you can use to redo it but eventually it will happen again\nAnd an spiral balances are are one of the oldest balance system still in use today you've got your your ah blocking tackle system\nEr which was used back in the in the twenties thirties forties fifties and and still today they have a version of it that I call a string and spring balance system it's not really a block and tackle it's a little different\nThan it sounds like you're ... what's that ... that sounds like a military well it\nDoes it does kind of sound like that does kind of sound like that but it but it refers to more like a block and tackle that you would you would stop something with your voice up in the engine with ... there there are blocking tackle systems Jews to waste a heavy machinery and things like that and mechanics shops\nBut uh in this case it it's not that it's well it's similar to that it's it's a it's a tension and police system that does you know does the work for the windows going up and down but in your case it's a spiral balance system and and truthfully it's it's an outdated I'm\nA technology that those replaced probably Twenty years ago or so\nWith a a with a a system called a constant forced balanced system which is a coil of metal typically a stainless steel or or an aluminum our way of some kind that's kind of like a tape measure in the way that it coils up onto onto the keeper\nThe other piece is attached to the window itself this disaster moving part of the window and it keeps a constant tension no matter where you put it so it's a more reliable way to to a raise and lower and balance the window than the spiral balances much easier to replace him work on than the spiral balances\nVery in it just a window and my answer probably Twenty years old and it's time to call you\nWouldn't be a bad idea if you have your windows has spiral balances ... chances are good they are aluminum windows uh chances are good that they are at least Twenty years old and yes ma'am that would be a good time to talk to

Sheriff Joe Arpaio was was that I Would say probably maybe a thousand ... or\nA ... probably about four years but I noticed that a lot of low though they well\nThey might at it a little bit they well ed school last and I took looks horrible all age it gets more of a rancher apple or they will take care of\nI think that's more of like you said it's it's a renter mentality it's not their house they want it to look half way decent but they're not concerned about impressing or [noise]\nUm yeah I think it's more of an ... ah the mentality of of it being someone that rents the home rather than owns it and then of course you've got some homeowners they\nDon't care either\nOh I I've lived in neighborhoods very very nice neighborhoods\nWhere Ninety nine point nine percent of the owners kept their homes and their yards and really excellent condition I mean as you were proud to live in that neighborhood [noise] but you always had that one always had that one and I happen to live next door\nThat didn't mow the grass didn't fix up whenever something was in disrepair what their car on walks in\nThe driveway and they would get letter after letter after letter from the H away and the fact of the matter is that most H always although they have a whole lot of ... don't have a whole lot of bite no a which is which is unfortunate because many people buy in in a neighborhoods that have a choice for that very reason they want to have that\nAssurance that their their property value is going to remain high and that you know that that the codes and the rules are going to be enforced if you didn't want that you should go get your cell twenty five acres out in the country\nAnd do whatever you want to do exactly a ... and what I and I'm and I had the opposite reaction whenever I moved into town from out in the anti Texas I had a place that I Lived on a ranch Yancey and\nThere was nobody for a mile and a half from our house I could do what I Want live how I Want no restrictions whatsoever it was awesome\nWhen we moved into town I thought man I I just don't know about this eight to away stuff I don't I don't like somebody telling me that I can or cannot do this or that with my house but I'll tell you what after about sixteen years of it now I appreciate why they exist and and uh in in in a lot more on board with it than I was whenever I first moved into town\nYeah but there's a few of them that you can do a little overboard I had some of them are oppressive I had an island that was pretty impressive to the point that they even had the local police department an officer that lived in the subdivision tried to come by in his patrol car to give the illusion that he could enforce a chili rules [laughter] you know he can\nNow now that that they do not know he can't uh but but to answer your question real real simply is is unfortunately if you're a renter and this is not all ... so if you're a renter out there and you take great care of the property that you're running from you're doing what you should be doing and congratulations\nUm you owe it to the person who you're renting from to take care of their property and respect the place that you're living it however there are many runners who don't do that unfortunately because it's not their place they're not and appreciating their place their depreciating somebody else's place and it just doesn't matter to them\nSo and even if it is or renters mentality a lot of it can still go back to the homeowner because if there is a\nHomeowners' association and play where they're ... required that the yard be manicured are kept in a certain in a certain order and of course they can go out and knock on the door and sent all the letters they want it that's a rent or he can't ignore those letters he didn't sign those papers\nBut the homeowner did so at the homeowner's association with the whole the homeowners the to the fire and then the homeowner you know ... if I had a renter that they didn't take care of the grass and I bought myself I'd go ... and then I charge that runner for it\nYeah\nIt's just you know the area could be really sure it's probably about maybe\nSeven eight Seventy five dollars is getting AOL nice little\nShip that was sort of deal but it was just wondering you know sometimes that grass is gone I Want it to a long road but you know like ... street is there anything else so um I I don't know what it is but if it's ... I guess I\nI read it so that\nYes and and another thing to keep in mind to before we step out and say things you could have some houses in there that are vacant\nAnd that's why the yards get to that point and or could you could have elderly elderly couple that they just can't keep up with their yards anymore so we don't want to they want to make sure that we don't offend anyone or upset anyone because your yard gets overgrown there are reasons that that cannot be avoided\nWell here's here's something that I like to throw out there is is before and this is for anybody who lives in a subdivision where you may have a an occasional person who is not taking care of their place in and you think it should be done a little differently [noise]\nWhy don't we fly being neighborly maybe go over and meet that person and you don't get to know who they are and and what their situation is maybe it is an elderly person to just needs a little help with\nKeeping up their place and maybe that's maybe that's your you know what you can do is you're you're a goodwill gesture to that person you could help somebody out\nRather than just calling the H away and complaining are filing a complaint through the mail or email\nOr via neighbor that's that's something that we've lost a little bit\nOh yeah I've seen in in in my father got Martin grew more in the country than I did I grew up more in town I was young when we did have some places in the country but more in town is where we live and I remember my father in law and the neighbor's yard\nI remember the neighbor coming over and moan my father's yard it was you know if you're out there pushing the law and more and you see your neighbor's yard ... overgrown a little bit you just kept going in\nIn the yard for him and then he would do the same thing for you on the next on the next time around\nThat yeah and we kind of lost that a little bit unfortunately I'm I'm hoping that we get it back some day but anyway Chuck I I Believe we digress but thanks for your call this morning\nAnd uh any anything else we can help you with\nUh and I would defer to the particular company that you would deal with as to which they're recommendation would be on that because that would be the ones looking at it looking at your particular topography and and making the determination at that point\nI see a very a a a slab Laurie type of a patio like that that it\nUh it gets ready to sell the home a few years down the road that you know probably would be most attractive movie goer\nYou you know I Would do I would either do a a a a a pebble finish which is ... you know probably the most popular patio finished you don't want to do just straight a straight brush concrete that it's a it's a little too plain either want to do some kind of a an overlay\nA stamp or a pebble finish one of those three\nOkay All right I'm All right so um\nBut no specific contractors that you work with the companies that you work with\nYou you know I've worked with different concrete contractors in the past it's been several years since I've I've used them and I hesitate to you know to recommend anybody that I haven't used in the last couple of years\nUm just because I don't know if they're even still in business or if they if you know what the quality of the work is right now uh but but just Google it uh just Google concrete a contractor San Antonio look at their reviews and and and pay attention\nWhen you if I Want to caution people when you read reviews\nBe sure to look at the good ... good reviews and the bad reviews don't just look at the three three bad reviews are too bad reviews of the company has and then ignore the fifty great reviews that they have and when you do read a bad review on any company read the response of the owner that's going to tell you more about that company than the review will\nBecause of the if the if the owner does not respond that's a problem uh or if he ought to respond angrily also not great um but there are many times when you hear both sides of the story that you might get a picture that you didn't get whenever you just look at the at the bad review\nGot it got it All right very good for your time to show thanks again\nYou're sure welcome thanks a lot pre sheet that very much Paul and let's try to Tony in here before we go to break Tony good morning welcome to the K TSA home improvement

further damage to the newly leveled foundation\nCorrect it a big question is if the pipe broke first they're not you can file a claim with my insurance that's the foundation both pipes and I'm Out of pocket\nYou you need to get an independent uh insurance adjuster or to look at that on your behalf and I as an as an unbiased third party\nAnd give their opinion on that because I I certainly understand the amount of money that is at stake here when it when it comes to repairing that and who's going to pay for it and I would want that assurance it'll cost you a couple of hundred bucks to

home improvement show\nHey fill up our you\nKnow it took a call that a quarter of a ... billion up they're not for a a what's a good thing that they put up there now for texture\nOh that's that's easier you can grow up with an orange peel extreme global the moderate knocked down texture a it pretty much anything but popcorn\nYeah pretty much the only thing yes you can you can actually rent the hopper\nI'm at a big box store if you don't have the hopper you can mix your own one thing that I've I I Love and it's kind of a moderate but it's a homemade home style you just take some drywall mud makes it a little sick and you put it in your hopper and you point that operate ceiling and you start spraying and it gives you a nice bladder texture\nUm that when the when the ... hits the stealing it spiders out flat\nOut about the wall going well now you\nKnow you definitely want some kind of tax John ... at least my my opinion a lot of those opinion but I always want at least some context or on the wall because it helps hide in the imperfections that might be in the taping and floating in the sheet rock\nMore popular now is probably the the light orange peel texture now there was a time\nOf the Monterey texture was a you know as it was a heavier texture was really popular and then certainly a Mediterranean homes in Spanish style homes it's still very popular but in most homes or an orange bill textures going to be what you want to go with how many children\nDo you do you have do you have young children no\nOh okay okay I was just going to say we did uh my uh we did a house one time and when did the bathroom and it and we just thought it was in the idea we took and had the kids get their hands in the drywall mud but their hands on the on the wall and turn their hands like flowers\nAnd we just dead all over the bathroom and then painted over it it was a meat texture appearance\nFeel it and the walls\nAre you you can do it on the ceiling but on the ceiling I Would I Would rather go with some type of a really light a Monterey tech strongest feelings but certainly a orange bill could be done on the ceiling but uh some type of a light Monterey tech sure would be or or you can go flat on the ceilings you don't have to have a texture you can go flat\nI see okay but I Would definitely make them different you want to offset the I mean the feeling in the walls you don't want the same thing it's going to make them roam well as you want to continue as room\n... that's ... I Would jump on that when you want something different on the ceiling maybe no texture on the ceiling orange peel on the walls or Monterey on the ceiling orange peel on the walls or or vice versa\nYeah OK okay ...\nThanks Phil appreciates being a part of the show this morning\nYou know I saw a really really neat texture and on a house in Corpus Christi on ocean drive and what they did is you know the towel trial let's get the teeth on one side uh-huh okay\nThey would take in trial they traveled the um the guy was mud on to the ceiling and they would take those teeth and pointing straight up in and give him a return\nAnd they'd go right to the next side and get the kind of given it a fan look right and you have a deterrent and they went through the entire house doing this in the entire house was done and the reason that I Am familiar with it because I had one of my see guys in corpus fall through the ceiling and\nWhen we tried to repair that feeling I had to pay to have the entire stealing in the entire house oh no Rene done because you could match it oh you know up that you couldn't ... to ... I had to redo\nHad described the entire ceiling in the house and had to have the entire stealing announced read non so there's your downside to doing something that unit yes there's downside of doing unique stuff yes\nSame with uh with with the Venetian plaster finish inside the house or your gas gorgeous but you can't repair it it's almost impossible\nTo ... to a full wall are full room\nYeah and I love it it it's gorgeous but just know that if you ever have to repair it a patch it you're going to have you're gonna have an issue if I'm there used to be a squirrel finish that was really popular back in the seventies and and and it was around brush a really heavy Brussels Brussels around brush that you would use them in the plaster work\nAnd they take it and its spin it in and give it that the give the plaster that swirled finish that was very popular for a while\nI'm Talking about stuck going in and brick stone in particular back in the in the sixties and early seventies one of the most popular things that that we did down in Corpus Christi when when dad had a brick stone in Corpus Christi at that time\nIs a brick that we would take seashells seas seas sea shells\nAnd and uh and put them into the brick and I you talked about a labor intensive arduous process oh yeah individually placing seashells into the brick\nAnd then having the brick pattern so it looked like these were all see show Laden bricks right incredible look very very expensive and labor intensive and time consuming\nAnd the amount of sea shells that they had to buy to do this I Can't even imagine right but I remember growing up that having several samples of it and I think he probably did five or six jobs\nMostly on restaurants and commercial buildings\nUm but it really turned out pretty cool and for a while that was very popular you know so you had Trent trends and and things and times change but a\nA N as it is what stucco with finishes on walls there was a time when when popcorn ceilings were everywhere\nEverywhere okay but now a nobody likes popcorn ceilings for the most part I mean it's ... if you want to do everything you can to get rid of them in your house down such a mess to do it but um but it's just not the style now not even not even close\nYet the pop and uh [noise] you have to be careful taken that step off it is so messy ... or a it\nIt's nasty and you definitely don't want to do it dry you want it you want to take a pop up spray or what it down and and do all what removal because if you try doing a dry removal you were going\nTo cause any harm to remove it's really not you just take a flattened out scraper look like a hole that you flatten outskirts straight yeah you take a pop up spray yourself to stealing down and you scrape it off\nAnd you can if you have eight foot ceilings you can even put it on a on a broom handle and type it onto a broom handling scrape right or you don't have\nIt on the last ... just ... oh my goodness\nIt is and and and I've had to do it it's it's a bit is a terrible mess\nThey really were and they had some really good stuff I mean real it some great songs silly love songs great song\nUm I I mean there's there there are a lot of hits\nA really looking forward to that really looking forward to that\nUm let's get back to our fault checkup shoot up fix up list uh stuff that you need to do before the weather gets your uh this ... you know the cold weather gets here\nAre the next on our list as a furnished shoot up now we're we're not going to believe at this point we talked about this almost every week during this time of year absolutely it's your furnace tuned up coal shape for services get them out there and get it checked out get it taking care of\nA number four on the list upgrade your windows selfishly this is one of my favorites\nAbsolutely it it it truly is and and now if you if you would not believe upgrading your windows is going to your windows not only keep the heat out in the summertime they're gonna keep the heat in in the wintertime yeah and there's just that simple\nIf you have a problem with compensation and and if you have a limited windows you know exactly what I'm Talking about if you have aluminum windows and it's cold outside and it's warm inside condensation builds up on the inside of your windows and eventually it makes its way down to your cells and it causes damage to the very least appeals paint\nOr the very worst causes rot a drafts of course are a huge problem with with uh with older windows your your heating bills show the damage that they're doing because that goes up and up because you can keep turning that heat up\nBut the draft don't stop and the bill keeps going up um besides improving the overall comfort of your home we talked about this every week to new windows will also improve its looks and its value so uh one of the very best investments you can make in your home this is not an expense this is an investment because it does pay back\nReturn on investment when you sell your home or not to mention the comfort level of your home while you rented a number five increasing insulation\nAbsolutely ... this is something that hey if you're insulation in your attic is starting to compress down a little bit\nJust a day it just completely kills the inflating factor the only way you're going to get the good insulating factor and the the true our rating of it is a nice fluffy insulation if ... you know a lot of folks believe will the more inflation you pack you know the better and fled and you know the the the fluffy and this is what gives you the insulating factor\nUm it may be where all you need to do is go rent the the hopper and go up there and add some more bone in inflation but if it's really just lightning there's a lot of dust and you may need to vacuum all of that out of there\nWell and and if you happen to get into your addict can kind of look around and you notice that your your insulation is black a number one that's an indication that it may be an older insulation it could be I'm an ... um\nWhat what is the rock hall that could be old Rockwell insulation if if you it's like the Dickens it probably is rock wallets elation or if you touch it and by the way don't hum touched the insulation wear gloves were long sleeved shirts or because if if it is fiberglass or rock well it's going to be irritating to your skin\nA you don't want to do that a blown in insulation is the most popular form of insulation now and and probably the most effective form of insulation you can do the cellulose or blowing and fiberglass and the fabulous that they use now is not nearly as itchy is what they used to use I don't know what they did to fix that but\nThey didn't write write a ... [noise] I I Can't remember the term that they get a ... I think it's it's just because it's longer fibers maybe that's it's it's longer fibers in the fiber glass um but in just remember if you do decide to blow in the inflation yourself if you have the flex spider in your attic from your air conditioning ducts\nOr remodeling your bathroom break time to do that if you're dreaming of remodeling your bathroom it's a great time to be doing stuff inside and fall is the best time to finish that project\nClean your got her folks but I strongly recommend I don't care what kind of physical condition you're in you hire somebody to do that that the dangerous daunting task so many people you hear about every year follow up the ladder from cleaning gutters Arab professional\nAbsolutely and and and if it's if if it's possible in it's in your budget consider\nA at this time looking at your gutters if you need to replace them it's a great time to replace the gutters and if you do have gutters are filled with leaves consider a strongly putting a leaf protection system on top of those gutters when you replace them and it when the world would be happy to help you with that too\nI'm One of the I get in one last little a little bit about when the world if you're in the market for a energy efficient windows if you want to keep your home comfortable this winter time and not lived through another ... terrible toll draftee winter give us a call them when the world or check this out on Monday when the world\nDot com gym or do we get older you J.

to throw a computer at it computers are extremely common replacement items on a Chrysler products\nAnd so you could still be looking at that but I I Would never suggest you just throw a computer in their um only because of the cost and the cost of diagnosis you might as well get a diagnosis to make sure that is the problem okay okay do you what part of town are you in\nA west side by likely\nK I Can't think of anybody off the top of my head there um I tell you what why don't you if you do have a good shot that you deal with\nUh there there is one that normally use but\nI'm ... and the problem is on a ...\nThan a couple of months and I'm not the end where I'm like well set throw any more money at this thing or should I just kind of ... is with it I'm like okay ... so it's really on their worst [noise] Fifteen hundred bucks or so\nNow it's the it's the cost of transportation so I Want you to do some soul searching after we get off the phone but a look at what you're going to do once you get to Wyoming or you would would you drive this vehicle around Wyoming\nOr is this the vehicle you wanted does it fit your lifestyle does it do you know would you utilize it or if you sold this vehicle now would you switch over to something small say a hundred court or something bigger because you need a pickup truck or something like that\nIf you were going to change body styles completely\nAnd you have some money to do so than than now's the time to truly think about that because it's the next step to take and you could have a nice reliable or drive on the way up there or if this is the vehicle that fits you and you like it and the only issue is that it just will not idle right and installing\nThen take it in and get it fixed because what we're talking about now is not the ... the\nThe value to sell it right because no vehicle I mean you're you're not going to get a ton for what we're talking about is the cost of transportation so if you could invest\n... let's say a lot let's say you invested three thousand into this gee that'd be a just an enormous amount of money right but when you're avoiding paying even twelve thousand for a good used vehicle so if you were going to use this vehicle\nOr would you rather pay three thousand and keep driving around and know that it's safe and you got good tires on there now for the trip\nYou've got a computer replaced and it's fixed in his running beautiful no problems or would you rather go ahead and pay twelve thousand for the security of having a different vehicle in which case you're buying a used vehicle and you may need repairs on that\nOkay that makes sense that makes a lot of sense is or so a lot of really love the vehicle\nThat yeah it's just it's a hassle it 'cause I I've had some warranted worked on the differential replaced on it but it's likely that covered the transfer of had swapped out and\nDo you say Ninety six or oh six Ninety say okay All right go ahead sorry about that ah All right so yeah and that's one of the things I I just wanted to get the the rest of that thought out is that a lot of folks look at it when they're driving an older vehicle it's like well I'm not going to invest what this vehicle is worse because I'm never going to get that money back out\nWell I mean transportation it it's a a a depreciating asset it's not like you're ever going to get the money back out of your vehicle\nIt's the cost to drive it costs to get around or is it it's a different way of thought and I would never convince somebody again\nFluids will have the protective qualities that they need and

S. s S.\nSo but that's what I Would do if I just wanted to go out and be proactive and do something otherwise hook up your feel pressure tester and uh it go and see if you go\nOr if you're missing spark and fuel and then if you are at the other thing that we like to look at if you're missing when is cranking but not starting if you're missing an rpm reference so you have your skin to hooked up and you're looking at the data and you're looking at the rpm Z and if there is zero then you know that it's occurring chef censored because that's what gives you that reference\nRight by okay so I'm just I'm just telling you we can put three crank chef sensors on after market and then we finally go back to ... and after about two or three cars that you say All right nothing but most of our from now on\nYeah yeah okay All right well right now where\nI gave you a little bit of a direction to go in I you know you you got still just a little bit of diagnosis to do but that fuel thing you cannot overlook fuel and I have had people call in and say well I pushed illustrator valve and feel came out\nAnd that's not that's not good enough because I'm fuel will come out of there if you have five PSI a fuel pressure in there and fight be assigned means you've got about ...\nBut if you just push the straighter valve and he shoots fuel out I joked around with a caller one time and I said well now when the shooting when the fuel came out did it did it just shoot up like just a little bit maybe an inch or two or did it hit the the the hood you know or did issue way over your head well you know I mean that that none of that is quantitative her qualitative at all\nOr it's just kind of a funny guess and so ah let's go to Joe Hey Joe you've been waiting patiently what can we do for you\nI mean a power steering thing with the mercury grand marquee to those and then three okay a third of the engine of you know the ... or the ... and works everything works very good writing car\nBut um what do you started up after your turned it off in say a voter started up\nThe power steering of this theory is if like stuck Casey and uh\nSo I wanted to find out but after if I I wrote it down down the street a little bit or the parking lot and a kind of move the wheels back and forth a couple of times it but it's got to be rolling it'll it'll go back to\nWe've got a few callers who've been waiting a good little while ah to talk on the phone on the automotive sheer show shoe here on a new start five fifty K.

Fifteen Chevy Sonic forward or I stayed and about three weeks ago I got this check in July ... after I filled up and uh it's\nThe check engine light says he'll try to run up and then after a seal it up every single time now it's a it's heart start\nK A credit\nThe fuel trim and the the the fill up don't match up for me and my mind at least ... what's the code number that you got\nYou know I'm Sorry I didn't write it\nThat's okay what you likely in my opinion what you probably had as I can evaporated emissions are largely small league a vent valve something like that and that's extremely comment on the Chevy's based on your symptom\nStates yes when I actually\nJust got a notice that there's this cross goes right over the span of\nWhich is weird it's class I felt that it actually has such a thing that shirt groups from uh the manifold right and I I started doing it and it feels like it's actually became quite a bit so that's most likely the crust part which I don't know why should I really do that but\nIn the ... is the the PCB liner the breather line is what you're talking about\nYes oh okay yeah so now that would cause of Field Stream issue\nThat you would have a vacuum leak and it would be a lean condition\nOr or a fuel fuel would ... I don't think feel trim as the word used\nBut anyway like a a fuel lean condition or a vacuum league basically a that would cause that that would not cause your your issue on start up the issue on start up that you've got is is a evaporative emissions a vent valve are purge valve okay and so what that does is while you're filling up\nUm ... it's not\nRegulating the pressure in the tank and it's not allowing the vehicle to start to crank snow starting it's an extremely common issue whichever lace of all vehicles for some reason Chrysler's too and I think that's just because they use very similar says symptoms but my guess is they have you had it scanned recently like very recently\nNo sir\nOkay my guess is that now you will have an ... code in the in the system and it may not even be setting the check engine light but you will have a pending code or the or history code that is in there and that's going to refer to the uh it'll be called and he got purged ...\nBut um anyway that's going to be your issue and and that's not a very difficult repair most of the time now I say that most of the time because some ... some cars and on the sonic I don't know off the top of my head but some Kurdish super easy to fix and some of them are a little bit more difficult\nAnd so where can you what\nTo get past that oh\nYou can what part of town are you in\nOn the site but I I travel a truck with shorts\nArt galleries heights garage sure yes they would definitely be able to fix that for you okay yeah give Gary ... a call in my garage and do I know what\nElse except for the fair\nNot a quality repair shop okay a because\nAnd I don't know if they will or not that's their policy but most of the time what we have to do and that has a just a perfect question and and and Mike ... who got you guys coming up but I'm dead or the perfect question will they roll the costs of diagnostics into the repair\nOn things like mechanical type issues or breaks let's say for instance\nYou got to pull the wheels you got to check the brakes and and you're already kind of halfway there so that by the time you get approval to do the break John half the labor is already done\nYou don't have to charge diagnosis to check breaks most of the time most shops right\nBut on something like this or check engine light you can't just grabbed the guy that does breaks only right and it's not capable of doing a diagnosis you can't describe that guy and say hey diagnose it and make sure that your labor rose into that because you're already going to be there fixing it no\nWhat we've got to do is most of the time we charge shops will charge when our diagnostics or diagnostics it's a standard rate summer one one and a half to depending on how much diagnostic we have to do\nBut you've got to test the the component that we feel like has failed in your car may give us the sensor that has failed but we've got to make sure that it's not wearing his rubs somewhere whatever anyway the long and short is I've got to pay my intelligent guy to diagnose that car and he's also going\nTo want to get paid to our nor the part so I've got to pay him so we ask you all as a customer to pay us that is a very very good question and we do have a Michael coming up Augie and Steve we've got one more hour the automotive show you all hang on tight you're on news talk five fifty K.

assembly\nAnd a lot of the times you have to buy it with the uh with the centers attached to it okay 'cause you have the ... temperature sensor on the thermostat housing you have the thermostat in the thermostat housing and you have the whole thing sold as one unit\nSo it is not an easy unit to replace and the cost has not inexpensive when you consider that a thermostat order cost about ten dollars right uh\nSo the I don't I Can't give you the the dollar amount on yours because it's different for every engine even on Ford Chevy's ah this this code is across all make some models and so um you do
