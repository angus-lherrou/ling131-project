Robbins up first guarded Robin\nGood wind up your Martin and have had a question for you okay have a passion fine that I planted and the spraying crops late march mhm it's a test that Flora and cannot read and it's\nAnd it said ... partial shade well I'm getting very few blooms\nUh lots of signs lots of ... that no phones\nAnd you know it partly is the passion of mine that you saw\nElected that particular variety doesn't bloom as heavily here as it does on the coast of California and some other places plus we've had a lot of cloudy weather you may have planted in the sunny spot but the son took a vacation or we didn't see much of it ah throughout September and the first two thirds walked over so\nThat is the biggest reason now if you plant more I Would think about planning a variety a such as incense um ... is a much more free blooming there are a couple of native species of passion vine to\nA which also are going to be a little bit more flow reverse in their blooming men Coronado is a beautiful thing and actually if you ever travel northern California you're just going to be amazed at how they grow out there but we're not California and its nature is to produce a lot of mine and not as many flowers\nUm I Love passion vines are so unusual in so many different but I think uh if you if you really want to see a lot of flowers plant something like incense you'll definitely get a heavier flowering part of what you're seeing is variety part of what you're seeing is an unusual stretches cloudy weather so not anything you're failing to do\nOK well great so the thing that won't do they like it they said\nHow they absolutely love to be fed but it's a you know feeding stimulates and helps healthy growth all the time but when it comes to flowering um you get a certain amount of the nutrients they need especially some forms of phosphorus\nAnd his sort of an all or nothing thing once they've got enough of those nutrients\nThey're going to bloom and doubling the amount of nutrient does not double the number of flowers it or is simply enough to get them to bloom well but adding more of it doesn't make it better so uh fertilizing yes there's going to help the vines of the bigger and healthier the vines are the more blooms are capable of producing\nBut in the case of passion vine is not going to change the number of flowers you get a whole lot\nOkay [noise] okay thank you have another question I have a balance here peach tree it bloomed so critically this past spring I thought my goodness [noise] even if I never get pages\nIt was just such a joy to say and the spring\nSure and they're actually ornamental teachers that are grown for their flowers only that make very little fruit and peach peach blooms are absolutely gorgeous there's no question about it\nRight okay I wanted to print it out a little bit is just said is it's an okay time to do that\n[laughter] no [laughter] I'm okay the [laughter]\nSimple word water ... talk about why\nUm your your peach has already said it's flower buds\nAnd any pruning you do is going to reduce the number of flowers now if you were telling me or into fruit production if this was a tree that you're really hoping to get a bunch of fruit from I Would tell you to prone to thin it out because at very definitely increases the vigor of the tree\nAnd I would recommend pruning it but I Would wait until it does it's spring flowering and then do any pruning that you need to do on it at this point\nIf Robin is most looking forward to having flowers on that tree I'm every every pruning cut you make is going to reduce the number of flour so\nLet's uh let's let it get lots and lots of flowers and then ... back wears a all molesters out there and me that are hoping to get fruit production yeah we're going to send our trees out real heavily in January or February so it it's just two different things as flowering page versus are fruiting page\nOkay and right now just looks like a shrimp yeah if they wish they strap [laughter] but it was sort of in the spring yeah so\nWell and but by the virtue of the fact that it did grow from a seed rather than essay grafted tree there's no there's no graph pointers

Malian have over a dozen improvised explosive devices this past\nWeek ABC News obtaining surveillance video from the ultra gentleman's club in West Palm Beach where say I work for the past two months in video from the day of his arrest say oc is seen entering the club at one twenty four AM he sits near the stage and spreads papers out in front of him sources tell ABC News that say I was going through press clippings\nAdditionally those sources say that at some point that morning they saw ... light a fire in the parking lot near his van a photo shows the remnants of that fire which included a chart paper clip\nABC's mark ran a large you're listening to ABC News\nAnd on a happier note I get to talk to you about south west metal roofing systems and\nWonderful roofs of they provide the ... peace of mind they give us the the durability of a roof I mean if you're dealing with southwest metal roofing system as you're getting a lifetime quality roof a roof you will not have to worry about and which will last you as long as the structure that that roof is on\nLove the roofs have had one on my roof for many years we've had one on shades of green my business partner and her husband have had\nOne of the roofs on their home for many years now\nAnd I'm so pleased and I love to tell the story about building a new ground water district office which is coming along nicely thank you Russell is daily crew but uh up in the Bernie area but when we first started working on the design of the building I said I Want to south West Nile river systems roof on that building the architect and the builders said oh that'd be too expensive and I said you check\nThey did check and guess what they found out what I already know that South west metal roofing system is extremely reasonable on their prices and so this is the root for getting on our district office and I am so pleased about it you can have one of the roof to it's as simple as getting together with them and do that by calling to ten\nIf this were the first of September I'd say go for it you still got time for new growth come out harden off store and more nutrients to get through the winter but\nYou know we're we're just right here it you know ... or we don't know whether it's coming next week or next month or January if but I don't encourage\nOr really much of any pruning at this time of the year because it does you know tend to make the plant you use up some stored nutrient that they really should be saving through the winter for next springs world\nOkay good good answer that's why I loved Louis anti okay another question how about some of the bushes and trees that I have that are just hanging over I mean they're they're not ... or anything they're just uh some type of I'd say trash trees out there that gets into than but\nAh and I trained them back right now or do I waited you're say with\nWell here's a is an excellent question Michael here's here's the thing I Would not be going around and just randomly cutting branches back because that would indeed stimulate some new growth\nIf I were going to take a branch all the way off of Oregon and cut it back all the way to the trunk or to a more major lamb and of course I'm cutting just outside the branch color\nThat's not that's not going to re sprout because you don't have that little stuff black when you cut it off you've got these hormones that are moving up through the stem constantly\nAnd when you cut off at some point further out on that stay on these things begin to accumulate and concentrate at the point of the cut that's what makes the new bloods want to jump into growth and produce a you know new stadiums\nWhere you're cutting it back to a major lamb or where you're cutting that limb all the way back to the truck\nThere you don't have that little stuff sticking out it's going to have the likelihood of starting to make gay that little tender new growth is going to freeze back so\nAh if you are selectively pruning where you are moving in tire\nBranches entire lambs whatever and not just you know randomly cutting relieving stubs staking out then you can do that kind of pruning otherwise I Would wait till it gets a little cooler when uh the trees go wind up what we called dormant see in Texas nothing like the dorm and see you have a way up north\nBut I'm a ... so yeah limit your ... but if you need to do some selective major pruning yeah you can do it right now no problem\nOkay down to the major labs are the major trunks and stuff oh yeah well\nI Do appreciate your time and all your information you have a fabulous week and\nIt will and it's my pleasure one thing I Would say for the benefit of all of our listeners if you are pruning on oak trees or use something to seal the wounds I'd have to be burning paint something to seal the wounds\nAny other trees whether they're trash trees or quality trees like a alums and pecans and things ruining see her is absolutely not necessary may actually be detrimental but all in oak trees seal those wounds to uh lessen the chance to vote will get started\nOkay yes 'cause we live over here in Fredericksburg Eric Gillespie county about a glass of that information too so [laughter] I never knew that\nAs there to help yeah thank you yeah I agree like if\nYou do the same sort of thank you bye [noise]\nAll right let me get a little commercial break out all the way

that the ... the people doing the research or finding a glass of save residue levels are so much higher dogs and cats and things because of the food and all the way she's going to be given a seminar next Saturday at shades and bringing a nine forty five and I'm sure pets will come\nUp 'cause I'm going to bring about you know there'll be a that everybody has every on his questions about that\nBut anyway so free seminars nine forty five and it's super important for people but uh you may learn some things about uh your pets and don't have a lot of answers yet but we have at least a are getting a better idea of how we need to pursue some of these questions so\nThose to be able to just joined us I mentioned this on my show but those ball yelled at just joined us productive for every show you are certainly welcomed I'm forty fire free charge over change going next Saturday and ah\nSo that's what I wanted to say you were to go to the phone call it ready to do it you have a Arthur Patsy and daddy and Arthur up first year visit with Dr Kirby\nHire high um we got a lot so she's at least fourteen years old and she had an ear infection and the ... era that we treated with steroids and stop the steroids now but I'm calling because her blood work indicates cushions disease you want some of the numbers from the blood test\nYeah did you do a low dose that suppression tests or you just kind of uh\nIt started after so it's the first things I think of when you when I if I see in a high out five I'm looking for a reason for higher fuss\nUsually an older dog or a dog that's um you know you can be stare on steroids so you you had steroids in the air and let me tell you they're absorbed every time you give a steroid whether you put a drop in the eye or you put a drop in the year they're absorbed into the whole body\nAnd they can elevate the al ... and the liver enzymes\nAt one time we also had a friend who was on and on and off\nOh yeah so you so even more so and she could be an eye after Jenike\nKush annoyed dog I've ever heard that you know so it's a dog that's um maybe predisposed to Cushing maybe is on the edge and then you give them steroids in orally or top ugly and they convert and they go to ... disease because they've been given steroids through the years\nIs that can do it and that's ... I'm ... you know Christians disease but otherwise ... says associate with either ...\nOr ... on the adrenal or too many steroids given at some point so you you would do a low dose deck suppression test and that would tell you and that's assuming is she drinking tons of water yes okay so there's a reason for you to test or I wouldn't if if she wasn't drinking tons of water\nI wouldn't even test or not it just because the drug that you used ... is the most common drug now\nUsed to be Mitt attain N. O. P. D. D. that was kind of the same thing but really strong drug and and toxic and entertains better um\nShe's not she's not ... times but she strictly well she drinks a lot of what\nYou want to know is if she's drinking does she stay at the water bowl and you're like gosh she's not even leaving that water bowl and then when she leash comes right back\nSo you could do that and you could put 'em on revolution and um and go from there and be safe because the cats if it's ... more time than ever then it's\nProbably doesn't have a real home we're not going to color destroy we're just going to call that are homeless cat [laughter]\nRight I'm trying to get her to follow me to my door he won I mean she just stays out in the parking lot she's kind of miss she'll make it a little way and then she stopped\nRight right and see who the weather is coming you give her a warm bed I'm outliving outdoors uh in in this kind of weather is not a bad deal other than the rain but when it starts cooling off\nThe attractiveness of a warm bed or in a warm place will probably went over the shyness of not wanting to admit that she wants to come into your house\nOkay All right I I Would love to have that happen now I have another question I read up on Siamese cat scans appears to me they're pretty busy during the day\nAnd says and I don't know if this is true or not uh they need some other cat to keep them company to keep 'em out of trouble\nWell now they're okay that way but they they do talk a lot usually does this one talk a lot\nOh yes\nSo why al ... has a very loud voice of Jesus I'm a yeah I mean there\nBut I mean it it's a pleasant stretched out\nBut you wouldn't have to get another cat for her I mean she she would be fine too she's found a way to keep yourself occupied you wouldn't have to do any more than that okay you\nDon't have that you don't you'll be the other cat she will be wanting to spend time in your lap shall be wanting to spend time um [laughter]\nIn in bed with you shall we say where she gets a she can wake you up in the middle of life for their pets that she needs kind of like my ... year you're going to be her companion uh and there won't be as much need for another feline companion dogs are pack animals cats are not\nNow so sharing and bike and you know if she'll come in and it starts to get cold and she wants to come in and you have a place for then it'll it'll she'll slowly assimilate into the house you know and and I like the fact that she can go outside go to the bathroom and everything else and then come back inside you know what I mean\nI'm that will that will eliminate you have to have a litter box and all those things too\nAnd when she gets to this point yet are scratching posts to put a little catnip on it just to be sure that she doesn't wear out are welcome by thinking she needs to go scratch on the furniture\nOh yeah yeah Vegas rattling poses a real good thing I'm an ...\nMainly concerned about our health director Kirby do you all have carriers carried\nThis weekend sure alone want anytime you betcha we did all the time we're glad loan you one very important\nI'll I'll do that then at ... you know I'm going to give her another day he how she how we\nYou know hey you communicate it pretty well it sounds good and what are you feeling or just one last question what do you feeding her\nWell actually the neighbor less than ... okay yeah okay so I'm Still using that but what would you suggest was if you want to say he looks in good shape\nHer her hair you know her her third is it's it's beautiful\nYeah I Would stick with what you're feeding her so you know you don't switch or and then that changes things sometimes so we wouldn't do that\nOkay okay well she well thank you so much\n... what have you named this cat\nCarrier she looks like she wants to live with\nMe you know what have you named her even if she is not officially years yet\n[laughter] I ...

he would not take a bigger and correct\nI Would typically not want her to be groomed until I had a somewhat under control\nOh yeah it seems like after she goes she always seemed to get that that that that's always asking it careful can you really get that little ... and now they don't end up with another infection that it seems like we sat there any way to control that\nI Would say that if you know after they after they do the years and and clean them with whatever they're doing they can for capital of alcohol in that era some people will put powder and you're I don't know if you noticed that\nBut um you know the ... pattern there but I don't really think you should put pattern here unless you the only time I do this when I'm trying to pull something out of the year I had like hair this growing deepen the canal\nAnd then I washed than I clean them out really well and so so no I just didn't make a capital of alcohol after they groom is fine\nAnd you have to say one other thing you people here alcohol cleaning years this has dogs only never ever put alcohol and the cats here yeah no we don't ever do that you have to bring that there's going to let you go so we can not get Don on here before the end of the show or not we were out a five minutes or for you to talk to Dr carry\nOut the real quick I got a little five and\nShit and now she's got this late like nasal congestion yeah all the time\nOkay five and a half months old like do you see a little white bubbles coming ever knows\nNo\nDaily okay I'm a slave but it sounds like a structure\nOr you're probably right on the issue the um the have you looked at her she with you right now\nYeah well they\nAre [laughter] I Know the only reason I ask because when you stop when you when you stop I Want you to hold her in front of you and I want you to look at her nose and look at our nostrils and see if they aren't closed Mike that they're not open but close those are the ... are opening I Want to know if they're open or closed\nOkay and she she doesn't do it all the time right she's sleeping usually she's\nShe's fine why still would want you to look at that and that's the first thing in the five and a half month old she too okay secondly secondly she has a flattened face and she may have a real flat face or a moderate flat miss what do you think\nShe's got I'm On earth that it's not like puck\nOkay good good and so but the but hers her if she has no you know cloudy discharged from her nose\nAnd um you know nothing else on I don't I don't worry about that and then your veterinarian when they examine them they'll they just need to open their mouth make sure that they look back in the back she could have a long soft palate\nAnd that soft palate goes over time so it interferes with Airflow plus there's little ... near their larynx that can be bigger than normal all those things affect the way they air flows from the lungs through the nose and and I'll bet anything that that's part of it ... times you say she breeze pretty normally\nYes\nYeah so that's what that is it's probably more of it or\nTry to treat it or allergies ...\nIt's not gonna it's not gonna that's not the issue that's not the issue it's airway issue so innocent and an atomic issue not a not a like an infectious issue\nBut I that's what I'm trying to do while you're correct I'm an art than I Am a desk I'm not totally unfamiliar\nWith the exactly I Know and I agree with you and then the other thing I'd tell you though is to look at our nostrils just just for the sake of looking look at those ... and see if they're folded those little our folds of the nostrils will be either clothes or not and in most of the time they're partially closed\nOkay well I've seen the she does have a wet knows and there is times or a liquid coming out of their food\nHuh mhm 'cause the one that airway goes through there when that ... we we know and especially pogs how they have airway disease actually break is valid disease\nBut this air comes through there and the flow creates turbulence and cause irritation to the sinuses as well but these young dogs it's always it's always about the size of the head the flat understood the nose\nThe narrowing of the ... of the openings and I'd sure like to know if you if you do see that they're partially close that really that would be important for me is this something that dog's gonna grow out of the some of it he ... when I was asked that some of it can get better I had one\nThey were told is six months to have surgery somewhere and I just said you know way to tell us a year or some\nKind of a magic number for dogs ... not insane and worked for every ... years of magic number for lots of animals\nAnd and sure enough of the year ... the the L R folds were folded in for a long time but they slowly work their way out they didn't ever come back fully but the dog never had to have surgery\nAnd that was what I was trying to avoid and and it didn't need antibiotics and it didn't need anything else and you know unless you wanted to go in and start changing the soft palate and the engine the way you're you're\n... which is all genetics you know\nRoger but a lot about that so I'd sure like to know and they can't stop and look at those ... than the nasal area but that's that's what I'd want to know\nOkay well I'm not she with me right now but I'm\nA ... hour ride I said it but\nYeah I'm an call anytime okay maybe calls next week if you find them say they will be here next weekend and then All right this is Derek\nI'm getting ready to take it real quick ... and I'm a I'm a little later passengers and\nYeah they can look at they could look at a that'd be a perfect time to do because she'll be sedated then and you could look at it closely\nRight exactly that's not that well\nYou betcha glad to talk to you\nYou could always tell when you're talking to a medical professional [laughter] I pay at all the all the right question at all the questions they don't ask because they already know the exact well you've got thirty seconds here to talk about this beautiful\nOh it's beautiful it is beautiful so it's a day to get out and be with
