supporting the Democrats um so the way he tells the story on the campaign trail is I'm a you know\nShe's she's been a democratic voter and um she's ... she's been always been a Republican voter and I'm only now is she come around to support me and to support the party\nUm\nTurns out that's not quite right CNN\nOkay you're saying I'm\nMelissa O'Rourke has frequently voted in democratic primaries has frequently contributed to democratic candidates including but not limited to rock Obama a largely voting in democratic primaries since two thousand donating money to candidates from both parties\nUm people are going to be quick to laugh this off and say oh come on and he's not\nReady and these are not experience than these a legend his own mind\nUm I Will say this um I think the landscape has turned a little more favorable for Leon Castro and I'm not saying that I support him but let me let me just leave this out and you can tell me if I'm Crazy or drunk or whatever you think I Am I'm ... of course when he's talking about doing is running against an incumbent\nPresident and that is\nUsually in and of itself a long shot I mean history is not on the side of a candidate who challenges an incumbent president so that's\nThat means that\nThis run for president in twenty twenty might not really be his ultimate run this could be his warm up\nLet me show my stuff getting to know you getting to know me kind of thing he's young enough that he can basically treat the twenty twenty race as a\nPractice run\nGain experience make contacts in key states where he is a not known at all uh impress people which brings me to the second point if you look at the way the Democratic field is shaping up for twenty twenty it's a bunch of very\nOld retracted I'm warmed over a people\nThat I don't mean to sound ages but it's a notably long in the tooth a bunch of people Hillary Clinton Joe Biden Bernie Sanders Elizabeth Warren\nI'm\nSomebody is going to emerge as the fresh young alternative to all that and it could be him I mean there are other people that could be Cory Booker it could be Kamala Harris it could be other people but um there's no reason why he shouldn't looking at that\nI'm a A R P upper tier of candidates is no reason why he shouldn't try that and thirdly\nUh people are more set up and frustrated with a Washington DC than ever which means that any candidate whose pedigree is a DC\nUh you know resume so Joe Biden senator vice president uh\nSeveral of the other people are or have been in the Senate\n[noise] um it\nMight just be that Democrats will be in intrigued by somebody who can say well yeah I've been to Washington but I'm not of Washington that's why you have even\nMayors are considering running the ... the former mayor of Los Angeles is considering running the current mayor of Los Angeles is considering running the mayor of South Bend Indiana is considering running\nUm people are going to say you know Trump pushed a button\nWith that whole ah Washington's broken and they're all talk and no action and we got to fix it from the outside and\nThey won't use the exact same language like drain the swamp but somebody in the Democratic party is going to figure out that there is an advantage to being from somewhere else well\nCastro can say I'm from San Antonio I'm from Texas and remember while we might know him too well\nIn most parts of the country they hardly know 'em at all he's a blank canvass he can paint onto that canvas whatever he wants and other people can project on to him whatever they want that happened with a man named Iraq Obama if you remember\nThere were people who saw what they wanted to see and heard what they wanted to hear with him and he let that happen and he was he and his team were smart enough to not\nCorrect people when they projected on him that he was a moderate or the projected on him that he was a evangelical Democrat or anything like that that they let that be they let that go in and and who Leon Castro is so inexperienced and so on known\nThat he can actually do that too so I'm not predicting anything and I'm not endorsing him by any means I disagree with them about just about everything but I have to think that actually\nHis a decision to run for president doesn't look so crazy to me that's my point um and even if it\nFails or fall short in twenty twenty four when Trump is term limited if he is re elected he'd be term limited in twenty twenty four that's when I think\nUh having run in twenty twenty and and made the effort and put in the effort and made the connections with people that's when it could really a payoff for him a plus if he has any chance of being on anybody's ticket as a running mate again he needs to be in this mix early and often that's been the case for a number of people in the past\nA hoop and chosen as running mates people like Al Gore\nUm and uh and others now sometimes a president's big running mates for all kinds of other reasons but it doesn't hurt to run for or be thought of as someone who would run for president just my thoughts on that suits and five nine nine\nFifty five fifty five he's got his new book

a full legal fees at Fox News he was quoted Fox News great now I can go after horse race\nAnd her third rate lawyer\nIn the great state of Texas she will confirmed the letter she signed she knows nothing about me a total con [laughter]\nHorse race responded ladies and gentlemen may I present your presidents in addition to this is um shortcomings he has demonstrated is incompetence hatred of women and lack of self control and Twitter again and perhaps a penchant for ... game on tiny\nUm\nAnd then Michael ... her lawyer got in on that you're discussing besides you know you're an embarrassment to the United states this whole thing is an embarrassment\nThis whole exchange I don't want to hear\nThat this is Trump playing forty chess I don't want to hear that he's gaming the media I when I when I think that I'll tell you and when I think the case can be made that he's getting inside the heads of his opponents or a\nHunting them or whatever that this is just grow the hell up you know yesterday at the same time that you were tweeting between horse racing mushroom head we learned is that the United states has regained the title of the world's most competitive\nEconomy and you might have thought we always were but we weren't\nAnd we haven't had that rating from the world Economic Forum since two thousand and eight of us getting the highest score in the world for\nCompetitiveness and the economy competitive productivity on a scale of zero to one hundred the United states word in eighty six hundred and forty different countries are scored\nThe competitiveness of productivity future competitive advantage is\nGenerating entrepreneurship and and what are called disruptive business models meaning that you're you're generating a business or a business model that will you know change things and upset apple carts\nThe top five us Singapore Germany Switzerland and Japan this is mostly due to Trump's economic policies why is he tweeting\nAbout horse face why is he calling a woman that most people don't believe names and then getting called\nMushroom had back you realize we're one tweet away from the twenty Fifth Amendment at this point because if he decides he has to disapprove mushroom had by tweeting out a picture of you know what where it twenty Fifth Amendment time right where president Mike Pence time right there\nWhy do it\nI Know why they're doing it I Know I have an ... doing it I Know I stormy is doing it\n\nWhy in a year where the media wants to depict you and your party as hating women what'd you call her horse race you called Carly Fiorina and ugly faced woman you you you made fun of of ah Heidi cruises face wanting why are you doing this\nWe looked at your face I mean you know kind of live in a glass house there\nAnd you know this is where I think you could legitimately make the argument and I know people say this all the time and it's it's it's kind of mood but this is where you could legitimately make the argument hide his phone\n\nBecause the messaging should be that economic message the messaging every day from here on out is you have a choice between more of what we've done these last two years or the next two years being all hearings all impeachment all the time Ted Cruz said at\nYes good morning I found it very interesting that you brought up all several past presidents supposedly turn the other cheek when the Democrats attack them or they turn the other cheek\nDid actually only brought up and on I brought up George W. Bush\nOh well uh okay one of them but at the same tactic they use all the time right they attack\nI and I said I uh he should have fought back\nYeah and they didn't why why do they not ... I'm a I'm a Vietnam fighter pilot the enemy turn agenda may I add right okay so Trump is attack he may be doing overboard\nBut doing nothing didn't help at all they John you they will continue to do it for as long as we let them get away with it\nJohn to use your analogy of being a fighter pilot there's a right and the wrong way to do that there are different degrees of effectiveness of how you respond to an attack the way to respond to this attack would have been to point out the hypocrisy of Democrats and the way they use women for\nPolitical purposes they're using Stormy Daniels Heidi Heitkamp is using real sexual abuse victims the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee used Christine Ford that's the way you fight back you did not fight back by calling her horse race\nWhat I just ah last night I saw that they put out a video of millennia are portraying a stripper in the oval office\nHow was that an answer to what I just said I'm here anything I just said do you\nYes I heard everything you said they're sounding more and more liberal to me all the\nTime you know I'm I'm just asking you why not go back and point out the hypocrisy a and the phoning us of those attacking you on this issue why give us a woman a nickname that's not a good comeback that's an ineffective response\nAnd that respond to not get published by anybody but maybe you\nWill know that isn't true either because everything your tweets gets into the news the white today that's why his tweets are so effective\nEverybody does it say horror space or Pocahontas it won't make the news\nAlso in other words she has to use a nickname or people won't talk about\nIt is that right yeah Okay John what's wrong with that watch wrongly not\nPay John By your lights nothing is wrong with it I just think it's a huge missed opportunity\nA and ... again it puts us in a position where people that really are scum bags are getting away with being scum bags this man has the bully pulpit he can point out the Heidi Heitkamp thing he can point out the Claire McCaskill thing he can point out what happened\nA just a couple of weeks ago at the Senate Judiciary committee don't let people forget that I mean they've Republicans think that that is something that might help them in the mid term why aren't they talking about that every day why did they stop talking about it the minute Brett Kavanaugh took the oath of office do you ever wonder about that I Do\nFind the Republicans I'm going to keep talking about those Kavanaugh hearings because every thing I read everything I hear tells me that those hearings blew up in the faces of Democrats and our game changers\nFor these midterm elections so that's what I Would be doing with my Twitter feed not calling her horse race\nIs nothing to do with being a liberal\nDoes a right way to fight back I'm Glad he fights back I think that is a good thing I think that's given the Republicans the only chance they'll have a twenty Eighteen\nBut this is just not the way to do it Dan is on tape TSA the anger morning\nHey good morning I I totally agree with you here is the problem with how to respond\nCalling it ran in and get them anywhere but all they do\nAnd that can therm where all the people that are already yes down saying that's what he does and those of us why you persuade people to be on his side and look at it like ... what did we get the audience that you know what he did which is a way it's a\nHighly highly credit I'm hard\nTraining for him yet because I'm so he insulted the girl the white man that I wanted to vote for I really want to do that we start\nTalking to her then that way and now I think that can be that but I can no way\nSo I found is that you know he sort of respond that just like yesterday when or what he didn't respond like calling him name he said you know what your campus telling you to\nYou know just calling loans but here the\nStuff that you're not\nThe way you know you're you're not running for the way you should be okay\nThank you Dan I'm even even more pointless is the point of his tweeting was to talk about the victory that he had\nWon over Stormy Daniels and Michael Evan out either defamation suit against him thrown out they were ordered to pay his attorney's fees which are not insignificant they're appealing that but they may be on the hook for some pretty serious a legal fees\nUm he could've

for the Republican candidate\nThat pretty much seals\nUm presidential elections for Democrats because you'll have California and New York which already has all of their electors who go go for the Democrat if you throw in taxes it's becomes nearly impossible for a Republican presidential candidate to win so\nThat that's why one reason why there was a focus on taxes because they\nNo those elect doors in the in the electoral college are are so critical to their effort to make a durable Democratic majority in Congress and and then the White House\nBut I'm a little lost how does that how does how does contributing to making Beto O'Rourke the senator changed the makeup of the electoral college\nWell because that is the effort to turn Texas glued to to\nTo to reverse the the Republican dominance in the state of Texas and some people believe that Beto O'Rourke is the tips despair you can make that\nHappen but the second thing is that and I and I think there are Democrats around the country you believe this to look at that at all work as the second incarnation of up rock Obama\nThat kid that he was a\n... that that he was in Congress for a little while he's going to run for the Senate and uh that he could be a viable\nPresidential candidate a candidate who has this kind of so I'm Hispanic ah sounding name and has this uh this ... appeal and that he could be a very strong a presidential candidates\nAre in the next election and so I I think a lot of people are a number it's obvious you look at the kind of swooning over O'Rourke that there are a lot of people who are ... with him and things that you should be on the national stage and so I think the combination of those two\nTwo issues of of trying to turn Texas blue for the electoral votes and this idea that he could be the next president or a\n... has all this money orient\n[noise] see I I look at him and I'm not and it has nothing to do with whether I agree or disagree with him or not I disagree with them on most things but I don't see I don't see what the media\nSee in him um\nI can look around the country and see candidates who are also young who are also rising stars\nWho are I think more impressive and their presentation and their credentials like Josh Hawley the Republican candidate in Missouri against Claire McCaskill or months of mix Sally the Republican candidate and former fighter pilot in Arizona I just don't I'm not getting in fact the comparison to Obama doesn't seem fair to Obama I think he was a better speaker\nOr in a more charismatic figure in his you know a early rise a than O'Rourke is\nI I don't disagree with you what what I Will say is I think it'll work is done a great job of marketing themselves that uh you know at tour that he did with will hurt driving to a driving back to D.C and and doing it face all the social media that was surrounding that\nI think that's what the probably the first time that he appeared on the national stage and uh this idea and and he's he's really capitalize on that that\nYou know and and he talked about it in the debate last night that he and it will hurt one simple or for bipartisanship for that effort and and that's been the cornerstone of his campaign has a new way of of of doing politics and working together and reaching\nAcross the aisle even though his policies are for the last us of most Texans and uh\nSo I I think he's done a great job of marketing themselves as this new generation new ways a Democrat\nAnd and that has caught on with a lot of lot of the Democrat based around the country and that's why he's received so much money you know\nA final question uh we've been talking about this on and off throughout the morning\nUm if the Republicans have a bad night in a few weeks um how much of that would you lay at the feet of Donald Trump he is saying if anything I put you guys back in the fight not taking you out of it\n[noise] well I think all pollo loco and uh in taxes uh if if there was a bad night for\nBecause\nPresident Trump um yeah you know you look at the cabin on hearings and uh in states like California and New York\nAnd eat or to put the polling data shows and it shows that the hearings are going to drive a larger than expected a turnout for Democrats but in taxes it's the opposite that\nThe Kavanaugh hearings in reaction to the Capitol hearing this are going to drive a larger than expected Republican or\nSo I don't think I think that some swing states where you might be able to say that the president's unpopularity will drag down some candidates but in other states um it's going to be running on the Trump platform and and running on on the front on Trump policies are going to be winners and\nTouches not all one country I mean it's it it the the whole country doesn't look at the cabin on thing the same way the whole country doesn't have the same approval\nRating for President Trump you go from state to state you find that\nHis approval rating is not only over fifty percent but in some cases well over in in states that he won in twenty sixteen and it just means to me that\nUm when you take a national poll you're gonna you're gonna uh waited artificially with the people from the very populist anti Trump stay and it's going to be a low number but he doesn't have to win a national poll he just has to win the states he won in twenty sixteen and I think that's plausible\nYeah and that's why I say I think that'll work would be a great candidate in California or ... or a Florida but he is not in Texas in two thousand Eighteen is not a
