out showing that Republican Josh Hawley jumped to the lead against Washington Democrat Claire McCaskill and latest Missouri Senate poll holiday now leads the Democrat Senator by two points the poll was taken after McCaskill announced her opposition to Brett Kavanaugh\nThat is when she fell behind\nReports out over the weekend as well may have an explanation for the second door in Mrs Ford's home\nYou're when she testified on a friday or Thursday one of the things she said was that this all began because of a second door she wanted to put a second Dorner home supposedly because she was very traumatized she said by Brett Kavanaugh that she wanted to have two doors\nSo she could to front door so she could get out no matter what happened inside of her house you could get out and so it took two doors now to be able to get out of your house and that's what led to the whole get together with the the uh shrink because\nHer husband said what you want to doors why do you want to well I'm very upset\nI'm Upset I we've got to go so they went to the counseling that's when it came out Brett Kavanaugh put his hand over math and I thought I was going to die so I Want to doors and et cetera what's her story okay well in ... and said okay All right\nWell now apparently people got to looking into the past about that and when those doors were installed and there's a lot of trouble the timeline as to when she said those doors went in\nVersus when that meeting with the strike happened in ... all of that but a bottom line is two things about their home I'm number one there's a business or was a business it was being run out of their home the couples Research Center was being operated out of their home\nAnd the other thing was apparently they had tenants who are renting rooms in their home\nSo now there's question as to whether or not the door had anything to do with the alleged attack that happens so many years ago and more about how they installed a separate door for people to come and go who are either coming in for the business that was being operated out of there\nOr a tenants who are renting rooms from them so they wouldn't have access to the main quarters that they would go to the uh rooms they were renting so I think there's you know pretty good chance that there'll be more investigation into that but some serious questions\nAs to why that door was actually put in when I was put in she she hunger testimony on that door and whether or not that door was put in\nTo give people access ended at home who are renting rooms and or going in for counseling services into a separate section there\nMark ... at resorts along the Las Vegas strip gotta go dark tonight about the same time a year ago when a gunman up there Patrick Stephen Paddock the

you can't buy it and if you can't buy it everybody knows that nobody does it as long as you can't legally buy it nobody does it we all know that and so that's why we passed these laws that make it harder for us to buy these things such as tobacco\nOr alcohol or\nGuns or anything like that because we know just more laws and more government involvement and more government control over the

beyond really right I Want to cross examine this witness and that's what you want to further up the check\nCross examine this witness\nWell I'll tell you John you're you're right and but what happened was the Republicans who are so out of their league when it comes to political warfare they allow the Democrats to a frame this as not a this is not a trial Brett Kavanaugh was not on trial so he cannot faces accuser he cannot cross examined the witness\nAll the normal things that apply to a court of law and we know this was a court this was a kangaroo court it as a quarter of\nA public opinion but also the standards of a of a quarter supposed to be upheld when we're dealing outside of a court let me explain what I mean by that\nIf we ever lose the presumption of innocence and normal regular life outside of a court proceeding we're done folks were song it's over for American society if I let me give me an example right here's the stupidity\nThat I'm Talking about and how this country has defend that descended into stupidity over this USA Today they ran a piece of a I guess it was friday or Saturday I suppose\nAn opinion article is Brett Kavanaugh right that he can no longer coach girls basketball I was in the sports section of USA Today the U.S Senate may yet confirmed Kevin ... to the Supreme Court the peace sad but he said stay off of basketball courts when kids are around\nYou hear what that is saying this was a piece in USA Today I read that rag in years by the way it's piece of junk\nBut ... this piece is saying or are implicated or a laying it out there that somehow Brett Kavanaugh's better far you shouldn't be on a basketball conveyed where our kids are headed\nBy the end of\nThe nation is newly vigilant on who coaches and trains its children given the recent scandals in gymnastics and other sports\nCredibly accused\nYou get that word accused no formal charge there is no a conviction there is no sentence USA Today says credibly accused sex offenders\nShould not coach youth basketball girls or boys without deeper investigation can't we all agree on that\nYou hear that\nWhat they're saying is is that like these others that were involved in these scandals involving young girls in the you know us a gymnastics on all of that\nThey put Brett Kavanaugh right and that just like when Kay sat last week put a man with with a Bill Cosby\nThere maybe they're implying that he is one of the same as a Cosby or that he's one of ... what was that guy's name that coaches ... was that his name one on the same as him\nAnd it's just based on accusation they even set in their\nPiece which by the way they have a sense taken down because I think there's some real questions here about whether or not they're accusing him crime that there is absolutely no fact factual basis for and USA Today just might get their butts sued clear to China and back\nAnd they should maybe even to the moon and back\nCredibly accused sex offenders stupidity where we are now folks\nIs that based on an accusation your life is over you should have\nNo more ability to coach you should have no more ability to\nBuy guns that's what they're doing out in California now Jerry Brown signed a law over the weekend raises the gun aged Twenty one for all guns but it also says that if somebody says hey you are a threat than you are a threat and you have to prove you're not a threat they come get your gun and take your gun away from you and they hold\nYour gun until you prove that you're not a threat\nSo I'm looking at Chris Chris got a gun I say well Chris is a threat and based on my accusation not the presentation of evidence not the presentation of witnesses not a jury trial not not the ability to face your accuser and to cross examine the witnesses none of that all that goes out the window I say Chris\nIs a danger go take his gun from him and they go take his gun and this is basically where we're going in our country and people are applauding it\nRight before the bottom of the hour and I want to get into this with you right before the bottom of the hour I told you about this host on C.

corroborating evidence\nThere is no a these are all an unsubstantiated allegations and the burden of proof is on the accused I cannot believe that the burden of proof is on the accused\nHe's the only one that ... that brought any evidence and yet we're supposed to unconditionally believe the woman this is a female host of a television show saying this in Austin at the Texas Tribune festival\nNot one Democrat is going to vote for him at the end of this week not one that's what they're you know that that is what's so stupid about that we have descended into into\nStupidity into our country we really have and it's ... it is a it's a terrible shame\nBut I've seen it you know and and people that I Know young people up in Austin that I'm very familiar with it at a complete turnaround and they're thinking uh they went to a liberal arts colleges they got out of there and the next thing you know their their minds when they went in there were conservatives and they come out ahead conversations with um just last weekend\nAnd I can tell you that their minds have completely changed on on subject matter they're listening to ... who is telling them he wants to open the borders and they loved that idea they're listening to ... because they know people who who are illegally in the country and I don't want them to to to be shipped out\nAnd ... telling them out there on the on a on the campaign trail that yet on the the the progression to taking away all guns the next thing they want to do is they both action five rounds that's all you get to have they called it bullets five five bullets and both action\nAnd it is changing their minds because they're hearing this all the time from the media boy if we just you know if we just take guns away nobody's going to be shooting anybody now you and I know that's not true that's not how it works\nBut that's what they're being taught if we just take guns away we just do this we just open the borders and nobody's going to be

S. M. C. A. will now replace\nNAFTA and the president's going to talk about it I Believe us at ten o'clock hour time that they plan on having a press conference about that at about ten o'clock our time to be a very interesting to see how that\nTurns out so we got South Korea done right he's working on North Korea he's got this happening over here with the NAFTA being replaced started out a lot\nIn the European Union they're concerning their situation with the United states in the European Union\nNow China is the is is the odd man out at this point and and that's how these negotiators work they work through this bit\nAnd anybody who doesn't want to play ball they end up becoming isolated ask ask any successful businessman whether it's a macaw homes are frost or any of these guys that are successful businessman who have negotiated big big deals\nThe odd man out who's left standing on the sidelines as the guy who ends up losing and right now China with as powerful as they are in their economy is they are looking at the er at being the odd man left out of all these deals these new trade deals that are being made\nAnd all this was going on in the world's attention in our country anyway is all focused on Brett Kavanaugh and the Democrats saying if we just have one more week man we can approve this guy the FBI check it out one more and you know that's not true\nYou know at the end of this week they are going to say well we need more time to injustice report from the FBI and we've got to do this when we got to do that so we need another delay and another delayed and the Republicans\nKnowing how the Republicans are don't play how they are so or unprepared for a political war they're probably gonna give it to him and so this can go on perpetually this could go forever\nAs we see what happened on friday when the Republicans just wouldn't stand up the Democrats are great uh playing political war because this is what this means the most to them of anything on the planet this right here winning political war means the most the Democrats so\nThis after that I'll be on for a pariah from four to seven and we're going to talk more about that take more of your calls ... noon here on gay TSA plus all the breaking news from today traffic and whether as well I'll tell you about Ryan or Saudi Ryan or Saudi law man I tell you he's sharp when it comes to the law and when it comes to defending your rights many many times", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Trey Ware", "city": "San Antonio", "day": "01"}
