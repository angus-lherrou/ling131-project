story and I want you to be aware of it if you're a law abiding gun owner in the city of San Antonio San Antonio and this is one of the reasons why I call it San Fran Tony Rio\nCity council is coming after your gun they don't believe you ought to own one and of course we all know the law abiding citizens don't have guns in the gang bangers into criminals are the only ones that have the guns and they know it and they use\nThem hello Chicago let me ask you questions you want to San Antonio to become like Chicago\nHow would you like to wake up on a Monday morning and listen to your favorite radio station or turn on your favorite news television station and they do a tally every Monday morning how many people were shot and killed in the streets of San Antonio over the weekend I was like that to happen\n[noise] [noise] well\nThat's basically what goes on in Chicago and you know why it goes on in Chicago because it is so so hard for law abiding citizens in the city of Chicago to get to go\nThere's all kinds of hoops there's legal ramifications there are this ... this whole idea they just passed throughout the state of California\nLast week where somebody can make an accusation about you and your gun gets taken away from you until you prove the accusation is not true you lose your gun all of this goes on in cities like Chicago and others the most violent cities in America you know what is correlated to the most violence ... gun violence\nAmerica\nThose cities are those states make it extremely hard for a law abiding citizens to get\nGuns that's the correlation and here we have the San Antonio city council saying well we got to take guns away from people law abiding people they can't get them away from the criminals um I'm going to say this is clearly as I can see the San Antonio city council\nThey criminals are not buying their guns or gun store sorry and so it doesn't matter where you put the gun store it's not like they buy their guys signed the gang bear buys their gun at the gun store walks to the school next door and shoots up the school\nSo I ... you want to play your politics and you want to say I've done some look I got to do it all you're trying to do is limited access to guns for law abiding citizens\nAnd you guys are single handedly forcing good people to leave this city good people\nGood people are leaving the city in droves good people because of the politics that are being played by this current city council and one of the things that they want to do by taking your gun rights away well\nHey here's what they say they're doing I actually\nWe we can tell we can tell businesses where they can sell alcohol why can't we tell them where where they can sell guns they shouldn't be able to sell guns by schools or churches or places like that rye rye and neighborhoods where people live\nSo when you do that when you start to limit those kinds of things the next thing you know is you've got half of the gun shops right now would be out of compliance if they passed this new city ordinance\nHalf of them and yet\nSuch a move would do absolutely zero to cut down on gun violence in schools are anywhere else in fact the more you limit the ability of law abiding citizens to get their guns and hold their guns and to keep their guns\nThe more crime and the more death by guns you have why they want\nTo be the most liberal city on the planet I have no idea I think\nEarly on was the one who put up a picture of former mayors for San Antonio I have it here a former mayors for San Antonio and and current mayor and uh and I looked at this picture and I went yeah well that kinda that pretty much says it all pretty much says it all about who we are as a city\nThere's early on there's Henry there is hard burger and there is near and Bert all together not a\nConservative in the bunch not a conservative and a bunch so what I'm Talking about\nJob Brett Kavanaugh and the moms that you saw in DC over the past couple of days we'll talk about that and you can sound off on that now that he is Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh to ten five nine nine fifty five fifty five\nYou know chances are you've already heard the menu is the dirtier side I'm\nAt a restaurant on each menu that they hand you when you walk into a restaurant there's about a hundred and eighty five thousand bacteria\n\nYeah surprisingly the second dirtier side I'm at a restaurant isn't in the bathroom\nIn fact it's on your table\nThe second dirty aside I'm at a restaurant next to the menu the pepper shaker yeah all the people that have touched the pepper shaker pepper happens to beat all the others salt\nSugar cheese and other shakers to for germ harboring a surface contest wanting to study conducted by ABC News on average a pepper shakers bacteria count eleven thousand six hundred any German subs out they're worried about this\nMost salt pepper shakers are only wipe down if they appear dirty\nAnd even then only with the damp cloth the buses keep in their pockets after they wipe the table down and\nWhile some restaurants collected refill and wipe down the shakers they're rarely properly emptied and sanitized it sits on the table day in and day\nOut and of course another fact to keep in mind too is if this wasn't grows up\nParents that are eager to occupy their little ones you get it they often lead their toddlers play with the salt and pepper during the meal\nYou have never seen before the way they're going to investigate them and try to bring down a his administration or at least slow him down for a couple of years until twenty twenty when Korean come Allah will be running against him\nUm so that's the idea they want to immediately immediately go back up on your taxes\nAll the tax breaks that spurred this\nFantastic economy that we're living in right now and they want to put all those regulations that Obama had on businesses they want to put all that back on business as well get us back in the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal most of the things that the Democrats said that they promise to do if you elect them or\nLet me put it this way since I Know this is a majority conservative audience if you don't block them if you do to prevent them\nThe circus that you saw for the past couple of weeks is exactly what they're going to do and they're going to do it even worse by the way but like sharks you smell blood and the water and they're coming after you if you're a conservative in this country they're coming out you\nGo ahead\n[noise] ended up ... just to the national\nAssociation hey we\nDidn't

doesn't grant carte blanche to assemble a petition in fact\nIt is the only pair of rights listed there and that contains a limitation even the second amendment doesn't contain limitations and we put all kinds of limitations on the second amendment\n\nThe right to peacefully assemble and petition peaceably we don't have the right in this country to behave like a mob did you see as he was being

Democrats is that look they've been using the courts now\nFor many years as a way of getting public policy it when they can't do it to the Democratic process in other words when they can't convince Congress\nWhere they can't convince state legislatures to pass laws they they try to go around the Democratic process the legislative process and go through the courts and that's why they put people on the court\nWho don't believe in the rule of law and follow the constitution but believe that well whatever my particular use of public policy are I can use my power as a judge to put that in force and they're now are afraid\nThat's cutting it happened again with the Supreme Court at least for the foreseeable future because it looks like we've got a solid five votes that will prevent that from happening\nNow here's what worries me to a certain degree ... and that is a ... Democrats or you know they the rule or they ruin if they're not going to be in charge and they just want to burn place down and they play to win because this was all that matters to them\nConservatives tend to play not to lose our shall I say the Republicans who have typically been there\nHave played not to lose I mean there's a there's a glimmer of hope when Lindsey Graham get that excited I saw a little bit of Donald Trump and Lindsey Graham there but we'll at last ... usually Republicans will go back to their normal lives they'll give up on this kinda stuff want something happens and they get on back to whatever it is they're doing\nAnd and forget about say the the midterms I'm ... how how do you make this excitement and there's an Trish how do you make this this peak in this level stay with conservatives so they turn out in a couple of weeks in the mid term\n[noise] oh I I think they're I think that's going to happen um the the polling shows that there's really been a reversal are amongst the American people the people\nGo out and vote and its anger at the way this whole confirmation process has been handled a there's a lot of people out there who were excited about going to the polls to vote who now are\n... because of that anger and because you know there there are a lot of women out there who are they're buried\nYou have sons in college and\nThey know what it's like a if there are false charges brought against the man that they love and there's a lot of men out there like\nA what I I'm a I'm I'm going to be looked at if I apply for a job for a the the beer party might have gone to in college and high school and that's going to affect my living today there's a lot of people that are\nVery upset well yeah there's a whole lot of people who went to the coast for spring break and stuff like that in high school and college you know and do you want that stuff to affect your life ah going forward so\nI'm going to get into that with the with the listeners here shortly and I think that's a very interesting part of this the other side of this too is that people are are willing to let bygones be bygones but I Hope that Chuck Grassley will not do that I understand that he has requested\nFormal communications between the three accusers camps apparently he has reason to believe\nThat there may have been some sort of polluting new between those camps are discussions between those can for some because he's asked for all their communications and whether or not a missed forward may have not told all the truth when she was testifying under oath to the truth may have changed when she testified under oath\nAnd he has been requesting information concerning all about as well\nAnd now that it's all over with there are those who are saying well it bygones be bygones and get on with that but no I think that if you have evidence to present you present the evidence and try to move a case forward because you've got to stop this stuff from ever happening in the future\nOr do you do and and and not only do we need to find that out\nBut um if for example a Dr Ford lied under oath she needs to be prosecuted I mean that needs to be referred to the U.S Justice Department that's the only way to keep that from happening and at a a great example of that as you know\nIs that she was specifically asked whether she had ever helped advisor counseled anyone as a psychologist on how\nI'm happy that those who tried to destroy his life sales short\nI'm Glad those who've tried to overturn the rule of law and replace it with mob rule last I've never been more test in my life is this character assassination this this morning power too much to the extent that I came to the age of this good man and helped defeat this debacle I'm happy as the\nClass [noise] ... is a glass lenses pretty happy are they [noise] if you add it\nForces the new fired a strong man I'll tell you that lists Graham seven fifty three and he has said thank you\nSo

and I had been talking about\nJoshua Thatcher for the express wrote about it on Saturday propose rules may make it harder to open a gun store in San Antonio that is exactly the plan that this current

inseparable they want to keep it heart make it harder for a law\nAbiding citizens to get in and keep and carry a gun because laws obviously do not have any effect on criminals they don't\nCriminals don't follow laws that's what makes him a criminal so gang bangers over here they are not going to go to the gun store and buy their gun is not where they're getting up so any laws that you pass on gun restrictions on gun stores only hurt the moms and dads who are trying to protect their little babies at home\nAnd the city council ought to be ashamed of themselves for considering further gun
