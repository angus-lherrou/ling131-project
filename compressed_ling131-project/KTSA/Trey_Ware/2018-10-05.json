Bush who I have lots of trouble with these days but even George W. Bush has been on the phone to all the senators talking to them about the great character Brett Kavanaugh George W. Bush should know him better than than almost anybody a step to his wife and family\nBecause Brett Kavanaugh was entrusted with the most sensitive information that our government could ever have\nThat anybody in our government could ever have so you know\nOver the past thirty some odd years are twenty eight years that he has been in public service\nThat they have been crawling all over him every chance they get ... this is not one of those deals where they show up and they knock on your door and they flash the FBI badge and they're wearing the up from simplest junior suit\nAnd they sit down and all that kind of thing they do all kinds of checking into they will show up and ask friends they might be in shorts and flip flops and it's like hey man what's going on\nHey what about Brett Kavanaugh and if anybody was ever going to say that did was a party animal man it'd be under those circumstances they try six ways of Sunday's Chuck Schumer would say to try to get information out to people before they trust them\nWith the most sensitive information that our government has he has undergone the most rigorous\nOf investigations the level of ... that he has undergone extraordinary the Senate has received far more information about him that has received about all prior Supreme Court nominees combined throughout American history\nI think about that\nFirst came to six FBI background or best occasions of him then the Senate Judiciary committee made public about five hundred thousand pages of documents dealing with Kavanaugh and his works five hundred thousand page\nOn top of that the committee received tens of thousands of pages of Kavanaugh court opinions articles in speeches\nAnd Kevin all answered an unprecedented one thousand two hundred Seventy eight post hearing written questions from senators it just a couple of days he sat down and did twelve hundred Thirteen hundred questions in writing back to the senator's\nThey were trying to toss him in the trash can then they were doing everything they could to discourage this guy and get rid of him\nWhile his family his wife beautiful wife beautiful daughters they're receiving death threats\nSenators have all the information they need to do what they are tasked with doing out of the constitution and their task is this provide advice and consent to President Trump's domination of cat on all to the Supreme Court that's it that is what they're tasked by the constitution to do\nThat this is really important this is not the first time the Senate has had the opportunity to review Kavanaugh's background is education is professional qualifications\nFor an important judicial post they did a twelve years ago when he was nominated to be an appellate court judge and guess what they found on him twelve years ago when they crawl all over in twelve years ago many of these same senators by the way many of the same people who are now wrecking his life\nGuess what they found twelve years ago the zero nada ...\nNothing\nThere is nothing in the record that has changed over the past twelve years that should bar Kavanaugh's confirmation of the nation's highest court\nThe fact that he served on the nation a second highest court in Washington DC should have been all the past that those senators needed yeah OK rubber stamp is dude we already crawl all over him and for twenty some odd years the every ... every force in our government is crowded out over him\nThat if you compare these unproven claims against Kavanaugh nearly Thirty years of distinguished professional career in which those who have interacted with him gave him nothing nothing but the highest praise\nNothing Kevin I was probably one of them\nQualified lawyers to ever be nominated for a position of Supreme Court he has more judicial experience and the vast majority of prior nominees the high court certainly more than justice\nElena Kagan Kagan did not spend one day as an appellate judge not one day as an appellate judge before Brock Obama nominated\nHer and she was confirmed by the Senate to the Supreme Court\nQuickly easily without fight and with Republican support you see this is not supposed to be a political football\nBottom line to all this is elections have consequences didn't Brock Obama tell that show really to John McCain he did elections have consequences the American people voted for Donald Trump to be the president of this country based largely on this very issue\nSorry Democrats you got to swallow that pill and they got to vote for the guy that he picks that's how that works this is not supposed to be about politics\nThis is about one thing and one thing only qualifications thought about your politics what they are all about right now is overturning the results of the twenty sixteen election they're trying to do this in the mid term they're trying to with the midterms so they can impeach Donald Trump\nSo they're doing this on several fronts and I'll give you just to right now this right here is all about stoking up a gender war\nThe left wants men and women to fight I'd rather love but the left doesn't want that they want women screaming in the streets\nHating on Donald Trump all this is\nIs a terrible attempt on the left\nTo generate the emotions of women and turn them out to the polls against Donald Trump that's what this is you gotta look through it you have to see it's not about Brett Kavanaugh they would have done this no matter who he put up this mad as Supreme qualify to be on the Supreme Court pun intended\nYou don't know anything by five but let's see what you think about all that that was shot by a judge ... was it in the void FBI investigation\nIs is a sham investigation is it a bowl bleep investigation as Menendez call it is is is like a sham and is Donald Trump making this into something that it is not is he trying to force Brett Kavanaugh onto the core by\nAnd are illegal means\nAnd what about these protesters who now see there are three hundred and some odd of them are arrested yesterday two one zero five nine nine fifty five fifty five two one zero five nine nine\nFifty five fifty five so do you think there are a do you think they're even a registered to vote do you do you support those protesters do you think that there are doing the right thing by harassing the senators threatening these senators\nOr there was some talk just a little while to go on ABC about Senator Lindsey Graham being harassed by one woman and he turned around and snapped at her of course the news did not\nOr all they covered was he turned around and snapped at her they didn't cover what she was doing to him say there's two sides to this and these people are being disruptive these people are are being threatening and they are saying let it quite literally saying I think there are a bunch of the ...

five\nAccording to the summary report FBI agents interviewed\nTen people and I reached out to a lab and they focus exclusively on witnesses with potential first hand knowledge of the alleged sexual misconduct by Brett Kavanaugh was that enough did they do enough to find out what was going on it's being called by Bob Menendez a senator a BS investigation listen to this\nFor defense and investigations of the reality is that that is not a full of a thorough investigation\nOkay and that is the line now coming from the Democrats so as as the due diligence spend done have they done all they can do to vet him and is it time to get on with the vote and make this thing happened as they are planning on doing effective today and having a vote on his confirmation\nThis weekend a two one zero five nine nine fifty five fifty five I Believe it is and I believe it is\nPrimarily not just because of what happened this week what happened this week was a sham what happened this week was an embarrassment for the United states of America what happened this week should get every Democrat voted out of office every Democrat who's running should be voted out of office based on what happened this weekend this week alone that's what I think\nBecause what they attempted to do was politically assassinate the character of a good man\nIn order to keep him off the court all for pure politics they're trying to overturn the election in twenty sixteen of Donald Trump\nAnd what they're doing is they're trying to spark a gender war they want men and women want blacks and whites they want all of us fighting in Haiti on each other just because it's going to drive people to the polls for their cause\nWe should not stand for that as citizens of this country\nWe should realize what they're attempting to do and don't forget Bob Mueller's out there and I bet you he makes a grand entrance sometime between now and the midterm elections adjust thirty three days now thirty three days people go to the polls and decide whether or not the Trump agenda continues or whether or not stop dead in its tracks\nAnd whether or not then he would be impeached\nTwo one zero five nine nine fifty five fifty five among those who were interviewed by the FBI and the so called sham investigation\nAmong those were mark judge PJ ... ties are the three individuals that Christine Blasey Ford said we're president right they're all three of those individuals had already provided written testimonials to the Judiciary Committee under the penalty\nThe owner the penalty a felony denying any knowledge of the alleged assault and apparently it's the same thing that they told the FBI so they were consistent in that in fact I'll say this is the FBI had uncovered anything new\nThan you would have heard about it like crazy from the Democrats they would not have been able to sit on that all day yesterday that um and screaming in front of the cameras see see see see we told you we told you we told you\nBut there's nothing there so this man's character was assassinated and his family threatened with their very lives for what purpose because the fit throwing Democrats can there but hurt they can't get over November of twenty sixteen that's the deal\nThat's the whole deal\nTo on zero five nine nine fifty five fifty five but now we have hundreds and hundreds of protesters there that at the Capitol in Washington DC there\nIn the Senate office buildings they had been following the senators around they have been threatening them they have been harassing them to one inch of their lives wherever they might be what do you think about those ... protesters\nAnd by the way several of them have been interviewed by media outlets in the past twenty four hours and you want to hear a common theme that they talk about\nThey talk about basically overthrowing the government of the United states they're talking about socialism taking hold in the United states going to a totalitarian as a government in the United states possibly a dictatorship\nWhen they talk about things such as getting rid of due process of law and the presumption of innocence for all in America not judge Brett Kavanaugh but these are the kinds of things that they're saying their interviews should we keep the presumption of innocence no we should get rid of the presumption of innocence\nAnytime somebody brings that accusation particularly a woman and you tell me what you think about it ladies should every single woman be believed\nShould every single man who is accused of sexual harassment or some sort of sexual impropriety should he stand guilty until he proved himself innocent Amy you're on K TSA with Trey Happy Friday Amy\nHowe tray I'm I Am that rare magically unicorn on the millennial
