this is your limit or this is how much we can pay for your car or whatever the case may be and all the while you're being taken advantage of fall\nThe Democrats take over the house this go round and maybe take over the Senate although their their chances of that do not look all that great\nWe are seeing some changes to the stock market a ... it's ... you know had a whole lot of ...\nThe stock market and people who invest in the stock market aren't dummies in fact they look at a projected changes politically and ever since you had this whole talk about Democrats taking over the house of representatives\nI don't know if you've noticed but the stock market has been extremely volatile with all of that news or they like the news that a Trump was in charge and we had a whole lot of economic success three point five percent GDP Growth\nWas announced on friday so so far the GDP Growth has been much higher than than Obama's one point eight\n... but now that there's talk of the Democrats are going to take over the house of representatives and and all the pollsters say that's a pretty good shot fair bet right there if you were done fantasy politics you would probably say that they were going to take over\nThe house of representatives now the stock market is responding with this volatility because they don't like that idea they say the idea of higher taxes coming back on businesses\nThey say the or many of the things that they have talked about the Democrats have talked about trying to impeach Trump or at the very least holding up his agenda by a subpoena ... him and everybody in the administration just tying them up with all kinds of investigations\nAnd no more Supreme Court nominees so the stock market definitely has been responding to that over the past couple of weeks when it became pretty clear that Democrats have a really good shot of taking over the house\nAnd I would say if they do take over the house ethics expect that there'll be more volatility like that and possibly\nA downturn in the stock market as well the president addressed that over the weekend he said we've made so much progress we don't want to give up that progress we can't allow that to happen\nAmerica is booming like never before because we're finally putting America First\nMore Americans are working today that at any point the history of our country as I said real gross domestic product grew in an ... rate of three and a half percent in the last quarter which ran from July through September or the last time a president has such a hot economy heading into congressional\nElections in his first term was Nineteen Seventy eight Jimmy Carter had four point one percent when Trump took office the growth rate was at one point eight percent and his first quarter but the economy quickly heat it up he has since posted quarterly growth numbers\nOf three percent to point a to point three to point to four point two and three point five these results course or no accident this is what happens when we pass policies to help American consumers workers businesses generate economic growth and opportunity and\nWe're seeing the results of that may well Hillary is not done she announced over the weekend that she'd still like to be president she was asked you know she's on a tour right now to get her name out there and her book out there that's what these candidates do like early on Castro's doing right now\nAnd she was asked while she was out running around or do you want to run again she said no I don't want to run again I just want to be president [laughter] yeah well see this that that's that that's the sticking point actually have to go out and pursue it\nWhich many will say that's exactly why she didn't win the last time either the Trump was everywhere all the time and that big black and red Trump airplane and Hillary made very few uh parents is going not going to some states at all states that she figured that she had in the bag and that he actually went to those states and the one she didn't say I'd like to be president is uh\nThe the work would be a work that I feel very well prepared for\nHaving been in the Senate for eight years having been a diplomat and the state department so she said you want to hear anything from her about it until after the mid term elections that Castro said the same thing she has however stepped up

officers I just want to kill Jews Boston Red Sox win the world series Adam Sandler\nA rubber and has been removed from ministry for allegations of sexual contact will talk about that and so much more this morning so the U.S military has begun delivering Jersey barriers to the southern border they've got a plan but in this plan together of course goes all the way the top with the secretary of defense James Mattis\nExpect to hear more about that plan a little bit later on today and what the plans are for our military down at the border\nAs now you've got it appears to be a total of three caravans headed our way there is no way that anyone now has any standing to claim that these are just you know loosely affiliated groups of folks who are getting together\nThat's what people were climbing about the first one and we said over and over again no this is being organized they're using social media like\nWhatsApp and what have you to organize these folks to assault our border make no mistake they attempt terrorists to assault the border to make the border collapse period and now they're going to send waves after waves after\nWaves of people here to assault the border and a non violent way obviously but to overwhelm our authorities at the border\nKnowing that there is no way that we're going to be able to take care of additional wave after wave after wave of humanity headed this direction on top of the already average of Nineteen hundred per weekend\nThat skip across the border so there's no way that our people down there are going to be able to keep up with all this and that's why the president has dispatched the military as backup\nThat they can't legally because of policy kind of taught us they can't do anything down there\nOther than be a backup for the national guard is about two thousand National Guard troops that are already there it'd be a backup also for the border patrol so that's what our military is going to do but also it speaks volumes to have guys and uniforms walking up and down the border as well putting Jersey barriers into place\nNow what we're finding out judge judicial watch dispatching people down there and into the the the original migrant caravan and I'm Irish caravan has shown over the weekend that they're not really interested in jobs and they're not really interested in anything other than getting into the United states of America\nThe president of Mexico that came out over the weekend and he said look I'm I'll give you a job I'm going to get a health care and they give you an opportunity right here stop\nYour in your house has to end to got says what he said to them they are in your house you can stop right here you can be here and they said no we're going to the United states that's why we all say when we look at this this was organized this has been this has\nBeen organized as a as a way to get people to collapse our our southern border that's exactly what's going on\nAnd judicial watch dispatched a camera crew down there and that's what they found they did find criminals they did find children who were being smuggled who are being brought up by smugglers and they also found other criminals in the middle of all this but they also found people telling them we're not afraid of what's going on in El Salvador we're not afraid of what's going on in our doors\nWere not scared like we had been told you know here we have been told over and over again that's why they're coming now\nThey're saying that's not why British tried to go to the United states they have spokespeople they have people that they are arranging to stand in front of the cameras that look a certain way that our arranging all of their students to watch found all of this out this is all well planned and so it was the next one that just tore down\nNew barricades in the south of Mexico to to do their march and the next room which is already forming which is going to leave on Halloween day and head toward the United states waves and waves and waves are now coming\nThe question is only this how are we going to deal with it so here on\nLoop for ten westbound live for ten between starcraft in Harry where Spock a major accidents fatal accident we're being told oh by authorities\nAnd so with that accident there is just shut down west bound for ten there between Harry where's Bach and er starcraft northeast side of San Antonio it's a very heavily traveled area this time of day going westbound this afternoon about five\nIs going to be very heavily traveled gone the opposite way going back east bound the right now west bound for ten and I see people posting that they have been stuck in it for about an hour or so so far vehicles are being told to get off for ten and to get down onto the access road that's right there by McArthur park\nSo that's going to cause some slow down in that area if you're typically go westbound on look forward to and across the northeast side right there were northeast Baptist hospital is you've got McArthur park and then you've got to do just wrote and all that is a severe slow down and you're going to be dealing with that more was acting your traffic coming up here on the

school\nNow is those folks typically would you go on Harry where's Bach and go on to west bound for ten now they're going into the massive humanity there the all the cars that are in front of McArthur park\nAnd they're having to stay over there on the access road so that's adding to the heartache that's on the access road in front of McArthur park as it goes on up to ... and then I'll let you back on after you go through the light\nAnd ... just said he is reporting that has backed up I Can't see that far on the camera angle that I have I can see cars stopped as far as the eye can see what he's saying out to North cliff\nThat is north of shirts civil on southbound I thirty five\nThat's almost a New Braunfels in fact how far this is all backed up so it is one heck of a delay here on southbound thirty five to west bound move forward to avoid that area at all cost if you can you know sixteen oh four that might work I I don't even know you can get to sixteen oh four comfortably right now\nAnd all the feeder roads now are now affected by this like I was just talking about Harry worst Bach\nAnd pair and vital and I'm sure when you get up close to that area Judson Rhoda people trying to get off on judge sooner top or wine or whatever and head on west bound from there also are causing some tie ups and all that area too so it's it's pretty much a gridlock situation over here on the west bound for ten or the side of town\nCalled ... dot com is joining me now we talk every Monday and we talk about what's going on with the money and the markets and what to expect it over the weekend Carl the president said that voters\nAre he's warning voters of economic set back if the Democrats or take Congress we have seen some increased volatility in the market along about the same time that there's been a lot of talk to the Democrats would take over\nThe house of representatives and they do like where the economy has been headed and what's been going on with the economy a you know the whole concept of of what's happening now with with politics it does have an effect on the market does it not\nIt does and you know that the stock market historically are best yourself liked gridlock in Washington\nWhich is kind of makes sense to a certain degree sometimes but really the main thing right now is the fact that there's a group of people that believe the economy has done its best it's doing very well right now but the best is behind us and it's going to slow down a bit not not dramatically but enough to where\nDoes that justify stocks of these levels and at the same time the Federal Reserve Keith rate the rate as we talked about and so that's the fear is that that they're going to keep putting the brakes on while the economy is slowing down at the same time which is a good combination so you had the stock market volatility and\nYou know October ... for for volatility not always down it's just the tourist for volatility so\nA investors need to number one realize that you know stocks are going to be volatile times but I think this was where you have to look at your whole portfolio and say how much do I even have in the stock market you know you have to have this free determined allocation going into stuff like this this isn't the time to\nYou know panic if they won't need to shift everything around this was a time to say I need to be up to this topic if I if I Want to be\nBut certainly panicking at times where things are falling like they are because it's been pretty bad and not so far you know and it's not unprecedented by any means but it's something that gets still costs and they\nShow what are you what do you advise people to do in that realm I remember in two thousand or late two thousand seven men two thousand and eight\nPeople with a lot of money in the stock market that I knew they were saying that they were going to all cash and they were getting prepared and a lot of them did very well during the recession because they got out of the stock market at that time I'm sure you're not advising people to anything that drastic but just what are you telling people\nKnow not and and if you were to talk to most of those people Ninety percent of them that they're telling the truth I\nDidn't get back in anywhere near the lows and in a lot of his never got that it at all so for those people you know tactically\nMakes sense to ship something around but I have yet to see people go from you know all in to all out to back to all in and and make money I mean they're very very rare so tactical moves\nMakes perfect sense if you're somebody that wants more money in stocks and this is your time you've had a ... percent dropped or you can take advantage of it\nIf you're somebody that says I have enough that you don't do anything\nI mean you just don't do anything and and again some people have thirty percent of their money in stocks I'm twenty so I'm sixty it all depends on your specific situation but\nYou know when you're going through something like this this is the time to stand back and go much to have in the stock market\nThat one thinks we're ... you don't you know determine that going into some\nDo you first see something like a two thousand and eight on our horizon anywhere\n[noise] I don't in fact I uh I talked about it this way and that actually see something that is more akin to the dot com bubble there is a group of stocks that are left\nPrimarily the technology you know and those particular stocks are the ones getting hit the hardest right now Amazon and what have you those are huge a\nCourse precisely in the end they are overlooked it they're getting it harder but I think if you look over all the dot com bubble there's a lot of stock that did very well during that time slot diversified portfolio it's fine not like two thousand eight minute but during the dot com bubble there were stuck to it very well and I think\nThis could be something like that where you get a ... you know specific number of stocks\nThat do get very very hard to overlook that they're very expensive\nVery good Carl eggers eggers capital our time checking out thank you Carl appreciate your time seven forty two now I K TSA look for ten of Harry where's by west bound I see a white vehicle of some kind of can't tell what it is but some sort of white vehicle sitting on its side in one of the lanes we know is basically the right hand lane there in front of McArthur park\nUm and that is what's causing the entire free way to be shut down because it is a a it is a fatality uh uh you know a death in the accident\nAnd so the accident has caused the all the other traffic that would typically be on west bound for ten and then there's a lot this time in the morning in the mornings westbound is typically heavier than east bound and then the evenings east bound as heavier than West Nile law that has to do with the medical center a lot of it has to do with usa and what have you\nUh you're not going anywhere if you're headed west bound around with for ten a very very slow just a couple of miles per hour on the access road because you're still going through the lights up and that could do just by the time you get there\nYou will be sitting on this for a long time if you're cutting down south down on age thirty five and trying to make that turn there and get on west bound for ten it is at a crawl\nThat's in front of cowboys and it goes on a pass to a\nA star craft and then as we said right in front of McArthur park is where this accident happened on the loop itself\nBy the way my shells going to do the same thing oh yeah oh yeah you wait Michelle's gonna state to state that yeah the sales going around and say if you get me you know you're going to get Obama you get ... back to Iraq is back watch just wants to see what happens here\nSo she was asked over the weekend do you want to run again she said oh no I don't want to run again I just want to be president\nShe said this was Hillary either work would be work that I feel very well prepared for having been in the Senate for eight years and having been a diplomat at the state department both of which were complete failures by the way\nHer time as a senator from New York carpetbagger and a diplomat in the state department the secretary of state complete and utter failures may I say Benghazi\nIf she wants to take another whack at it I Hope she does I really hope she gets and in fact Hillary why don't you just announced right now that would be awesome she says she's got to wait till after the returns like early on and Corey and Kamala they're all waiting till after the midterms to get it but a man of great they got it right now\nSpeaking of the germs wow it's rocketed the turnout rate and this year's midterm election is blowing away everything all across the country right here and Barrett county we've had over two hundred and Eighteen thousand vote one week alone\nSo if we stay on that track if we stay on that day so we keep pace up by the way we can see four hundred thousand maybe even a half a million people boat in ... county in early voting this week\nIs the final week over early voting eight to eight at most of these polls and then of course election day is next Tuesday usually the heaviest day for voting is the last day for early voting and so a lot of people may be waiting till friday to get over their bill last minute remember man I forgot about time to go\nGo early and vote and make your boys be heard and all this pretty amazing that we're seeing this now in about ten states across the country all mid term records have been broken this looks like a presidential election\nSeven fifty five let's check on the mess now over here on for ten west bounce back you were saying that it's backing up to the shirts area now at three double o nine is that right\nYeah that's correct that's where you're seeing those delays and start to build a if you are on thirty five now I think we do finally have some semblance of good news is looking at the four tenant Harry worse by cam it looks like they've up right at that overturned car sales and gotten it out of there\nNow again this is an ongoing investigation so the police are going to be they're investigating until they get all the information they need so that's not a guarantee it'll be gone anytime soon but that is some good news\nBut yeah those delays are backing up past the shirts area\nAnd it's really causing some heavy delays if you want to take six you know for southbound it's still pretty clear their wars by parkway has some congestion on it now\nOr if you want to take that westbound it just from all the cars peeling off but it's still much better than anything you'll sit through a on for ten and thirty five right now if you are a little further down you can also take as three sixty eight to get out of the way there as well\nVery good very good thank you Zach pretty shitty yeah that's the thing right there is is try to avoid and and as he was saying even the feeder roads the back roads or things like parent vital\nA you've got a top or wine and judge soon anal Connor and all of those roads are stacking up now as people are feeling awful by thirty five they're heading south out they're thirty five they're trying to find another way to go\nAlso Harry worst box in the northeast side in front of garner ... middle school it's all backed up as well because those cars typically if you know that area they pass in front of garden and they go underneath loop for ten and get on loop portend westbound well they can't get on a loop portend west bound because that's exactly where they accidents is\nRight there in front of McArthur park so they're having to stay on the access road go up to ... which is where the ... and the taco cabana and all that stuff Broadway bank and then do whatever they're going to do after that so it's a ... this mess has been here since a little after five o'clock this morning\nHere we're coming up on eight so that's three hours now they have been working this accident and still no relief in sight although he's he's right I'm looking at where the vehicle is gone now but investigators are there\nThere's a number of police units now that are lined up uh in that right hand lane and on the shoulder right where you get on to look forward to in West bound they're\nOften very worst box where it feeds on there and that that's where all the work is going on right there in that particular site so a boy that area at all costs this morning 'cause it's

and what do you have to say and it was Halloween time at the White House yesterday we got more details about this coming up breaking news traffic and whether all morning until nine right here on KPFA Andy you're on kick the essay which right what's going on anti\nWell good morning story I have two questions for you on his graduate level but I think you can handle it the other civil a simple one is as a cyclist is it a state law that in stop and go traffic such as we're having this morning you're not allowed to block\nA driveway or intersection if you've seen that you can't wear it in the stop\nAnd go traffic and what I that's what I understand yes okay well I saw some do some do and the graduate level question but when you were referring\nTo a you're a attendance at NFL game yeah yeah there's the meals so they have a way of seeing if you're watching it if you're on cable or direct TV or something like that did they just a technology tell them that you're a viewer\nAh yes yes in fact in fact what I Am told\nWhat I'm told Eddie is that it works well much the same way these days as it does uh with uh with with your computer or a click and and so I'll give you an example there are some shows that I Will not even a click on while I Know that show is on 'cause I don't want them to get my rating\nFor whatever the amount of time is so let's just say it's a shepherd Smith on Fox I Can't stand to watch the guy anymore he needs to be on CNN or MSNBC I just can't I Can't watch him anymore so I purposefully at two PM I make sure my television doesn't come on\nOkay and the same thing is true with with a lot of these football games although yesterday I was just clicking through the channels and that's what I so I don't know technically how all that works but I don't want even take a chance you know what I'm saying\nIt yeah go ahead record won it counts for\nAs far as I Know I'm not I I I'm not all up and you know exactly how that works but that's what I've been told anyway yes okay\nThank you for your ... you better have a good one I I don't know I I'm not really um you know as far as that I have not been a purposefully saying I'm just done with us and all that but what I look at that when I look at those stadiums\nAre very empty for a reason guys and the only thing the only thing that ever changed was what we went through with the anthem controversy now I Know they're blaming it on all kinds\nOh thanks but that structure of the U.S military has begun delivering the Jersey barriers down to the border\nThey're getting set up man while over in Mexico the Mexican president over there and you know I thought he said hey listen you guys can stay well put you to work and all that stuff this is your house two guys that you can stay here man you are home basically at the end to God's that\nStay here we're going to put you to work and all that kind of stuff the migrant said no we're not interested in staying here\nThat's because they are organized come to the United states put as much maximum pressure on our system here in these waves and waves and waves\nKeep in mind that we're not talking about just seven thousand or four thousand or whatever the number's going to be by the time they get here there's another way behind in another way behind that that are coming they're coming in waves\nNow it's very ... it it it it it is\nI don't want to use it I Want to be careful about using the term military where this is concerned because people get the idea of armed soldiers and they're coming and ... and it's not that's not at all but it's very militaristic and the way that you send another wave and another battalion and another battalion another battalion\nComing to the coast and our people there cannot keep up with the business\nSo what you're going to have to do to be able if you if you want to be serious about vetting these people then you're going to have to close it down and set up posting these other countries and that's where you're going to do your vetting you're gonna have to do when you got to really come up with a deal with Mexico\nAnd do vetting and Mexico and these are bad people or these are people who don't deserve a Saddam either turn right back there in Mexico said go home go right back where you came from which you you're gonna have to do it outside of the country either that or be have the president go ahead and suspend the asylum law which he can do for a short amount of time\nBut you can't have both because once they stepped foot in the United states they're here forever they're never going back guys once they step foot here\nThen they get their asylum hearing which was seven thousand here four thousand there three thousand here in addition\nTo the Nineteen hundred per weekend that are already coming over guess what you you can't keep up with it there's not enough judges in America\nTo hear all of those cases so what you're going to have to do is you're going to have to do this somewhere else\nAs we've been talking about on this show you need to do it in those countries the border is close other than ... traffic coming across for commerce and if you want to uh approach us for asylum you got to do it in your home country you need to go to the American consulate or the embassy there in your country\nAnd you walk in and say I want asylum I Want to go to the United states of America\nOr we set up some sort of thing and in Mexico like we were saying it away from us territorial awful our property and we say okay we'll vet you right here\nBut this is untenable this is not going to work there is no way that you're going to be able to vet all these people and you're going to be letting some criminals in the way we already know through judicial watch and others who have been down there", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Trey Ware", "city": "San Antonio", "day": "29"}
