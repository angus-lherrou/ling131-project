now like you so I'm all these people are streaming toward the United states it seems to me that we need to get this\nRight so that we can stem the tide and the flow of further that would be screaming to the United states what do we do\n[laughter]\nWell once they are set foot in the United states even the tip of a shoe on on American soil\nAnd make a claim for asylum they're entitled or hearing now asylum does that mean the economy has gone sour asylum means that they are the victim of intentional governmental behavior\nI'm back home which is harming them so if you lose a job you can't claim asylum\nBut if the government is refusing to enforce criminal law and gangs rule the streets you can claim asylum and just giving a two hypothetical the claim for asylum under the current law\nGives you a right to a hearing before a judge those hearings usually come about between six and eight months after you filed a claim\nIn the Obama administration\nWants you came here and saw the claim the government's set you free and expect you to come back for your hearing many did many didn't and the Trump Administration the government is detaining you until the time of your hearing at separating you from your children that detention is lawful the separation is not\nSo that's one aspect of this which is the claim for asylum which is a a right to the Congress is given to anybody who's chose sets foot in the United states\nCan the president use the military to stop this well yes and no you can't send the military into Mexico they can only stay in the United states on\nOur side of the border and they can't use deadly force against people merely because they come in large numbers they can only use deadly force against other deadly force\nAnd there's no sign of these people uh that these people have weapons\nSuppose somebody sneaks into the country rather than going through a lawful portal and claiming asylum well if they're caught within two hundred miles of the spot from which they snuck into\nThat can be arrested on the spot and deported without a hearing back to Mexico if they make it beyond two hundred miles there almost home free because then the feds would need a warrant in order to arrest them\nNow this these laws are pre World War two a vintage and so I agree with some and disagree with some I think the president is largely correct when he says the laws are a mess and we need to revamp something like a lot of laws they're a combination of\nCompromise is coming from different generations with different political pressures on the politicians who for its the compromises but that's the situation that he could front now the best thing that could be for him I think would be if the Mexican government\nA turn the care a caravan around is actually a confrontation at the border I don't know what's going to\nHappen yeah you know he also says if we're going to be a nation we have to have boarders that's the whole point of you know a sovereign nation ... what I think a lot of us are concerned about is you know there's a Martha was talking about this on her show last night about fifty seven million in central and South America\nAre wanting to come to the United states obviously that would be a catastrophe for our country of all of a sudden we had to absorb fifty seven million\nNew people that would be streaming across Mexico to come here so what we think\nSteroid seven thousand is a drop in the bucket fifty seven million wealthy\nAnd see it right now we have to we have to communicate that we have borders or else they just got that encourages more to come but I think the bottom line to all this is we have to find a way to vet these people many of them are coming because they do want to find a a better life and they do want to work here in our economy and that's fine\nBut really we need to make sure we know who is that's the whole point of having an immigration system as far as that is that\n... that is the government's duty right is to vet each of them individually not as a group yeah and my own view is many of these people legitimately are looking for jobs jobs that a lot of Americans wouldn't take the pay rate\nA
