um so I wrote a new blog this morning I Hope you'll check that out it's on the tray where paycheck K TSA dot com\nBut an important reminder and the Mets of chaos\nThat matters how we do things\nAnd what we do what we do and how we\nDo it it really does matter and it's in the a blog this morning just go to trade T. R. E. Y. Katie essay that's trade T. R. E. E. Y. Katie essay\nAnd it will come up with the news channel a case that last night at a story on something you and I've been talking about now for weeks and that is proposed regulations on the gun stores in San Antonio as this city council is definitely making a gun grab now they're saying they're not making a gun grab we don't we're not coming out to your guns\nThat simply is not true they say that all day but it is a gun grab that as a back door gun grab isn't a ... it's an infringement on the rights of law abiding citizens to exercise their Second Amendment bottom line they call it whatever they want\nBut I don't buy into political BS I go straight to what the real deal is here in the real deal is this is back door gun control in San Antonio Texas if you as a law abiding citizens who care about liberty and defense freedom if you allow your city council do this\nProblem though with regulating guns sales or gun control is we don't need it said Greg broadcasts let's not penalize responsible gun owners and gun sellers\nAnd make their lives more difficult he's absolutely right in fact one of these uh city councilwoman district seven councilwoman ... said the regulations will help protect\nThe city's youth without saying how because she knows or maybe she doesn't know and I'd be happy to explain it to her that it will do know such a thing or this or that this ordinance that they're talking about putting effect does not do one thing to protect any ... years in San Antonio from gun violence\nThat's the most ridiculous thing that anybody could ever say about this or any other gun regulation that they're trying to put into effect in San Antonio now a ... and ... and brought up a really good question because people started to say yesterday at the end of the show we're talking about this plan\nThis game this back door gun control people started to talk about the charter amendments\nAnd this is why people are turning out to vote for vote yes\nOn the charter amendments and ... said connected to make the today show how there to connect with or to connect and that it's ... it's it's measures like this\nWhen the city council does things like this or take statues down in the mail and I are approves the moving of the Senate tap against the will of people when they are doing things out of the will of the people of San Antonio that the people of San Antonio or looking for a more direct way\nTo redress their government instead of waiting for another two years to be able to vote for somebody both him back at office or better yet vote them out of office they want to mediate redress and that's why people are looking at these charter amendments particularly a as their way of keeping things like this from happening\nSo if they put this in in effect I'll just give you an analogy if they put this in effect and they start this backdoor gun control by limiting where guns are sold in San Antonio if they do that is a passes then people will have an opportunity to get a petition together\nTo repeal that to to bring that up\nAnd that's why people are making that connection and that's why people are supporting these amendments to a big degree whether you support them or not is is is uh outside of of the discussion right now I'm explaining why people are supporting these because they see a city government\nThat is not responsible to them and and being held accountable to them\nAnd it's measures like this that are driving this and of course I said the statute to me the statue\nAnd we're watching very closely this morning\nThey are not going to be a factor for us right now but possibly by midday and afternoon\nToday we could see some storms kind of get\nPretty big around San Antonio with some pretty heavy downpours little bit later on this afternoon so we are going to stay on top of that\nAnd then hurricane Michael is over there and the Gulf of Mexico and ready to just blow up today as a hurricane one hour and a cat one now\nAnd it looks like will be a cat three by about one o'clock or so tomorrow afternoon making landfall right there in the Florida Panhandle which would affect Alabama and Florida in a really really big way and not only is the wind and rain that's a major concern but a twelve foot storm surge\nBecause you've got that Big Bend area and out of Texas but uh Florida right there and all that water has got to go somewhere and that's where that water is going to collect\nSo last night the ceremony was held at the White House it was very impressive every single Supreme\nCourt justice was there for the swearing in ceremony last night\nA justice Brett Kavanaugh now he was already formerly a justice because chief justice John Roberts had given him the oath of office on Saturday after the Senate confirmed me this was just ceremonial but it was big Mitch McConnell was there the edge of the newest justice is family\nOr was there are many senators including our own senators were there as well in the East Room of the White House\nLet's listen to a little bit of it as it came off about six o'clock our time last night\nAlthough the ... Senate confirmation process tested me as it is tested others it did not change me\nMy approach to judging remains the same a good judge must be an umpire neutral impartial decider who favors no lid again or policy a judge must be independent and must interpret\nThe law not make the law\nA judge must interpret statutes as written and the judge must interpret the constitution is written informed by history and tradition and precedence\nThat was justice Brett Kavanaugh speaking after he was ceremonial ... sworn in last night\nAnd now the Democrats are not given up now they continue their war on Brett Kavanaugh for them it's not over with this is gonna be a great fundraising tool for them has been a great fundraising tool for them\nAnd they're hoping they can keep us alive to the midterms as I've been telling you they all idea is age gender war to fire up women against Republicans and get us to hate\nHate each other that's what this was all about and it's all coming from your loving

about\nWhile I'll tell you what it was about and it it's it's the end result of a process turned sour\nThat began with the destruction of Robert Bork yeah so the Democrats and then they attempted destruction of Clarence Thomas\nBut the Democrats and then the refusal even to consider the perfectly loss on elderly appropriate nomination of Merrick Garland but the Republicans and a democratic pay back for that this is no way to confirm\nThe Supreme Court justice both parties in my view were equally at fault look Kevin ... not my God I'm a libertarian right and if you want to know what my

wouldn't want to have to justify publicly right judge a jet one justice Kavanaugh was judge Kavanaugh he wrote that the feds can access that without a search warrant on their own without your knowledge or consent so he's not my guide money is there\nThe process is over the court has to get to work and it has to repair the image that was created by senators in both parties as just another political branch of the government it is not a political branch its job is not to do the people's will\nIts job is to interpret the constitution\nIt is the anti democratic branch of government who's a
