the full unabashed story encompassed within the footprint of the automobile\nThis sacred space belongs to all of us indigenous Donald taxing and defender Texan Mexican and present day citizens traditionally the complete store the Alamo has not been told so you're right they want to basically changed the story of the Alamo\nAnd force everybody to go through one entry point and the city is only going to have control of that area five nights a year yes\nIsn't that amazing isn't that amazing so basically we're going to sign over our right to that whole area to the state and the state is it and gun control this area uh for the Next Fifty years old with two twenty five year options\nSo so the people that own property down there the citizens of San Antonio can't go on that property uh freely they're going to have to go through one ... truck point\nAnd we run one point six million people are visitors to the Alamo every year so you want to talk about ten minute wait times that's an

to stand in front of the Alamo the chapel and take a picture and say wow here I Am this is where this is where they defended or our liberty here in Texas and this is our cradle of democracy here in

see what they want them to see\nWhat they want to Tucson and that's why they gotta move that sort of top down there and then they're going to restrict free speech in the areas well going to have a little area where you can congregate and actually have your protester or speak freely the rest of the area it's off limits it's a it's a non free speech zone this is yeah this is a radicalized version of the Alamo to me\nYet and you know\nI I think I have other issues a lot of different issues on this project but uh this one is uh the biggest problem that I have with it and everybody should have a problem with this because basically\nYes we're going to lose our downtown ... is\nThe state and not have not have free access to that plaza well way it's always been three hundred years you know\nThat's just absolutely heartbreaking that that anybody would even consider doing this and locking the people of San Antonio out of their own piece of property around the Alamo in downtown that

politics good morning John good morning thanks for having me again so Nikki Haley bales already has got to bail by the end of the year and I watched all the pundits yesterday going why what's she doing what's going on must be something nefarious must be something a foot\nUs John hey we're take on all that\nWell I don't think it's mysterious because it was a leak if there was anything nefarious are really bad about her departure if it was harmful to the Trump Administration in any substantial way somebody would have leaked it a long time ago that's how this works\nAnd instead it was a total surprise to everybody in the media and nobody knew this was coming and I suspect that is one of the reasons why she played it pretty close to ... she apparently disgusted with President Trump some time ago\nAnd then she surprised everybody by announcing it and saying she'd be leaving at the end of the year but I think that's probably because she just kept tight control over the information and the Lakers were able to get old\nShe's forty six she has a lot of political ambition she can get out right now she was a governor so she did something here that shores up what most governors lacking that is international foreign policy experience she now has that\nUh everybody loves her and thinks he's a really wonderful and fantastic so she can spend the next couple of years are raising some money going on a speaking tour writing the book and doing all the stuff that you set yourself up so that you can run against my pension twenty twenty four\nI think that's the plan I think she was pretty honest when she said she wasn't planning in any way to run against President Trump she supports his re election I think that was from the heart and I really think twenty twenty four hours for a year if she wants to make a place where they think she's pretty well positioned to do so I think she's more plausible candidate for twenty twenty four than anybody in the Democratic party is for twenty twenty right now\nOh no doubt about that and let's talk about that because they're already beginning to run and Hillary Clinton and her calls for instability\nAgainst Republicans which we've already seen come from Maxine Waters we've already seen it come from Cory Booker\nThis is what the left and the Democrats have right now attack Republicans where you find them run the amount of

blown up over in a Washington apparently because he had Trump stickers on it sitting outside of a bar uh what else is going to happen here you know Rand Paul said last night I feel like somebody's going to be assassinated if they don't ratchet down\nAnd Rand Paul was that the last assassination attempt he was at the field was correct at least we shot so he knows exactly what he's talking about besides being assaulted themselves I mean this was a press take irresponsible dangerous statement by Mrs Clinton and it's\nLiterally let me let me do this or John Donne ... can you pull that off the Hillary comment I I just in case we have anybody who did not hear it I Want to play it and then let you comment on it should go ahead Don run it\nYou cannot be several with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough\nTo win back the house and or the format that Clinton ... can start again finance health and the only thing that the Republican theme to recognize and respect strength [noise]\nAll right John go ahead\nI like I said breathtaking irresponsible I mean this borders on ... or just the violence\nIn a time when the Democratic party electric cars already showing signs of violence and extremism she's fanning the flames and it's very very telling that the media isn't saying a bad word\nAbout it if the public and it said this during the Obama years or even now they would melt down it would be twenty four seven three sixty five news or with the the biggest story in the world and instead she just throws is out there and they don't care this is going to end with people getting killed Rand Paul is absolutely right\nAnd it's the responsibility of the Democratic party's leadership to denounce this language of the strongest possible terms\nAnd encourage everyone to remain working peaceably within the political system\nIt is the responsibility of the media to make them do it that's their job if you're a quote unquote reporter you're supposed to go to every Democrat in the country right now and say here's Hillary Clinton calling for instability and violence where do you come down on this ... this will you denounce Hillary Clinton\nYou know that's what they would do it for a Republican and said this and it is the correct thing to do in this case this needs to be in the bud before it\nGets worse show what is the difference between her saying that between Cory Booker saying get on their faces between Maxine Waters saying get in their faces\nAnd all the Democrats who were so upset when Gabby Giffords got shot and they said it was because Sarah Palin\nHad a target on the back of Democrats when she was running a and remember how they gave us a lesson in how we need to be civil and how well you need to tone it down and we need to be quiet and we can't do those kinds of things because people go out and now now they feel like\nThey're the ones who can run out there and say threaten people this is incredible uh in in today's world and you're right the silence of the media while not surprising is absolutely heartbreaking on our nation today that she's going to get away with saying this\nA deafening silence especially if you look at what they said back during the climate of hate frenzy after the Tucson shooting that was disgusting frame job that was as bad as what they tried to do to Brett Kavanaugh and they tried to do it to every Republican and conservative in the country and it was just completely over the top\nBack then and now it's a one eighty or violent rhetoric is fine I mean is it okay for early Clinton said don't be civil to these mass to Republicans it's incredible but it's also a sign of sheer desperation how bad a lot of this\nThe only thing they can do right now is trade is still there voters enthusiasm for the midterms and you'll notice that while they're doing this they're no longer trying to depress Republican turnout because that ship has sailed the cabinet bid for them it was all and it was a Democrat will of the dice on character assassination it was outrageous it didn't work\nThe Republican base of super fired up and the only thing they can do right now is traded with their people to the polls in greater frenzy so they'll say\nAnything to try to get their voters worked up in March ...\nI'll say it again the answer to all of this that is happening right now whether it is the cabinet character assassination are now the Hillary comments about instability toward the Republicans in those on the right is a red wave\nI'm not predicting it but I'm telling people right now that if you ... if you find this so disgusting\nIf you find the way that they are handling things so unbearable in our country the only answer is a red wave you've got to roll that red wave ride over the top of them so that they have no voice left whatsoever no\nAnd and I'll promise you that things get better really fast if you do that if you crush the Democrats in the selection if you really great party spirit and the selection you're going to be us down did how fast immediate improved they won't be taking orders from the DNC anymore their their coverage will get better automatically not perfect the better the violence will tone down because the Democratic party leadership order\nIt to tone down they can turn this stuff on and off like they're turning a water tapped look how fast all the protesters vanished from the Supreme Court overnight when they realize there is no point in funding and busing them in and organizing them anymore I don't\nBelieve that any of this stuff is sincere grassroots this is all orchestrated and if you crush the Democrats at the polls they'll turn it off because they know what's hurting conversely\nIf they win they only ratcheted up\nOh absolutely the order more of it if they think it's working and it's going to get them somewhere in twenty twenty you you better believe it's going to get worse if they do well at the polls\nRead him at Breitbart dot com and of course Dr zero year one that's John ... thank you John we'll talk next week thanks very much for having me\nCom the judge Kelly Kraus\nJoe gum is is that

fifty five fifty five today's big day because today is when the ILO stuff is going to be talked about downtown and a couple of a couple of ways be session and then of course with a\nWith a design a review a group as well and the big question that people have today and I have it as well is this concept this idea of locking down animal pleasant only having one entrance point I Know that was a sticking point for you as well\nHow are you going to do that if the if the Catholic Church when they needed that area over in Eighteen Seventy one said the reason the or the way we're dating the Silver's has got to remain open to all it\nIt defeats the purpose doesn't it to to have the Alamo plows area and then you know people have to go through one area or one gate to get there\nYeah well so that's a concept that ... that has taken the most time to to work out and you know the the what we're trying to achieve\nA where our entire state is trying to achieve including San Antonio is average space that reflects history uh that were beer is the site and what happened there\nAre but also remains the center of civic life for San Antonio I maintained all along that I'm\nJust like the Catholic Church they said we've got to have a stage that is open to the public that is free to the public\nUh that's twenty four seven\nAccessible and I think with this plan um you'll see it but we've accomplished that\nUm the question of how do we manage the flow of the death rate access do always remains especially when we're trying to bring a better understanding of history there and so that's dealt with through these portals now they're not locked down\nOr in fact the um the ... the battleground is seen\nThrough um you know the the footprint\nArea which is why people have to work through the portal but the whole idea of access points just so that we can have both a space where it can be reflective of the history accurate today history but also remain free and open\nAnd on gender to match what a is reflected in voice and that's why are we worked for a while after the original resolution was drafted to achieve that before I signed\nIt well I understand that I I ah I looked at this plan or as best I can from what's available out there and I just can't imagine the Alamo grounds the area they're being on lockdown\nAnd you only have one access point to get in first of all you got a million six people to visit the area every year and I know you had trouble with that and the ten minutes I'm standing in line to get on to Alamo plaza\nWhere it's not free and open and unfettered access doesn't make sense to me being a San Antonio guy that grew up here and I was always able to ... sit and eat the tree or or whatever the case may be and now\nThey're going to be able to restrict access and I can see in the future where they where they say okay you know it's totally locked down and we can't come in at all\nWell that's not the bill and that's why we wrote it in that way that and the ... the land office a has basically guarantee there's not going to be wait times are not going to be lines if you want to take your stack when she go have a watch him yellow plaza right in front of the ah right in front of the barracks or or the church you can still do that\nBut we want to make sure that not only really have the opportunity to remain\nAn open free civic space but we also have\nUm a better management of a ... flow which is Ninety five percent people weren't from here and eat the need to walk away with some sense of history and the sanctity of the battle plus the the three hundred years of history that that has made the Alamo one of the most recognizable sites in the world I don't I don't think it's either or\nAnd I think that as people step back from what I'm this plan is is not walled off it's not locked down or the only way we can\nAchieve both is to have um some manage some reasonable you managed to access and that's you know that's the concept that took\n... in my opinion the most work or to get done\nYeah so the idea is they have to go to the museum so that they hear the spiel before they got they don't\nKnow how they do not have to do that so there is a a wide walk away under the plans of the design\nThat essentially you'd have to walk past the museum\nUm and you have the choice of whether or not to go through the museum or not whether to take A Guided tour not\nYou can go in a yourself or you don't have to uh do any of the regime activity but they want at least some flow of traffic so that number one you get an oriented to where you are a which is again a the center of\nLife in San Antonio for three hundred years but you also have the opportunity to partake in that kind of A Guided history\nI don't it's the same it's the same thing\nI ... I guess my my hang up is why do it at all I mean why why not just have an open where people can get on the grounds and people can walk around like they've done all this time and they don't have to go through any Porto why of portals at all\nI hear you try and and I ask myself the same question but after\nLooking at this and and having the conversations with the management committed if it comes down to this Ninety five percent of the people who come to San Antonio go to the Alamo have never been here before sure and they're coming to the Alamo because maybe they saw", "show_name": "Trey Ware", "year": "2018", "city": "San Antonio", "day": "10"}
