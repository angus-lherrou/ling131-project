a ton of ... which I asked\nMy issue is I have a chronic illness and I still work full time and I and not letting it take all my life good\nOn that question is is how do I I check 'em for like the doctor though is that the recently I recently switched off crying for my death above started again I'm\nAlso have a chronic illness you're going to hit the duck double every year\nRight um it's\n... the guy that happening on the go it it it's not they don't see it and it's not life threatening are you going to do it every year\nNow okay so now I look at what what is the nature of this what was the nature of the illness\nI mean I don't want to go into detail that is that it's an air tanker commissioned officers are unsure of what it comes on okay um so if there was a ... year what I Do is very I'm sure because it's relatively new got I got I yeah\nWell what I Would do is just try to estimate what you think it's going to cost you a year\nAnd the more experienced God help you that you have with is the better your estimates are badly because once you've did battled with it for five years you're you're going to kind of know a five year average versus five months\nYou're kind of guessing it what it's going to cost you in a year right right and you just put that in has a budget item so let's just make up a number okay if you're the duck double was six thousand and you're going to run through your six thousand over the duck double every year then that's five hundred bucks a month\nIf it's three thousand dollars a year this is going to cost me out of pocket that's two hundred and fifty a month and I just put a\nYou know a\nA whatever a line in your budget\nFor medical expands on doing raw Nick medical when just call you call it chronic or whatever just give it a name and

this or something yeah but for now for now you're saying it's predictable\nOr that you're going to have issues we just don't know how severe or expensive they are going to be up into your future and so ... for the next so many months we need to just be budgeting is if we think we're going to spend X per year divided by twelve in your monthly budget\nMm I mean ... issue is that I'm literally like penny pinching\nI told him I see where I can make that happen so what I've been hearing is I mean I decided starting next month I'm going to kick out fifty dollars that you really I think you're right

A.\nDot com\nAll right well I tell you what a let's just get started with some uh uh some phone calls here and feel so we'll save southern ... for a little bit later in the shower and talk to Laurie and Frank and a line three during it now but let's say good morning Laurie\nHi good morning I've called before in you he laughed at me because I retired navy in East that I was trying to make my only Anders behave\n[laughter] he\nSaid that uh there was no one day on the line and in the navy that's called center you know your order it couldn't come forth\nA man [laughter] I I appreciate you're listening and responding like\nIt good veteran does [laughter] yes [laughter]\nUm I just have a quick question and I don't need a long explanation that um I have a different ... and I'm facing door\nAnd I have a landscape area and the ... it's very nice when when the winter cold froze froze the plants that and they look like they're native land's Hannah this and there is a big ... plant okay and there's another\nSpiky cactus which escapes me um and then some Indian Paintbrush is enough let them over grow\nIn used living a gringo how they look fabulous they came back just like you said good if I wanted to cut him that because they're kind of wild now is it too late and and that's my only question\nWell here's a here's the reason that um you have to be careful about cutting back because while a plant is while we're in warm weather followed plan has the potential to grow I'm cutting it back will make you put on a bunch of new growth\nOr that the if you want to know that happens because there's a hormone that collects at some points that you cut entails all little bugs the burst out and start growing again and this is a bad time of year to encourage that\nBecause as you mentioned uh many of these plants are going to freeze back whenever freezing weather arrives and your guest is as good as mine on that I Know we're supposed to be in the lower forty six next week which tells me that\nThat the cooler months are arriving right on time but what we do not want to see is to have those plants use up a lot of their stored energy reserves to put on a new growth which is they're going to freeze back before it has time to you know rebuild those reserves to make it all the way through the winter so\nUm had we done this say the first of September and I'm Talking for future reference now are the plants would have come out they would have built sisters are back up and it really wouldn't have been any problem\nRight now you cut them back this week they'd start re growing next week and then we could potentially have frost two weeks later and that would not be a good thing so\nI think you're better off to wait you don't necessarily have to wait until the plants are frozen back that need to wait until we're\nReally fairly regularly down in the forties or temperatures that the plants will not just immediately try to jump back out into growth so\nI ... if you want to do some minor pruning just to make them a little bit more manageable that's fine but save the major stuff until they have gone is dormant is they're going to for the winter now in the case of the\nUh the lion panels have probably means freezing all the way back to the ground same thing for paintbrush and many others ... they're going to remain green but I'm In general I Want to give you I\nWant to give you a little lever this weekend for not having to get too much too much work in the landscape book goes uh uh it it's just not the best time to do a lot of printing\nYes sir and so that's a great answer and I understand everything and and letting it out thinking\nAnd let me ask you one more question is a year of ... is it a solid green former does it have variation in the foliage ... and the foliage\n...\nOkay that's good because those the cold hardy ones if you worry very gated form I Would tell you to be\nBe prepared to cover it if the temperatures are going to get down to the green are down into the teens to solve the green forms are just substantially more cold hardy so you've make good choices and it's always a pleasure hair from a wide awake voice so this early on Saturday heart or\nGet out I have a good weekend there thank you thank you my pleasure by ranks up next than it is going to be rude governor Frank\nHi, Bob are you a bit\nI'm great a great who can be complaining about whether like this\nUpgrade it is great I Love those rain we had and I want to pass on on one of my naval oranges are never seen what split from the bottom a hot room all the water [laughter]\nThere is a a no there shall be called ... which is one of the few that really loves the shade it his naturalized around my business partners places funny she planted only the white\nForm and it through seat everywhere and virtually everything that has come up is red but there's you can stand in her yard area for a garden area and look\nAround and you'll see literally you know dozens if not hundreds of areas you just bright red little flowers sticking up among the ice we'd all those other natives in the shade so you're not just limit to Sunday spotted you can put some of these are good points out that the deer will leave alone so\nI question because you know you're talking about throwing shaved and stuff and I had a ... blue bonnet so they're like six inches tall ... are they going to make it light and blue\nWell the blue bonnet goes through to life stages is why we call it a a by any all it's a it\nPuts on in the fall it makes a liberal Rosetta leaves six inches is unusually tall for it to be at this point but uh it it is totally normal for to make its first life stage so to speak in the fall months that's why we plant them this time of year\nAnd then as things start to warm in the spring is did they start getting longer again\nThen they go into their Second Life stages where they make it very upright growth which then has the flowers now I'm not going to say that there may be some very confused plants out there because we know dry and then so wet you may even have a few blue bonnet Blum in the fall but most for the most part for blue bonnet are\nIn very healthy good shape because all these rains have just enabled them to make what we call the rose at\nA stage of both extremely good and unless we have\nYou know something unforeseen weather wise is has the potential to be one of her pretty springs and long time for a while flowers so you're you're ... you're just doing their native or natural thing that's nothing to be concerned about\nGood good because I Want him to receive themselves\nAbsolutely profusely ... you get out and have a great weekend and thanks for supporting the botanical garden\nThey have a good day\nYou do things by the tens up next governance said\nAbout your Martin\nI wanted to start with saying I didn't realize it but I Know your business partners husband can barely a general store\nI absolutely and I'm the out of\nThis [laughter] hey he's retired he has a little bit more free time that his wife and I do so you'll find him from the Bernie wider that can do your general store to or various other and ... century places around ... general store and all the others but very good what is what all this morning\nWhen I was going to ask you a couple of things I Am absolutely confused about what's happened in my tomatoes\n[noise] um [noise] I Am normally planted fifty two hundred and plants and we can heavily and give away heavily um and I put them in mid February this year and that very well at a wonderful spring and then of course nothing in the summer right [noise]\nAnd [noise] I read planted but I didn't get a ...\nTo ... uh I did my fault planting and unfortunately probably the late July early August and those guys really really didn't\nDo well at all and now they're probably only do you do now [noise] you know so hot and dry in August [noise] right [noise] the problem I have is a\nBig ... are not producing tomatoes and I don't even see very many flowers on them I\nProbably have forty plants or so in that were planted in February\nAnd they were very prolific in the spring right\nRight they probably eight feet tall male but there's no flowers and almost no tomatoes and yeah what the heck have I done\nWell it's not anything you've done his Mother Nature has done and um you may get some flowers you may get some cherry tomatoes but you're not going to get any more big tomatoes his fault if they're not already set when the night temperatures are either too hot or too cold\nOr the big the big fruit varieties don't set fruit didn't blossom said nothing you can do is going to change that fact\nAnd so it is one reason I always recommend people playing some cherries because they're not as picky about nighttime temperatures but\nA bird Hi Mary you've already been down in the forties more than once you're going to be the low forties in the coming week and even if your plants do produce flowers are just not going to set any fruit this was a\nI won't say battle say horrible year for fall tomatoes for most people because as you so accurately mentioned we went from very dry very wet to very hot to really fairly chili nights and is not anything you've done is just the conditions have not been right for a good crop of tomatoes this fall\nAnd um I have to tell you you're not likely to get much of anything out of them this late in my opinion is time to probably a use that space to play and broccoli and cauliflower and you know beats and carrots and radishes and turnips and lettuce and charred in ...\nShirt and spinach a lot of things you can plant now that are going to you know give you good production over the winter march but a mother nature just roll the dice against us as far as all tomatoes and\nUh there's not really anything I Know of you could have done to change that outcome and unfortunately at this point there's not really anything you can do to get much more of the way of tomatoes out of this fall\nYeah I was wondering if uh just pull a ...\n... and it you know I\nI don't see any reason not to pull 'em up I just a ... there's just not going to do much sets the law in the short of it and that but I I sure would leave that soil foul there are plenty of other things you can plant now and I'm\nNext year will be different hopefully we'll be back to producing good crops in the fall\nLate July is not really bad time to plant that I like to have a man um I I have experimented for a couple of years actually planning in June ... rather than July and that's given me as falls tomatoes ever but I wasn't able to do that this year so I'm like you I'm a\nEating store bought tomatoes and not really enjoying it\nEarned that to your ... you're talking about planning on June\n... well hopefully we'll have more available ... to put you back on hold and talk more if you like I go to news is Kay TSA San Antonio\nI'm Carrie Preston

Myers Lehman is the most cold hardy of our lemons and most years going down to his lowest twenty six degrees does not cause the many real problems but\nI've seen it gets much colder than that here and I've also seen as have winters when it never got below that point so I'm a lot of people plant Myers lemons outside in San Antonio most of the time it works fine and the hill country it does not an hill country\nI'm either going to you know rural I'm In a big pot or a matter of fact going to build a greenhouse over him in the winter but um if you are thinking of you know planning them in the ground how would you choose a protected area and recognize that you may have to cover him if we get one of those real cold weather's\nOkay thank you very much\nAlways good to talk to you Tony I appreciate you call this morning thank you Bye bye and go buy a case next step is dawn ...\nLawyer Bob this is Don ally ... morning again ah I got a good question for you okay all ... does that work what\nAn rattlesnakes down\nLow balls though a lot of the late to have learned to shop\nWell the it will drive the rattlesnakes out but non mothballs are not good for you it's paradox or old benzene is the active ingredient in a mosque balls the oil that in a couple of other things and I don't want your family breathe in those films so\nI'm a you know cedar oil tends to drive rattlesnakes out even seater mulch is will be repellent to reptiles have just about every sort\nA but I I I sure wouldn't I sure wouldn't be breathing a lot of that the fumes from those small falls or that that would be not something I Would do under my home\nAnd light now I get to it in Waco puppies and I just got to kill that are out of snake yesterday about four feet away from all of\nA while yeah the rattlesnakes are moving right now you know the male rattlesnake may move oh gosh as much as ten miles away from its Dan the females are usually within a mile or two of where they'd been up but rattlesnakes are moving through pretty actively right now and I'm\nA a yeah I I'd you know they they're not likely to want to take up residence under your home so I'm not going to be too concerned about that and I am going to be ... around which is also going to help with the\nFleas and ticks and things like that that you want to protect pups from\nBut a a mutt mothballs aren't the way I'm going to go\nOn to try to figure out what the best way to educate the puppies for a bit 'cause a rattlesnake ...\nAnd rattlesnakes are born live in a you know you obviously had a if you got the little foot long rattlesnakes you've obviously you had a a\nIn a litter of um whatever you call a bunch baby rattlesnakes and\nUm they can be just as dangerous as a big snakes now chances are they are going to be going elsewhere for the winter but\nUm you know in your your pop sure little young if I can remember to ask Dr Kirby tomorrow at what age we start can start giving the dogs the Randall snake anti venom um our dog's always are are protected in ah\nAh again Dan Kirby if you're able to listen on Sundays does show that I have the pleasure sitting on a loving clock on Sundays and we talk about a lot of things but uh\nMy ... my dogs get their rattlesnake booster shot and ... says is not going to mean that they don't have to go to the vet but it means you're going to live long enough to get the vet that I'm not sure at what age out I'm not sure if the I think ten weeks is probably a little a little young for them now\nThe one thing I Would tell you about a foot long rattlesnake is that it can't climb very well love rattlesnakes I've seen them up in Bush's uh my summers I spent in the wildlife management area in West Texas we occasionally found you know diamond back up and and South Korea so Bush or something like that\nBut you can if you can create what I Would call the snake fans something that's like a\nA Eighteen Inches tall and is fairly slick\nYou could if you have a dog run or something like that you can pretty much ensure that the rattlesnakes can't get into it at that size rattlesnakes don't climbed the way that a ... steak or something like that does so\nUm you can do things to exclude them from the area but uh I'm afraid mothballs are just not a good idea for you or the puppies either one\nOf the crops are there to get the labor costs seven acres city why a bushy flip yeah so a guy made shreds and ... and they look lousy [laughter]\nOkay All right I was just kind of work because I get a lot I guess that there so early and then I get a lot a lot of ...\nThey need it yeah no it's um yeah I spent part of one day you know lives out of ...\nBut not by burn piled so that's just a pretty natural thing as long as the newest growth on the tree looks healthy\nUm you're good probably another hundred years now if any of these trees are exposed to the point where you think they might be susceptible to being struck by lightning you might want to think about getting a lightning rod\nPut in the top of those trees is not super expensive and I see a lot of trees every year they're damaged or killed by lightning strikes so\nUm if they're you know if they if you feel like that could be an issue that's one thing you might look into but you know in the meantime just feed him once or twice a year and water\nIf we go for more than a couple of months without rain ... through players were exposed in I think you're in good shape\nThe roof was is that right at the base that\nShow yeah it just they shouldn't look like a fence posts coming up out of the ground they should be short abroad and out where the tree gets down to ground level\nOkay okay I didn't know it could do there are these ... they had already been struck a alive and well and uh it's still it's got it's got some holes in it it's got it's got a pretty big hollowed out area at the base\nBut I had all the local person that deals with trees and he said that it's fine how are you going to be it'll\nBe a ... fine but no a lightning rods and they call them points they put up in the top and they are very important to protect a big ol' heritage trees so uh I Do that yeah I think is a real important thing to look into so\nYou get out and have a great weekend and we'll visit again thanks I appreciate it thank you bye Steven ... artist David [noise] hey good morning bomber and I really enjoy your show set free shape that thank you\nSarah I had a question about the roses I was um I'd like to try and put some roses on my porch but in um in containers are earning powder in pots\nCertainly you recommend that that is doable\nYeah just just choose some of the rose varieties that are the hugest ones out there I mean you never grow a lady banks frozen a pot smaller than a swimming pool but there are a lot of smaller\nRose varieties are the ones that they call miniature roses actually beautiful roses get a couple of feet tall\nMany other varieties like Martha Gonzales is a pretty little red one that comes to mind there's one called China doll there's a\nOh golly called well paying there there are many many different roses that will do beautifully and fought so long as they get get good bright sun and a a ... a drain well nothing wrong with that but just stay away from you really big varieties cars are going to be a lot harder to maintaining a pot\nSo I should just ask for something smaller miniature\nYeah it was somebody that knows roses if you're here in San Antonio combined talked a marker Mike fan and covert panics nursery those guys grow more roses than uh you know anybody else in the area and they're going to have the widest selection of them um if you want like say you know just a lot of advice from a\nA any any nursery that knows their roses I Wish I could say they all did but you have a lot of choices if you came to the U.S would probably be talking about Martha good solid us we might even talked about Julia Child but uh uh if you're looking for a broad range of things you might go by and talk to ... over ...\nOkay sounds good so that's what I Need to know\nI appreciate the call you get out and have a great weekend will do so you do have to have a right to finish our up with Romero Romero\n... thank you for taking my call you for calling I'm\nGail escaping I Want to do some serious gaping in my yard wouldn't wouldn't be the best time of the year to start that\nTrees and shrubs and woody plants you're looking at the best time of year right now I'm October November probably the two best months of the year some perennials your evergreen perennials I think you can certainly put out now that would be many of your salary is that would be ah\nOh love valley has skullcap a there there are a lot of a perennial shaking go out now\nUm so the answer is you know now and in the future ... you've got a ... there's some things you can plant a twelve months out of the year the trees and shrubs ah this is the best best time of year to be planning those\nAnd and what what type of soil or ground ally adapt to that\nWell a year native soil is what you're what you're gonna have to live with so you may want to do some soil improvement you may want to add a you may want to blend some compost into the soil you're going to want to mulch things well\nBut the don't really have to do a whole lot of the things that make his ear escape plans more drought tolerant is the ability to spread their roots over a wide wide area\nAnd if you make the soil too good just ride around the base of the plants in the plant has no reason to develop an extensive root system that wants to just put his roots in that holds that you've created for it so\nOther than making certain that you have good drainage you're pretty much gonna plant your ... plants with your existing native soil then but some good mulch on the surface but we're not going to be bringing in a whole bunch of soil or changing the existing conditions\nOkay uh I've seen several ... uh where they have this are like tiny cables were ... heart and oil is is that uh\nThat's just strictly for that is strictly for decorative effect\nI'm handles do nothing and do not put a plastic or\nSo called we'd block underneath them or the rocks are strictly decorative and a matter of fact my friend mark Peterson had a had an article got sent out this past week about that but uh as decorative effect that's just fine but um\nI as I say it's not benefitting your plant some things like lava sander Levin gravel might do something to help but um that part of it just ornamental\n... is that level of gravel I think that's what I'm Talking about is that expensive to apply um\nI Know it's not really expensive you know anything's heavy like that you're going to pay something to get it delivered\nBut uh it's it's certainly ... is not really expensive but ground covers also fit very well into his ear escape and I talk to you a little bit more ... the air because I have to get a out for news time right here we'll be right back with ...

just\nUh it it had just scratch my head and that is why our country\nDoes and put more controls on that Europe's not perfect but there are a lot better about keeping things out and I know recently Italy turned away a big supply of American oats because with a life as a contamination and\nOne of the most recent list Shaw ... showed that oats and oatmeal products or some of the most contaminated things we have out there\nYeah it's a it's a heck of a no we're we're allowing something to stay in the food supply the effects biological activity you know affects bacteria and it's just such a gift\nUh it should be such an eye opener and it should be so clear to everybody that that's about the worst thing you can have is something that hurts bacteria and the guy but you know and it's catchy you know it's getting a little bit more publicity all the time and making some headway but it's not nearly as strong as it all they will just keep fighting\nWe just keep fight and then you and I do the best we can to help people you know not keep it in the landscape but I think it's just going to the day's coming\nWhen it's not it's just going to be grow your own food as far as possible but the the problem with that I saw a couple of great quotes this past weekend one of them is to live off your garden you practically have to live in your garden so\nWell he just your best shot the farmer's markets in a row but we can but it's I don't know which is a problem that uh you know it's kind of like the the roof ... trees is ubiquitous problems out there everywhere and we just have to keep talking about raising the awareness of it in ...\nWe've got dying it's coming to give a talk on a GMOs and things next week at the nursery milk I'm really looking forward to seeing what new research she brings this\nBut them anyway that'll be a lot of fun\nYeah that that's the other side of that which is good is if there are there are more and more new products coming out and there's apparently a continuing to be more more research done all the time even bought a chemical companies and the big companies try to come up with some of alternatives but\nYou know the the acceptable organic herbicides are getting better and better this new pro of a a pure grow weed crush product\nIt's got some real simple ingredients and it uh is working very very well just bars and kill plants better than any of the\nOf vinegar or fatty acid products I've seen so far into the fatty acid products are getting better and better too I don't know if they're changing the formula little bit of what they're doing but they seem to be\nGetting better you know the first one that was ever on the market as far as I Know size rice and that was produced by one of the chemical companies tower one out of I think and\nAnd now there's probably a close to it does an album out there and getting to be more and more all the time and the more people to get in there and compete and try to come up with better you know a better mouse trap the better we're we're going to be\nWell and that's so true and and but\nI just in and we have people send his pictures all the time\nThe more people to follow your program and in any good organic program if you're nice knee jerk and a half for those weed killers and it's just not a good healthy yard or you know best best audience is a good defense you keep things\nIn good shape and weeds aren't going to be an issue but I I really appreciate I guess I just hadn't read the label carefully enough on the a rep grass controls ... worked on a lot of things other than just the crab grass and\nWindy pointed out to me the yes we do have it on the shelves I Need to I just need to get out and read a little bit more but I I did not realize how effective it was against clover and other things that people people continue to fight so\nIt's probably the most effective own clover and so the broadly is like that so yeah that's a that's a great tool will\nUh will continue to push along those those lines I I've got a problem in my turf in the back then I'm going to have to be doing with I Can't believe how sloppy and wet it's still the youngest of this ... this year we've had something here in Dallas around twenty seven nations says first\nOf September and I got a verbal swamp and the back yard and we've written a couple of Dallas Morning news articles and my last newsletter\nWhich I didn't get I don't know if you are about drainage and talking about you know drawing specific spots and things like that\nI I haven't seen it yet I haven't looked at my email this morning but I have come through yet\nThey all hope it went out I sent a note we might be a little bit late on getting it out but it\nIt's certainly how a list of everybody and the question of getting the most is what about the water that standing around the trees you know or you have exposed\nThe flyer and I had I took some pictures of it I had a little bit of water still of yesterday on the gecko and now it's completely gone so it just it it goes away and and you have\nA moisture on the flair for a much shorter period of time that if it was buried and soil you know so it's really not a big worry you can put it in the dry and lives if you need to and that's what the last newsletter cover people that don't get the news or you can\nLook at it in the archives on their doctor dot com\nAnd you can simply were requested ... doctor dot com yeah sure\nIt's it's a great thing how are their anything special that you're telling people where water is been standing on a we've talked a bit about\nYou know hydrogen peroxide is a way to get some oxygen back into the soil and\nIt's it's my opinion it's some of the biggest damaging comes is when the soil actually gets anaerobic because there's so much water and we lose some of our our good microbes so I Would think that uh\nThings to support that like you're a juice and ... good compost compost tea molasses anything like that that increases microbial activity are going to be good things to use in those areas\nYeah the hires are products out one time and then you also wrote good quality of compost the gear juice mixture itself like you say and just you know any of the organic amendments recommended I think the whole the whole thing of the entire basic bed preparations are sick trade trading and all those things\nThat are dealing with the same basic ingredients called quality compost walk ... you know a lot of sand and as a lot and things like that and then the sugars that drought drama last and the corn meal that you can't beat that basic formula\nFor a lot of different things for medial reasons as well as just just getting started on the one time peroxide treatment uh assuming that folks are getting the Bronx I just from the grocery store a drugstore how far are you\nRecommending that they diluted down three to one for the one with water what do you think is going to be an effective level\nThree to one is fine but to make it easy to one works works well it's so inexpensive go about eighty eight cents of court or something like that yeah\nEasy way to do a fifty fifty fifty you with water or fifty fifty with you can take Garrett you said are ready to use ... raise spry and a mix it fifty fifty with a hydrogen peroxide networks right to or\nYou can make it stronger by putting\nLeaving whatever you'll leave out of the site you leave a court of I probably would give you more accurate save you leave a quarter of the water out of the formula of your juice and replace that core water with a quarter of hydrogen peroxide that probably works better than anything\nAnd it's not going to affect the on things like Gary Jewish pro and it's not going to have a negative effect on the on the Mike rice on fungi and things like that oh it\nProbably will hum yeah if you're using the ...\nProblem that's a good point it probably will do some damage to it right up front 'cause it kills bacteria ...\nAs well so uh it might be best on second thought their due to fit fit you water and then do your juice or separately and then you want a heavy damage those microbes\nBut other than the guarantees pro that's the only one that a\nRegular or do you measure was original saying it was no problem mix it with anything but the ones that are loaded with a good a bugs it's probably better not to put a strong killing stuff in with\nSpeaking of a good products are you making progress on getting a dry form of the tree do that I'm I'm getting more and more calls with people having gurgling problems either from animals are\nSometimes from porcupine sometimes just the things rubbing on age or\nA different just ways of injuring that outer layer bark and I think ... just you know a phenomenal thing and then I think you'd mentioned at one point you're looking at maybe getting a dry form of some sort of going to sort of I just add water and slander on\nWell it's always a a drum mixture and the one that's out there there's one rabbit hill has and the like it very much because it has I'm not defined picture book kind of a junkie a\nA phosphate native that will work okay but it just doesn't slow slide around the site on as well we were playing with liking it out of a good quality compost and as a lie and I haven't gotten back to to tweaking those formula down and and making it work and putting that in a\nIn a bag the two owners of the compost asthma I\nProved that on the water so it\nTurned out to be a very very valuable project it still organic today as far as I Know gorgeous\n... says one of the real success stories are are are you still making progress\nIt's on getting the various talk shows you how does your home and health fair I'm getting those videotapes available to people\nWho are arrested I haven't gotten to report lately I have to find out I just got a note from Doug saying that the news or go out about\nThis all the ... the update on all the ... a solution so or by take a look at that I'll I'll check all the classes the lecture should be finished by the world that stands I'm going to say\nMonday the taxes are checking a gecko tree so good with those photographs I'll be able to finish\nMy fantastic trees slide show will get that all set up it will go in the members area\nFor some period of time so it's just a vital to the members and then we'll make it available to the public later on it'll have probably over two hundred\nA slides of the fabulous trees of presented and look lectures through your\nWell I had such a good thing you're doing and I was\nThinking about a as we get closer to the end of the year I always have a few organizations that I make that tax deductable charitable contribution to in a\nPark is right up there on my list as well so I Hope all our listeners that do like supporting good organizations relies a what a good organized ... organization that is needed is fully tax deductable as well so when you talk about that off and on it's hard to believe is versed in November I don't know where this year is gone\nInto effect at all you do in a face to listeners and solve keep up the good work\nAnd it will talk again next Saturday the next ... thank you sir but I go by people\nWho don't know how or Garrett he is the man who's moniker is the dirt doctor I think his website is the best on the Internet at ... doctor dot com and hope you will check that out when you when you're looking for good\nReliable information for this part of Texas phone lines roping we've got twenty five minutes left in the show reminds you once again are free seminars this morning is all about gardening rooms in greenhouses and materials to use for both temporary and permanent enclosures we're also going to talk about eaters and cougars in\nAny way if you have a thought about the whole thing that sort of thing in your own\nAt landscape garden you know situation wherever come on over free charged nine four five the coffee is on my nine we started about nine forty five\nI also remember next Saturday is dying Bain's is going to be here to talk about GMOs if you have kids your grandkids you know you really need to be sure

wonderful combination pots and hanging baskets and things for the following week but anyway going to have a lot of fun this morning with the with the greenhouses garden rooms and I've\nRun some samples brought some pictures of what I've created over the past couple of months of my own landscape so\nHope you will come out and plenty of parking ah we have parking and then our friends with\nThe plan if you cross the street welcome us to use their so will be a problem finding a place for you to park over there right now let's talk for a minute about let's talk about a couple of the good people that I get to visit with and uh one of them and two of them the two of 'em really go together but let's start talking about new or because they are just the makers of\nLarge quantities of quality compost sermon your compost is now certified organic\nAnd ah their work in a day to get the number new bag products them and had more to tell you about that over the next few weeks but uh just
