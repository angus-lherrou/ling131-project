understand about the calcium but what does magnesium\nOr we're talking about stress and we're talking about stress affects the body and first of all in order to function at all your body needs magnesium it's probably of all the vitamins I could list magnesium is probably the most important vitamin on the planet right now\nI've not heard a whole lot about magnesium ... why is maybe seem so important\nThere's over three hundred and twenty five bio chemical reactions that magnesium is involved with it it's almost like a hormone wow and for example if it was low levels of magnesium your heart won't\nBeat who very important factor in life you would say so in fact\nLet me just read a list of some of the conditions are associated with magnesium deficiencies okay um you have attention deficit disorder Alzheimer's or anxiety asthma autism\nChronic fatigue syndrome congestive heart disease caused the patient diabetes fibromyalgia high blood pressure insomnia migraine headaches multiple sclerosis muscle cramps Parkinson's osteoporosis and the list goes on and on and on\nAnd then this this is associated with a a lack of magnesium in the money\nSimply a lack of magnesium bully too so it's nothing really mess around with now what happens is that you need the many of them in your body in order for the calcium to be absorbed\nOh so it's it's a necessary thing in order to get the first component which is calcium\nThat's right they work in combination with each other now there's many more practical applications of this ... formula mhm first of all like I said you drink so it gets into your system and one of the first thing we use it for in our clinic\nIs for people who are under a lot of stress and it can't sleep well at night it works better than anything I've ever

various I'd like to discuss with you\nWhile that's fantastic some of those things that you've named seem to be age related or or things that we experience as we grow older is there a link there yeah\nThere's a vicious circle that I'd like to discuss what happens is that when a person has\nA magnesium deficiency spending the gleaming museum they don't absorb their food as well\nAnd so they go into what we call mal absorption syndrome which millions and millions of Americans have and it's not like you feel sick or you know this that use it might be over time just starting to feel more tired and tired and tired mhm and that's just a real graduate overtime type of thing and a lotta people justify that they're getting old and they just need more threats or whatever\nRight that that's what I Would think that what happens is that when when you get less absorption you actually increase the efficiency in your system of magnesium and that\nAnd that starts to take the count them out of the bones you start getting bone loss you start getting 'em all muscle loss because it also reduces the muscle mass and pretty soon before you know you are feeling old yeah and your body's actually

to you again it's one eight hundred eighty two three eight seven three four\nWell if you're just joining us I've got Dr Michael is on the phone today and he's telling us about stress and how important it is to ensure that you've got the proper nutrients in your system specifically calcium and magnesium\nAnd how much of an impact that has on our overall health so I guess one of the things that people should really be aware of is because of this isn't an instant thing that triggers you to say oh I'm sick but you know instead happens gradually over time\nIt's very possible that people might not even be aware that there is a deficiency of calcium and magnesium and thereby\nWell that's the thing is that a deficiency is or not like I'm a water main break in or you have a real noticeable thing the right to their little drift little leaks here and there and so what we have is a cumulative effect\nWhere a person starts to go downhill just a little bit at a time yeah to the point where they don't really realize how bad they'd actually gotten before it's too late\n[laughter] knock your biggest you'd mentioned insomnia we talked about that a little bit what about back pain\nCalcium and neither is excellent for back pain because\nThe calcium goes into the muscles magnesium actually helps the transmitters and the nerve and when you take us combat formula many times they will calm your back pain wow I Know I I have a couple of years ago I herniated disc and my back in ... and I was trying to everything and I took out the comics formula\nAnd I drank it and I couldn't believe the difference within about a half hour I Would functional again not wasn't completely gone but I I drank it over ten day period in it at a completely alleviated the problem\nNow what about heart disease\nHeart disease is or something you have to watch out for about ... and going down the genetic line yeah and if anyone has any history of heart disease or ... even had bypass surgery you should be on this complex formula and I can't say that without enough emphasis because it's something that will completely give you a new lease on life\nIsn't it amazing um we talked about arthritis what about joint pain\nWell the arthritic joints\nReally respond to this and I recently gave a can of this lady who was suffering from fibromyalgia where she was having pain and just about every joint in your body can be in or near could be in her neck it could be in her elbow and I'm ... and I gave it to her one week and I saw her the next week\nAnd I swear credit I did not recognize are really just that the lady that was sixty four years old and the first time I saw her she looked like she was\nEighty four years old and a week later\nShe was bright she had a beautiful smile her eyes were claiming and I I honestly had to ask my wife who this lady was and and sure enough he was the one who took a week of ah the formula to counteract formula\nAnd um she said she got a really good week of sleep for the first time in years wow and that her pain was much better and she ordered three more cancer and make it out to her friends and that's amazing\nAnd when I used that with the professional athletes I'm a doctor for the U.S Olympic team and I had a number of athletes in us before their events so they could sleep well and they wake up in their muscles were in real relaxed shape\nYou really wouldn't think that a such a small component of near normal diet can make such a profound impact over the way that you feel\nOr say what's happening is that in the last fifty years the American diet has greatly changed\nAnd the nutrition has greatly changed and add to that in the medication as many people are on blood pressure medications or anti anxiety drugs or heart medications\nAnd many of these things also blocked the absorption of calcium magnesium in the system though the very drugs that are treating the conditions that your body is experiencing because of the fishing and ... and many of them it's also blocking further absorption\nBusiness them it's really it's really a rat race it sounds like it's a vicious circle\nThey've Chris rates have you with you\nSo let's get right into this whole stress issue you know stress is such a normal part of our daily routine these days but why should we be concerned about it and more specifically what's going on in our bodies and one of the warning signs that we should be looking for\nWell you know there's two ways to look at stress on is what we call mental stress on the other the other is how stress affects your body as a doctor I'm more interested in how it affects your body sure so the way stress affects the body is this a one person's under stress the body transpose is the stress in detention\nAnd your muscles end up contract day and everyone feels that in their in their upper ... right and the doctor I'm more concerned about the muscles that you don't feel that she has the muscles in the arteries\nOh that guy up and the muscles the heart is a giant myself over and the muscles in and around your digestive tract ... these are the things that are resulting in in a heart disease digestive difficulties\nAnd I want to talk a little bit of your show today about nutrition because there are two nutrients that completely handle the body in terms of stress okay according to the research that I've been involved with it's it's as simple as calcium and magnesium\nCalcium and magnesium right okay\nWhen you're deficient in calcium and magnesium a lot of things can happen\nCounting magnesium for example is needed in order to go to sleep at night and how many people you know they just don't sleep while you wake up tired your body hurt more pretty soon it starts to wear you down and pretty soon you get sick and you have a condition that people are suffering for pain and osteoporosis and fibromyalgia\nAnd cramps than their legs and we're illnesses so there's something wrong with this picture\nAnd it has to do it not how much calcium somebody taking in their diet or how many calcium supplement their how many in Athens you chew it has to do with simple absorption is that calcium getting absorbed into your body\nWith calcium being something to do with stress season calcium for building bones\nWell yes okay yeah and it does does your ... but it's the one percent of the calcium actually circulates in your blood\nSo in that one percent starts to drop it could affect your heart your brain your kidneys your organs and your body shutdown actually died\nWow this is all one percent of the calcium always has to be in your system and there's two sources of calcium one isn't that diet you know and to us from the bones themself\n... absorb it back from the bones of ...\nThat's right and I say and what you just discussed right now leads to one of the major causes of a condition that's affecting twenty five million Americans right now which is called osteoporosis right which is a weakening of adult\nNow and that's due to the body deriving the calcium from the bones instead of from the ... yep\nOkay and so we have to do is we have to find a way to put calcium back in the diet now you'd think that would be really easy\nSure just drink milk just drink milk or you know eat a lot of green leafy vegetables and that sort of thing but first of all people don't do that right\nAnd second of all the the quality of the calcium that comes from our diet has been decreasing in the last fifty years really because things like pastures Asian food they're irradiated um the calcium as leads from the soil and\nPeople are taking medications that block it so\nThe actual calcium is that being absorbed in the body okay and then you see people taking toms and calcium supplements you know they buy the health food store drug writer right but these things don't absorbing the body the\nTopic for a couple of reasons one uh when you take a let's say an aunt that had the ... like a ... first of all calcium does not absorbed in the body unless it's an anesthetic environment but to see what happens when you take a tub with an antacid\nOh okay so even if you're getting calcium in the in the antacid itself it's not been absorbed\nI see because it has to be in a in an acid environment for it to be absorbed\nExactly okay now we have a product called the ... formula\nMy combat formula it's natural and the differences is that the powdered\nAnd what happens is you put it in hot water and you mix it up and you drink it down so it's in a liquid instead of a pill\nAnd it absorbed into your system wow\nSo that sounds that problem that\nWell yeah because when calcium and easy Myrna liquid state it absorbs ten times better than in any other state\nWow that's great matter of fact yes I'm I'm reading the can right now says a fenced absorbing calcium and magnesium beverage powder\nWell it comes down to absorption\nOne of the ways to tell if you're not observing calcium is take a look at what drugs they're taking are you on high blood pressure medication do you need something for your kidneys or you want pain medications you need sleeping pills since the calcium and especially the easiest being absorbed ... you're not going to suffer from all these things\nMy combat formula does absorb incredibly in the body the thing is is that when you take my comment formula but not like well well I feel better I have thousands of people ready to the doctor pain 'cause I Can't believe it thirty minutes after I took the ... the pain in my wrist went away or I was able to sleep for the first time in

that we've been talking about a including being able to\nExtend your life but you know when you have the government saying look all you need is sixty milligrams of vitamin C I mean you can see where people are confused\nWell Chris I said in the beginning of the show here that there's two problems with the vitamin C. that you can buy one is getting enough of it yeah and second having the right form of vitamin C. here's the thing I did go to the supermarket before\nI got here [laughter] okay and I brought some vitamin C. and I I went and bought these and\nI'd like to just show you what's out there so let's go through this this particular vitamin C. it has five hundred milligrams of vitamin C in itself right off the bat you'd have to take three tablets to get the same amount of vitamin C that's in my super see twenty two okay All right All right but I Want you to read some of the ingredients\nAll right so this one has a vitamin C. well just one type of ... right it's so it's a single type of vitamin C. okay then it has silos now cellulose has grown up newspaper alright the next one is uh vegetables Sterritt gases\nNow that's an oil all over again so the pills come out of the machine when they form\nA and the next one is a silica silica sand sand like the beach All right so here's another one try this one here okay so this is a national brand here right right so it's just five hundred milligrams okay this is a tool yes All right so take a look at the ingredients\nOkay I'm personally green is sucrose sugar okay ... sugar sodium a score right\nThat's a form of vitamin C that's attached to salt so now you're getting sodium right vegetables Derek acid that's that lubricant again and empty and see yellow number six there you go a number six so now that is artificially colored vitamin C. now what what makes your formula supersede twenty to form a different\nFrom these that we are talking about well what's different about as I used twenty two different forms of vitamin C. and it's all naturally flavored\nNatural colors there is nothing artificial in it ... so it's good for you and it's the only one that has this unique delivery method of being able to drink it down as water soluble goes right to work and your body and it has\nThe proper amount of vitamin C. per survey there's Fifteen hundred milligrams per serving ... there's nothing else on the market like it I've done tons of research vitamin C. has over a hundred thousand studies and it's really survive the test of time what are these studies suggest what are they saying well I'll give you I'll give you a couple of headlines\nThis study was conducted at the University of California and it found that people who took vitamin C above the RDA above sixty milligrams increase their lifespan up to six years\nThey also found that death from cardiovascular disease were reduced over forty percent ... a study reported in the international journal vitamin the nutrition\nConcluded that when you have high concentrations of vitamin C in your system blood pressure comes down ... here's another study according to the American Journal of epidemiology\nPeople that had more vitamin C in their diets had greater lung volume and they measure lung volume by Mila leaders and so those who increased their vitamin C. every day\nHad an increase of twenty two millimeters now that's a lot especially if you're an asthmatic a smoker\nIf you're someone that has allergies when you get the lung volume up you get more oxygen in your system our energy that's just from vitamin C. wow now earlier you you talked about the connection between vitamin C. and weight loss how does that work well this is kind of groundbreaking research on\nTo protect yourself no matter what time of year it is\nSo what's the best way to protect yourself from these nasty viruses the cold and the flu\nWell here today to share his health secret for shielding against viruses colds and the flu is Dr Michael Pincus\nDr bank is it's great to see you again Chris it's great to be here you know most of you probably know the doctor bank is is a nationally recognized authority on both natural and alternative health he's also a very successful chiropractor he's been son out by top Hollywood celebrities\nProfessional athletes Olympic athletes and he continues to be very involved in some of this nation's top health concerns so Dr biggest what is this how secret that you've been talking about\nWell what the secret is actually getting the right amount and the right form of vitamin C.\nVitamin C. All right well uh vitamin C is is not really new though\nNo vitamin C is not new but it's still a very vital and essential nutrient for optimal hell and unfortunately Critz vitamin C. has taken a backseat to other nutritional trends and the bottom line is with out enough vitamin C. and the right type of vitamin C. U. of low energy pain your immune system's compromised you're more prone to cancer heart attacks\nCataracts allergies diabetes the list goes on and on and according to several studies your life could be short and by six years\nBut but don't don't most of us get enough vitamin C I mean I drink a glass of orange juice every morning he is not enough\nNo it's not enough a typical glass of orange juice contains about sixty five milligrams of vitamin C. okay and you're not even in the ballpark with vitamin C. unless you're getting around three to four thousand milligrams a day wow three or four thousand a year and that would be like drinking fifty glasses of orange juice\nSo because of a lack of vitamin C. or getting enough of it just to keep you a little bit sick\nA little a little bit sick what do you mean by that well the number one complaint of anyone go into a doctor's office his doctor you know I just don't any energy I don't feel like myself I'm hurting yup and then the doctors get the wheels spinning in their head and they go oh we've got to do these tasks send you through the scanner\nAnd the problem is is they don't find anything ... is the most doctors don't look at nutrient levels and vitamin C is critical for life\nAnd it was interesting the human body is one of only a few mammals who do not make our own vitamin C.\nAlright the other ones on any pigs primates and the fruit bat when you look at the rest of the animals out there you don't see cats and dogs and elephants and giraffes with high blood pressure you don't see the cancers the arthritis the tiredness\nAll the time right all those animals make their own vitamin C. huh and they'll make up to five thousand milligrams of vitamin C. per day\nSome animals like a goat Yeah Bill produced upwards of a hundred thousand milligrams of vitamin C a day wow yeah so it's like a double whammy first of all we're not getting enough vitamin C in our diet and ... and we don't make our own\nAnd because of the two people are walking around sick and tired sick and tired sicker can't quite put my finger on it\nYou know right but you know I think most people myself included sinking vitamin C in terms of cold and flu so we're talking about this connection then between vitamin C. and the melodies that were suffering from is that you know what\nIt is actually the common denominator the lack of vitamin C. and the right amounts and the right kind and that's why I created my supersede twenty two formula and as a powder Chris and you mix it into water you drink it down if you have at least one to two servings per day you're going to get the right\nAmount of vitamin C. and the right forms of it\nAnd I'll tell you what it has twenty two of the most powerful forms\nOf vitamin C. on the planet now I didn't realize that we're different forms of vitamin C. well that's right nutrition comes from many different sources what I've done is I've taken the most powerful forms of vitamin C ... your body needs different forms of it and I put it all into one\nVitamin formula now and you said there was how much vitamin C. and your super see twenty two years Fifteen hundred milligrams per serving\nSo by by taking supersede twenty two then what what are some of the the things that you'll experience well the first thing you're gonna experiences energy vitamin C. produces energy in the body\nThere are studies

super see his blood pressure dropped\nIt he said the top number dropped eight points in the bottom number drops seven points and that's after three days he said no another thing that happened is I became more alert and I now have a clear head off from vitamin C. yes one study in particular show that if you get on a good supplement like my super seat and you stay on it the average life

sure I'm not getting enough on them and see based on what you said I I I I I'm not arguing that point\nBut the reality is I'm I'm Still standing still wake up every morning what's the big deal here I mean hasn't the government figured out that there is some level of vitamin C. that you need to have in order to be healthy when you're talking about the government and nutrition and health recommendations\nBoy they get like a de minus because they're already a for vitamin C. sixty milligrams sixty million empty at ... inadequate the RDA for vitamin C. was determined so you don't die from ... but sixty milligrams of vitamin C. is like partially water and your grass so it's not quite brown\nYou see what I mean and that's the problem with our bodies is that we're not getting the

image of yourself [noise]\n\nToday I Am thankful\nAnd today I Am hopeful\nAnd I am both of these things because I have been permanently ... things by the blood of Jesus Christ [noise]\nAnd so we read in the book of Romans the a chapter in the thirty first first if you're there say amen what then shall we say to these things if God is for us who can be against us\nHe who did not spare his own son but deliver to him up for us all\nHow should he not with him also freely give us all things who\nShow bring a charge against dogs elect it is God\nWho justifies heavenly father\nLet this word penetrate our hearts our minds in our spirits today than we would recognize that you are on your throne and you are on our side and therefore we have reason to believe that we can indeed do all things through Christ who gives a strength\nYour precious name we pray and received this word and all of God's Children said praise the lord [noise]\nPaul begins this passage by saying and what shall we say\nTo these things\nIn order to understand why he begins this way you first have to look back at the case that he has been building\nPaul is letting us know that there is a right way to live and there is a wrong way to live\nYou may choose\nHow you want to live wrong but there is only one way\nTo live right and Paul begins building this case all the way back in the first chapter of the book of Romans\nBy the time we get to Romans chapter eight and burst thirty one and it's literally a crescendo\nOf confidence poll is so full of joy considering what he is in what God has\nDone and what that makes him that he simply cannot contain it and he says well shall we say these things before us who who\nCan be against us\nI don't know how you read the Bible but when I read the Bible I gave everybody voices\nAnd I listen to their volume and I kinda feel what they were feeling when they write I've never seen Paul Go and what shall we say\nTo these things is going\nTo be for us [noise]\nCalmer [noise]\nThis is not that kind of moment Paul\nHas a Christian those confidence and everything that he's been saying for several chapters builds up to this one declarations and he wants the world only earth to know and he wants the angels in heaven's no and he wants every power in Prince of talent you know that he has a secret\nWeapon that they cannot do anything about\nIs that these are him before him can be against him [noise]\n\nAnd then you begin to tell us why\nHe says if God didn't spare his own son as he gave us what he value the most how will he not freely\nGive us all things and Paul builds this case beginning in the book of Romans is the first chapter in Romans\nChapter one verse Seventeen he makes this statement he says the just show live\nBy faith say that with me the just show live\nMy faith now if you're going to enjoy your life you've got to have confidence and if you're going to have confidence you need to know some things about yourself first you need to have a sense of your identity there are a lot of people in this world walking through an identity crisis they change themselves like millions\nThey see a magazine cover and they become what they see because they don't know who they are\nYou as somebody who are you and they'll tell you what they do that's not your identity that's your activity your identity is where you begin the foundation of your confidence and declares his identity and Romans chapter one he says I Am\nJust I'm not a perfect man I'm a full and man but I'm justified\nI admit that I've done wrong but God has made a way where there seems to be no way for me to be\nAll right not only do you need to know your identity but you need to understand your capability how many have you recognize what you're capable of how many of you are aware of what you are not capable of\nYou need to have a firmer grip on both\nFor example if you invited me to join you for a cheeseburger I Am fully confident that I'm capable of accomplishing the mission [noise]\nI Am your guy [noise]\nBut if coach pop a bitch calls and says hey we need a little help at this point guard [noise]\nI can point to the garden [noise] but I may not be that guy\nNow if I'm going to live with confidence I got to know what I can do and I've got to know what I Can't\nDo and Paul continues with his confidence sessions and Romans chapter to when he makes it very clear and Romans to in one that none of us can accuse the rest of us of anything\nHe says one man cannot can do another man because the moment the fall and man can Denver another fall and man he himself is guilty of slim\nWay of saying if you point out someone else's imperfections all you're doing is magnifying your own\nSo Paul understands that he's capable of sitting and he understands that he's not capable of judging someone else\nCould you imagine what would happen to the body of Christ if we were to take more time to look at ourselves and improve us and encourage others\nThat begins and understanding who you are and what you're capable of not only does Paul recognize that he's not capable of judging but he does announced that he is indeed capable of sending in Romans three and twenty three he says\nOh have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God say that with me oh have sin and fallen short of the glory of God\nNo when it comes to see and we typically in our lives walk to make sure that the crime is tangible we want to be able to point at somebody for a deed that they have done and be able to say on December the fifteenth of twelve o two PM you

and and the Guardian's you've got a big clumps ...\nInstead of a you know just one disease and choose these it's it works really well\nYeah that's a real good at it do you do you make your own soil blocks or do you buy a a pre made a press all block\nNow we are I'm I'm working with the the demand is managing the the the gardening down here and I'm sure it's civil oh yeah and we've got a whole a a a\nLesson plan going on the soil blocks we we go in and and teach the students how to use the equipment and build the soil blocks\nMhm and it it's a one stop shop very good he just picked up a ...

the you know or a lot it up to bigger\nBlocks or a containers\nIt's a great idea great at in Asia all the big boys use\nYeah yeah it's well and when it brings it down to the level that a U.S you know part time gardeners who lover gardens but have you know ... times things we do elsewhere it just puts the things that you produce new puts in the reach of ah\nUm every body and it's just a very good thing I'm certainly applaud you for a for teaching people how to do it and giving them an opportunity to learn and if you're like me you feel real good about teaching them how not to ... do all the

yeah and that that's the beauty of it and\nAnother thing is you can you can get in for less than fifty dollars with equipment out of their partners level or you can go all the way up to you know sky's

I Know of\nIs what we call a day neutral crate Myrtle which means it pays no attention\nTo a a day night cycle it will bloom if it gets ... twenty four hours a day so I don't believe that's gonna be any issue whatsoever unless like I say unless there's a\nPhysical issue when it gets so big in grows up around you to security like did you not get much light out of it but don't worry about that I I guess the easiest way to put it would be more concerned about the impact the crate Myrtle would have on the security lied and then the impact the security light would have on the great part of that makes sense\n... about forty\n... you're in good shape don't don't have it uh don't give it a second thought\nOkay thank you get ... I got a woman they know uh-huh shut up ... that is a political way and\nThat is a tropical plant and what that means is in its native habitat it's used to growing year round\nUm it might be what I Would call a tender perennial which means that if you planted in the ground here\nMany years it's not going to suffer anyone each wintertime damage some years is going to suffer a great deal of wintertime damage but a crate Myrtle that is I'm Sorry great Myrtle Bolivia this planet in the ground and properly mulch\nI have not seen a winter cold enough and I've seen one or one of his in single digits in San Antonio but I've never seen a winter cold enough to do severe damage\nOr to a ... a planted in the ground improperly mulch but a\nA mini wetter they are going to freeze back and if they are raised up in pots they may free so solid that they died so we have to call it a a\nA fairly hardy tropical but I I wouldn't quite somewhere between a harder hardy tropical unattended perennial it's a it is much more tropical in nature but in most areas here with little care for new it will be a perennial it will come back year after year even if it freezes\nWell thank you my last question I have a lot of a ... and that's all I have to set up with ... ... and ... look ... what would be a good ... said I'll Wait just say well\nOnce again we have some super hearty perennials many of which are evergreen things like ... things like ... camp the\nUm things like black foot daisy I could go through a long list of perennials that are very hardy and I think fall is a very good time to plant those on the other hand we have some perennials that are going to freeze the ground with the first frost\nThat would include some of our ... succulent Saudi is that would include the well it probably would include cigar plant uh the different ... and things like that\nThose you're gambling a little bit if you plant a slight because of their freshly planted and they get a hard freeze they may not fair so well over the winter months if they have six to ten weeks to establish that root system\nThen you'll be find to be planning even knows this time of year but you know I've seen years so we didn't have a free still January I've seen years when we had a freeze in late October so\nUm the the hardier perennials absolutely this is the best time to plant them just as it is the best time to plant trees and shrubs and things like that tender perennials you're risking a few bucks I'm a gambling that we are going to have six or eight weeks of warm enough weather for them to become established before they freeze back but uh\nUh I don't do whether all they do plants and your guess is as good as mine is the way we've got fall now and it's just a guessing game is to win win for going to arrive\nWell Bob I took your advice that I have a brand new locked door or a lot that will take up a bunch of a say August they rest yeah how was that good at San Diego where will they will will survive the oil\nWell oh yeah no we plant St Augustine basically three hundred and sixty five days a year my big concern on St Augustine this year is just with all the moisture and with the fact that most of our St Augustine is grown with a lot of synthetic high nitrogen fertilizer round patches going to be a big issue on\nEstablishing grass but also especially on newly planted grass so I'd tell anybody playing grass now we're thinking of going planet but give it a little application of corn meal just to head off any rise up Tony any brown to patch problems but weather is not going to be a problem to your St Augustine\nOkay what about the same thing same thing but\nIt's a Bermuda is of course I'm going to brown out sooner than St Augustine but uh I I Would not plant Bermuda from seed but if you want to ... to solve this time of year I think you're just fine\nWell what about if I have a state I stayed in my yard it adds to the lady there also is that good is that going to miss well\nIn a dry circumstance that ... going to dominate with adequate moisture nutrition near St Augustine will dominate it just like you know to\nA you know two players on and on opposing teams uh\nIn in the case of ... and good nutrition side Augustine is going to dominate to Bermuda and dry times to Bermuda is going to dominate the St Augustine so yeah they're going to play well together but depending on how you take care of them you can pick which one's going to be the dominant grass\nYeah so what other court costs let somebody else get at this as a share those be tied up my in laws are kind of go down to the side and say well there's some people tie 'em up\nWell you can you shouldn't really have to Esperanza once it's established is a fairly upright plant now there are many different Esperanza says and they are likely to freeze back at least partially this winter if they're in the way tie 'em up if they are not the way you've got plenty of other things to do\nUh that's the bad news on the other hand red oaks are\nAmong our most showy of ah you know of trees I have probably a if not thousands have hundreds of them growing up my ranch and I'm certainly not out cutting them down but I'm not planning more of them either if I Want to fall color I'm going to be playing the big too\nHe pulls somebody plant cedar elves and recognizing that in trees they're very few that have as bright color but you know we've got our ah our flame sue Mac or actually create models a bigger varieties can be beautiful red color in the leave so\nI they there are many red oaks unfortunately you planted the wrong variety of rental but all red oak sorrow will susceptible and you just have to measure your level of risk against a you know forget sugars higher for beautiful fall foliage\nRight well we have a we live on a couple of acres got beautiful beautiful live old so ... your ...\nSome of 'em you can't put your arms around him as a yeah uh we were trying to to uh we have seen her own or let your seat at home as well you're right about the color of their their beautiful uh I guess we are looking for an open variety that had that kind of color\nAnd unfortunately it's it's not out there\nUm there is a the the ... will have you know some color most years a borough is going to give you a nice a yellow fall color much like your alums do and both of those trees are highly resistant to oh quilt but\nThere is one and only one red oak that has you know that that vivid color and unfortunately all of them are oh quilt susceptible\nOkay All right well thank you I have a couple of other questions real quick sure uh which is the uh queens crown a year resistant\nDepends on how many do you have ... to ... be able to have too many in parts that have a reasonable number\nA deer we'll eat queens crown if they're hungry it's not going to be their first choice but uh\nI'm a people I Know that have a lot of deer and have queens crowd\nYou know growing up uh fans the dairy what's outside the you know the bar is inside does well so if you can give it a little protection from the deer I think it's certainly worth planting but if you're just you know in a neighborhood that news overrun with there there's not much they're not going to eat\nOkay well last question and a ... are raised garden bed we'd like to revitalize the soil what would you suggest as a uh trying to uh to turn that over\nWell fast faster results of compost compost composting more compost is going to revitalize the soil faster than anything other things that I Would consider adding a little bit of love a sand is great for a\nYou know water attention but at the same time some Arab vacation of course organic fertilizers is a given that that sort of a temporary thing whereas lava sand is more or less permanent\nUm there is something out there that I'm experimenting with this year that I had it has great potential\nThis called hazel might a C. O. M. I. T. E. and ah there's been a lot of work done with it and uh it it contains colleague contains like fifty different micro nutrients in a different things so\nIt's something you could add a green sand of course ah I prefer and there's still some of the lady but product round called magic sand or where he is a great uh ... it's not a permanent edition but you some you're going to apply every two or three years probably\nThose are all things that will\nHelp your soil driving last as well ... a great deal but when we look at things like fertilizer driving lasts just things like that those are things that we will add more of when we look at things like the lava sands and the rock powders those are things that you know one application skin lashes ten thousand years or so\nOkay All right well so and I really love your show we're really appreciate your advice\nWell it's always a pleasure I appreciate your call you get out and have a good Sunday\nYesterday that your job and go by alright break time and that is\nGoing to be Lamar and Diane and I'm ... we have a couple of open line she'll grab one if you like to ten five nine nine fifty five fifty five well I get to talk about the tank depot not open today but if you want to check out the Mets array of tanks that they offer you simply go to tank dash depot dot com\nAnd again every kind of tank you can imagine the storage tank chemicals hang ... open top pack\nA transfer tank for the back of your pickup truck all those things they have but I really really love to focus on rainwater because well have you heard sauce gonna raise your rates again have you heard it solves has it now where they don't even have to have to ask for city council approval they can raise your rates\nAnytime they feel like they need a little bit more money for their new pipelines and some of these other projects\nYou know rain water catchment is a very very viable option and if you're just going to use the water for landscape watering it is so simple there are few other hoops you have to jump through if you're going to make sure drinking water source and that is very very doable as well\nBut think about where most of the water use goes it goes on your landscape you want basically free rainwater or do you want to pay solves a lot of money for it comes down to that will take new poll has the tanks if you decide you want to go the rainwater out\nAnd I would highly encourage you to check into it and they've always open a Noel they're open six days a week they will start closing on Saturdays for the winter months\nBut uh Monday through friday you know you're always gonna find them over there on southeast loop for ten just south of ... days like today go to tank ... common to see what all you'll find\nWelcome to give me got high your new ... good how do you make it funny in green in line I mean we definitely don't think a lot of them I think there might pairing things ... and we don't use it maybe Harry or the carrying of one phrase main green we typically like\nI mean the nice thing which is\nOkay I'll take the turkey Tom me mom it makes it harder\nDry our new nine green weed sounds to me God's we were yeah\nRenowned medical correspondent and endurance race champion pop are not empty people ask me how to\nKeep competing at the age of Seventeen healthy living is important which so if if you have have you can't train so on through and I discovered salon ... plus this unique topical pain reliever contains too safe and effective anesthetics nothing has worked better for\nSalon ... cream or wrong\n... ... again like class of votes with\nHer how some home a third generation family owned company whose homes are built on tradition we utilized to buy six exterior walls and have a Twenty years structural warranty twice the industry standard every home is built to last as a guardian certified home chickens out online at her combs dot\nCom that's K.
