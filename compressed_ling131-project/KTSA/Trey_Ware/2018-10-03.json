this down at the different segments as we go forward this morning\nAnd I want you to be able to hear it it's over on the Web page at KPSK dot com but we've got\nSome news coming out today concerning now some of these accusers of Brett Kavanaugh and the FBI investigation uh may wrap up as soon as today and if it does they might take a boat on Saturday they've got to do some things with cloture and get everything ready\nBut they may be able to take a vote on Saturday Christine Blasey Ford did she the question is did she commit perjury on several things that she said last week in her testimony\nBecause now there are boyfriends or at least one boyfriend who has come forward and said no in a sworn statement provided to the Senate Judiciary committee\nBasically an ex boyfriend are costing Christine Blasey Ford said that he personally witness poured coach a friend on how to take a polygraph exam even though Ford said she's never talk to him about that\nThat ... ... you know she never mention a bread Kevin all she'd never mentioned having anything to do with the PBS be that'll all those claims that she was making last week never came up and the more than six years more than six years that they were together\nSo the president spoke out about it last night and he he was talking about Britain Christine Blasey Ford\nAnd so of course Bette do who is running for president keep that\nAnd mine anytime you hear Beto O'Rourke Robert O'Rourke he's not running to be senator of the great state of Texas that as a stepping stone he has been chosen to be an expert rock Obama type figure even down to the point where they have coached him on how to speak\nWhen he has a debate and how to control that microphone and the way to talk I mean everything about him is Obama ask down to you remember Obama one\nTerm senator out of Chicago and then ran for president that is the plan for Beto O'Rourke so he launched his campaign for the president said last night and a tweet\nAnd he said Dr Ford showed courage power and strengthen her testimony she should be treated with dignity and respect not demeaned and be little by the president of the United states well hold on this is what the president said last night I was looking at his words quote\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago was it I don't\nKnow that's all true nothing demeaning about that that's all true ...\nThat's what she testified wait a minute there's more president well say what neighborhood was it in I don't know where the house I don't know I don't know but I had one beer that's the only thing I remember\nAll of that she testified to guilty until\nProven innocent said the president that's very dangerous for our country a man's life isn't the Tatars\nAnd his wife is shattered they destroy people referring to the Democrats who have opposed Kavanaugh vocally they want to destroy people these are really evil people well let's hope all of that that the president said was true and was said under oath\nSo you know he he's not fooling at least this country boy by putting out that tweet he's clearly\nRunning for president of the United states and to be senator of Texas is just a stepping stone whether he wins or not this was a way for him to make it to the nomination in twenty twenty\nAnd if he wants to run for president and twenty twenty hey look more power to anybody ought to just say that he's\nBeen lying to people he's been lying to the people of the state of Texas which makes him a liar and nobody wants\nTo have a liar as as a senator alright so great thing Kevin to San Antonio the uh the twenty Nineteen Texas Special Olympics summer games coming here hosted by Morgan is wanting to land a Gordon Hartmann\nAnd his crew at mortgage wonderland are the best anywhere the finest people you're going to know anywhere and the fiftieth annual summer games are going to include track and field cycling gymnastics soccer tennis competitions held at area Venus including Toyota Field over there the south Texas regional soccer complex chart Jason Moran is one of the land\nAnd it happens may second through the fifth of twenty Nineteen so congratulations to Gordon Hartmann and his team over their mortgage window and they certainly deserve it this is a\nOne of his kind of park at a trend setter really in in parks all around the world and it has a Special Olympics come here the worldwide special architects the special effects in twenty Nineteen is a really really big deal Secret Service as this has been telling ya intercepted envelope suspected of containing rice in\nWhich as you know is a lethal poison that it was sent to President Trump it did not reach the White House now and that other letter with that suspicious white powder causes scare over Senator Ted Cruz campaign headquarters over in Houston the powder turned out to be non hazardous couple of the employees over there\nAre volunteers or whatever they were sent to the hospital\nOr to be checked up on but they're okay\nI'm All right so we had an interesting moment yesterday as we were wrapping up the showed about eight thirty five [noise] uh I had mentioned to LA not reading some tweets\nFrom Donald Trump junior and Elaine's just the best when it comes to being able to get gas\nAnd said let's get him and just ... minutes later he's on the phone and we had him on yesterday morning for about twenty minutes or so and you can hear the entire interview on the tray where page UK TSA dot com that's K. TSA dot com and the key word is trade T. R. E. Y. my conversation with Donald Trump junior but throughout the morning\nA ridiculous over regulation that didn't do anything that was the dumbest thing I've ever heard all this stuff started on November ninth when people realized that you have someone in the White House that you will have someone that's not going to fight against you but you have someone that's going to fight for you\nAnd you know the New York times back it up remember when Obama said oh there's no magic on that you can't break one point ... percent GDP Growth were Africa Deborah\nRight as long as you say it was like why can't you have three for even find I don't I don't even understand you know no no there's no New York times\nBack them up no no no one point eight percent of the new normal well just because Obama had never signed a paycheck in his life just because he never created a job in his life just because he never had any experience to justify being in a position to move to the economic needle\nDoesn't mean that someone who's actually done that someone who's actually had people's livelihoods and their family's well being dependent on his success back I can do it you know we got to make this viral because the other side as motivated yeah they they are motivated by hate and they're going to show up so we better show up we'd better bring our friends and we are not let them turn Texas in California\nThat one of the narratives about his dad of course the president and himself is it they don't like women they treat women like ... you know like they're horrible human beings and all that kind of stuff and they're only for the guy so ABC wrote a piece saying that Donald Trump junior\nIs more concerned about his sons in the era of me too that he is about his daughters they could care less about his daughters and the fact that they may be harassed some day and you want to protect them and you want them to be believed no no no no all Donald Trump junior cares about his men and protecting his son so I asked him about that\nThey they asked me about it and I said listen this is a you can't win in question right there are ... for for men to be able to have someone come up with any accusation right already five years ago I did this was a real fast zero core operation is he really anything and they say that you can ruin someone's life forever that guy is presumed guilty\nIt's it's insane that scary as hell I'm not I didn't say that I wasn't worried about the possibility or actual assault from my daughters I was very clearly that you can't win question but there are processed these\nThere are things I looked at I raised them well enough that they would do something about if something is that terrible happened to them and they would do something about it that they would go to law enforcement that they would speak that they would fight for themselves but to be able to say that you can destroy someone's life and that should worry\nAny everybody that she had to worry any mother of sons that someone could do that\nToo and otherwise perfectly upstanding individual a guy that's going through seven or six or seven FBI investigations someone who's been a public figure\nThen someone can just say oh by the way then you have other people coming out of the earliest one state against what now that changed last night as soon as the greatest political ... this was so serious why Feinstein sit on it for two months exactly right exactly and said this\nIs nothing more than the Democrats being Democrats and if you can ruin your life if they can just arbitrarily decide maybe it won't affect liberal so maybe they're finding out what but I mean this is a way that they it scares the hell out of me and it just scared any parent\nThat is on the Trump junior the entire conversation with Donald Trump junior is on the tree where page at Katy I said I promise to trade where page Katie I said I can check it out he said more and it is over there\nUh one of the things we talked a lot about yesterday was this uh this new polling and these pundits now that are starting to say Brett Kavanaugh doesn't make it onto the Supreme Court that Republicans will pay heavily in the mid term elections because conservatives and Republicans are going to punish\nThose in office or by not turning out in the midterms and voting for them we talked about it on the on the air quite a bit yesterday took your calls\nAnd several people called and said they're going to do directly the opposite what they see happening to Brett Kavanaugh right now and the fact that he is being railroaded the way he is right now with false accusations have been made against him right now and uncorroborated no evidence accusations that have been made against him\nThat people are fired up even more so than they were before the Brett Kavanaugh situation happened we're being told by the pundits of course the other way around the pundits are saying well they're they're they're going to be punished\nFact of the matter is the answer to all of this right now for those of you who are conservative and appreciate conservative values the answers a red wave that's what the answer is no I'm not predicting a red wave I'm not saying it's going to happen I'm telling you what the antidote is to the foolish knows that you have seen\nFrom people like Booker and Kamala Harris and of course a

boyfriend oh Christine Blasey Ford\nSaid that he personally witness Ford coach a friend on how to take a polygraph exam now if true it would mean that board provided false testimony to the Senate Judiciary committee last week when she claimed that she never had any discussions with anyone about how to take a polygraph\nDuring some of the time that we were dating Dr Ford lived with Monica McLean he said even has even as her name who I understood to be her lifelong best friend that's what the ex boyfriend wrote under penalty of perjury to the Senate yesterday\nDuring that time it was my understanding that McLean was interviewing for jobs with the FBI and the U.S attorney's office I witnessed Dr Ford help McLean prepare for a potential autograph exam Dr Ford explained in detail what to expect\nHow polygraphs worked and she helped McLean become familiar and less nervous about the exam helping her beat the polygraph exam now this is an ex boyfriend of Dr Ford saying this now\nAt last week's hearings Ford was specifically asked by Rachel Mitchell that experience sex crime prosecutor that the committee hired to bring it in question for these were her questions exactly\nWord for word [noise] have you ever had discussions with anyone beside you were attorneys on how to take a polygraph never said for it and I don't just mean countermeasures Mitchell said but I mean just any sort of tips or anything like that no was Ford's answer\nHave you ever given tips or advice to somebody who was looking to take a polygraph test never Ford replied\nFederal law makes it a crime to provide false information to congressional officials in the course of an investigation no person convicted of lying to Congress can be in prison for up to five years for providing that false testimony so we'll see if\nOr where any of this goes as the day goes on but what's happening right now\nAre all the accusers are now beginning to have their past or come out and things about them and it's starting to flip on them last night President Trump flip the script on the Democrats because as this all the sexual allegations in these charges have begun to fall apart literally fall apart right before they're very eyes\nAs you note and we've been talking about it this week they have been changing the narrative it turned from sexual allegations now to him being a drunken throws eyes he he's a gang rape or who throws I said at that you'd be forty concerts\nI hadn't run right I Want to be well you think it was it was ... ...\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you get their own

know what I had one beer that's the only thing or in so many lives is is a man slices shatters\nThat was the president last night and he's getting criticism because they're all saying oh now you're picking on her item that he's a throwing it back her way to one zero five nine nine fifty five fifty five he did go after Patrick Leahy yesterday Patrick Leahy\nThe president says oh he's never had a drink in his life I check it out and look under Patrick clays slash drunk seems to be flipping the script on Democrats who thoroughly question the drinking habits of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh when he was a teenager this is what Trump supporters like about Donald Trump is\nThat says it's nasty holiday represented kids like voted for a person is going to you John and they're all acting like cats and they're not doing a job that it's just getting ... paying tax payers money and lives and they cheat I think they need to make that one out\n[laughter] thank you Debbie appreciate it yeah I hear what you're saying and it goes back to something that block Obama said and I think he was very rude to John McCain when he said it\nAnd it was during the debate over health care and they did it\nIn the executive building next to the White House over there I'll never forget it because they were sitting in the ... a table configuration\nGot like in a horseshoe ... was in the middle and yeah these very well known senators or what have you who were surrounding him they were debating health care and John McCain was making a point and an Obama interrupted him and he said and this is these are words align that goes down in infamy if you will\nThe elections have consequences John now he was a brand new president right and he's talking to one of the oldest senators that he came to love because he stood up to Donald Trump a McCain did later years\nThe lectures that consciousness John you're just gonna have to deal with it and that's the point about this and the Democrats need to get over there but hurt about November sixteenth or November of twenty sixteen\nAnd get on with their lives they have this attitude\nA we're either going to rule or we're going to ruin we're going to rule\nEverything and we're going to be in charge of everything and we're going to call the shots are we are going to ruin it all we're going to burn it all down to tear it all down and they are in the process right now because they were thrown out of power they are in the process of trying to burn it down tear it down that's exactly what they're doing ruler ruin ruler ruined that's it for Democrats\nAnd that's why you have people like Donald Trump and Donald Trump junior who was on the show yesterday and they're giving it back\nAnd it is in Boulder ... others by the way I'm I'm looking through some quotes right now from Charles Grassley and he seems very very hot I he says he's looking for the information\nA from a Deborah are are are from a Ford\nAnd he's looking to get that information as soon as possible they are demanding now that they turn over those notes that she was so coy about saying these are the nose with a therapist that brought all this up and she's a she said during her testimony well she had a bunch of different answers as to why she didn't turn the notes over\nTo the Senate and now her attorneys are are still saying that are going to turn those those notes over to the Senate Chuck Grassley has fired off a numerous letters saying\nYou must turn this over because this is very important information is pertinent to our investigation here\nThe attorneys are saying no it's private information between her and her doctors\nBut the fact of the matter is she let that information out she's the one who turn the information and those notes over to the Washington Post and that's another area of questioning and her testimony as well because she said she never really saw them until she went online and she just basically gave the Washington Post a summary but the Washington Post says they actually have the notes\nSo\nChuck Grassley said I Want those notes and I want them delivered over here and I want them right now and her attorneys are saying no we're not going to do that that's part of this whole\nYou know we're gonna we're gonna rule or ruin\nAnd we're gonna we're going to say what we want to say and we don't have to back it up and that's why you hear the president say this is a very dangerous time for guys it's a very dangerous time for all of us if we choose to go down this road of we're going to allow you're guilty until you're proven\nInnocent 'til you prove yourself innocent\nIt will affect every American going forward not just guys who may be\nYou know accused of some sort of sexual crime that will affect everybody going forward we have to nip it in the bud we have to stop it right now we need to make sure that it doesn't go a bit further that's why Chuck Schumer should never be in power over in the Senate and Nancy Pelosi should never be in power over\nIn the house that's exactly what you're going to get and they've shown their hands about that as well more recalls coming up and the mayor has signed off on

I think some of the cabinet and stuff probably galvanized some over the base\nNow I think if if the Democrats the Republicans fold and they give up to every concession they keep folding and doing what they do best in so many cases I think we have a problem now fighting for dead because it's actually a fighter from day one he's been fighting for these policies because they say is that it's working for America but it's also working protects us\nPart so there is that's not Trump junior my conversation with him yesterday all of it is on the tray where page K TSA dot com and John ... from Breitbart dot com joins me every Wednesday at this time we're talking about what's going on the political world\nAnd Don Trump junior is here in Texas today John fighting for Ted Cruz 'cause Ted Cruz is that a fight with ... rock right now\nWell it it looked like he was a head last time I checked the polls but we got a ways to go yet before the election you know there's a million miles between near the finish line even though it's only a few weeks away so this is the time for everybody to make their closing arguments that I think Ted Cruz a really strong closing argument it seems like every public occurrence of his opponent lose them further and further away from our Texas voters are\nAnd ... and ... not address this DUI stuff I mean he is he keeps telling stories about it he won't be honest about it that matters these things matter especially at a moment when the Democrats are telling us that every minute detail of Brett Kavanaugh's college life is hyper relevant most hyper relevant debater will work drove away from a drunk driving seen\nA man to that so let's talk about the Kavanaugh situation we're just second because now we're seeing some holes get poked\nA in a forward story and there's some real questions I think now a boyfriend has gone under oath to say wait a minute\nShe never talked about two doors you never talked about the TST or having claustrophobia she never and and she did in fact coach somebody about how to beat a polygraph test all these things are starting to happen now where people were really careful to not try to challenge her now people who knew her and knew her best including her best friend\nWas question again by the FBI Leyland Kaiser and said I don't even know who Brett Kavanaugh is and I don't know of any party that happened that she's referring to holes in her story\nAnd the FBI investigation is evidently going to wrap up today or tomorrow I think most people are saying today\nAnd it's most likely going to leave her looking worse for having spent this extra time there's less collaboration of anything she said she's in more trouble for making evidently false statements I think the Senate traditionally Republicans have laid out a pretty good methodical case that she perjured yourself several times to her testimony\nAnd not a little details eater but are talking about the the ridiculous media arguments over whether Kavanaugh was honest about exactly how much gear he drank in college we are talking about major details of her story like her saying that she's never coached anyone on a polygraph test she apparently lied about that she did\nThe story about her front door and her house was completely phony left is integrated you know that that she put a second front door and her house and that was why she was going to couples therapy with her husband that's not true\nI mean it matters that she is dishonest about this stuff it matters to a legal sense\nWhen she made false statements under oath and it matters a very great deal with this question of who's will credible which is what this is all boiled down to all of the evidence is on his side where exactly were we were two weeks ago he has all the evidence he has all the testimony she has nothing except her own ever shifting story\nAll right and the other two have been discredited as well and in fact in the story of Julie sweat makes she has a boyfriend who came out and said do not believe a couple of boyfriends do not believe a word she says even her dad says she has psychological issues\nUh she she was into having multiple partners at one time so maybe that's where this is coming from so on and so forth Alan Dershowitz says\nIf she perjured herself if she lied and her sworn testimony\nOr would be that if in fact all all this other evidence shows that are stacked up against the same thing with Ford that these people need to be prosecuted for bringing these false cases against somebody like judge Kavanaugh or anybody else we need to make examples of them\nAnd and lock them away in fact he just what you're saying you need to put her in jail if she if she perjured himself now\nThe other side of that though and this is the question everybody else what do you do with those Democrats up there who entered into this knowing these stories had holes in them and yet they did this to to Brett Kavanaugh but they also keep in mind did it to the United states of America what's the recourse against them Dianne Feinstein people like that\nI I think in the case of Dianne Feinstein and possibly at another Senate Democrat who was involved in this they need to be prosecuted for what they did with the letter and how they brought this out it was a political dirty trick you know and all the Republicans are angry about it\nAnd all the Democrats are chuckling and slapping each other on the back and saying good wouldn't die if I Know if they broke Senate rules they need to be censored and that may mean they'd be removed that you mean they face charges that's what has to happen there has to be costs pretty sleazy tricks is exactly right there has to be a price for making false statements under oath\nAnd I really hope to Republicans don't end this by getting cabin and then the beltway consensus as well okay you want you got him can fry so just let all the rest of this stuff slide\nProve it prove it and that's basically where we are today there's a lot of holes being shown right now [noise] ah so last year I K TSA with Trey go ahead Celeste\nThank you ... and I just said because I think a lot of let's say they now get back to that lady prosecutor but I think you could have gotten here in San Antonio any chocolate like they had a grandmother and she could have gotten up there and that's better question and that ... just common sense question that you and the president were talking about last night\nAnd I know it's hard to catch like please somebody had him at caltech thank you\nOkay thank you very much a bad is so last two ten five nine nine fifty five fifty five to ten five nine nine fifty five fifty five o another story came out the overnight men are now making up about\nPercent of illegal immigrant parents trying to sneak children into the United states they're leaping to take advantage of the family loophole means illegal immigrants who come with children get treated more lenient lay and fraud is also sword with a border patrol\nBuying a hundred and fifty cases from may to August of adult men or women pretending to be families to take advantage of a loophole but they're not really families\nShould they said that children have become pawns deportation shields now so just like we told you and all that crisis was going on at the border parents are being separated from their children well no not really\nThat does happen but\nChildren are being separated from people who have pick them up in those Central American countries or who have bought them for that purpose so they could come into the United states because they know that they come with a child well then they're scot free they can stay\nAnd now the proof is in the pudding as they say and we've got the actual numbers that are coming

she's got any situations like that there's been no evidence about that that she has any psychological issues or whatever or nothing like that has come forward but what's happening now though is her
