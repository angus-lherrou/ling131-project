news with Trey aware now\nOn FM one o seven on the safety of the American people is my highest an absolute priority I've just concluded a briefing with the FBI\nDepartment of Justice Department of homeland security and the U.S Secret Service as we speak to packages are being inspected by top explosive experts in a major federal investigation is now underway\nTo full weight of our government is being deployed to conduct just investigation and bring those responsible for these despicable acts to justice we will spare no resources are expense in this effort\nAnd I just wanted to tell you that in these times we have to unify we have to come together and send one very clear strong unmistakable message that acts more threats of political violence of any kind of no place in the United states of America\nResponse from Hillary Clinton's spokesman for the range of rain said this to the president this was on you you cause those\nFiber of your rotten being you have been cited and condoned hate your very existence requires anger and fear you need it like normal people made oxygen now that's a spokesperson that's\nThat's Hillary Clinton spokespersons official statement last night after the president condemned the suspicious packages we don't even know if there were bombs yet that were set out so a lot of talk about this yesterday of course obviously wall to wall coverage everywhere you look [noise]\nAh there are those on the political up saying that these are no jobs who are taking a the words of conservatives and the words of while Republicans on the words of the president and going after Democrats tried to kill Democrats\nAre there are those uh and I heard them on Sean show yesterday who were saying well this\nThis was an inside job it's Democrats trying to get sympathy they've tried everything in the world including a caravan I heard somebody say the caravan when I started work against Democrats it was something they launch they thought they were going to be able to storm the border by election time and this thing\nUh turned sour and by the way did you notice not one mention of the care about yesterday and the media did you notice that your attention completely diverted away from apparently now about fourteen thousand people ready to storm our borders about fourteen thousand at another caravan forming and some interesting information\nAbout the people behind this\nUh how they are connected to a political organizing group out of Chicago who else is connected\nTo a political organizing group out of Chicago I don't know Valerie Jarrett and ...\nAnd Jerry's litter with Obama and Michelle in that house in Washington I don't know just you know\nYou try not to be a conspiracy theorist in this world but it sometimes all of these things come together to make you move in that direction so what are you thinking about those\nTwo one zero five nine nine fifty five fifty five sixty one zero five nine nine fifty five fifty five none of these quote suspicious packages exploded yesterday well\nA couple of them\nWere exploded by bomb experts but they haven't said what was in them they haven't said whether or not there was\nA anything and that that would cause them to explode Ellen ... talked about the contents in there that's that's interesting that's not to say that there's a reason a one way or the other or maybe they just haven't felt like they want to report that yet maybe their hold us some information back the FBI may be holding but they are saying that they've got some pretty good uh evidence here\nAnd uh there are those quote experts that fill up the all that time on these talking ahead channels now\nUh they go find these guys and they put them on and they're saying well anticipate at a rest\nVery very soon because this guy or guys whoever it was left some telltale signs possibly DNA by licking stamp or to a possibly even the labels that were printed out with the names\nUh the address sees those came from computer predators and computer predators can be identified because they have like a dot matrix or kind of like a pixilated\n... you know a picture of there and when you are a printing the letters themselves are kind of like pixilated in in a computer printer can be identified that way\nAnd they are of course looking for surveillance footage and it's very hard to believe that there wouldn't be some sort of surveillance footage somewhere along the way much like the Austin guy when they caught him going into the FedEx\nTo mail those packages on video it's hard to believe that if some of these places would not have video surveillance where somebody dropped off one of these packages [noise]\nSo I mean there's all kinds of things that the FBI working on right now and they're the best the best the best of the best at it and if anybody's going to find them is going to be\nThe FBI that doesn't mean we're ever going to know a motive right because think about what happened October of last year out in Las Vegas they they still don't know a motive why that guy climbed up into Mandalay Bay shuttles people they didn't know they know he did it and they say they know who it was\nBut they don't know what the motive was so you can catch this guy or these guys are these ladies or whoever's involved in those who ever did this you can catch them and you still may not know the motive\nUm are are you sniffing something out on this it's I'm all contrary to what may be the obvious kind of thing would be on this\nDo you want and zero five nine nine fifty five fifty five one remind you about my blog this up\nThis morning trait where page K TSA dot com it's about Joaquin Castro he's at a very busy week at the polling locations complaining about a printer that failed\nAt one point or he also ah was complaining about I'm a police patrolling at last promise and the\nPolice command staff in San Antonio agreed with him and issued a stand down order and\nTold San Antonio police to not go to the polling places do not patrolled around Paul Paul what what they did yes what what the command staff over that said pd did yesterday was just tell you know everybody who has nefarious intentions there are no cops\nAt the polling places that is unbelievable to me that they would\nAs are breaking news coverage continues you just heard Aaron ... is talking about now it appears as though we're up to nine of these suspicious packages\nThat had been discovered this one apparently going to Robert Deniro or at least Robert Deniro Z restaurant and we are watching right now as that bomb truck is carrying it to the Bronx is Aaron was just telling you for it to be a detonated so that the FBI\nCan carry on their investigation into what the is going on with all this we're going to find out why they do that and more details about that coming up at six thirty five this morning our friend Dr Jeffrey ...\nFrom the center for terrorism laws going to join us here and we're going to talk about the these now apparently nine and I say apparently because there's been some dispute over whether they had eight of them last night or seven of them last night and now this would be number eight and whatever the case says there's a whole bunch of them that have been\nA set out and the FBI or saying there could be even more in the pipeline and to be vigilant and to be aware and to look at these particular packages\nAnd if you see anything that is suspicious that you were not expecting to receive\nThen don't open them and be very very careful and alert authorities about this and so on and so forth what do you make about all this we're taking your calls about it this morning and Robert you're on K TSA betray your morning Robert\n... tree you know what I think I think it's a Democrat is sending out all these things and why do you think that they want it to where it's not fair to say they just let job who just was like the Republicans look bad\n[noise] um there is a piece today and the Washington Examiner by a very a well thought of individual who basically is a possibility that he is saying that this could very definitely helped the Democrats here in the midterms um\nHis name is uh James angel and James writes frequently in the Washington Examiner and he's really really good and and well research\nAnd he said could the bombs that targeted Democrats win them the mid term elections and he gets into how\nAh don't be surprised basically if\nYou find out this was some sort of job that was coming from actually a left wing or a trying to help the Democrats out I don't know\nUh but I heard that postulated on the air several times yesterday is as well I Know that this was never okay as far as my position is concerned none of this from either side is ever OK to terrorize people to scare people and if these are real bombs and we don't know they're the FBI has been very careful\nTo name them suspicious packages and they have yet to name them bombs not one time have I seen an FBI report that says these were bombs they're saying these are suspicious packages I think that is really important because none of them blew up\nNow for up to nine whoever did this is not really good at making bombs obviously because the nine not even one of them was detonated\nSo these are suspicious packages we don't know why we don't know who as of right now the FBI is digging into it but violence and the scare tactics like this is never okay from either side for any reason yes\nChallenge people on their politics and their political ideas challenge them like crazy on their ideas but be civil about it\nUm they respect the humanity and the individuals that you're dealing with respect him challenged them on their ideas you can talk about how nutty their ideas are that's perfectly fine that's what politics that's what free speech is all about\nThat's another side of this that we are going to talk about this morning as well\nThis could have one of the most chilling effect on the first amendment and free speech and political speech in America that we've ever seen\nBecause uh people are not going to be as free to speak as they once were if the idea is sold to them that they may be inciting violence with some of what they they have said\nAnd that was clear and a lot of the reporting that was done on CNN and coming out of the some of the Democratic operatives mouths yesterday talking heads on some of the stations yesterday shut the latest is the New York police department of transporting a suspicious package now in that bomb truck\nThat they are taking now up to the Bronx that's where they have that's where they detonate these things and uh and and so this one was addressed apparently to to narrow Robert Deniro restaurant we don't know if it was addressed specifically to him we don't know that we do know that it was sent apparently\nTo a restaurant there at the film studios try back a film studios in as being transported right now and

open their own mail for them\nAnd so somebody was there a security personnel and checked on that and now it's either eight or nine they're not really sure there's there's reports on on both but uh anyway a number of these packages have been set out now and they're suspicious packages because the FBI has not called them bombs yet the FBI is calling them suspicious\nPackages and the FBI has been

got any speculation you want to enter into Jeff\n[noise] well we we know it well the only thing we can know for sure that it's it's designed to spread tear a and that you know have the element of fear in it and these packages that are set out even though they don't go off and go as hard as good as\nIt is terrorizing people it of course we do that certain segments are using it for political advantage which is also another issue involved with a revolt was able to screen the last couple of days [noise]\nObviously intended to send a message we now have eight or nine of them none of them have gone off we don't even know if any of them if they were in earth or if they were had the capability of going off because as I said the FBI has not been talking about um for obvious reasons but\nUm ... it is intended to send a message what what is that message do you think\nWell you know the recipients are obviously criticized press\nRight nah we just lost Geoffrey I Believe okay\nWe just lost his a self connection so we'll try to get that back\nAnd discuss this some more with him but he is going down the road talking about how these are obvious people that have\nCriticized President Trump on the latest being a Robert De Niro there you just heard that um and of course this is also we are going to get into this when we get Dr etiquette back a chilling effect on political free speech as well\nUh there are those ramifications too so we don't know who and we don't know why we don't know a where\nThese packages came from we do know according to the mailings and the addressing on there who they were intended for 'em but okay we got the doctor I had to cut back now now you were talking about how these were these are people who have criticized the president go right ahead\nYeah that's right I mean there are commonalities that's what you got to look for the commonalities none of them have gone off which tells you this person is either a got you know trying to kill people are just trying to terrorize or he's extremely confident um because if you got eight or nine packages medical ... that made it\nUh that that raises a red flag right there uh in terms of of what they're really trying to do but yeah the commonalities are there individual that have criticized the president and a and so that's you know kind of narrows the search for what they're looking for\nBut uh I expect we'll go see a conclusion to this today or tomorrow\nWith a number of individuals that are looking at this whatever packages there's gotta be DNA evidence on their uh this guy also is not a very bright because he's got to know that these high profile figures they don't open these packages and therefore he are not very bright where he knows that they don't open the packages that are just trying to instill fear\nUm it it's you know there are several things that they're looking at when they put all these things on the board trying to connect the dots\nWe heard also that one of the reasons why that much mailing was used to have that much posters was used so they could be dropped into blue mailbox and not taking into\nA facility um we know that that's what busted the case wide open and Austin as an example the guy up there took it into a FedEx facility to mail that last bomb and that's when the officials saw him on video there is so much video surveillance right now do you have any doubt your mind that this individual or individuals\nOr somewhere on video particularly since we know that the one that was delivered the Soros on Sunday night Monday was actually put in his mailbox I Can't imagine his mailbox or his property doesn't have all kinds of surveillance\nYeah there's there are surveillance activities out there every year but the Unabomber which was you know ... was a a is his body spray last over a period of several several years\nHis case with broken up by by somebody that knew him or identified his style of writing a newspaper notified authorities so somebody knows this guy just like to tell what Austin deserves at somebody do something about\nIt so that's also something that we could have ... chips that are going to be coming in a

that\nVoters said no I'm sending it twenty thousand signatures cost him forty thousand dollars to do it you know they got us to this point because uh they went out and spend five hundred and ten

forty ground and get twenty thousand signatures and overturn that and unionized San Antonio's what you're saying\nYeah I think that threat is definitely here we are at a point here and the reason I become so involved we talked about this really I'm really not involved in this San Antonio and twelve days or could potentially if we lose on a and these past a could be threatened to make San Antonio a different type of city no question about attract\nWe've seen other cities that have done this and a California is is a prime example the perfect example okay and and how has that been detrimental to the cities that have tried this before let's just\nTake I mean some people talked about Austin doing this yeah Austin's situation's different than this one are totally structured different but at one thing that I have talked about and it will I Will get into this later as we have a ... a chance and this isn't me saying this is Lisa reports from the people who do the rating\nFor San Antonio because San Antonio is you know has the best a rating of any major city in the country when it comes to what we borrow money for the lowest interest rate by far and\nUm but the Austin for example has already had a tax increase and so when people talk about well this really won't do this we'll do that no one's going to happen is you're going to pay more and get less because it has been made very clear that if these\nAmendments pass that we are going to be a down rated to 'em from our AAA rating and what that will cost us if we are just brought down one notch thirty five million dollars per year\nTo ... which is what many are saying two to three Seventy five and all the way up to a hundred and twenty million dollars in additional interest costs so we're just gonna be paying the banks more money instead of getting services something has to give\nHigher taxes are less services and that's where my concern is here we're going to take our put the city and a whole different approach towards how

found one address to Robert Deniro the actor who is an anti eyedropper any other to Joe Biden the former vice president and senator\nAnd we are covering those stories for you this morning here on K TSA we're covering the story concerning walking Castro the wrote a blog about it\nAnd him going to the polling places being it's polling places and in one instance he was mad at a predator that broke down on the other instance he was mad that there were police there and the command staff overt SAP ordered issued a stand down order for the polling places we're going to get into that coming up\nOne more segment here with Gordon Hartman we're talking about a B and C as you are going to the polls yes people have been asking me have you invited the yes side yes we have\nWe would lie to the side and so far they have yet to respond so my door is always ... might this door is open and I have invited or or a lane has invited she does that work for me she has invited the yes side of the yes side has not said yes if the U.S side says yes there are more than welcome come in and do what Gordon is doing right\nNow trying last night I was supposed to have a debate with the other side and they didn't show so I I'm not surprised\nOkay well I yeah I understand I I'm just saying as far as I'm concerned I have asked that uh they come in as well and when they're when they want to uh then we'll we'll do the same thing I'm not I'm not being a you know part of sitting here in any shape or form or fashion\nOn the disseminate or the information on these so that you will understand exactly what this was all about that's what I've been all along try to help people understand what's going on I understand the frustration that people have I understand frustration with government better than most people because I Lived this you see the ... stuff\nThat I read every day when I come in here I live with the frustration\nIn government so I I completely understand people being frustrated and wanting to have more control\nOver their government I'm trying to understand for myself in fact and we're going to talk about this the bond ratings and why this is going to affect Moody's that's the first question people have asked me why is this going to affect our our rating so much now we covered this a little bit in the first segment we have new listeners right now I Want to touch on that a second that's what you were doing a\n... well first of all it will all three rating agencies have said there's a high probability that we will lose our AAA rating again we're the only major city that has it\nWhen that is lost interest rates will rise and why is that because we will not be seen as a stable environment when any action at the city council taste can immediately go to a referendum\nAnd even if it doesn't go to reference it can be held a basically hostage for six months on their fear of that that brings about a fear of risk and therefore it and instability which there for those who lend you money going to try your higher interest rate\nWe have done so much in the city in respect to being able to ah improve our infrastructure over the past uh twelve years we have done two billion dollars a drainage project streets projects all sorts of different things\nAt the lowest interest rate possible you change that many of those hangs has to be pulled back because you won't have as much money because you have to pay higher interest right that's the biggest concern here\nNow does this affect things like SARS and ... the amount of money you can pay for fire and police and I want to not\nOnly are we talking about taxes but let's talk about your water bill when they go out and have to sell bonds to be able to do things those rights will be higher when the CPS has to go out and which are doing right which tells you do it right now they're doing right now we're going to say like every body will be affected by the so it's not just going to affect potentially your taxes\nBut it's gonna affect your water rights is going to affect your electric rights\nAnd so that's why this is something that people really need to put a focus on because it will really changed the way we are in San Antonio I mean all three of these amendments and we talk about a minute see for example\nAh we're basically the firefighters can go to immediate binding arbitration and you know I I like I I'll be the first one to tell you tried I loved firefighters I mean they have helped me many times at one time the daughter was\nHaving to be rushed because she couldn't have had a problem you know the greatest folks in a while I Know a lot of them yeah right so this is about this this is about the union now saying look\nRight now the average firefighter makes a hundred and forty two thousand dollars a year okay okay and they were offered by the city a twelve percent raised it tried to get past this impasse\nAnd they said no and so if they get into a binding arbitration situation what you're going to do the state is going to be at ... the\nThe the firefighters grasp of the moon and arbitrator will hit somewhere in the middle which will be well outside what this city physically can be able to afford right now two thirds two thirds of our budget general fund goes to just fire and police we can't sustain this\nThey need to be paid well I'm not questioning that they do a heck of a job and they put themselves in dangerous situations\nBut right now they are getting paid well over a hundred and forty thousand dollars medium being paid well over two hundred thousand dollars they're not agreeing to twelve percent raise what did they want it's a we got to put some element of control to and this is a way to try to manipulate that situation where they can control that the union can't control\nIs a it's a uh been very interesting because you have had to go out and tried to mobilize people to say no to something\nThat's that's got to be a very difficult position to be in most difficult thing in the world is going to say vote against ... that's what I'm saying that they're easier to say yes go say he has pulled over for most people are used to that yeah but you're you're here saying go in and say no to all three\nVote against a B and C and at the end of the ballot make sure you get to the other ballot and that's another thing we've all been said well you know if we had the opportunity to vote on this ... then the citizen spread out\nJust how many races are All right down you know about every judge in about all the details are all that just thing when you have to go into the voting booth and see twenty or thirty different items at the city council voted on that now you have an opportunity to vote on\nHow we got to be able to study those things were not that's not ... well it's not it's not it's not going to work\nAs a valid point um okay well as we wrap up here hum when you see the things that had been going on the most recent being the animal plan and there was some severe opposition to things like you know I was opposed the Senate tapping move I was opposed to the walls being built around the table I think around plaza I think it ought to be open

Republican you will not be able to vote for him essentially walking will end up getting your vote at that point so you have to go bit by bit and go through the entire thing let's talk about it right now subject to my blog this morning what's Joaquin afraid of why why did he want cops\nPatrolling the polling locations Brad you're on K TSA would try to go ahead red\nRed alright to ten five nine fifty five fifty five\nO all this was because walking Castro congressman from San Antonio a complaint on Twitter that he saw a couple of police officers who are patrol the area a at last polish where people were voting\nNow let me give me the back story on this I spoke with my Kelly this morning and that is being pod cast this morning it will be up on the tray where ... he's the president of the San Antonio police officers association these were a couple of officers who were directing traffic there there was a bottleneck\nObviously with all the people parking there to go into boat they went over into the parking lot to check on the bottleneck that was it that was that there is a police substation nearby by the way\n[noise] so uh\nThat's that's how this whole thing came about Joaquin Castro saw them there went on Twitter and complained about seeing police officers there and told his Twitter followers let me know if you see any more police officers the next thing you know the command staff deputy chief flavor in issues they stand down order and tells the officers all the officers to now\nGo to any polling places unless they're on a call\nA stand down order do not go to polling places\n\nYou have a very volatile a situation right now with people in their politics obviously we have now ten of these suspicious packages that have been male to people yeah people wanting to you know physically assault people over politics these days and you're telling the police to stand\nDown John you're on K TSA would try and go ahead hello Jay go ahead John I'm listening\nA yes or oh I was a voting over at a Fair Oaks ranch area and I'm a it was only about a forty five minute wait and uh the Fair Oaks coughs sore I say there were visited that area three or four times I'm doing that voting period yeah\nGood good for his Fair Oaks Fair Oaks still believes that it's okay to do that and it's important to do that I certainly hope you know we've had people calling this morning and say well this was all because San Antonio's a sanctuary city and if there's people who are who are voting illegally then uh the presence of uniform officers would chase them off\nAnd you know San Antonio police officers do not enforce immigration law that's not something that they do in fact they have been strictly ordered by the ... to not help enforce immigration law\nSo this is not a situation where they're they're ... you know looking around for anybody who's illegal or anybody who's voting illegally that's not their job their job is to be on patrol and make sure that peace has kept to protect and serve\nI asked my Kelly if there if he couldn't remember a time when there was ever is such a stand down order given he says I Can't remember it\nSo I'm\nYou know there's still a lot of open ended questions about this did they take on an order from the congressman or the congressman strongly suggest that they do a stand down how ... how did all that come about I think we need some answers to those types of questions\nI think we need some answers as to why he's a kind of lurking around and hanging out at polling locations what's he doing at these polling places is he the new poll cop do we have a a new movie coming that he's going to star in Joaquin Castro poll cop\nI mean what what exactly is going on here\n... he he was upset about one printer going down and now he's upset that the police of San Antonio police officers are doing their job\n\nWhich is keeping us safe by the way I kinda think it's cool deal if you're standing outside and you have political opponents nearby and you're standing there way to go and vote and everybody's kind of you know hanging out I think it's kind of a cool thing if the police are just around I think that's all right I don't think there's any problem with that you\nMight Kelly telling us this morning it's ... it's it's illegal we were told it's legal for them to do that\nAnd they can certainly patrol different areas
