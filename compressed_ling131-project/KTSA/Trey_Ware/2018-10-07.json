confused\nWell Chris I said in the beginning of the show here that there's two problems with the vitamin C. that you can buy one is getting enough of it yeah and second having the right form of vitamin C. here's the thing I did go to the supermarket before\nI got here [laughter] okay and I brought some vitamin C. and I I went and bought these and\nI'd like to just show you what's out there so let's go through this this particular vitamin C. it has five hundred milligrams of vitamin C in it so right off the bat you'd have to take three tablets to get the same amount of vitamin C that's in my supersede twenty two okay All right All right but I Want you to read some of the ingredients\nAll right so this one has a vitamin C. well just one type of score but gas it right it's so it's a single type of vitamin C. okay then it has ... now cellulose as ground up newspaper\nAlright the next one is uh vegetables Sterritt Ghassan now that's an oil all over again so the pills come out of the machine when they form a and the next one is a silica silica sand sand like the beach\nAll right so here's another one try this one here okay so this is a national brand here right right so it was just five hundred milligrams okay this is a true of all yes All right so take a look at the ingredients okay um first and granted a sucrose sugar okay ... sugar sodium a score right\nThat's a form of vitamin C that's attached to salt so now you're getting sodium right vegetables Derek acid that sat lubricant again and empty and see yellow number six there you go number six so now that's artificially colored vitamin C. now what what makes your formula to supersede twenty to form a different\nFrom these that we are talking about well what's different about is I use twenty two different

drink it down as water soluble goes right to work in your body and it has\nThe proper amount of vitamin C. per survey there's Fifteen hundred milligrams per serving ... there's nothing else on the market like it I've done tons of research vitamin C. has over a hundred thousand studies and it's really survive the test of time what do these studies suggest what are they saying\nWell I'll give you I'll give it a couple of headlines this study was conducted at the University of California and it found that people who took vitamin C above the RDA above sixty milligrams increase their lifespan up to six years\nThey also found that death from cardiovascular disease were reduced over forty percent ... study reported in the international journal vitamin a nutrition\nConcluded that when you have high concentrations of vitamin senior system blood pressure comes down ... here's another study according to the American Journal of epidemiology\nPeople that had more vitamin C. and their diets had greater lung volume and they measure lung volume by Mila leaders and so those who increase their vitamin C. every day had an increase of twenty two millimeters now that's a lot especially if you're an asthmatic a smoker\nIf you're someone that has allergies when you get the lung volume up you get more oxygen in your system our energy that's just been vitamin C. wow\nNow earlier you you talked about the connection between vitamin C. and weight loss how does that work\nWell this is kind of groundbreaking research on vitamin C. and weight loss but what happens is vitamin C is a natural appetite suppressant and it also increases your metabolism and your energy when your energy goes up yeah you start feeling better you go out and take a walk let's burn some of it off\nThanks Chris rates have you with you\nSo let's get right into this whole stress issue you know stress is such a normal part of our daily routine these days but why should we be concerned about it and more specifically what's going on in our bodies and one of the warning signs that we should be looking for\nWell you know there's two ways to look at stress on is what we call mental stress on the other the other is how stress affects your body as a doctor I'm more interested in how it affects your body sure so the way stress affects the body is this a what a person's under stress the body transpose as the stress into tension and\nYour muscles end up contract and everyone feels that and they're in the upper ... right\nAt a doctor I'm more concerned about the muscles that you don't feel such as the muscles in the arteries oh that guy up and the muscles the heart is a giant myself over and the muscles in and around your digestive tract mhm because these are the things that are resulting in in a heart disease digestive difficulties\nAnd I want to talk a little bit of your show today about nutrition because there are two nutrients that completely handle the body in terms of stress okay now according to the research that I've been involved with it's it's as simple as calcium and magnesium\nCalcium and magnesium right okay\nWhen you're deficient in calcium and magnesium a lot of things can happen\nCounted magnesium for example is needed in order to go to sleep at night and how many people you know they just don't sleep well you wake up tired your body hurt more\nPretty soon it starts to wear down and pretty soon you get sick and you have a condition that people are suffering for pain and osteoporosis and fibromyalgia and cramped in their legs and we're illnesses so there's something wrong with this picture\nAnd it has to do it not how much calcium someone taking in their diet or how many calcium supplements or how many in Athens you chew it has to do with simple absorption is that calcium getting absorbed into your body\nWith calcium being something to do with stress isn't calcium for building bones well\nYes okay yeah and it does build your ... but you see one percent of the calcium actually circulates in your blood\nSo in that one percent starts to drop it could affect your heart your brain your kidneys your organs and your body shutdown actually died\nWow this is all one percent of the calcium always has to be in your system\nThere's two sources of calcium one isn't the diet you know and to us from the bones themself\n... absorb it back from the bones of ... that's right and I say\nAnd what you just discussed right now leads to one of the major causes of a condition that's affecting twenty five million Americans right now which is called osteoporosis right which is a weakening of the vault\nNow and it's due to the body deriving the calcium from the bones instead of from the ... tradition yep okay\nAnd so we have to do is we have to find a way to put calcium back in the diet now you think that would be really easy\nSure just drink milk\nJust drink milk or you know a lot of green leafy vegetables and that sort of thing but first of all people don't do that right and second of all the the quality of the calcium that comes from our diet has been decreasing in the last fifty years really yeah because things like pastures Asian foods are irradiated um the calcium as leads from the soil\nPeople are taking medications that block it so\nThe actual calcium is that being absorbed in the body okay and then you see people taking palms and calcium supplements you know they buy the health food store drug maker right but these things don't absorbing the by the time\nFor a couple of reasons one uh when you take a let's say an antacid that has the calcium in it like a ... first of all calcium does that absorbed in the body unless it's an anesthetic environment but see what happens when you take a tub with an antacid\nOh okay so even if you're getting calcium in the in the antacid itself is not being absorbed\nI see because it has to be in a in an acid environment for it to be absorbed\nExactly okay now we have a product called the ... formula\nMy comment formula it's natural and the differences is that the powdered and what happens is you put in hot water and you mix it up and you drink it down in a liquid instead of a pill\nAnd it absorbs into your system\nWow so that sounds that problem that well\nYeah because when Cal the magnesium earn a liquid state it absorbs ten times better than in any other state\nWow that's great matter of fact yes I'm I'm reading the can right now says a fenced absorbing calcium and magnesium beverage powder\nWell it comes down to absorption one of the way to tell if you're not observing calcium is take a look at what drugs are taking are you on high blood pressure medication do you need something for your kidneys or you want pain medications you need sleeping pills because the calcium and especially the menu is being absorbed ... you're not going\nTo suffer from all these things my combat formula does absorb incredibly in the body the thing is is that what do you take my comment formula but not like well well I feel better I have thousands of people ready to Dr pain 'cause I Can't we're thirty minutes after I took the ... the pain in my wrist went away or I was able to sleep for the first time in Iraq I mean this is really amazing\nI Want to take a moment here to let you listeners know that if you want to get a free book about calcium and magnesium and try

I'd like to talk for a minute about how the magnesium\nFactors in I mean uh I'm starting to understand about the calcium but what does magnesium\nOr we're talking about stress and we're talking about stress affects the body and first of all in order to function at all your body needs magnesium it's probably of all the vitamins I could list magnesium is probably the most important vitamin on the planet right now\nI've not heard a whole lot about magnesium ... why is made me seem so important\nThere is over three hundred and twenty five bio chemical reactions that mechanisms involved with it it's almost like a hormone wow and for example if it was low levels of magnesium your heart won't\nBeat who very important factor in life you would say so in\nFact let me just read a list of some of the conditions are associated with magnesium deficiencies okay um you have\nAttention deficit disorder Alzheimer's or anxiety asthma autism chronic fatigue syndrome congestive heart disease caused the patient diabetes fibromyalgia high blood pressure insomnia migraine headaches multiple sclerosis muscle cramps\nParkinson's osteoporosis and the list goes on and on and on\nAnd this is this is associated with a a lack of magnesium in the money\nSimply a lack of magnesium bully too so it's nothing that really mess around with now what happens is that you need that many of them in your body in order for the calcium to be absorbed\nOh so it's it's a necessary thing in order to get the first component which is calcium\nThat's right they work in combination with each other about there's

edition of the memories in hell on your host Chris McKay and I'm really glad you're with me today because they were going to be talking about an issue that affects each and every one of us and that stress\nAnd believe it or not whether it's job stress financial stress family stress or even the little things that were told not to stress about\nAny form of stress takes a serious physical toll on your body\nBut don't worry because there is something you can do about your stress and joining me today on the phone is Dr Michael ... and Dr ... there's going to talk about stress and give us some great information on things that we can do to reduce or even eliminate the negative effects of the daily stress has on our bodies\nFor those you that may not know Dr Parikh is he is a nationally recognized authority on natural an alternative health he's worked with top Hollywood celebrities professional in Olympic athletes and he continues to be involved in the latest research into today's top health concerns that Dr ... thanks so much for being with us today\nThanks Chris rates have you with you\nSo let's get right into this whole stress issue you know stress is such a normal part of our daily routine these days but why should we be concerned about it and more specifically what's going on in our bodies and one of the warning signs that we should be looking for\nWell you know there's two ways to look at stress on is what we call mental stress on the other the other is how stress affects your body as a doctor I'm more interested in how it affects your body sure so the way stress affects the body is this a what a person's under stress the body transpose the stress and the tension\nAnd your muscles end up contract and and everyone feels that in their in their upper ... right and the doctor I'm more concerned about\nThe muscles that you don't feel such as the muscles in the arteries oh that guy now and the muscles the heart is a giant myself over and the muscles\nIn and around your digestive tract mhm because these are the things that our results in in in a heart disease digestive difficulties\nAnd I want to talk a little bit of your show today about nutrition because there are two nutrients that completely handle the body in terms of stress okay now according to the research that I've been involved with it's it's as simple as calcium and magnesium\nCalcium and magnesium right okay\nWhen you're deficient in calcium and magnesium a lot of things can happen\nCounting magnesium for example is needed in order to go to sleep at night and how many people you know they just don't sleep well you wake up tired your body hurt more pretty soon it starts to wear you down and pretty soon you get sick and you have a condition that people are suffering for pain and I feel roses and fibromyalgia\nAnd cramps than their legs and we're illnesses so there's something wrong with this picture\nAnd it has to do it not how much calcium and taking in their diet or how many calcium supplements or how many ... it has to do with simple absorption that calcium getting absorbed into your body\nWith calcium being something to do with stress isn't calcium for building bones well\nYes okay yeah and it does does your ...\nBut it's the one percent of the calcium actually circulates in your blood\nSo in that one percent starts to drop it could affect your heart your brain your kidneys your organs and your body shutdown actually died\nWow this is all one percent of the calcium always has to be in your system and there's two sources of calcium one isn't the diet you know and to us from the bones themself\n... absorb it back from the bones if neither that's right and I say and what\nYou just discussed right now leads to one of the major causes of a condition that the fact and twenty five million Americans right now which is called osteoporosis right which is a weakening of adult\nNow and that's due to the body deriving the calcium from the bones instead of from the ... tradition\nYep okay and so we have to do is we have to find a way to put calcium back in the diet now you'd think that would be really easy\nSure just drink milk just drink milk or you know a lot of green leafy vegetables and that sort of thing but first of all people don't do that right\nAnd second of all the the quality of the calcium that comes from our diet has been decreasing in the last fifty years really yeah because things like pastures Asian food they're irradiated um the calcium as leads from the ...\nPeople are taking medications that block it so\nThe actual calcium is that the un absorbed in the body okay and then you see people taking toms and calcium supplements you know they buy the house which started right are great but\nThese things don't absorbing the by the time\nOr a couple of reasons one uh when you take a let's say an antacid that had the calcium in like a ... first of all calcium does not absorbed in the body unless it's an anesthetic environment but see what happens when you take a tub\nWith an aunt at that oh okay so even if you're getting calcium in the in the antacid itself is that being absorbed\nI see because it has to be in a in an acid environment for it to be absorbed\nExactly okay now we have a product called the count max formula\nMy combat formula it's natural and the differences is that the powder and what happens if you put it in hot water and you mix it up and you drink it down in a liquid instead of a pill and it absorbed into your system\nWow so that sounds that problem that\nWell yeah because when calcium and needs emerge liquid state it absorbs ten times better than in any other state\nWow that's great matter of fact is I'm I'm reading the can right now says offense to absorbing calcium and magnesium beverage powder\nWell it comes down to ... one of the ways to tell if you're not observing calcium take a look at what drugs they're taking are you on high blood pressure medication you need something for your kidneys or you want pain medications you need sleeping pills that the calcium and especially the easiest being absorbed mhm you're not going\nTo suffer from all the things my comment formula does absorb incredibly in the body the thing is is that when you take my comment formula\nNot like well well I feel better I have thousands of people ready to Dr pain 'cause I Can't believe it thirty

into the sermon today first the battle is supernatural dog has promised to Jesus Christ and to David\n\nThe devil as promised it to the ... there is a war between light and dark mesh over the city of Jerusalem what is the basis of the battle\nEach of them have earned the title but each of them have this thing in common they earned the title based upon how they responded to struggle\nHow can we crown someone a champion unless we've seen them struggle and overcome to be a winner how would we know the valor encourage of a warrior unless he's endured the adversity of the battle\nHow will we know who the wine or is it less trouble breaks out and all they do is complain how do you know what the whim is until you see them put\nTheir faith in fear and ignore problem hoping somebody else is going to solve it\nThe reason that I Choose these four characters is because I Believe that they all have something in common with each and every one of us and that is in this life you will have struggled\nJob set it surely is sparks fly up words so it was a man born the trouble there is no shortage of struggle in this life\nOn the news and all you're going to hear them report on his struggle there's the global conflict the economics\nI'm flick the political conflict there's all kinds of struggles great and small in this world\nSome of you in this place today are struggling with questions but you need an answer to and you don't know where to turn others of you are struggling with me then you're not sure how they're going to be provided for others of you're struggling with problems that you're starting are\nToo big for you to solve this live there is going to be struggling when they come what\nWill you do what role will you play well you engage like the warrior will you come plane like the Weiner will you ignore it like the wind or will you be what God created you to be which is the winner you were bought with the blood of Jesus Christ\nSo that you could stand in the sanctuary today and declare\nWho gives me Frank [noise]\n\nThis morning we're going to look at what God can do with a warrior\nLet's read Hebrew Sullivan's verse thirty two together if\nYou're there say amen and what more shall I say what time would fail me to tell\nA get in and Morocco\nAnd Samson and Jason also of David and Samuel\nAnd the process who's through faith some do kingdoms word righteousness obtained promises and stop the mouths of lions heavenly father\nLet the word of God in this sanctuary today encourage and inspired those who are here and those who are watching\nThat the battle there in belongs to the lord and if they are willing to take him at his word they will be crowned conquerors in Jesus' name\nAll of God's Children said praise the lord you may be needed [noise]\nYou were born to when\nWhen you came to Christ Jesus in face the Bible says all things had passed away we hold all things have become new\nSo regardless of what you came from prior to the knowledge of Jesus Christ in your life that day you received him through faith by faith you were born\nTo in this is what Jesus said in the Bible and he said have\nIn God\nWhat are we just read in Hebrew is eleven and thirty two it says what more shall I say of these men who by\nSubdued kingdoms stop the mouths of lions and\nObtain great victories for God judges is a great book for us to turn to see the topic of warriors winners Weiner's and whims why because they're all they're\nNot only is judge is a great place for us to turn and look it happens to be the place that he Bruce eleven thirty two is referring us to get in was a judge for Iraq was a judge Samson was a judge we're familiar with Samson but Gideon was a judge who defeated\nThe ... when God introduces us to get in the angel of the war goes to get in and says behold mighty man of valor the lord is with you and get in goes well it God's with me then how come he's not moving\nBut if an angel standing in front of you calling you a mighty man of valor and telling you God is with you what are you whining about\nHe Bruce chapter eleven it tells us what about Iraq what about the guy he was a wimp Bob told him Brock do fight general Cicero\nNow Cicero had the largest army of chariots in the Old Testament but God told Iraq go fight Cicero\nAnd you will win his dad didn't tell him go fight him his uncle didn't tell him go fight him his preacher didn't tell him go fight him the Bible says God told him no fighting now God told you to do something and you knew it was God who was telling you how many of you were pretty much believe it was going to happen\nBut you know in Iraq did he when\nHe waited until Deborah the profit is showed up and she looks at him and says God has already told you to do this\nShe she called him out\nAnd you know what he did he said I'll go if you go with me when [noise]\nSo Deborah looks at rock and she says let's go he was a winner but he started out as a wimp\nSamson he's a lawyer but he forgot where his strength came from and every warrior who forgets where their strength comes from I assure you will not win\nWhen we look at the book of judges not only because we see the parallels in personal lives we looked at the book of judges because we see the parallels in the world we live in today you said judges was a bad\nRut that the children the visual we're in and if you look at the world that we live in today in many ways we are in a pretty bad\nSo why do you do when you're in a rut\nFirst let's consider what happened whenever it came to the time of judges judges chapter to gives us some insight jeopardy too immersed in it says now when that generation had been gathered to their fathers what generation was the Bible speaking of it was speaking of Joshua and Caleb the young men who spied out the land who\nEndured the wilderness who conquered the promised land these two men were warriors for God Joshua told his generation if it seems right to you to serve other dogs do do it but as for me and my house we\nServed alone he was a warrior and when that warrior\nDied the Bible says that another generation arose after him they did not know God nor the work that God had done in Israel\nNow the thing that you have to understand about this verse is it wasn't that they weren't ignorant of God it wasn't that these children the visceral\nKnow how great grandfather got out of Egypt and they didn't know how Joshua got across the Jordan they had\nAll of the reminders they needed there were twelve stone set in the Jordan River to remind them to do\nBut all the waters back to the right and left there was a pile of rubble at a place called Jericho that reminded them that God had brought those walls down with a shelf this generation knew who God was they just acted like God didn't exist\nWe live in a society who knows who God is we just choose to act like God doesn't exist\nWe know how God brought our great grandparents through a time of financial struggle in the great depression into an era of prosperity we've used the prosperity\nThat he gave to them to almost destroy ourselves\n\nWe know how the great generation fought for our freedom but now we've taken the liberty to they defended and we've used it to almost destroy the country we live in\nHow\nBecause we don't know who got is we've just behaved as if God doesn't exist\nWe've forgotten where our blessings come from we've forgotten that we are the shape of his pasture and that he is the lord our God we have forgotten that thing's great and small things\nGood come from him the food you eat God did that the house you live in God gave that the strength you have to go to work and God\nCourted out on you the best you breathe God gives it to you the way your heartbeat God designed that [noise]\n\nThe time of the judges was not only a time when people forgot God but\nMen were a law unto themselves and therefore there was no law whenever people cast off the truth of God's word lawlessness bounds and you look in the world we live in the day and we live in a lawless\nSociety the children of Israel not only suffered in social chaos but there was a tremendous political struggle does that sound familiar why was the political struggle because of the disobedience of the righteous\n\nDid he do his part yes but he did it in Jesus' name and you have to do the same no matter the conflict you have a choice to make me a warrior\nAnd a winner or a Weiner whim [noise] but God can do great things with a warrior\n\nWith every head bobbing every I closure in this place and you say past or there's a conflict in my life a conflict I've been ignoring a conflict I've been struggling in a situation that I Need God's help to get out of and today rather than wine or women out I Am going to make the choice\nTo be a warrior if you\nOh what that conflict isn't you know you won God's help I Want you to raise your hand right where you are\nNow I Want everyone in this room to repeat they're sprayed with me Lord Jesus Christ\nToday I thank you for your word because it is alive is powerful\nAnd it can set me free today I Choose to be a lawyer for the king of kings believing that the battle lime in belongs to him\nAnd the victory is mine is sort of Chrysler lord\nNow I Want you to take a moment until the lord about the battle you're in if it's in your finances say lord I released this problem in your hands\nIf it's your physical body say father today I'm receiving healing in my physical body if it's in your family if it's an unsafe loved one you give God their name and say they're on the wanted list because I Want them in the house\nOf God to be part of the family of fate no matter what it is you need to know God already knows that God already has solved it and he's\nWaiting for you to execute your battle playing in Jesus' name\nSo today in Jesus' name received the victory\nIn Jesus' name here comes a breakthrough in Jesus' name\nYour house your children

following the earthquake and tsunami you're listening to ABC News [noise]\nAll right good morning it's a beautiful Sunday Morning out\nHere and I say it out here because I'm sitting out broadcasting it ...\nI got to start out by telling you about our friends\nOver at Fox farms and of course panic so they wanted the dealers on Fox farmed products so if you're looking for the bales of that smart natural happy frog product if you're looking for the small bags they're fertilizers just about anything that a Fox farmers make say carry over here at ... they're really stepping up since we've lost some of\nHer other organic suppliers talks farms those natural and organic products lots of different\nThings especially fertilizers based on things like a leather male feather male all the good organic agreed yet very few years but absolutely top quality things for vegetables thanks for flowering plants\nAnd then of course they've got the cultures of compost I Love their core base products things like their cocoa local products\nA lotta people tell you they are some of the finest soil so that they have ever used Fox farms is a nationwide company big company been around for a number of years now you get to see more and more of their products showed up throughout San Antonio because well lots of folks getting interested in or organic Fox farms is providing a lot of great things but it comes to\nThere's absolutely no reason to wait your tree will be able to use that as soon as possible and so I Would fertilize immediately and like I say I've been like to put a little bit in the bottom of the whole\nProblem more real quick almost saying are on the uh composting over your girls so I was going to do it over buffalo grass or would you recommend putting that down quite shortages lead with law under the way I have kept it\nThe [noise] before you put the compost over\nI it doesn't really make a lot of difference um you know you probably want to be sure your compost is fairly dry and as long as it you know kind of settles down around that you don't want to bury\nA your native grasses anymore and you do ... so you're only going to work and put down a quarter to happen\nAnd so I don't see any reason to cut it off and he's shorter than that I just uh I like taking that heartbreak that grass re flip it over so that flat Mars there and just regular back and forth until it settles down around the grass and it'll be the the best thing you can do for weight control in drought tolerance next year\nCrave Patricia\nMuch hair salons smugglers or polish or take it out and you take it out a good deal of work but it was a good time of year to do it so I always called me if you have any\nQuestions they'll have like a very nice move along and talk to Patrick Patrick\nYeah I have two questions the first one I have some in gold a peach trees and I'm Wondering a soil amendments I should do at this time of the year they did really well last year and I think we ... them a little bit too much though but it's got a full head of hair this year of\nOcean [laughter] well what you want to do of course is more thinning them pruning I like doing it in January when the leaves are often you get a better look at what the actual\nLimbs structure is as far soils go I definitely would be put down some good organic fertilizer and uh I'd\nI don't think it's possible to have too much mulch over the root zone not right up against the Trump out over the root zone if you add an extra inch or two of ... that's always great but that's all on earth I Would worry about doing as far as soil improved but\nUh or soil amendments said just be a little more mulch on the surface [noise]\nIt doesn't really matter when you put the fertilizer down but given a choice I think it's better put fertilizer down first and then put mulch on top of\nIt okay the second question I have is about ... farmers' almanac or I taught at all or is that and a little bit of history on it\n[laughter] well it's been around since Ben Franklin five I think and they use different things than showy say our our modern meteorologist new forecasting weather and whether trend\nI Would say they are somewhere between eighty five Ninety percent accurate or realize they give a very generalized forecast not real specific forecasts but\nIt seems to me like our most of our our\nPeople attempting to forecast whether I'm trying to find a nice to acceptable way to say this don't do any better jobs and they do a uh in my job with ground water district we consult with a good meteorologist and he's smart enough to just shrug your shoulders and say we just don't know sometimes so\nI Would uh you know it's just you know agriculture is just legalized gambling is all is said and uh I don't I I Would always look at several sources but I think the old farmers' almanac\nHas some useful information in it and I think it's right about as much as the weathermen are but I just uh [noise]\nUm ... they're certainly not a hundred percent is not the Bible as far as you know what what goes on so I I think it's a very useful thing to look at\nBut a common sense and look at it in a number of different forecasts and sometimes I think he just practical you end up flipping a coin to decide whether it's going to be a wet or dry weather or cold weather or warm water but ... is interesting and I ride a surprising percentage of the time\nYeah I've got a friend that's got a ranch in Colorado and there are asked other than the uh he was telling me that the farmers' almanac was predicting a huge snow dumped for them this year\nAnd I went out and bought it and I read it and I'm scratching my head and I'm going I'm asking myself what formula that they used the term\n[noise] oh it's in it's much of it is folklore but you know that's not the knock things had been around for two hundred and fifty years in this country and even longer and other times and say that would be contrary to what\nWould you would expect the national weather service disabled because I think they are in agreement that we are likely to move into an El Nino pattern\nA which involves things like the ... oscillation in the western Pacific oscillation things going on way out in that part of the ocean and in an El Nino pattern typically\nThe inner mountain west is drier and we in the south are wet or so or a few I think that if the if the national weather service for forecasting they would say lighter than average snowfall so\nYou know take your pick I sincerely hope because I was up\nIn Wyoming what three weeks ago and all the ashes poor people are so dry and fired for such an issue I Hope they get dumped on how to get record snowfall this fall but um I maybe it will maybe it won't die I'd really have looked\nAt it what the almanac said for [noise] you know the the Rocky Mountains but I'm I'm Glad to hear their at least give me a good chance of heavy snow fall 'cause they sure do needed [noise]\nAll right well I sure appreciate it thanks low\nPay it's always a pleasure Patrick I appreciate the call this morning [noise] let me get a little break at all the way here and then we'll talk to Richard in St Louis and we'd probably have other people holding me but uh [laughter] I've ...
