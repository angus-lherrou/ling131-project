what is her\nReally appreciated your advice over the years and what I followed what you said it's worked out\nBut now I'm like oh well I've certainly relieved to hear that\nI ever an issue where I Am just simply have too much ... uh-huh\nThat uh you know the formula that you can as you said it's just below spray and kill it and but I don't remember what the formula is well it was\nOf all keep in mind that uh it just kills that it doesn't make a jump out of the tree so you got to be looking at a lot of ugly dead ball moss up there if you go after it that way the product is just simply baking soda\nAbout a fourth look out the baking soda to a couple of gallons of water and sprayed all the ball moss will effectively kill it now you don't want to overdo it you don't spray and all the time because uh you know baking soda has a lot of sodium in it\nAnd so the bicarbonate is just what you're looking at there and so the affective time the most effective time to do it is normally in the spring when the ball bosses an active growth it of course it's not a pair of ... technique ... and the time that is\nMost sensitive time of the easiest to feel\nMost years is going to be some time that march April May\nPeriod where it is an active growth now this has been as everyone copy is leaking see up pretty weird year as far as whether his grown and it is putting on some active growth right now we had such a long drive period from\nWell basically the first new through August of the year it was so dry and then when we started getting wet in September\nThe ... resumed a bit of growth so you will get at least some success in spraying it right now all of this is like I say this years three elaboration but\nAt the very best time to spray will be to wait until march or April of next spring of following some rainy period that's when it really comes into his most active growth face and that's when the baking soda will do the best job with yell at it\nAs it was quote a joke that was the water right just lay low ... like\nYou know good old cheap old cater to the grocery store baking soda and um and it will do a job against it in the past people have used some copper base fungicides and things like that if we were effective but also very very toxic a copper is just in anything beyond just trace amounts\nOpera can be very toxic the baking soda seems to work\nVery nearly as well and of course is much much safer only time he ever got to have issues is um you know if you overdo it down but really\nAre usually one spraying is enough to do it and that's not going to put enough additional sodium in the soil because any issues at all\nOkay Bob really appreciate your help and I think I Know what might as\nWell you get out and enjoy ... gonna be a nice warm day to get out and do things like that a couple of days now you're going to be wearing a jacket if all your work and so be a great day to work on it\nIt sure has built nice to have the cooler weather\nI'd

not making much I'll buy in so uh it's we're good\nOkay good or you had a caller last week on your show right at the end of the show that was talking about using essential oil at cedar for\nWell I'm just curious because I had bought some and I I don't have said her favorite particularly but I just buy a number of said jello else because I think they smell pretty you know like\nI ... and they do a lot of good things yeah\nWell one of them is called Texas feet or oil ...\nAnd I looked at it to see what I mean I have one I liked the fragrance fright and then it it it says it's June ...\nCano parentheses Texas ... for ... uh uh would you know tightened said it will just wandering would that be it smell like cedar is that that is that the one from here are not\nWell is not the one from here it may be the one from South Texas and less attacks on them have gone on change names that I'm not real sure why they would never Virginia ...\nIs the er or juniper further actually I I was the one that we have most of here uh Virginia and as the east Texas sci is the one we have in the hill country\n... I'm not familiar with I Would suspect the it's a variety or a very close relative ... which has a name would imply may just be from South of the border so um it uh I I\nI don't know how closely related they are I Would think that if one helps to build those you know helps to reduce that antigen antibody reaction that causes the cedar fever symptoms\nIt gets any state route and the stars of all all all the other trees are green back up a little bit of rain\n\nIt or is it a chance at all\nWhen the leaves turn brown did they stay attached to the tree or does it come tumbling down\nA I'd say probably sixty percent are still attached\nAnd it's not a good sign I'm\nYou know it's when when a tree get stressed and a drops his sleeves browns and drops his leaves is just ... more shirts being transferred out through the ladies tree chemically sensitive hey I'm not taking any water up I Can't afford to be giving up this water\nSo it drops a high percentage of its sleeves when a tree just when the leaves turn Brown in state attached that's a sign that you know that that would is probably totally dead and postal service wimps to begin with her not nearly as strong and hearty a tree is a\nLive okra baroque or some of these other show\nI unless as posing a threat to your home your vehicle's things like that not gonna hurt to leave it a little bit longer and see but I'm I'm I'm less than fifty percent or when it comes to optimistic that is going to come back out\nYet it's kind of goes to the house probably ... feet away at a town with boys but also lifestyle where it's going to fall but I'm just up and see if I can get some of the classes that are ... that sort of follow the other way I\nDo with it if you decide to have you decided to START I mean ... living it up as they call it taking off some of the lower limbs is not going to\nReally heard anything and I think it would probably be a good idea and I think you can judge pretty well when you start taking off those lower lambs if you find nothing but Dr brittle would you might as well go ahead and take the whole tree out because like I say post oaks are just\nThe kind of like red oaks there are there the wimps of the old world and that if it gets to dry they die if it gets too wet they die they just uh\nYou know they're just I had a a ... a sheep order up in Scotland one time tell me\nA a sheep is born with but one ambition and that is to die the things\nThey have so many problems with and that's kind of way it is with post oaks where we've had an extreme of either wet or dry a lot of just fold up and die and when they when the leaves turn brown and stay on the trees\nIt's not a good sign it also at the very minimum I Would take some of those lower limbs off that would limit up if you find nothing but Dr brittle would when you do that you might as well go ahead and take it out\nIf on the other hand you find you know green soft tissue or don't be in a hurry to take it out or I Would wait until next spring when things would normally bought out before I totally gave up on it but uh if you if you take off those lower limbs and find them dry ended and brittle it think it's time for new tree\nLet's think it'd be next spring that with all the rain the soil getting pretty ... I didn't want to lose a the roots get weak and fall over\nWell I'm with you a hundred percent that's not a monster history but that's a big enough tree to do some damage to start out on those Orlando see what you find if you have any more questions called me back but uh\nI'd I'd make that judgment if the tree is alive at the lowest part of the tree is going to be the part that retains the most life if you limit up if you take off some of those lower limb some find nothing that driver would I think you might as well go ahead a plan on turn it at all into firewood\nOkay I got one more if you got to go right ahead a\nSign that get grass or that's growing up in the area that I Want to um instead of just like a chemical spray to kill that gas like the ... is there a organic was\nAbsolutely a strong vinegar a world any vinegar but the stronger the better or two ounces of orange oil ... uh I think Medina packages best orange soil around two ounces orange soil to a gallon of vinegar\nWill kill things grass especially will feel very quickly I mean you'll see results literally within minutes I wouldn't spray it while it's raining but when you can count on the grass being dry for an hour or so after you spray that will do is get a job is any chemical weed killer out through a whole lot safer\nIt it does it hurt trade or any of the players that are in touch with her\nOr any green foliage you spray it on will burn but it's not going to go into the roots and cause any long term damage the way so many the synthetic chemical products to\nGreat cry\nEye Harry what I'm going to be working round plants that I don't want to ... to damage I just carry big piece of cardboard folded up to keep the spray from hitting those plants in that way I can kill the grass and weeds up within you know five inches of the rose bushes without worrying about it at all\nIs great that's what I was looking for okay thanks so much of\nAlways pleasure Kenneth thanks for the call go buy it All right up to Bernie it's James turn to James\n... we get that one right this try this one more time good morning James\nLord ... neurosis or how about yourself I'm great I have two big raised beds in my yard\nThat that has slips in it okay let's get rid of that\nWell this well over the winter months\nThat drips exist and the larval stage in the ground and January February Ifill sprayed with a beneficial in the toads live beneficial nematodes that will take care of the thrift style going back to the old and he grows emporium where you know trips or a big issue on roses\nRobbie one year sprayed the beds and reduced the trips to the next year she sprayed the bed to maybe twenty feet out into the grass areas around them\nAnd totally eliminated the trip so I Would definitely put that on your calendar for mid winter in the meantime drips do not like garlic and if you have plants where you have an issue with trips or\nYour state good garlic spray will normally totally suppressed them\nPerfect thanks Bob\nAnd whip the garlic spray early in the day they stole bottles or the openings in the leaves of the plants that's where you know the garlic is taken up and actually spread through the whole system of the plant\nSo just spray early in the day with your garlic and that'll take care of on your flowers but I Do plan on making even told apple late at application midwinter and that should really put you in good shape for next spring\nThere yet like so much\nAlways a pleasure James ... called this morning we'll talk again what a gravel I Do it right now we'll be right

TSA and em on oh seven one\nAll right well are going to start out with the Ronnie and then it's gonna be window and Suzanne and John and let's just get\nStarted billboard and Ronnie ... more than sir\nI had a question about um tobacco mosaic virus on peppers okay [noise] um I don't exactly know how it happened but I'm suspecting that I'm\nOn a a sheet to temper that I was going a is where it started and Elise got all kinds of critically and um [noise] I look like\nI'm a stained glass window in a way they were still mostly grain but had yellow spots in\nAnd whenever they would produce blues the blooms would immediately turned yellow and and ...\nAnd well that's yeah that's that's bad I've not seen that much to them a tobacco mosaic virus on she chose the shirtless shade on a lot of ... but uh uh what time of year\nI'm I'm I uh I got these from seed from a pepper Joe's uh-huh and I agree with them I'm starting in I guess I started um on march\nSo they were pretty good size and I'd given some away and those are those I gave away to other people are doing well but uh this particular one um [noise]\nIt just kinda languishing there and I've sprayed it was a like hydrogen peroxide in it and that helps a little bit yelling at me he goes right back to a condition\nI you know problem with the most say viruses or whether it's a orchid most sacred the tobacco mosaic for their lots of different ones\nIs that they are spread by insects especially by the drips insects and right I Would um gosh that's that's one thing I think I Would probably not even put it in your compost pile when you pull it up this fall I think I'd go ahead and\nDispose of it along with your trash it is not a virus that remains in the soil so overly next year you'll be free of it now\nI'm not going to ask you if you're a tobacco user but people who do use tobacco products you can spread tobacco mosaic virus because his hand most all the tobacco products of any sort out there\nYou handle it you get it on your hands you go out and you're rubbing even picking on\nPepper plants and tomato plants and things just as one way that that tobacco mosaic virus gets spread around so\nUh if you have people who smoke or Jew or anything else or\nYou know tell them to wear gloves shrimp fish or plants or whatever because that's how it gets into a lot of different plants I have seen it mainly as a cool weather issue and peppers and it seems to go away with the heat but that sounds like\nThat uh you know your experience was a you know was a lot worse than that so I think if it does show up I'd start in with your hydrogen peroxide sprays\nPretty early in the season and try to get it under control because once we get in the hot weather it's normally not that much of an issue but you're never going to eliminate it I mean the ... the hydrogen peroxide seems to suppress it better than anything else we found but uh\nI don't think that in fact I don't think that even saved seeds from that plant technically the seed should be virus free but the viruses definitely going to be in the pepper itself the\nWhat is it they call the deal meant tell them that is a in inside of the pepper so I think I was very definitely get some fresh seeds are next next spring to start your peppers with that I Love that she she told and it's one of the easiest peppers to grow from seed but I think I'm looking at different speeds sources next year\nWell it's a it's funny you mentioned about the ah tobacco use a no one's been around it using tobacco and uh we don't smoke or shoe or anything like that and\nI never wanted them people but I'm Glad to hear that you've got the sense to do that so one of the things\nThat I Do is when I'm Out exercising in the neighborhood I kind of police the neighborhood and I'm I was thinking I uh I take a cigarette butts in our little trash bag not throw 'em in there and I was thinking I could probably picked it up from a cigarette ...\nTwo and a half that's a real good observation Ronnie and that's another thing that's a very likely things so uh\nGet yourself some little fan plastic gloves I apparently are good guide because a lot of good things but uh [laughter] you know she is a either wash thoroughly that's one thing you know a good uh and I'm not an anti bacterial ... they're just good old cleansing soap and water will take off your skin so uh\nIt it would be a real good thing to remember while you're out doing your your neighborhood policing for\nThose creeps out there that don't police after themselves if you want to know how really feel that subject anyway just just wash thoroughly before you work around your plants because you can't actually transferred tobacco mosaic virus that orchids in a number of other plants and uh once you've gotta you've gotta it's just something that like she'll always have to deal with\nBut it won't it won't be there next\nYear no sir no sir should not be there\nI you know the some of the other viruses are spread around by three ... and what happens is the virus over winters and some of her native grasses and I'm Talking about the curly top and the spotted will virus and some of these things to get on a tomato plants but\nUm I don't believe any of the native grasses will be a host of that so you're not gonna to the ah tobacco mosaic virus so don't think you're going to have to worry about coming back in that way\nWell already destroyed a several pots full I just through the dirt and everything away I put it in the garbage a well and you're right I didn't want to put it in the compost pile either\nYeah and and the fact that you shared the seeds or plants from the seeds with some other folks that did not have the problem that indicates to me that uh you know it's likely could easily have banned that you spread it back into the plant speaking up or other people's cigarette butts and things like that so I guess as scientists and well learned this year\nYes it is All right thank you very much\nYou know a good question and I appreciate the call thank you sir and came by All right let's talk do Wendell governing window\nOf a thank you Bob we have a lush is a fresh they planted palmetto St Augustine in a foot were okay and it's about four inches and I mean it is sick oh you're allowed to walk\nOn a ... a\nCouple of we do have some places in the backyard and out of course we're seeing the brown patches ha ha\nAnd uh they're spreading one's probably about three about three and then there's some little ones popping up one by one around the yard gives them a corn meal on yes we've been putting form little all those Bob out a couple of town with all you know the that now than we are going on vacation for a week\nAnd we're on both of ... a website and stuff and leave
