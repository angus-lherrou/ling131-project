some of the folks brought generators\nSo they've got heat out there although it's not really cold but you know some people find fifty five degrees a little bit nippy ... and they're just wandering around hanging out just kind of talking to each other very peaceful all good but it goes on for miles and miles and miles and miles and a ton of people there\nSo you remember when Barack Obama became the president he was a one term senator right Nate in past any legislation and do anything but just hang out look good had charisma sounded good wrote a couple of books about my my daddy having some dreams and all those kinds of things right\nAnd that was that was his claim to fame role but he looks so good and it sounds good and he's a what a rock star they had the media right saying\nOh bottles such a rock star Mr Obama you're such a rock star and do you remember when he would go out on the campaign trail women would faint remember that they would fight and then he would turn I go\nOut on the bottle of water another one said oh that was another up that was another oh there's another one\nLike ten people would find in a row and you'd have to get all these bottles of water that he just keep next to him on the stage so we can handle it remember all the while the media is trying to do that now with NATO I call her bra but because what he was in college\nThat's what he said don't call me Rob me don't call me back to I'm Rob I don't want to be called but that's that was in college\nBut now that he's running for a politician here and the great state of Texas He thinks he's going to win ...\nThere's going to hit sake you into thinking that he's a he's a a Hispanic or a Mexican he's neither he uses Irish is I Am and that's pretty darn Irish\nShe was here oh five nine nine fifty five fifty five so they took a microphone they went up to the capital and to the University of Texas and ask some of those folks up there who you're voting for they all said Beto\nAnd then they said so tell me one thing he's done\n... verse Ted Cruz and you had to make a decision right now who do you think you would support the Senate and I would probably vote for ... of what I Know that's when the ... are there any accomplishments in his career you can point to that would make him a good person for office\nOn I Am not aware of the line it's just amazing how much mention he has made learning complements debate does your point too I I don't know any so I Can't say any of that\nIs there anything you can point Jewish things to be like yeah he's accomplished today\nUm I think he's an accomplished like finally getting his name out there I honestly couldn't points anything I'm just trying to you know I'm not as a kid I Would like to be\nAny accomplishments of bitter or did you point you know I had the ... what are accomplishments debate of that you would point to\nAnd I mean he's been working really hard I I think again people because we are more aware\nSo there you go\nUm no I'm not as educated those are all people who said that they would vote for ... for for ... all those people that are so they're going to vote for him and when asked why what has he done was the one accomplish why I don't know I have no idea I'm not as educated as they should be I don't know where they resonates with young people well he's got his name out there well he's working hard\nNo I Can't name one saying then why are you voting for him if you can't name one thing\nWell because he looks good you know he works a lot of these always out there and he talks a lot and he's always out and\nAll that kind of stuff you see what's happening here right this is the cult of personality once again this going to get a guy elected just like what happened with Iraq Obama now I don't think he's going to win but there sure are going to pushing hard and twenty twenty for ...\nI think young people because we are more aware\nMore aware of what you're more aware of what\nA view yeah I guess so you gotta be kidding me\nHe resonates with young people because we're more aware\n[noise]\nTwo ten five nine nine fifty five fifty five your reaction to that and your reaction\nNow to the caravan that his marching toward the United states of America back on the day when there were seven to ten thousand people who were marching toward a sovereign nation carrying the banner of the nation that they just left they were met with incredible resistance\nWhat do you think the United states of America's response and resistance ought to be reopened the border as some Democrats have said and let these people come on end because they're just looking for a better life come on just open the doors and let 'em in or the president says they're not coming into this country\nJerry you're on K TSA betray go ahead Jerry\nHi Trey how are you today very well thank you sir and\nThank you so much for letting me say a\nQuote I notice no one else has said you know one thing about the Democrats I cannot stand is the\nFirst civil order laws for there to protect us and our country and it seems like a they don't care these people that come in here legally\n... respect them or not and the one thing I've always said I don't mind anyone from any cut a country coming\nIn ours but do it the legal way respect\nOur laws and they never do that and when they come in here legally it seems like these um Democrats reward them for breaking our laws and as I mean\nThey should send them back and say hey who is you have a clean ... a background and everything comes through and do it the legal\nThat's all that so so yes Jerry we're a nation of laws we have laws that um are supposed to control our borders and so if you want to come here come here legally and don't try to over ...\nOn our system which is exactly what they're trying to do the president right now is tweeting about this as we speak he just said sadly it looks like Mexico's police and military are unable to stop the caravan heading to the southern border of the United states\nCriminals and unknown middle Easterners are mixed in I have alerted border patrol and the military that this was a national emergency and we must change the laws every time you see a caravan of people illegally coming or attempting to come into our country illegally\nThink of and blamed the Democrats for not giving us the boats to change our pathetic immigration laws remember them in terms so unfair to those who come in here legally that's what the president's talking about this morning it was a couple of tweets from him\nThe Democrats have in fact been presented with some new laws and they don't want to do anything about it they refused to pick up any new laws are not going to do anything about this\nBut what's happening here too is that you have both sides that have been lax in dealing with those issues Democrats and Republicans both have not been dealing with this issue for years\nBecause Republicans like cheap labor they loved the cheap labor\nAnd the Democrats course are looking for votes they love the boats and that's why we are in this position that we're in but you got a guy that came along its name was Donald Trump and he said our borders our nation is going to be respected you're no longer going to take advantage\nOf an open door policy you're gonna have to mind our laws if you want to come into the United states of America\nAnd that's exactly what we're facing right now now I think you could probably tell that there isn't going to be some great concern that violence is going to be\nA inside it and all this that they're going to be those are probably on that side who we're going to get here and try to get somebody from the military if they end up being involved\nSomebody from the border patrol if they end up getting involved in the somebody from the national guard they're involved\nTrying to protect them in other words get them to fire back or get them to fire at them or or something that's what agitator do when they go to a thing and these people clearly some of them are agitator is no doubt about that\nWe predicted as well\nThat there would be the uh aiding and abetting of the mainstream media Matt Gutman is there right now and guess what they're showing all the babies all the babies and all the women this is all about women and babies who are coming here for a better life\nThe women and babies are here and women and babies the poor babies with their fingers in their mouths they don't have anything to eat and they're bringing their children here for a better life and so on and so forth a that this was all about midterms for ... got men in an ABC and those people trying to make you\nThink that Donald Trump is the bad guy and the Republicans are the bad guy that's what they're trying to make you think on all this um no he is not the bad guy and the United states of America is not the bad country this is the good country but we are a country a nation of laws and they\nNeed to be respected when we come back we'll talk with you more about this went over to the phones to John By nine nine fifty five fifty\nFive [noise]\nThe Ramsey reality check is
