of this rain is going to start to lay off a little bit by the time we get there but it's all north of us right now San Antonio's in pretty good shape nothing like what we had yesterday that's for sure yesterday was a mess\nToday is certainly a little bit better but still some slick streets you got to deal with and certainly those cooler temperatures are out there as well two one zero five nine fifty five fifty five two one zero five nine nine fifty five fifty five\nDo you think we ought to tax businesses here to deal with the homeless population in the panhandlers in San Antonio and an idea that it's about to to be on the ballot in November sex in fact\nOut in San Francisco where all the stuff comes from may have come down there are there now known as a place\nFor aggressive panhandling they're open air drug use and sprawling tent camps in fact some of the streets are so filthy officials out in San Francisco have launched day special poop patrol or young tech worker has developed ... an apt to report crap on the streets just junk on the streets you know trash\nThe frail and sick or shoveling along in wheelchairs and San Francisco right now they stumble around sometimes have closed in the middle of the day and so now on the battle it out there they are going to put a a measure to tax\nBusinesses so that they can spend money to house the homeless and give them health care and showing the show for it\nNow you and I know how that works when you reward something what do you get you get more whatever it is you reward and show it looks like the mayor in San Francisco feels the same way that they are out there says listen we can't do this because\nWithout collaboration among other counties nearby all we are going to do is be taken out a magnet\nWhen you say we're going to feed you were going to house yah and we're going to get health care take care of you based on taxing businesses then the next thing you know they're going to come from all over the world oh look San Francisco's going to get me free food free health care free housing I don't have to do anything but show up\nLast year San Francisco spent three hundred and eighty million dollars on services related to homeless is not their\nCities all on the west coast are grappling with rampant or homelessness and panhandling and we deal with panhandling here in San Antonio so there is there a plan out there is to put taxes on businesses and give a all kinds of free stuff to those who are living in the streets right now well\nIf you give free stuff to people living in the streets you are going to get more people living in the streets\n[laughter] how that works [laughter] I'm into the mindset always is throw money at ... and we'll fix ... know when you throw money at poverty you create more poverty that's how that works\nAnd you get it's very simple you get more of what you reward it's that simple it's not even hard to figure out\nHeartbreaking story from Fort Worth Texas a judge is going to allow another week for parents have a nine year old Texas grown on my porch find a new facility for the ... for the child I say it's heartbreaking 'cause I mean the parents were in the situation of ... their child nine years old she's brain dead she's on life support\nAnd the parents want to keep her alive and I completely understand that and a judge is in here again now because the doctors want to take her off of\nA life support is really not a place for a judge to be a that's a decision the parents ought to make only the parents should make that decision based on their consultation with their doctors Wilkinson previously ruled the doctors that's the judge could remove the girl from life support yesterday afternoon but the parents appealed wants can\nAnd the parents said no a or the the judge said no you got one more week then to try to find another facility for uh your daughter so hopefully they're going to be able to work that situation out there and the parents would be able to find some peace in\nWhat they're dealing with with that situation six forty one out K TSA John you're on the TSA betray go ahead man what's up\nMan listen I was just talking about the homeless situation and you know what they said that it is it\nA shot I didn't they shouted Toyota was or stupid enough to elect liberals or ... or ... or socialists a liberal cesspool and that surely out of it and it will actually coming up\nThat was a big in turn that around ... or you can forget it is you saw all of a shock to Wall Street tour just love the liberal stretched the look of corruption and socialism\nSure I I call San Fran Antonio for a reason you bet that's the direction we're headed in San Antonio and if you look back at them at the past mayor's here\nAnd you could just take them off in fact there was a picture posted on Facebook the other day\nOf just the recent past mayors who early on and Phil and uh and and uh Henry and now Ron they're all there is not a conservative in the bunch not a conservative in in the anywhere to be found and the same thing is true of the city manager who actually runs the city's she's not a conservative either\nSo you know ... they sure they're going to put into effect there liberal socialist policies and that's one of the things that you get though when only Thirteen percent\nOf the population turns out to vote and and hardly any or other people who live in the typical conservative areas of town a stay at home this last election didn't turn out to vote at all and this was the result that we're living with it right now\nMichael you're on K TSA would trigger right ahead Mike\nYeah I have to agree with your awarding a bad behavior because I have noticed that direct correlation between the opening of habitat for humanity and an explosion there homeless population I'd never seen so many homeless\nWhat'd you say habitat for humanity you mean the the center downtown not habitat for humanity right\nYou know and I saw a lot of people that were like me that we're just not convinced about you know about those you know so you know what what\nWhat convinced you why why did you decide yes\nI think the city managers well overpaid for a San Antonio you know I mean it\nDoesn't take much to live in San Antonio well nowadays it is the taxes are going out and I just stay for her job that she's making way too much a shift too much power it's starting to turn the power back to the elected officials not to somebody who was appointed\nAlright well Pete thank you very much appreciate good ... good always going to hear from eight to ten five nine nine fifty five fifty five of had a number of email and in person request to go over these charter amendments\nA couple more times which I plan on doing an in depth than we have done since they were and now so let me just tell you a couple more times total more things about them so you're\nPretty much clear on on what they are all about a is going to make it easier for people groups organizations whatever to be able to bring about a petition to petition and change what the city government is doing at that moment are ... ... a decision that the city government has made\nSo instead of the did just make it real simple the bar's gonna change are you going to need fewer signatures and you can have a longer period of time to get those signatures\nTo turn back anything that the city council ducks okay now are the pro side of that is is that you have more control over your city government right that's the pro side of that and it's frustrating watching the city government do the things that they have been doing\nAnd so when when they're out there doing whatever they want to do and a lot of it is in direct opposition to what a vast majority of people want done and I've said since since they took that statue down that that statue was the was the dividing line and that was the started to all this the change in the Alamo the crosswalk all these things the city has done\n'em and and so as they continue to do that probably goes back to to the embryos well\nUh that the people are going to have more power but the other side will argue this is an outside\nBut now anybody is going to any any special interest groups any a union labor union as an example or any other special interest group will then be able to wield a greater control and greater power over city council\nAnd ultimately that would be a bad thing because Everytime you turn around a as some sort of labor organization or whatever would be able to put together enough petitions\nTo take the city government at a different direction show the people who are leading the city that were voted to leave the city this was the no side saying this but people that were voted to lead the city now they don't have any real power or control because it's up to whoever can get the most signatures and the and the amount of time the allotted amount of time to uh uh to run the city [noise]\nAll right that's a basically and I'm not sure I could go into more detail but we're not going to that right now\nA B is about the city manager and limiting not only the salary but the amount of time the city manager can serve now a lot of people in the city do not like Cheryl scali they don't like the direction that she has led the city\nThey don't feel like she has done a good job in the city when you look around the city people see weeds I see trash on the streets ac homeless panhandlers and stuff like that and they say wait just a minute\nWhat is going on we need a city manager who can run the show a whole lot better particularly since she's one of the highest paid and all of America and obviously the city's not being run very well on the\nIt's MORNING ... county detention deputy is on the
