here in the dark and uh but it's this is always a photo of edits always always great via down here\nYou can always tell by your voice well thank you [laughter] um I have a quick question okay um\nI was cruising my freezer to the other day and and discovered a couple of dagnesses corn meal uh-huh is it a good idea to put it on grass this can be ...\n[noise] if you have any sign of ground patch what so ever it would be a good idea to put out the corn meal\nIf you have had brown patch in a given area before I think it'd be a good idea to put it out the preventive rate is about ten pounds for thousand square feet curative rate is about Fifteen pounds per thousand square feet and uh\nThe core meals been in the freezer hits perfectly good it is that's where I store vine ah you know just keep the wheels and things out of it but what what kind of grass do you have and\nWe have a mixture okay and brand patch in a couple of years ago\nYeah I I think it'd be a good idea to put it out St Augustine is of course our most brown patch susceptible grass probably followed closely by jam or soy Shia but even the other toys used even the Bermuda is can get it\nWhen it is as wet you know I was looking at my I post on the ... laws or whether website\nAnd out of twenty days in October so far they're only been five days that I didn't have rain fall to post so ah let's just call it unusually moist and unfortunately that's what sets the stage for brown patches having cool my chin and wet days and a warm days so\nI Would think that any areas she'd chew of have brown patch and yes I Would go ahead and put some corn meal out other areas it's strictly up to you whether you want to go to the trouble or whether you want to wait and see organic yards are by nature less susceptible to brown patch but a year like this or we're seeing her that require\nOkay All right and it doesn't matter in there for a couple years doesn't it\nDoesn't matter if it's been in there for a couple of decades it's just fine I don't know if I'd be making car muffins out of it but it'll be just five or stop to ramp hedgehog as\nTo exactly [laughter] I think he said that\nYou always have a wonderful weekend ... thanks and [noise] All right next step is Neal governor to nail bomb hey get Martin sorry\nOkay you know I was uh uh my wife was talking about how to roaches in the house and ride in the past ... ah the the doorways\nAround here to the bottom was figured out and started to multiply and my wife's a little upset about\nThat the ladies and roaches well people at roaches don't don't really cold man goal to very well where where are you seeing the problems now\nA ... around and the kitchen and ah and some of the bedrooms but usually in the kitchen okay and what I ah my wife said there is a formula for that Bob says that we\nCould use a put some kind of ... down right but I Can't remember what it is\nWell it has all of courses ... about a half ... gas it and have sugar\nAnd ah you know the ants have also taken bark asset and mix it with a little bit of Crisco just plain old lard but um yeah Bork acid in in sugar is one thing that will normally draw the roaches and they just dying on a bit of that and that's pretty much the end of them\nYeah they got a pathway underneath a a lesser cabinets you know on a show that's that's the place I'm going to put them\nWell I think that's a good it's a good thing to do but also you know if there's anywhere they're out of sight out of any word you're going to be sleeping or vacuuming I Do go ahead and keep a little bit of a diet makes his earth out or places like under your refrigerator under your stove places like that\nI'm In fact there was a company for a long time package that under the name of crawling insect killer at all it was was a good grade of dive to ... earth than if you can kinda and and at one point they sold it in a little puff are shorter thing and um it's just I I just would make a point to leave it\nIn places again where you're not going to be sleeping where it's not really going to be visible I've got a couple of places in my kitchen that I\nJust um you know just leave a little bit of it out and knock on wood or it is taking care of the roaches most of the aunts and uh the occasional other crawling creature that comes in so that that's what I Would do and then where you have an issue with them or the ... sugar will do a pretty good job of it\nSo uh I you know don't don't worry about doing a foe tests on your little seeds that's only for some of the\nYou know really bigger things and really other than ... and things like that I really can't think of much of anything that would be applicable to so don't worry about don't worry about trying to float test on those guys\nWho care how how long how in the sea bass before it will full you ought to throw it out\nWhere that depends on how you have stored it if it's just been sitting you know in a on a closet shelf or something like that a couple of years two to three years what you really need to be doing with your seat that you don't use is\nPut them inside of a jar that you can screw it tightly on and do you put them in the refrigerator\nA man said will keep for Fifteen or Twenty years that way I mean you have ... percent German nation the first year you might be down to you know Ninety five percent the second year ten years out you might be down to eighty percent German nation but they've found seeds and the pyramids that we're still\nYou know viable so uh what you you know heat and ah and most humidity those are the things that cause well not to mention insect damage but those are the things that will ruin seed\nAnd by you know our our refrigerators these days are very very low humidity that's how we can have frost free freezers and so you don't want to just put your seed packages in the refrigerator like we used to\nYou want to put your seat packages in a jar\nBack to look on the shelf and my refrigerator there's more than one base in jar sitting back there with packages a seat in ... that you can keep your shape for several years without worrying about it\nWell thank you so much\nAnd it's always a pleasure good to talk to you and you have a good sign a good weekend banks than by [noise] alright well to the bottom of the board let's say good morning to George what's going on today George\n... bringing up the bottom of the board I guess\nWell here you know many Sundays at the time you call you would have been the first one in but uh and a nail in bend must have started dialing very early this morning so good to talk to you how can I help you today\nWhere a wall and make sure that uh heard you arrive last week and and don't do something I Can't take back but I think hers you tell a fellow who didn't have any tomatoes auto plants at this point\nIt would be better just to pull him up and put something else in the ground and I find myself in that situation\nWell you know what I always tell people is if you've got unlimited space in your garden you know leave a man until they freeze your till they're just no hope whatsoever for but\nIf you're limited on space if you don't have tomatoes by now the chances of you're getting tomatoes on big rooted varieties is a somewhere between slim and none\nI if I'm if you are growing the cherry tomato it's your chance of getting fruit office somewhere between unlikely it's slim or whatever because cherry tomatoes can still set fruit even when the nights get cooler but uh\nI think we're through with said much fruit on our bigger slicing type tomatoes so\nUm if that's what you've got out there and again if you've got a big garden and you can do all the other planning that should be doing without pulling them up you know you can go ahead and leave 'em and we'll see what happens but if you're limited on space I'd be pulling the tomatoes out Blanton broccoli or cauliflower charter\nYou know whatever whatever you enjoy the way of uh wintertime vegetables\nEither better boys or hadn't tried those before but yeah they're gorgeous class they just don't have any ...\nWell I you know we're supposed to be\nWarmer today but from the Knight temperatures get down much below Seventy they're just not gonna said much fruit and better boys good tomato I mean it's an old tomato I remember my grandfather growing that in his business but

promote awake for for whenever twenty five dollars off tomorrow sleep dot com [noise]\n\nBob good morning that free says are so I always learn from your retirement it's\nWell I appreciate your list in it even more appreciate your call at what's going on today\nYes there was a question about planting glass uh we moved on the side of sorts in there about a year ago okay so I'm not a house I had like the types of art at all which is just a clover grass and little wheat scattered so into\nI'm calling to see or do you recommend as planting a grass with a gun in the back yard I have a a scattering of oak trees in the backyard of the oak trees in the front yard or what would you recommend them to the best time to plan to do what kind of glass would you let them out [noise]\nWell you know you've got two ways to plant grass you can either planet by seed or planning planet from pieces of existing sod um this time of year\nThere's not going to be much you can plant other than a if you want a permanent grass you're going to have to go with saw because about the only\nRegular grass that we can plant from seed this year I'm perennial grass is going to be Bermuda grass and it's just gotten too cold to be planning for Bermuda from seed\nI Would you know I I Would work out a plan for what you want to use or how you want to use the whole yard\nI'm just not a fan anymore with water prices and water scarcity I don't you know I just don't think it's practical to have as much grass as we once did if there are places\nThat you would be happy with ground cover with lower maintenance and with lower water usage if you or your family want vegetable garden flower garden play area for kids grandkids things like that\nCome up with an overall plan\nFor literally every every square foot that yard and what you plan to do with it and decide how much grass you really want\nNow you know as far as the grasses you choose probably\nThe toughest hearty is grass that you're going to plant in sunny areas is going to be a Bermuda grass or the ... for Nineteen Tift green tiff way\nUh these grasses they use on golf courses in you know how much foot traffic they put up with and that is that's one of your ... for the sunny area\nAnd if it gets to the point that we just can't water like we should have in the summer months he will turn brown\nBut it will come back with a first rain the thing about Bermuda grass is always used to some extent is they can brown out but as soon as we get some more sure they will come right back my most of my yard and the hill country was totally browned this summer and now it's the thickest greenest luscious thing you can imagine\nBut uh in shady or areas you're only real choice is going to be saint Augustine I like uh my two favorite variety is one of us call palmetto the other is called del mar D. E. L. M. A. R.\nAnd St Augustine in many ways is the I think the best grass out there it doesn't get sugars and it it is has the longest screen the center of any grass\nThe big problem of St Augustine is if you have to stop watering it dies it doesn't turn brown and come back\nAt it you know it's dead so shady area is limited areas St Augustine still my favorite grass where you have bigger areas where you have good son and um you want to be able to cut back on the water if you need to\nUm my my first choice probably be one of the ... is my second choice will be one of the narrow ... either emerald or el Toro soy Shia\nThey're very good grasses but they don't stand up the foot traffic if you have once again if you have kids run around if you have dogs they will totally wear out so as you grass where is the ah differ meter will take it pretty well\nIf you don't have a lot of foot traffic um you know those are two more very good grasses emeralds oil Shia or the el Toro soy Shia they're very find blighted they're slow growing they don't have to be motives often but like I say their big drawback is just they don't take the foot traffic well\nI got ... appreciate that 'cause I can kind of get shoved up front in the back yard and get an idea where things are going to go and that way I like you're saying is hot or a more sunny spots in Bermuda and that was going to get some shade and smaller areas maybe some of the things\nThat would be I think the way to go let me tell you one other option here and if you say well I just don't want to pay the money I don't want to go to the trouble of buying sod\nThose areas where you uh have a lot of sun where you might want to plant Bermuda from seed you could always just over seat at right now with a little bit of one or the winter rise how go with one of the door for a variety says they shored\nIt German age in about three or four days when we've got this much moisture beautiful green all winter and then it dies out when it gets hot next spring so if you want to buy yourself a little mud free time ah you can do one of the winter rise in either the shade or the sun and then when we get the hot weather you could go with common Bermuda from seat but\nAgain it's just is tough it's just not as nice a grass not as compact in thick\nIs he a as a tiff type ... skin\nIt'd be planet from ... but if you say that's just too much to take on at one time just so someone arrive for this winter season and next spring will tackle this when it starts to warm up a bit\nI appreciate about they have assigned Saturday okay you do the same ... get to talk to you and thank you sir ... give us a\nLittle break here and then we'll get back to the phone calls I get to talk to you for a moment about my friends who knew earth's soils and compost and they want to remind you as I Do that it is cool it up now that you can think about putting a layer of compost over your guard\nNow that said bit of work to do hopefully find some good strong help to do it but I don't know of any one thing you can do that will give you a greener more wheat free yard next spring then to put a layer compost on on the fault not to pick somewhere between a quarter and a half an inch\nAnd let me tell you what Newark has the compost you're looking for the call up there in your compost it certified organic it actually has a little bit of Medina is growing green fertilizer mixed in with it\nIt's fortified with all of the great microbes I mean it's just the Newark makes their compost from so many different feedstocks it naturally has the

thousand years ... sycamore average life spans probably fifty sixty years\nBut I mentioned ... not a slow growing tree it's a very very fast growing tree takes a little bit more moisture to keep it happy\nBy then you know say in oak tree but it's when you're looking for shade yesterday\nI mean that it's the fastest growing quality tree I can recommend to you\nOkay a drink and then that here in

[noise]\n... birds of paradise three of them for\nThree years and I finally got to go in and everything else I had a cage around\nA jeep today are away from them and I started seeing these growing all over here I live on the west side of lake right a growing everywhere with no protection whatsoever so I sort of concluded that or maybe their view from the deer\nSo I took my cages all for just wipe them out completely\nOr have you know bunches just total branches will know leaves on so I Want to see if I can retrieve though somehow or another are reviving mother\n[noise] well we're getting late in the ... infidel the Mexican border paradise as a hearty plant my freeze the ground every winter and always come right back out\nNext spring so I don't know\nYou know how much growth you will get out of them this fall I mean I'm afraid to put your cages back you obviously you're in an area with just too many here\nBut um I Would protect them I'd hit him with a little bit of astro or\nYou know any kind of good liquid fertilizer and if he had little foliage on them this fall that will be good that'll help um store a few more nutrients for the winter months\nBut I'm not going to panic even if you don't because like I say they it's normal for them to freeze back I normally freeze back in December and then come out again and about April so um\nIt's not I don't think his hand of the world if we don't get more foliage on her but I think it would be good if we do since we seem to be warming up a bit but uh not a lot of really need to do other than just protect him and I'd like to say I'd hit him with a good liquid fertilizer like castor grower Fisher motion or\nA ... one of the uh ... makes a good liquid fertilizer there there are quite a number of choices out there\nYeah OK Margot where there was an answer I was looking for you all have a good rest of the day on\nHow well we'll do our very best and if you don't want to go to the trouble to uh you know get the cages back out there are some reasonably good deer repellents out there the last for three or four weeks at a time and like I say another you know probably another six weeks everything's gonna freeze back anyway so\nHour ride phone lines are full again can jak Robert and Suzanne in that order and uh let me tell you real quickly once again or if you\nWant to have if you don't want to grab yard this winter

run like LA gay oh hey you know got our garden for\nOur yard which was well established St Augustine on and all of our flower beds got maybe ten inches a mutt it it\nYeah what you do with it oh man [noise]\nWell [noise] age yes and no I'm\nEve do not want anything piled up around you know the trunks of your trees that we would call this a ... oil business how Mother Nature has built are more fertile soils over the millennia\nSo it's unfortunate that we get so much of it all at one time\nThe problem is with this stuff when it dries out is going to form a crust it's going to be\nNot real pleasant to deal with at first um [noise]\nI Would spray regularly with something like Garrett choose for something like Medina plus I'd be out spray in this uh this stuff that has washed in at least once a month what you're trying to do is stimulates the microbial activity you're trying to\nGet that loosened up because like I said it's gonna it's gonna get a crust on it is going to be a little hard to deal with at first a little bit of molasses either drive molasses or liquid glasses is a little bit cheaper\nBut you're gonna be spray and things like that on that to try to get away from that crushed you know to get it back to more of a workable consistency so to speak\nGiven that it's going to make great soil over time but it's just you're gonna you're gonna find that it's very fine is so difficult to deal with it first like say you do need to get it pulled back from the trunks of what he shrubs and trees that over time\nIs very very hard on trees especially but uh the main main challenge is going to be you know turning it from kind of just a very fine mud material to turn it into a decent soil\nAnd like I said molasses Garrett choose a Medina plus those are probably going to be some of the best agents to be using on it\nAnd how quickly ... the fact that Bush is a bad\nGuy in a couple of months and yeah oh yeah you've got a couple of months to do which you've probably got me into even longer than that but just all I can say is the sooner the better how I'm thankful hopefully your home was spared because of gosh we've seen a lot of devastation with us\nWith the right until you got three ... water in it oh my goodness [noise]\nWell it all you've got your challenges in front of you I certainly would I certainly would work from home first um but yeah it's it's not a big rush to uh you know to get your um your trunks exposed on the other things but just\nWhen you're tired of working inside and want to get outside and work on something you can do that if you uh find them on there that has an air spade when it dries out um you know a couple of guys with an air space can uncover\nA lot of trees a lot of shrubs and today's time and that is certainly the the lowest labor intensive way of doing it but uh\nJust my thoughts and prayers are with kids of my you know it you've got a challenge in front of you\nCan't\nGet appreciate the call and let's get Jack in here before the uh news break governor jak\nLaw on welfare how about yourself\nOr do I have a first off I Want to get a shot in our body I bought a a a for profit\nYeah a little powder on stuff but

concrete\nAnd clover actually works to build the soil\nRather than being you know just a noxious weed and when you get your soil in good shape the clovers going to go away on its own now\nIf you want to spot spray with vinegar and orange ... places where you've got over it will be dead in Fifteen minutes if we get a sunny day and of course at mixture is a gallon of vinegar and two ounces of orange soil added to it\nBut what I see covertly yard it's telling me that I really need to go to work on softening the soil and just like you know breaking down that ... we were talking about a minute to go a little bit of compost over the top of a little bit of Medina plows Garrett choose things like that\nOr get that'll thicken that St Augustine up and it will choked to clover out the ... ... doesn't like\nMore open lonely soil so are the main thing to work it is to is to work on building that soil and just you know good organic fertilizer layer of compost and a regular spraying with your juice a vet skin to soften the soil or for the ... going to go away on its own\nIf you're in a bigger hurry in a in a given area the orange soil vinegar will knock it out literally overnight\nArtists or

for whatever reason the city council just gave our\nWater purveyor permission to raise the rates without going for city council approval and a wire she's getting expensive I don't I don't understand people they're just they're just wasted for\nFor many many different reasons up a related question I had this morning that I wanted to ask you with all the rain we've actually had some pretty serious flooding uh up up around the Austin area and had to call her this morning\nThey've got about a foot of that uh this is on Lake LBJ of that mock\nThat tends to wash up when you get floodwaters out there and they were asking how to break it down while they're asking what the problems were and I was telling them first of all you got to get it away from the the trunks of your woody plants you got to get those roots lawyers exposed but\nYou know it it tends to crust so badly and ultimately will turn into good soil\nI told him about spraying it down with your shoes but if you had a situation like that where you'd had a lot of stuff wash in with floodwaters how would you deal with that to uh to get it turned into a better soil as quickly as possible\nWell now they got to try to answer that question I heard her ... back there yes staring at a higher well at\nFirst we deal with that quite a bit I've had people use ... to ... put in areas where they were planning on doing some landscaping and that's that's is bad or worse than what your caller was talking about it just it takes a while probably won't will speed it up\nMeasuring anything's hydrogen arts or\nYou know I didn't think about that yeah that would make sense\nYeah if you spray and drenched pretty good with hydrogen peroxide a one really good time and then just you know do like oh we talk about always use or any of the amendment to stimulate biological\nActivity uh [noise] the gear juice or if you use efficiency weed or something other than the ... to be sure that the vinegar to it in stride boasting ... thing and\nIt will come around it takes a while if it's a if it's a silky material though it just it takes a while for it to happen\nWell ed and the problem that a dive scene with it around here it's a ... material covered with a layer of very fine played just forms an M permeable you know crust on the top of it and uh\nI you know the the hydrogen peroxide does make real good chance I should've bottom that I Will certainly do next time and I like molasses too because it's such a good microbial stimulant but\nNo cable that's uh that's good I again it's just it's just been unbelievable uh this fellow set up even on you know LBJ is a constant level light that when they have so much water coming into it and they had three feet of water in their home and I've heard that from quite a number of people up in that area so\nKind of things we think about Houston having to have dealt with with Harvey last year um actually hit the hill country this year\nYeah uh there was some stuff in our paper this morning about the mole already starting to grow and different kinds of problems and just you know washing things why of hydrogen peroxide I think it was a great tool just all around spray on the wall spray in the house\nTo yeah you're going to\nDo some showing the some of the dangerous stuff and not big on as well as start to the growth of the new good stuff and uh so\nHow did everything work out with your home you had all the problems with replacing lines and things and I know you had a bit of a mold issue honored the home I did all that resolve a well for your time\nYeah it was an expensive big project because we had we had mold throughout the whole house but it's a it's under control and the\nSurface drainage and everything out front of re done and it looks like we eliminated the the problem I think you still there we we would have seen that kind of violence back and get started but it's pretty well sealed under the\nUnder the house surfer strategist faked and peroxide stuff was used you know as the final step here why put everything down and cleaning up any of the mold had gotten going in the house it's a it's an expensive project to do it but it works\nWell that's that's that's good to know and um\nI you know we always see well we see water damage or from other issues from plumbing lakes and have it in bed with fires and things like that where they are dumping water on earth to put fires out to get damaged or she rock and things but\nUm I guess there's no reason it wouldn't work even where you've got to have is not real serious water if he'd gotten a little bit of wet sheet rock and things like that hydrogen peroxide work\nYou know just as well there is a dose in our gardens and other places I Would think\nOh yeah it's great to kind of stuff so I heard I heard you talking about global with one of your listeners I Want to throw something there and I and I didn't know if you tried it yet or not if not you'll probably I'll look at it carrying that product in your in shades of grain but\nYou can knock out clover in ... and broadly slot they're\nBeautifully with a selective organic herbicides\nAnd which one do you like\nWell there's only one game all along crab grass killer it used to be called the garden weasel\nBright bright all I did not know that would work on a on a ... grade on crab grass and totally\nWrong with it on ... yeah I just wanted to bring it up and I was trying to find something on my computer and I haven't found it you have one of our listeners of several years ago actually sent me a homemade\nRecipe to make the stuff and it I'd made it work and I can't remember the exact\nThe portions offhand ... he used a ... task embark on and on and then put some sentiment in it I think he had a gallon of worth of you know one bucket full of a a\nPotassium ... put a\nOne cup of settlement in there and he said he put some term or in it too he was suspicious that it was in the commercial product and it worked it it's um\nIt's pretty remarkable what I used it for in my backyard was the wild strawberries and tough oh yeah that's a tough little weight knocked it out completely and they do hold fly again but I Do\nAnything but we've drawn in one area there because it's so shady there it's it's I knock a lark any of that out the commercial product I was surprised to learn I was\nTalking to the all her about it about a year ago when the commercial product actually uses a base of\nOf er biking so\nReally uses sodium ... yeah ...\n... you know if you use it over and over again I guess you could create a problem with too much sodium but if people want to make it themselves I could try to protest embark on it or or the or biking so they want to say that commercial product is war give it a try\nYeah well I've I've just got to find a good ... you know you you've mentioned it before and we really do really do need to get it on the shelves but I had done the agro on is a\nIs the one and I did not realize he used to be gardening weasel 'cause we we carried that and then he just disappeared from the market but I'm Glad to know the dishes available basically on another name and um [noise]\nUh we will ... will go to work on that immediately\nWant for Doug can help you with it for sure but I think uh you just buy directly from the owner he sold it to a garden ... uh-huh he was just a\nLandscape I mean did did yard work came up with this idea you know just a moment ... and stuff like that came up with\nSomehow got a whole regarding what he was on solar to their business model though is that for every ten companies I buy they were seven or eight of them go back as soon as the way they do things while and he got it back you have to put it back and change it back to ...\nWell I Will uh I'll be in touch with Doug if we can't find them directly that way and we will sure go to work on that one other question I don't want that to ask you um\nIs you know I've I've made Garrett juice and sort of my\nPre seat treatment for just about everything that I plan on the guard new with bigger said do you think we're just just as well to spray the seed bed down and a half percent said is just so small I haven't figured out a real good way to soak it and then be able to spread it and\nI'm not just getting ready to plant some baby bok choy and a couple of other things in kind of scratching my head because it's such a fine seed and wondering if you think a treatment after you've already planted that seed or will work as well as says ...\nI think so a spray it real good and and heavy or put a big water and care and just water to the area the other way to go is a technique were years when we were doing the research and Ford in Texas I'm\nWell that's good will give growing hops a trial got so growing up the office up my little experience with him is that they're very easy to grow and it's a good looking\nTo and I think you can do some things with cops I was reading something the other day biking or even a tea from of the hops there's kind of interesting so I'm always playing around with it but you all do\nIt's on there and give it a shot we should you know I it was interesting I was uh went to an old ... up in Wyoming a couple of years ago and they had hops growing up there and this is a country that goes to twenty and thirty below zero in the winter so it is a tough ... slant Yeah
