I. B. L. E. going to match\nTalking about stress and we're talking about stress affects the body and first of all in order to function at all your body needs magnesium it's probably of all the vitamins I could list magnesium is probably the most important vitamin on the planet right now\nI've not heard a whole lot about magnesium ... why is maybe seem so important\nThere's over three hundred and twenty five bio chemical reactions that mechanisms involved with it it's almost like a hormone wow and for example if it was low levels of magnesium your heart beat who very important factor in life you would say so\nIn fact let me just read a list of some of the conditions are associated with magnesium deficiencies okay um you have attention deficit disorder Alzheimer's or anxiety asthma autism chronic fatigue syndrome congestive heart disease caused the patient diabetes\nFibromyalgia high blood pressure insomnia migraine headaches multiple sclerosis muscle cramps Parkinson's osteoporosis and the list goes on and on and on\nAnd this this is associated with a a lack of magnesium in the money\nSimply a lack of magnesium bully too so it's not that they're really mess around with now what happens is that you need that many of them in your body in order for the calcium to be absorbed\nOh so it's it's a necessary thing in order to get the first component which is calcium\nThat's right they work in combination with each other out there's many more practical applications of this ... formula mhm first of all like I said you drink so it gets into your system and one of the first things we use it for in our clinic it's for people who are under a lot of stress\nAnd it can't sleep well at night it works better than anything I've ever seen for people that have trouble sleep it really because it relaxes your body needs to actually feel the relaxation after you drink the ah after you drink a cup of the combat formula\n... interesting\nNow the other thing that it's really really good for our

Taipei fibromyalgia which is a form of arthritis back\nPain muscle spasms migraine headaches there's a whole category of of various I'd like to discuss with you\nWow that's fantastic some of those things that you've named seem to be age related or or things that we experience as we grow older is there a link there yeah\nThere's a vicious circle that I'd like to discuss what happens is that when a person has\nA magnesium deficiency specifically make museum they don't absorb their food as well\nAnd so they go into what we call mal absorption syndrome which millions and millions of Americans have and it's not like you feel sick or you know this that yes it might be over time just starting to feel more tired and tired and tired mhm and that's just a real graduate overtime type of thing and a lot of people justify that they're getting old and they just need more threats or whatever\nRight and that's what I Would think that what happens is that when when you get less absorption you actually increase the efficiency in your system of magnesium and that\nAnd that starts to take the count them out of the bones you start getting bone loss you start getting um muscle loss because it also reduces the muscle mass and pretty soon before you know you are feeling old yeah and your body's actually starting to manifest that\nWow all due to a simple lack of these nutrient\nCalcium and then they'll let me tell you and it is simple the problem and being a doctor researchers how do you get the end of the system\nThe formula we have the ... formula is so fantastic because gets at a

three four\nWell if you're just joining us I've got Dr Michael is on the phone today and he's telling us about stress and how important it is to ensure that you've got the proper nutrients in your system specifically calcium and magnesium\nAnd how much of an impact that has on our overall health so I guess one of the things that people should really be aware of is because of this isn't an instant thing that triggers you to say oh I'm sick but you know instead happens gradually over time\nIt's very possible that people might not even be aware that there is a deficiency of calcium and magnesium and thereby\nWell that's the thing is that a deficiency is or not like I'm a water main break in or you have a real noticeable thing the right to their little drips little leaks here and there and so what we have is a cumulative effect\nWhere a person starts to go downhill a little bit at a time yeah to the point where they don't really realize how bad that actually gotten before it's too late\n[laughter] don't you think you'd mentioned insomnia we talked about that a little bit what about back pain calcium\nAnd neither is excellent for back pain because the calcium goes into the muscles magnesium actually helps the transmitters and the nerve and when you take us combat formula many times they will calm your back pain wow\nI Know I I have a couple of years ago I herniated disc in my back in ... and I was trying to everything and I took out the comics formula\nAnd I drank it and I couldn't believe the difference within about a half hour I Would functional again not wasn't completely gone but I I drank it over ten day period in it at a completely alleviated the problem\nNow what about heart disease\nHeart disease is or something you have to watch out for about ... and going down the genetic line yeah and if anyone had any history of heart disease or ... even had bypass surgery you should be on this complex formula and I can't say that without enough emphasis because it's something that will completely give you a new lease on life\nIsn't it amazing um we talked about arthritis what about joint pain\nWell the arthritic joints really respond to this and I recently gave a can of this lady who was suffering from fibromyalgia where she was having pain and just about every joint in your body it'd be in or near could be in her neck it could be\nIn her elbow and um and I gave it to her one week and I saw her the next week and I swear Chris I did not recognize are really just that the lady that was sixty four years old and the first time I saw her she looked like she was\nEighty four years old and a week later she was bright you had a beautiful smile her eyes were claiming and I I honestly had to ask my wife who this lady was and and sure enough that she was the one who took a week of ah the formula that ... formula and um\nShe said she got a really good week of sleep for the first time in years wow and that her pain was much better and she ordered three more camp for me to\nEven it out to her friends that's amazing\nAnd when I used this with the professional athletes I'm a doctor for the U.S Olympic team and I had a number of athletes using us before their events so they could sleep well and they wake up in their muscles were in real relax shape\nYou really wouldn't think that a such a small component of your normal diet can make such a profound impact over the way that you feel\nOr say what's happened is that in the last fifty years the American diet has greatly changed and the nutrition has greatly changed and add to that in the medication so\nMany people are on blood pressure medications or anti anxiety drugs or heart medications and many of these things also blocked the absorption of calcium magnesium in the system you know the very drugs that are treating the conditions that your body and experienced and because of the fishing and ... and many of them it's also blocking further absorption\nThey've Chris rates have you with you\nSo let's get right into this whole stress issue you know stress is such a normal part of our daily routine these days but why should we be concerned about it and more specifically what's going on in our bodies and one of the warning signs that we should be looking for\nA while you know there's two ways to look at stress on is what we call mental stress on the other the other is how stress affects your body as a doctor I'm more interested in how it affects your body sure so the way it's stress affects the body is this a what a person's under stress the body transpose is the stress that tension\nAnd your muscles end up contract and and everyone feels that in their in their upper back in ... right at a doctor I'm more concerned about the muscles that you don't feel\nSuch as the muscles in the arteries no up and the muscles the heart is a giant myself over and the muscles in and around your digestive tract mhm because these are the things that are resulting in in a heart disease digestive difficulties\nAnd I want to talk a little bit of your show today about nutrition because there are two nutrients that completely handle the body in terms of stress okay according to the research that I've been involved with it's it's as simple as calcium and magnesium\nCalcium and magnesium right okay\nWhen you're deficient and calcium and magnesium a lot of things can happen counting magnesium for example is needed in order to go to sleep at night and\nHow many people you know they just don't sleep while you wake up tired your body hurt more pretty soon it starts to wear you down and pretty soon you get sick and you have a condition of people are suffering for pain and osteoporosis and fibromyalgia and cramps and their legs and we're illnesses so there's something wrong with this picture\nAnd it has to do it not how much calcium someone taking in their diet or how many cats in supplements or how many ... ... it has to do with simple absorption is that calcium getting absorbed into your body\nWith calcium being something to do with stress isn't calcium for building bones\nWell yes [laughter] okay [laughter] yeah and it does build your ... but you see one percent of the calcium actually circulates in your blood\nSo in that one percent starts to drop it could affect your heart your brain your kidneys your organs and your body shutdown actually dies\nWow this is all one percent of the calcium always has to be in your system and there's two sources of calcium one isn't the diet you know and to us from the bones themself\n... absorb it back from the bones if ... that's right and I say\nAnd what you just discussed right now leads to one of the major causes of a condition that the fact in twenty five million Americans right now which is called osteoporosis right which is a weakening of adult\nNow and that's due to the body deriving the calcium from the bones instead of from the ... yeah\nOkay and so we have to do is we have to find a way to put calcium back in the diet now you think that would be really easy\nSure just drink milk\nJust drink milk or you know eat a lot of green leafy vegetables that sort of thing but first of all people don't do that right and second of all the the quality of the calcium that comes from our diet has been decreasing in the last fifty years really yeah because things like pasture as Asian food they're irradiated um the calcium as leads from the soil and\nPeople are taking medications that block it so\nThe actual calcium is that being absorbed in the body okay and then you see people taking toms and calcium supplements you know they buy the health food store driveway or drink but these Cal\nThings don't absorbing the body it's time for a couple of reasons one uh when you take a let's say an antacid that had the calcium in like a Tom's first of all calcium does that absorbed in the body unless it's an anesthetic environment but see what happens when you take a tub with an antacid\nOh okay so even if you're getting calcium in the uh in the antacid itself is that being absorbed\nI see because it has to be in a in an acid environment for it to be absorbed\nExactly okay now we have a product called the ... formula\nMy combat formula it's natural and the differences is that the powder and what happens if you put it in hot water and you mix it up and you drink it down in a liquid instead of a pill\nAnd it absorbs into your system\nWow so that's ... well\nYeah because when calcium and museum earn a liquid state it absorbs ten times better than in any other state\nWow that's great man effect is I'm I'm reading the can right now says a fenced absorbing calcium and magnesium beverage powder\nWell it comes down to absorption one of the ways to tell if you're not observing calcium is take a look at what drugs are taking are you on high blood pressure medication you need something for your kidneys or you want pain medications you need sleeping pills because the calcium and especially the magnesium being absorbed mhm you're not going\nTo suffer from all these things my comment formula does absorb incredibly in the body the thing is is that when you take my comment formula but not like well well I feel better I have thousands of people are ready to Dr pain 'cause I Can't believe it thirty minutes after I took the counter pain in my wrist went

winding and the reason he's winding is because he thinks that the good old days are as good as it gets have you ever noticed how people can romanticize the good old days\nThey talk about the past as if it was the best thing since sliced bread you hear people\nTalk about the good old days and their sports careers they talk about that moment they were on the mound as if they were in Yankee Stadium and they retired right after the ball\n[noise]\nThey talk about the day that they were in the school play as a brand though was their co star and they were nothing more than a tree [noise]\nThey talk about all kinds of things in the past as if it was so fabulous back then compared to what we have now\nAnd it's not just in our social memory sits in our spiritual memories do\nYou talk to people in charge today who will tell you I remember when my hand of God was moving I'm telling you thank God it's still moving [noise]\n\n\nThey'll talk about the revival of eighty two sixty two forty two twenty two as if those revivals were the most miraculous things that God could ever do but I Know based on what I've read he's the same yesterday today and forever and the dog didn't then he can do it again [noise]\n\nUsually get he and he looked back\nAt the good old days and he brought forward with the miracles and he never brought the challenges he forgot that the people in the past had faced struggled just like he was facing he had forgotten that there were tough times then just like there is tough times now\nAnd a lot of times when people in the world we live in Wyoming [laughter] they're whining because they remember something fondly but it's really not that good\nThe good old days are gone the good old\nDays are here and now because the day is the only day you God and tomorrow is a promise but in guinea and situation there was a little bit of truth to the statement\nBecause in the book of judges the children of Israel we're in a very vicious ...\nThere were in the kind of run where when they would obey and drawn near to God God Bless things would be poured out to pull them and then they would fall into idle worship and disobeyed and God's blessings would leave them and the enemies of Israel would overtake him\nSo in guinea in life when we meet him his father and his grandfather actually had it a little better than the heat is\nIndians generations not only was he looking back and whining about what used to be but he looked around and he didn't find anything good in his current situation and maybe you don't see anything good and your current situation but you need to know\nThat God's ways or not our ways in his time is not our time and what you see is not all\nThat he sees he's the same yesterday today in forever and God Bless Abraham God will bless you\nAnd if God didn't get Joe's without a prison and put a human a palace God can take you from your period all the way to the pinnacle of success and God can make Moses\nLake a nation by storm God can use you to change the world if God didn't take Joshua from a slave to deliver whom the sunsets free is free indeed you may be bound today but if God sees you liberated tomorrow begin to rejoice\nAnd the lord always then again I say rejoice stuff looking at thrown passed feeling like the good times are going to stop looking at today wondering what can come out of it is simply lift your hands\nRaise your voice because of the Bible says let everything that happened\n[noise]\n\nReally fresh him in a wind breast because the Bible says he wants to hide it from the ...\nThe median nights according to the book of judges were like a swarm of locust when the children the visceral would receive harvest from the green that they had planted\nWhen they were bringing the graves and when they were bringing the fruit in the field the media nights with the the food and they would just come like a swarm of blow this with their army and steal everything that the children of Israel had been blessed with\nWhy\nBecause the children of Israel had been disobedient in God said and dude around ... if you are disobedient invaders will come and they'll take what's yours\nGideon decides that he's going to be clever\nAnd he takes wheat that you need to go to a hilltop in order to threshold you see thrashing is when you\nTake a stock of wheat with the straw and all of the grain appear in the head and you rub your hands back and forth and you allow the chat if the worthless paper stuff on a we start to get caught in the air and carried away while the brain falls to the ground\nWhen the brain falls to the ground all of the worthless chat is gone you discard the straw you pick up the seat you grind it into the flower you add just a little oil you add just a little water ... for the more you mean [noise]\n\nYou see is Gideon was going to take wheat and he was gonna fresh it his enemies would see him on the hilltop and they would know that there was somebody up there\nGrain and if he had grain he had bread and if he had read\nSo instead of getting in is over in the wine press with the wheat that he should have up on the hilltop rather than being in a high place where God wants him to be he's in a place pretending he's doing something good\n\nAnd he's over in the wine press with the stone and he's pushing the stone around and he's telling Americanized nothing to see over here no none of them just crushing some grapes for some new wine it'll be ready in about three maybe four years\n\nAnd what he's doing is he's putting out much more\nEffort than he really should\nBecause when you fresh we the wind does the work when you crush grades you do the work when you fresh\nWays you don't mix the chaff in the stock with the speed but when you put we enjoy wine press\nEverything gets mixed together\nGet in is putting out maximum effort and he is getting minimum satisfaction because he's trying to solve his problem his way\nNot God's way\nAnd there's a lot of people who wind today because they're putting out maximum effort with minimum return because they're trying to solve their problem in their strength not God strength when Judy and\nGets all of the stock and all of a chap and all of the seed mixed up he's going to make flower but when he eats his bread and he's going to spit seeds everywhere\n[noise]\nHe may think he's outsmarting his enemy but all he's doing is listening his quality of life\nThinking about that\nWhen you try to outsmart your enemy without allowing God to go before you in the battle all you really do is less than your quality of life\n[noise]\nAnd three hundred of them according to the word of God lack the water like dogs [noise]\nAnd I'm certain the guinea and looked at the dog ... and he said God there's something wrong with those minutes\n[noise] they need to go home they haven't been raised right\nThey weren't really concerned about what things look like they were just thirsty and ... says the guinea and you're right there's something wrong with those men they're willing to do things in an unexpected way they're just the kind of died we need to get in the Ninety seven hundred home and keep the three hundred\n\nNow get eons really got a trial on his hands because he thought he was going to go face them army with an arm and now he's facing an army with just a few hundred men\nSee when getting it had thirty two thousand men people would've said Gideon\nYou are a brilliant leader congratulations to you wouldn't give me an had ten\nThousand men they would say getting if you are a mighty warrior\nCongratulations to you but when Gideon has three hundred\nThe only thing anybody can say in that day or this one is God is awesome look what he did with Judy and\n[noise]\nYou may be sitting here today and you're waiting for people to surround you still do you feel like the strength that has brought in numbers may help you with your problem and you may be sitting here today hoping that someone will answer\nThis request of your heart and supply or need you may be sitting here today and waiting for another individual to walk in and solve all your problems I Need you to know something to do is not going to let\nAnybody get the glory for what he has planned in your alive until you are down to the only place where people look at you and say be why it happened was that was\n\nSo beauty and wins by doing the unexpected God tells Gideon you've ever met a torch and give every minute show foreign wait until nightfall whenever it's dark exposed\nThe torches blow the show farmers make him a me believe that there are hundreds of thousands\nOf you in the Bible tells how the media nights were taken by surprise and how they ran and they fled for their life and how Gideon was a judge over Israel for forty years\nAll because he was willing and obedient to the voice of the lord and doing the unexpected you know I Believe that the church in the world today is so patterned that our enemies don't expect much from us\nThey see the way they we behave and they know what we're going to do on Sunday and they know we're not going to do anything\nOn Monday but I Believe that if we will do the unexpected\nIf we will believe dog for the supernatural if we will obey his word will look at our grandchildren and not tell them about the good old days we'll look at our grandchildren

reading nursery guards that on the driveway to a\nPizza seedlings raised but a dog on a change demar yes or\nA forgot to tell you what I thought the the other day I Am a real good luck with the ballot as a at a seat from Johnny's\nReally embarrassed stuff but it it wasn't germinate and then this uh this last batch ballot size is just almost a hundred percent German a well that's good to know\nI don't know why that is but it's going to let you guys know that the ballots are working real good I think that's the same thing those are those big hydroponic growers uses is Alice\nAnd describe for our listeners what a what they do when they ... said\nWell if you remember back in the good old days when you're a kid you had a BB gun and and the ... or about the size of maybe a little bit bigger of a ... right at their their role in it looks like a white clay ... and they're real easy for an old half ... and [laughter]\nAnd\nIn other words for those of us that are starting our seed in trays or even if we're planning it out and roses just a lot easier to get our spacing\nA done properly when we have the the seed in a little bit bigger form ... sized instead of the size of a grain of salt us or even smaller and you know what it is that they that they ... that said with to ah get that little baby affect the\nUm I I'm not real sure what they use I wondered if he if you know\nYou can get you guys you can get organic certified and get conventional okay and I really don't know the difference you you just hit the nail on the head\nIf you're selling the lead to see you can you don't have that I mean you don't have to stay on because you're Iowa where you're flat and and especially carrots yeah you can you can see those rows and then you don't have to come back and it's\nIt's water [laughter] and and that's the biggest problem is that a novice Gardner\nUsually that's the biggest mistake that they frequently make in the garden is failure to thin and\nOh character such a good example you have a role of care so it's like a mohawk care caught out there but we don't then you're going to have all tops and no roots and that's why it's so important in a\nYeah the the palace high said and I still like some of the old seed tapes you know that was a very similar thing where the embed the seed in a biodegradable paper\nAnd that sort of the same thing as far as spreading it out\nI don't you know I I think you get like you're saying better better German nation with the palace high seeds and we used to in the seat tapes that seat tape used to be a great way to get around that issue of not sending enough for exactly the same reason you knew you know how far apart the seeds were when you put them in the ground\nThat's what's so cool about the dies carrots see on your you don't have to come back and and and then anything it because you can see you can see what you're doing\nA so [laughter] like\nYou say even if even if you're half blind your eyes are nearly what they were fifty years ago and uh um fortunately there are a lot of folks are around the country or identify with exactly what you're saying James and I suspect the difference in conventional and\nI'm an organic is is the seeds source more than it is the material that they're you know putting around them I my my guess is that it may be some rock phosphate it may be some kale and clay\nI you know I'd have to actually crumble up one of those things and try to look at it under a microscope to see but I think probably the only real difference people are going to see in the seed is the seeds source and as long as the seeds not treated with a you know toxic fungicides or something like that\nYou know I have no problem with a with conventional seeds so long as it's not genetically modified I'm I'm not nearly as concerned about whether the seat was produced organically as I Am with the Kerry get after gets planted so I'm used to always a little bit more things for us to look at it research and learn about\nAnother little trick a when it comes to the uh the green onions mhm ah so the soil blocks so about five or ten or as much as twelve seats for solo blocked right\nLet 'em every six inches in every direction and then when you bend over that green onions you your chicken more than one yeah I Do the multi plant block and that's really working well for me I'm starting a green onions and every every weekend to keep to\nKeep me and green onions but that a multi ... block is\nInstead of just you know yeah undermine them with their fork and then they get 'em up your your your ticket you pick one lunch and then you've got enough to eat or cell or bring inside for salads\nOh and they are so good I I Do it a little differently in my garden I plant the plants in but I just plan of a lot closer than you know I'm going to have at the end of the season and then I'd just go through and pull every other one out for I'm fortunate to be in you\nKnow soil to spin work for a hundred years so uh it's loose and open and I can I can go through in than them out and eat the standings without disturbing the the others but yeah your your idea of planning in a soil block is it's the same sort of thing you're planning them a lot more densely than you would if you were going to\nBe looking just strictly for a big onion bald\nBut a nice thing about a a crop like onions that doesn't truly ripe and it just gets you know bigger is that you can eat 'em at any stage of their growth and\nMan for me it's hard to beat some good grilled onions or [laughter] you know and and then you get those little Pearl ... onions and then you get your big bones all all from the same a group of plants\nMan oh man I Can't wait to ... [laughter]\nA lot all out of onions from last year so I got to get some more of the ground as soon as a of those folks that addicts and they all have ready so that we can start grow in a few more men are\nUh maybe on a digest you know working for a living all the hours I put in all the things I Do I don't\nHave time to grow a lot from seed but I guess maybe I Need to try to find time to do that so I get my own green on you started a little bit earlier rather than relying on the on the big producers but hey small is just such fun time and the guard new just so many things you can do and the weather is little more accommodating most of the time\nWell that's a fact so yo yo have fun and a garden and then uh maybe without the later\nForward to it thanks James having great Sunday ... thank you sir bye [noise]\nI got to do that a break here Michael is next and then David and then I got a couple of open line is you know the number two ten five nine nine fifty five fifty five\nGets talked about Fox farmers and that's just a name that you\nYou may not be familiar with but it sure not a new company Fox farm spin around a long time their product line called happy frog on people swear by some of those products and uh even uh the commercial the professional grower I guess you call people like James you don't\nOf their their of course he all eyes are that's coconut fiber and that's what I think smart people use in place of Canadian peat moss has all the same good organic qualities but it is a renewable resource unlike Canadian peat moss and it's not anti microbial like Canadian peat moss is\nFox farmers basis a lot of their products on core fiber things like that cocoa local ... just a good company doing a lot of things with a lot of good products\nAnd I guess very good organic fertilizers as well for specific crops and then for general use as well you know\nFive bucks products Fox arm products in more and more nurseries around the area you'll find them coast to coast if you travel as I Do and I always try to stop by visit a few nurseries been tested for years tried and true and used in love by a lot of people happy frog in Fox farms good things to look at\nAttention San

moving people\nAnd getting folks from point a to point B and all my colleagues are ah been working heritage absolutely a great environment for us knowing that we're trying to have some solutions and provide some solutions for our community\nAnd um then a little while later when a little onions are up to the size of a big marble are those are also useful in cooking and a lot of different things you chop I'm up in salads you can boil the men with some new potatoes and green beans or just a lot of good things to do with them\nAnd so I go through and pick out every other one and now I've got my plants about four inches apart\nThose are the ones that I can leave to form those big ball that I Will both enjoy and you know store for some time so\nI find that as long as we got reasonably good drainage as long as the organic and you're rowing program um and we do harvest the onion from the top start falling over in spring don't leave them in the ground for an extended period of time but I find that they store very well but the length of timing hold them in storage I think is more dependent on\nHow much sugar how what variety of ... and you have than it is\nYou know anything about how they were grown harvested\n[noise] when you were talking about the ... um you're sitting there waiting for this I just started brownie and falling over are you saying that in some cases they'll bowl before they brown and yellow were absolutely\nAbsolutely and if you get is that is planning to late is that what happens when you gauge later in the usually planning a short they variety\nWhen I'm you know when a planning them early when we're still in the short days do get to a certain point and then they bold\nIf you plant a long day variety and your catalogs we'll give you this information pretty clearly\nThen they're not going to bolt until the days get substantially longer which is usually going to be beyond the time that we would normally be harvesting them so it's not as much of a culture issue other than planning dates are that are important but it's the varieties that you choose to plant and when you choose to plant implant onions all the way from\nYou know early October through April or actually probably through march and still get good onions but you need to select your varieties carefully according to what time you're going be planting them on the calendar\nSure if I'm planning around the first in December [laughter] I'm In my short they still at that\nPoint you can I Do either but uh I I think the long days are probably going to be better for you\nI might have to know yeah they\nThey they don't make that clearly cattle or they just make it sound like you don't live in the right place for a long day\n[laughter] well yes and no it's a you have to realize that a\nLot of places cannot plant onions as early as we do I mean you get up in the mid west that soil still frozen until you get into march or April but um yeah it's a ... you know again we we can harvest or we can plant over a longer period of time\nWhat I actually do my ... you know in my garden I Do not pay as much attention\nBut I plan to crop south plant one in November December I'll plant a second crop and late February and ah unfortunately a lot of mine in November December ones do end up voting on me but hey I Need them uh the later ones that I plant I have very little problem with the bowl thing and those are the ones that I'm going to\nA store until that long list of hands and reaching out for my onions there there are number of people in my business in France at that think that is the best thing that I grow at my neck or a lot of different things so are a lot of people yeah they are not all more come pull weeds and help\nWith the work and the guard but they sure are they sure are waiting for a bag of good ideas when they get ready for\nThe last thing I realized is is there a high nitrogen use or they were high fertilizer user well how is that every day that grows underground you don't want to do that but apparently you need to make and\nWell yes you do when when you think about the structure of it on you know how you have those rings and an onion every one of
