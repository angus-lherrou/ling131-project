A. dot com they may have try before you buy plans for reasonably priced top quality service\nIs water solve or that I chose thanks ... best are a lot of years ago and I've never looked back maybe you should consider a kinetic cold\nAll right well look it up as a board all of a sudden we're going to talk to read it and Jamie and James in Tracy so that's a full house to get started so let's just do it you're going to\nGet more than just another nice Martin out there this morning\nYes but I've got three questions I'll Try to get through and fast a okay the first one is lawn and I heard you say something about brown hats uh-huh um [noise] after\nThat July rains my lawn turns yellow it's like every fall it turns the lime green mhm\nSo a one year I nearly destroyed it putting down iron right here I said well I'll put down\nGreen which is what I use cell that didn't even faze it\nSo then I got from hot compost and I said well let me just see what this does well\nI don't know if that's what just about killed in spots but it looks horrible I mean in some places against the foundation out maybe fourteen Fifteen inches it's totally dead now I looked\nFor change bag and go out and there wasn't\nAny um I've never had pets I don't even know if that's what I have\nWell let's yeah let's do\nWell at this point you know probably a little more patience and just about anything because what happens when we get Fifteen twenty inches of rain which is what we had all across the region you have to realize that not very far down in the ground we base of release it on a mountain of limestone and ...\nAnd when the soil become super saturated as it\nWas for a while they're in September we're starting to dry out a bit now but that soil literally ... the old fashioned coffee pause you sit there and watch them perk and broken broken bring 'em published down on the bottom of the coffee pot all of a sudden bubbles up to the top of the pot that is what happens\nWhen we get Fifteen inches of rain or more in a month's time\nAnd we have ... related up so much ... from\nDeep down in the soils that when and when we get that much alcohol energy when we get the age bumped up that much\nAll of a sudden a lot of the nutrients and things just become unavailable plants they become and know fairly much insoluble\nAnd that is going to change your um organic program is going to help the more organic acids more human gas to things like that that we\nYou know get being produced from just natural microbial activity from compost and things like that the more the yards gonna turn around and go back to what we're used to but we're in a period when\nYou can do almost anything you want and nothing but green paint is going to make your yard a whole lot darker green now\nSome yard show up more than others to people sitting on very thin soils have\nYou know the biggest problems right now the people with four feet of good topsoil have absolutely beautiful grass but you look around town and there are ... doing the same thing that yours is done either getting yellow in spots or getting yellow pretty much across the yard now there is a lot of brown patch out there\nAnd I think you know what you do go out and and take a hold of some mostly played for the grass is looking really bad and lift up if the leaf blade separates from the runner if you look down at the base at least late and it starts looking a little bit\nWatery a little bit round you probably have some brown patch fungus rather talk Tony getting started it all grown corn meal will cure that or corn water tea will cure that\nOr if you've had brown patch and you said you have not they've paid folks that have have brown patch in the past I go ahead and put down a little bit of a corn meal on a preventive basis because we're we are seeing and we're going to see a lot more brown patch this fall\nBut at this point if you fertilized I'm I'm not a big fan of cotton Burke compost I'm much more a fan of some of them in your base compost\nYou know that will very definitely help and just going to give you gorgeous yard next spring if you want to put down a little bit of our and you can put down a the product from lady bugs called magic sand you can still find some of that around\nOr a car pool has a new product healthy called Jersey green sand or really enter the grain fans will put more iron out there\nBut realized that as long as we're in this condition where we just keep having all this house and Senate he brought up a lot of that stuff's just simply not available to your grass and\nJust you know good care regular watering regular mowing the grass is going to turn around but it may take a little while and you just no matter what you do because of the soils because of the you know situation with our high uncle empty right now there's not a lot you're going to do to make your grass suddenly get dark green again\nFunny you know you've been forewarned [laughter] actually I really\nFeel free to call me and asked me how to get rid of it three years from now what has taken over the world\n[laughter] and I'll do it okay last question on my gender and ... they're both about two feet tall mhm do I bring them and for the winter or put them in the ground right now\nWhat kind of ginger the edible or yes yeah bring 'em in for the winter I bring 'em in for the winter or\nThey're going to be much happier and you're going to have a a lot more opportunity to harvest from\nYeah ... okay [noise] I'm good go going back outside then\nYou get out and have a wonderful day and we'll talk again Jamie thanks for the call this ... go by All right uh let's see what farmer James is up to this morning ...\nFlorida by the way\nIt just uh it's just a nice Saturday out there what can I say it's a it's warm enough to not be too bad cool enough to be able to do a bit of work it's not pouring down rain on a Saturday we'll probably get that about Tuesday or so so I'm looking forward to a great day\nYes sir um hey the windy is your asparagus six foot tall yet\nProbably yeah have measured it but uh you know it is very very happy with all the September rains\nAnd a ... give five six feet that's about where it is and I say more power to it I just fertilize it let it grow and know that the more green them more nutrient nutrients stores this time of year the longer I'm going to be able to harvest next spring so\nI'm all for it and uh it's you know it can\nCause that really invasive but it can sure take up a lot of room\nWendy fertilize your asparagus\nYear round year round I especially in the growing season all hated every couple of weeks with a history grow and when I'm you know putting out some of the grow in green for the other things I'll throw a little bit up in that you know bad as well\nWell I usually growing green and the spring when everything is you know when I'm when I get ready for the season right ah I guess all this rain kick the growing green and\nWell it did a lot of things and yeah it definitely increase of microbial activity which is very definitely increase the availability nutrients which certainly they have led to a big surge in growth and uh\nI you know who knows what it's going to do this winter you probably do the same thing I Do if it hasn't frozen backed by January I'd go ahead and cut it down to ground level but I'm just going to let it grow and do his thing as long as possible because\nThe stronger it is the topic is now the stronger the roots are going to be through the winter months and the more asparagus we're going to have to pick an eight next January and February\nYou freeze your asparagus\nUm ... meaning you surplus asparagus that I Can't eat all at once I've never harvested that's ... [laughter]\nI've got a waiting list of ... and uh you know I'd say it's kind of like Blue Bell says about their ice cream lead all we can and sell the rest that's the way it is by asparagus I ate all I can and usually have somebody with their hand out one this I've never\nI've never harvested enough asparagus to uh to have any left over so I have to say honestly I'd I've not experimented with keeping it freezing probably would work blanche union freezing but um it is not something I've done\nOK yeah a lot of the question for you or the or the local business in town has a goal by Nicole bell and you know growing up on the fence and uh I was wondering if you knew how to a ... a gate that for ...\nOh it it'll rooted in her life pretty easily for you\nOr don't get way out toward the tip for all those blooms reform um but go down you know take your cutting from the mid section of some of the vines and uh I usually leave about two leaves for cutting all stripped the lower leave off and be sure that no gets down on the ... but uh\nIt it can certainly be grown from cutting so you can also do route divisions if you've got a big plant of it\nBut uh oh it is so beautiful this year you can call it cleans crown coral being a you know and take it on my hope is is is botanical blame rows of Montana of lots of different names but man the bees I tell young you're bugs in from ten feet away\nYeah they've got this a flat covered up for sure yeah ah it's so you it it was like a vine so you just uh just got to leave off the vine and least somebody in there and then well\nI I I'll take a little sections of vine like a sail usually leave to leaves I'll take a section two leaves long I'll strip the lower the two leaves off and you know where that leaf came out\nIt's going down under the PR light and then leaving one leaf honored up above the PR light and uh shouldn't have very high percentage of root for ya\nAnd that's when the temperatures in the seventies or eighties dude anytime now\nYou just don't get all the way out to the gym where food temp a tip of the vine words that real soft tender growth\nOh okay yeah I got it All right uh can I ask you one more thing\nYeah get about Ninety seconds here for a news time\nI was talking to draw up at the right ideas that he was given a separation on\nPepper fertilizers and I didn't know that the peppers would drop their flowers if they were low on the couch\nI guess I've never worried about that because we have so much calcium in the soil I it's not been a problem for me as it for you\nKnow I've never had a problem with that [laughter]\nIt was a broker do try to fix it I Will let it we'll let some people at other parts of the country where they had lived or this or worried about that we've we've got all we\nNeed and uh I I guess you know that's a good possibility lack of available calcium can mess up a lot of different plant systems but it's so rare earlier problem here that are made some we just really don't have to worry about\nOkay bubble you have a good day it's actually take go\nOh it's always a pleasure to talk to you James you get out and have a great weekend or a you know like his or by\nAlright

weekend [laughter] we're going to be broadcast it over there tomorrow doctor Kirby and I and what we do this\nAnd the deer should may still pull some of 'em up trying to get a taste of them to see what they taste like so I Would uh I wouldn't hesitate to plant them but I might have a little bit of deer repellent on hand at least to get them well started\nGotcha okay well that's that's my question today and I appreciate it when they have a wonderful\nDay I Hope you do as well Tracy kinda good good October we'll talk again marches up next door to Russia\nHe might have settled several questions today that I Hope they're short answer is\nMy first one is that thanks giving I Believe cactus ... and I had it for years it's a it's a fairly small insects as part of a sudden it started wilting fertilizer the water I think appropriately I'm thinking maybe it's just tired of being in a smaller pot\nUm well I guess\nI think it's probably gotten too dry at some point and\nAh yeah it'd be a little bit easier to keep it watered adequately in you know don't go to a huge pot but you could bumped it up to an eight inch size pot which you've lost a bunch of route safe it is safe has got mood is very kind of\nYou know flash said limp sort of situation so I'd probably be use them little super thrive maybe a little uh Gary juice on it because it it needs to recover from that\nBut you know Christmas ... Thanksgiving cacti that whole group or not desert cacti and they do not ever ever want to get completely dry and I think you're probably got a little too dry at some point so\nUm I think it will recover if you want to put it a little bit bigger pop but I I think being in a smaller pot is not really the direct cause but being a smaller pop does make it hard to keep water so that's probably why I get to drive some point\nOkay I can I can do that um magic San ... can you use that as the in spider\nAbsolutely it's not I mean it's not televised but it doesn't go out as evenly as fertilizer will but as long as his dry um it it will go through a spread or certainly will\nOkay I'm next set let's see all the big Confederate jazz men that I think it's fair has white polish right um it took off after this rain and now it's I'm kind of bending my um\nTrial is and I like um when she did I say\nWell the best time to cut back star jazz when Confederate Jasmine whatever you want to call it is after it flowers in the spring blooms on new growth as well as old growth so you can prove it now\nBut you were set for probably the most spectacular flowering you've ever had in the spring so they'll get carried away with pruning it back and you will still get plenty of flowers because like I say it will put on a new growth in that road we'll flowers so if you really need to cut it\nDo it now but I you may need you just do a little better support on the travel is that because it is is going to be all going to shoot\nYeah I I I was thinking just supporting it better on my next one are beneficial ... right now\nIf you have fleas yes not much else out there well they work against fire ants too but uh the you know it's they're not as many troublesome creatures in the soil at this time of year now once it gets really cold will be thinking about ticks\nAnd of course um like say if you have an ongoing free problem than they are certainly the best ways to control that but\nI'm not one for putting them out preventative lay I I watch for a need and then uh I certainly use them but there there's not much need out there right now\nGotcha and then my ... well I have like three more but the last one I really need to answer is I have a I think it's a ... area I don't know you know the variety but it seems like every time I ... I only used and the Dana granular um\nAnd that could just be coincidental but the chips turn brown ... what would cause the ticks\nWill him around in your tips as a sign of roof damage um the Medina fertilizer should not cause that but uh when I see brown tips on was sharing things it's most frequently of water issue\nBut a ... it usually burn brown yeah that kind of brown yeah and it's usually an issue of uh of drought more than anything else of drought\nAnd it's always possible yeah ...\nThat's what I Would say it is I don't think it really has anything to do with growing green fertilizer that that's fine fertilizer to use on most anything or does your wish Syria bloom well for you in the spring\nYet yeah several times a year at all in fact they\nAre that's unusual for it to blow up more than once this should have a real deep deep purple flower\nAnd now it's like great yeah\nOK you may be looking at a there's a totally different plant they called evergreen listeria which is\nNot it is ever green\nOkay well that is this is a is a different plant ... botanical name doesn't go through the door of a period is very susceptible to getting to dry it it's a plant that it was better in Houston that it does in San Antonio so now\nI'm the must be pretty good soil if it stay in good and green and grown for yeah it's just getting a little dry forget brown tips on it\nOkay and what is the difference between competing in running bamboo I heard you talking about earlier\nWell that's a great question um when a when a bamboo basically is a grass and\nIt ... it is it starts to put up a new shoot that comes up right it it either moves a long way out from the base of the plant where it was growing problem it forms hotel and underground stem called the rise home\nAnd then it makes another shoot that comes you know sticking up in the air which is what we think of is bamboo and the so called club thing bamboo\nThose rise homes are very very short the new growth is going to come up\nAbout a quarter to half an inch away from the last grow so it's just very slowly spreading out and getting bigger and bigger and bigger\nThe so called running bamboo or spreading bamboo so\nThey may put out a rise homeless ten feet long before it starts putting up a new shoot\nAnd you planted in one place and all of a sudden it's sprouting up all over the whole yard because like I say it might that rise on may move which just under the surface of the ground but it may go eight ten Fifteen feet out before it start sprouting up so it simply start putting up troops over a much wider area\nThe pumping forms of bamboo like I said expand very very very slowly\nBecause those little motorized almost only grow a very short distance before they make a new top coming up is that makes sense\nYes it does so I'm kinda actually hearing probably all all of those should stay in a pot and no matter what\nEven this level I don't know I Do ... things I find are very good and in some people's yard I mean we have a good friend out in the medical center and she has said must be what Vietnam looks like a she has a huge bamboo thicket and loves it one of the prettiest bamboo ... out there just looks like polished\nYou know black would end this call black man boo but it is a spreading bamboo\nThat kind I Would either put her in a flower bed you know totally surrounded by concrete or something in a wide area where it can't get loose or I Would grow it in a pot that slumping types Alfonso car golden got us they're a bunch of good ones out there\nFine in the ground because you're never going to get out of hand and if you ever need to dig them up and move them is very easy to do\nOh okay that's good to know I think I saw and golden guy that's at your place a week\nBut I Try to

warm they start shivering when the temperatures started getting down to the low sixties so many when we first plant that comes into your home wouldn't fault comes around\nOkay well I thank you so much they help\nThe say de ... thank you Bye bye [noise] All right\nUh let's see here next up is going to be Nick ...\nGoing to bother you\nDo a great thank you how 'bout yourself a\nPretty good pretty good at it a little bit of rain right now so and they come in through the north side of their county right now\nIt's just it's really spotty I had a little shower overnight but uh had men those big range I say come on Tuesday I think is the day they're giving us the best chance for reasonably heavy rains but voter they know it's going to do what is going to do either\nIs going to the desert\nHey so a much question today I've got a couple of quick ones um I planted three in Monterey oaks uh they were really young when I planted 'em then about\nFour feet tall and the diameter of the Trump was about seizing my pinky finger right pretty tiny little trees but they really taken off or like I said it's all a bit of a two and a half years\nAnd they range in heights from eight to ten feet tall and the trunks are about\nTwo and a half inches one of them's about three inches sounds about right\nThey've really grown up so what I've been doing it for a while just feeding him I I fertilized ... uh about every six months I've just been using fertilizer stakes uh-huh\nI'm I water and a pretty deep water and about once a week if I don't get any rain just kind of look at the leaves and see if if I think that in the water and I feel the soil around them\nSo um they've been do pretty good but here lately um probably in the last six months of noticed on two of on the bottom third of them have these little white specks all over their leaves a no all the leaves but\nI Would say the like I said the bottom third of them have these little bitty white specks and there'd be twenty or thirty white specks on the leaves and not really sure what's causing it if it's something like aphids or something might be on the\n... can you take your fingernail and like the little white specks off\nYou know this part of the leash\nA so it probably it may very well be a it could\nScaled on there which gets very firmly attached but what you've been doing is kind of pushing those trees along you're given a mechanical a synthetic chemical fertilizer you're giving them more water than they really need\nAnd what you're getting is a very soft luxury and growth no overtime that's fine but when you have a plant that is kind of\nPushed along faster the mother nature would be doing it you make it more susceptible to insects and to some extent you can actually make it more susceptible\nTo uh some disease problems your your monitor EEO you're actually can live oak is still going to grow quickly but I back off on that watering the once a month then even then only if it's a really fairly dry\nThe are the stakes are always synthetic fertilizer and the problem with those things is you pound them down and the soil you've got an area of really concentrated fertilizer but Eighteen Inches way you have no fertilizer at all\nSo I look at air you're much better to just feed on the surface of the ground I prefer the organic products and I don't care whether it's ... lady bugs nature's creation they all make very good for ... but at this point\nI think we need to we need to stop pushing them so hard the growth is still going to be\nYou know they're still going to grow quickly it's probably the fastest growing of any the oak trees other than the red okay I don't recommend the red oaks is highly because vote wilt issues but uh okay you're you're Monterey oaks are are fast growing trees and they're going to maintain that but let's let's don't force feed them quite as much and let's say\nI'm In and again a friend of mine with USDA many years ago in a lecture I heard him give he made the comment that of plant will only grow as much root system as it takes to support itself\nAnd when you are really really providing that tree with everything it needs it has no reason to extend its root system out over large areas getting re everything and AIDS real close\nAnd they said\nI I saw this in two thousand eleven on my own ranch I had a ... trees growing along the creek not that I had planted but they were ruined ride longest streak in in the past years it would dry up for two or three months and then I have water and again well let's stay dry for two years during the drought of two thousand and eleven\nAnd a half or two thousand ten thousand eleven and I had the country's long that creek die whereas ones in the field two hundred yards away enormous trees you know twenty thirty inches or more in diameter and they never a bait\n[noise] you know I'm actually using the wrong term 'cause I did buy the plan so I didn't know the difference that it's not those little round balls that fight over a plane\nWhere would you said they came at a bag that made me think they were sets but OK onion plants do they are definitely you have nothing left to play for last year\nOr so so you just blew a whole two bucks you know go out and beat yourself up for no I'm teasing of course but uh no just uh they they knew which will not be available most of them are grown\nUp down in Dixon Dale and are they um tolls are going to be ready right around the first to November and you can plant I'm from that time all the way up through February aged ... crops onions\nOkay I guess it was like bringing home a tomato plants growing in your garage in leading it then that just died [laughter]\nIdeas that a good analogy and cruel is it sounds it does happen\nOkay and and then one more question for you um\nWhen my kids can do that and bring their dogs their ... use the bathroom on my beautiful green front yards the aircraft and so I ended up with these little brown spots\nUm when I fertilized with with my growing green out there it is it okay to to go over those spots to or is there anything that I can do outside as making the dogs go elsewhere\nWell you know if you can follow the dog around and diluted down I mean follow around with the holes and everywhere they they stopped the squat so to speak or you could diluted down it's a concentrated dog ear and that does burn\nIt actually contains things that would be considered fertilizer is just too much in one spot or you will neutralize the effect you get the grass growing back into those areas more quickly if you would put her a little thin layer of compost over those areas but uh\nIt's just you know the combination of the summer heat in ... a little hard on a nice grass and it's compounded by the fact that by the nature of dogs when one goes in a given spot\nYou know the next sixteen dogs income by all have to go visit the same spot and that's when you get the really bigger brown spots\nYeah yeah if they would use the back yard I wouldn't care it's not very tiny aren't yard nice patch where they want\nTo go well just a ... and again this would be a great time of year to put out a little bit of compost it will cause the grass to fill those areas in very quickly and actually it'll make the grass a little bit more resilient to dog ear and in the future so composting those series be real good idea\nOkay All right that's all I had for you to death I crochet your time\nAnd don't go walk the kids in the garage with the dogs in the garage you just leave your on your plants out there if you bust but any way you get out and have a great weekend\nThank he'd say if they fail by All right we'll finish up the hour with Don governor Don\nI have St Augustine with about four hundred square feet of brown patch okay\nI Want to replace the St Augustine 'cause I have fought this for three four years in the same spot this year it took over and ran away and I probably dropped fifty pounds of a corn meal on it\nSay how much it on the most resistant grass to brown patch\nProbably Bermuda or in tips Bermuda in particular is probably your your fish grass of a grass that you can mow and make a you know a good long out of it\nThe ... ... is a slower growing grass some ... like you're ... the narrow ... she is uh they're they're ...\nA ... a very good grass is always you want to stay away from a jam or jam or is actually more\nSusceptible Hussein August or to a ... even in St Augustine is but the ... or the emerald sway she already going to be your to most ... grasses now remember they do like son if you start getting very\nEarly this area is full ...\nEl Toro will be an excellent choice for ya\nOkay now to prepare the ground do I I'm I'm thinking a plug in my entire yard mhm a lot of these plugging machines when is the best time to do that\nUm you can do it any time of year hot if you find nice grass you can actually do at this time of year in your voice you will get a root system established you know over the over the winter months I'm\nNot doing it this fall yeah a do it as soon as far as the ground\nAs far as compost flux on compost a foot down\nNo compost at all if you want to put down a little more organic fertilizer that's fine but compost generates carbon dioxide of new of roots need oxygen and so you put your compost on top after your plugs ... are planted not before\nOkay yeah I'm going to a part of the big squares\nYeah might as well he was going on foot down yeah OK and\nIt uh you know ... is slow growing it doesn't stand up to foot traffic is well I've got a back\nYard ... now this is my front yard shots of as Ilya for\nYears and I you know all about it that well sounds like it's a good time to get it started out front and\nA ... el Toro or emerald either one would be good choices for\nIt to prepare the saw the ground area itself or just ... on the lowest cut impossible scrape it\nScrapes you down as low as you can if you generate a lot of clippings and things in that case either ... rake them up because you want your new grass to make good contact with the soil underneath\nIf you saw if your grass is already than a dead there you don't need to do that just mowed down low and put your a new ... new sod right on top of it ... to take out the ... and you're off to a good start\nOkay now do I get the fourth button [noise] before it but there's\nNo absolutely no reason to\nNo reason to show just scrape the ground get his\nGreat around put down in some good organic fertilizer late in roller water it and it's in the yard\nOK okay now for my other side of the yard is still a saint Augustine what's the best compost foot down on it for\nAny that you need them in your compost products are what are you getting from Newark they're ah they're your compost is actually certified organic or worked extremely well\nWhat about stone and so\n... says which will be get out there\nOkay and uh [noise] the ... the ... the best one of\nUs are ... okay\nYou got to go to news thank you sir this is Katie essay San Antonio\nFrom\nMichelle in France and then it sent to vote this afternoon and it appears there are just enough to be asked boats

creation\nAnd about the good products that they make and let me tell you what they uh\nThey put out a lot of good things they package Jake good corn gluten meal they call it prevent for a you know for weed prevention\nThey package a great alfalfa base fertilizer which they call their premium lawn food\nNow so package a lot of other good things and I love the fact that they're smaller containers they actually do them in plastic jugs rather than in bags makes him so much easier to keep and store talking about things like their fungicides corn meal just good natural home grown corn meal with little bit of garlic in with it\nMake a great great dry molasses doesn't plop or cake or get hard I could just go on and on talking about nature's creation a good company and everything they do is a hundred percent organic you find there find products that lots of different places earth works in Victoria plant housing for real ... here in San Antonio\nThrow it out of the trucks they're just not ever going to do it when we when we did the work on the contrary our remembered we had one of ... near the the wound\nThat hit of parents have been were widening came down the tree and blew out at the base that's what\nCaused the original or damage wrought got started and there was a bad ... growing out of the\nThe cows that was formed trying to grow back over the wound and we left it there for a while ha ha ha ha I mean somebody from the far surfer she's there one day and told them to cut it off that wasn't good which is\nNo big deal we left it there thinking that it would help the it's kind of like you know you you and I both talk about\nShe ... and things like that and leaving it grows a poet sometimes will help\nDevelop some growth in that spot but I think all fruit trees what you want to do is create a situation where that flare develops as soon as possible\nMost of the orchards most of the tree orchards are too deep underground and don't have good flyers and that's why people out they\nHave so much trouble with insects and diseases and after ... years of university recommended Sprite for so much and all of that I think it's all directly related so I think I was pretty much at the point now where and when you travel plans ... even if there's a pretty big advantageous\nRoost if it's fall or what are going out um own office and and and let that\nThe you know start developing a flair and and do it as quickly as possible rather than leave it alone\nThere will be a hundred percent in agreement with you I think one of the big things about fruit trees is because they're grafted somebody somewhere started this deal is saying oh always Barry ... a tree up to the graph pointer up above the graph white and which\nPuts in about eight inches ten inches today\nFor around ... and that's why I mean but\nYou talking about fruit trees coming into deep I think close to a hundred percent of the great models are come to us too deeply in the pot and I think they're they just they just do it to prop 'em up shade trees\nI guess it's better 'cause they're usually only one or two inches too deep but I I think the the big deal I'm fruit trees is a is just this misconception that you plant 'em as deep as the grasp all white and just nothing could be further from the truth\nYeah in the ... when they come in containers I'd probably are setting the container\nOr even too low to begin with a somebody was telling me ... years ago about technique Herman talking about the study was when I was first starting to talk about trees in too deep and I said have you ever heard the term yadda yadda and I can't\n... it was a term we're\nIn the end the growing operation the the propagation of new trees it works like this they put the tree down at the bottom of the pot and fill it up\nOf them because that holds its writer that makes it grow roots blowout mhm when they put a deep like that\nAnd that's what they get all the landscape architects you know or a besides me like ... trees you know and don't walk in a crook crookedness and that's one of the things I did to prevent that worried about the fact that cause all kinds of other friends [laughter]\nWell I you know but I couldn't agree more I liked characterize as narrow some trees yeah nice straight ... certainly\nYou know more formal type of thing but I I think some of these trees that have been blown around a little bit I Love driving along the coast down round rock or those winds sculpted trees\nThe Jews nothing's growing straight because the constant wind on it but uh back to the point of the of the roof lawyer exposure it's um I had it I don't think I don't think we can over talked about or I think it's something needs to be brought up\nRegularly and we've got it probably the most did it change who green the most prominent route flare out there is a one of those ...\nTo the back and hardly a day goes by that I don't walk somebody back there and say this is what the base of your great marvels your oak trees every tree and for that matter ... this is what her not looked like\nAnd it just is real nice having an example there to show people because I think a lot of people don't really understand how how much exposure you have to do they think they get down to where they just see the top of that route coming out and that's deep enough\nMost cases two or three inches deeper than that in my opinion creates a much better chance for the treated develop good routes there\nIs no question about it and it's pretty amazing how many how what a high percentage of trees have this problem and people ask why isn't anybody doing anything about ... the main reason is the tree can live and grow it appear\nTo be doing pretty well in too deep underground well\nQuite a long time and that's where the problem comes in because people say see the trailer it's when they're Seventy years as a truck that twelve inches in diameter\nOff it was it the right hides it will be taught at twice that die twice as big now some people I guess could argue that off the tree bigger than that\nWell what about the aphids and what about all those other things that you fight every spring I I think he just weekends the tree and as you and I've discussed many times that they're treated as we can buy anything is going to be more susceptible to damage from everything from ... to\nA number of the diseases and um I I think it all goes back many times to the the fact that people just don't realize how much is weakening that tree to be improperly planted\n... talking about and maybe we'll make a big big Dan in it at some point well\nI think one of the one of the other things to this we're we're talking among professionals is I think of at least a part of the problem in our part of the world a number of years ago\nIs a ... let's say as a mechanism to speed up the rate at which ah people canned up plants the wholesale nurseries popping plants up from a\nYou know the rose Potter from a foreign policy to a gallon container to a five gallon container to Fifteen whatever they stop paying the people doing that by the hour and started paying 'em by the piece you're going to get pay or many sense very thing you do\nAnd all of a sudden the big push was on the how fast you can pop things up\nAnd the easiest thing to do is just ... dumps him soil on top of it push it out of the way and go on to the next one and I think that's one of the reasons that virtually a hundred percent of the plants are improperly planted because we we took away the incentive to do it right and just replace it with an incentive to do it\nQuickly well we'll keep working on it I Hope all of the\nEvents coming up I wanted to tell some of your listeners that might be a sort of the parts of the world I'm doing a mother earth news fair in\nTopeka, Kansas very good and it'll be auto Sal I'm speaking twice on October the thirteenth or ... or or the world yeah\nAnd then the other one is there's got to be a farm and food Leadership Conference and Kenny and all the information for both of these on my website on Bert Dr dot com under a appearances but it's going to be an historic downtown ... which is worth the trip out there they've really done a great job the\nMuseum is still up there and that is well\nThat's right that's another thing to do while you're there\nAnd I anyway and when is the ... farm in ...\nIt's Tuesday a October the sixteen months they'll die I'm speaking it's a it's a two or three days they allow for my shoes on a on our website\nA farm in food leadership a cough for students McGarry you might have met her she out it yeah on who's behind it and invited me speakers a bunch of really good uh\nSpeakers on different subjects they're a little bit more on the agricultural a side but we'll be doing kind of a combination of my tree and pass controls all because I'm just doing one talk this deal\nWell you have a a busy week [laughter] and that's a good thing though I Love the opportunity for people to learn from the folks that do it right so I Will law I'll mention that on my show again tomorrow in so the one of them in Topeka, Kansas actually going to be next weekend and then in the middle of the week the following\nWeek will be just went in McKinney right very good very good\nAre you starting to see brown patch we're starting to see a ... showing up with all the rain and yet in a few who lights in in hot afternoons I'm In is out or whether it looks to me like it we're probably going to see a lot more of an unusual this fall it's been with the dry years we haven't seen much of it but it seems to be getting an early start down here this year\nWell not in not only had early star hairs when you're all summer here in for a while yeah and so the other people talk guard native Sarah ... couldn't be ... only shows up in the\nIn the fall and uh the beginning of the winter but that's not a true this year boy it popped up badly everywhere and the other thing and you are you headed there that's going on is and I'm here people talk about it all over the place\nIs this yellow wing of the site are saying yeah you said you're not saying the same definite\nLet's do for sure because this has been by far the worst year from the skaters I've ever experienced in every body is reporting the same thing and that nothing is working hard way\nWell it's an interesting thing though because I think you've talked about spraying the Beatty I even in places where\nYou don't have standing water and we've always you know recommended it to control the mosquito larvae\nBut I'm a lot of people seem to be finding that it has some sort of ... element of actually against us up ...\nTo ... and ... that's exactly what the deal if that's a that's a great tip to\nExperiment with ah put the a ... a ... and the boy with compost tea\nAnd it would be safe or just to the gear is you're just a a liquid top saying that ... ... if you'd like to bring a like a big difference in my uh\nWell I find it really interesting that are obviously in the Garrett juice or it is not affected the Mike rice or fungi since you're putting that in the ... pro now that is not having any negative impact and granted those were fungi rather than bacteria but uh\nUm I ... I started doing on a on a regular basis that\nOfficial bacteria and the pro also so ... yeah All right good stuff\nWell real good stuff you enjoy your puppies and uh have a great weekend and we'll surely forward that will just pick up where we left off next Saturday\nAt fun to see you next week\nWe'll look forward to an hour to an end with your ah with talks I guess next week we might be
