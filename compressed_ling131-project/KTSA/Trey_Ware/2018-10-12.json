decade ago when he stole the microphone for Taylor Swift over at the two thousand nine MTV Awards usually that's that's been that long ago\nA connoisseur same his political priorities are the same show why is everybody a freaking out in the media about him well John ... writes this morning\nThat just like the white Democrats who formed the KKK as there are the Democratic party in order to intimidate and suppress and destroy the political activities of the newly freed black population who were active and elected Republicans\nWide who the Democrats punished and made a public example of any black man or woman who dared think for themselves and who threatened the Democrat power structure\nNobody goes on to say during the era of Jim Crow white Democrats codified these tactics into law again to suppress any black political activity that threatened the white Democrat power structure\nHe says other than tactics methods change with modern day Democratic Party to protect their power to ensure that some Ninety five percent of black people continue to vote for them why Democrats primarily through their establishment media outlets are still trying to control black Americans you think she's on to something\nTime and again if you witness Clarence Thomas he says are Herman Cain or Condi Rice or Jackie Robin ... or Dr Ben Carson or Alan West cetera et cetera we have watched free thinking black men and women personally destroyed through political and media campaigns\nWielding ridicule and taught the apostate or Marcia so mercilessly slander ... by the mainstream media\n\nKnows he goes on to say the goal is to talk to fire these free thinkers before they awake at and aspire others\nTo make a public example of those who dare think for themselves I was just listening to a diamond in silk you know who they are there to YouTube posters who have become really really big celebrities and the Trump era there were one of the first ones to black lady's one of the first to jump on the Trump bat bandwagon back in twenty Fifteen twenty Fifteen\n\nOh that goes on to say and they were saying the same thing by the way that any time a free thinking black person thinks for themselves\nAnd steps off the reservation and it's not aligning themselves totally one hundred percent with the Democratic party they are a ... just totally miss line they are slandered their character as assassinated shown and so forth for daring to think for themselves\nAnd their their point is and this was ... point as well is that black people should only vote for the Democratic party as far as the Democrats are concerned\nAnd she they're saying and ... that's not true that it's okay to think for yourself and you don't have to just follow along and be a member of the Democratic party\n[noise] um when you look at what Trump has done the black unemployment rate is at record lows\nOr in the Arab Trump he's working on much needed criminal justice reform he's also fighting against the illegal immigration that undermines job opportunities in wages adage Trump wants to find a solution to the big problem in Chicago black on black crime up there [noise]\nSo what you're saying is the mainstream media has to destroy ... because ... is a direct threat to the Democratic party's power because a free thinking black man who might persuade other black Americans to think differently to open their eyes to what fifty years of voting Democrat has wrought on their\nFriends and their family and their schools and their neighborhoods\nAh is is the whole point of why they're going after Kanye West\nIn such a way so a diamond a ship was saying ... just basically the exact same thing that John ... he was saying is that this has more to do with making sure that any time there's a free thinking black person that comes along you have to slander\nThem you have to destroy their their character you have to get rid of them and shoved it you have to marginalize them

items ... exactly it was taking place\nAnd why is it taking place I hate to say this amongst is correct but uh some of the folks are it's a something I'd just like maybe Texas history or something but if I'm wrong about that please feel free to correct might but\nCould you too thanks good to tell us exactly in the summer what's going on I'm sure as to why\nWell I I'm not real sure about the wide part but ah what's going on is that they want to change the way the Alamo looks they have said for a long time that want to take it back to more the original footprint of the out of all the original way that it used to look and see what they're going to\nDo is they're going to a close the streets in that area they're going to a wreck some walls around the what used to be the original a courtyard and battlefield area of the of the uh Alamos fencing some barricades things like that they're building a big museum\nAnd Phil Collins is a big entertainer and he's been digging there for years so he has loaned a bunch of those artifacts that he has found to the museum\nThey're going to have a during business hours Ninety under six PM one entry point and you got to go through that museum because\nThey say that what they need to do is tell the entire story of the Alamo the three hundred year history of the Alamo and that includes before and after the battle of Eighteen thirty six that we all know that what we know this is they're what they're saying from Eighteen thirty six of just a small snippet of what the Alamo really represents\nThere is a um a a monument there to those who died at the Alamo and it's right there on Alamos street close to Houston Street it's called\nThe center of town you've probably seen it before they're going to move that down there by the main gr about five hundred feet to the south they say that they want to basically move it down there and open up this the original space there\nSo that's what's going on that's what's been all the flash point about this as far as the Y. is concerned\nThere they say that the Y. is to remove it back to it or take it back to his original concept and to tell the entire story of the Alamo that there's a lot of the Alamo that we leave out that we don't talk about when we only talk about\nThe six days in a an Eighteen thirty six or eight days and Eighteen thirty six the the actual battle time an Eighteen thirty six when we only talk about that we're leaving out so much more they out of all we need to talk about uh you know how Mexico influenced the Alamo before it\nBefore the battle of the Alamo how I Belong to Mexico at that time and Mexico's influence they call it a bi national approach to the Alamo now\nThat word by national meaning Mexico and the United states actually having influence on the Alamo over the years it's bringing in and I ... in my view the Mexican flag will fly there again and it will happen and it will be part of what you know the telling of the story is going to be so that's basically what's going on\nAnd do why they're telling us that it is going on Roger you're on gay TSA were trapped friday Roger\nOkay my question is there's a monument or memorial memorial should not be touched that's like building on Gettysburg\nThat she'll have oil Morial to those who died there\nThan it should not be tired and that is correct that is that's I mean isn't that are part of our law [noise]\nUm I don't know if it's part of the law or not but it shouldn't be touch it should not be moved to want to answer shouldn't go anywhere and there should not be any barricades or fences around the Alamo grounds this is what people are finally waking up to and and that is that they are going to erect some fences and barricades around the grounds like right now if you go down there right now\nYou're going to see chalk painted on the road you're going to see paint painted on Alamos street right there were those bricks are you going to see that\nAnd that's where they're going to be putting up walls and barricades if is is it's all already designed and all already laid out there the closing of the streets like if you grew up in San Antonio you went to the fiesta parades they pass in front of ... that won't happen anymore\nAll of that is going to be done away with and that whole area is going to be an area of like grass and trees and things of that nature\nBut ... ... people haven't understood I don't believe until just in the past few days\nThey're going to be fences and walls around that area and you won't have the unfettered access like what you have now right now you go down there you can go sit on the bench and look at the chapel itself you can go to that\nWe've done that for years all of my life we've done that but in the future you'll have to go

doing\nWhat we're directing traffic will get out of the street if you don't you're going into cops were going to give you one morning get back on the sidewalk at least people alone and if they had the motorists tell them loose and\nThese people are threatening to kick my ass and I'm Seventy four year old man a and they're telling me what I have to do you have saved threatened him they've committed a crime in every community in America including San Antonio where he is a crime to intimidate and by intimidate\nThat has a legal meaning but if I Walk down the street and bump my chested yours and say get outta here or I'll kick your ass I'd just committed a crime tray now I'd never do that to you 'cause you're a nice guy I think these people are thugs and they formed a mob\nAnd the police have been put on notice essentially if you do your job you're probably going to lose your job\nWell let me tell you about a video I was watching as well yes that's the one I was talking about another one too where there were some uh anti guys who were in the street they want um had a bullhorn they were shouting through the bullhorn a there was a cop that was part cat a corner down at the end of the street and he was just basically standing there against the trunk just watching\nAnd woman comes down in a wheelchair she happened to live in an apartment right there where they were yelling through the bullhorn and she came down and said hey would you please not be yelling through the bullhorn we're trying to get some sleep up here you know this is our houses our home and\nThey started screaming at her and threatening her and yelling at her saying\nYour home is up there get up there you leave us the you know what a loan and the F. this F. that\nThey never touched her but you're talking about intimidating to a woman who was in a wheelchair they certainly were very menacing and very threatening and I'm just thinking\n... ... is that community on edge up there ... you know the first time something happens when somebody actually retaliate or figures that they may be in danger I think about being here in Texas and if somebody is approaching somebody in a wheelchair\nWay and screaming at them and asked us and ask you that and they reach for their gun now we've got a big problem\nThat's right and let me give you a practical example of this doesn't even involve guns because you know Trey I carry and I believe in self defense right\nBut we have two cases one man who is a an independent conservative journalist who covers some of these mob actions in about a year and a half ago he was threatened by people carrying these big picket signs and they began advancing on him and he was afraid he was going to get his ass kicked he'd already had his previously a year and a half before\nIt had been knocked down his arm broken in two places his equipment stolen by the same group of people and he\nPulled his pistol out for four and a half seconds you can measure it because all of this was caught on video he has now been convicted felony crimes for merely pulling a gun out and getting the crowd to back off from him he was backing up away from them and they were advancing on him and all of this is on video\nSo that's the lesson number one the da's office will prosecute you for protecting yourself second example another motorist you may not have seen this video is merely easing down the street that's clogged up with an illegal street\nProtest and there are police nearby and when the crowd sees the car just you know easing down the street very slow\nThey began to surround the car and beat on the outside of the car and the man or woman in their ... they've got the address they've identified the driver and we don't know who it is but he he he's afraid\nAnd he begins to advance through and one of the protesters gets in front of the car to deliberately block it now to me I'm old enough I don't know if you are trade remember Reginald Denny in Los\nAngeles or who found himself as sure her situation and I was on the air while that was going on they dragged him out of the ... and and they beat him nearly to death row yeah\nSo I think a person in that situation has good reason to fear for their safety if not their life and they're now considering criminal charges against the dry wow\nWow that's how it upside down we really are the police\nCan't do anything God Bless the cops but if you know city all does not have your back are you going to give up your all your life your salary\nYou can leave even your freedom you can do the right thing\nYeah that's what happened in Maryland if you remember when all the riots were going on up there and the mayor told the police to stand down and they were going around the riots were going around burning stuff and and knocking buildings down over the it was just insane\nAnd we see this going on in Portland and Puerto such a beautiful city and we see all the beauty of downtown Portland yet right in the middle of it just looks like chaos\nWell trade mark Twain once famously said France is a very beautiful country except it's full of Frenchmen Portland is a very beautiful city I've lived here most of my adult life and yet it's full of antifa and a bunch of mobs who will hurt you if you don't agree with them and then you've got the former attorney general saying when they go low we kick",
