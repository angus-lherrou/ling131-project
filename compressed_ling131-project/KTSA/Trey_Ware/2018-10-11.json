eggers capital dot com joining the Stevens roofing news maker hotline a girl I ask you the question that I had several emailers asked me overnight my email box was full is the market going to recover\nYeah I think it's going to recover the thing is trade we talked about on Monday\nThe Federal Reserve raising rates is generally not for for the market and they've been doing it pretty consistently now for really three years\nAnd I think I disagree with President Trump that the feds to what they call loose meaning\nAre stupid too tight rights\nToo too fast and because it still is not normal in other words when we're not normalize right back to the levels where it should be based on all kinds of models\nNow having said that I think what got the market is in the last couple of days you saw Jay Powell who's head of the fed and his comments were what really got started and what did he say bond market and it went into the stock market he basically said that the economy is is is so good\nThat they are going to they could go past what they called neutral they couldn't go rape rates more than than we expect\nThat is not what the stock market or the bond market wanted to hear\nYou know and it doesn't make any sense to me and I'm just so I you know what I'm south Texas country boy trying to understand all this\nBut we have been and an eight year almost a decade long travesty you know if they call it the great recession that we have been in and now we're finally starting to see\nAn upswing in the economy we're starting to see people go back to work unemployment is coming down ... you know consumer confidence is really high why in the world would you want to choke this now\nWell because again low interest rates create all kinds of habit yes they're good to to speed things up but at some point you have to get rates going back\nAnd I understand that I mean I understand that we have talked about this but that but they're going way too fast with is they ... they need to slow their increases down and let the economy gets some legs underneath that are still going to chop it off at the knees before ... before he even has a chance to rebuild we got we still have a lot of rebuilding that I don't think\nWell I disagree I don't think they'd gone too fast and dust far the markets not worried about what they've done the fact is that they're projecting five more over the next twelve ... that's what the market's concerned about it's not it's not that we're sitting here you know two and a quarter is that what what could the market will stand up they go up to three and a half that's the concern\nAnd look at some point we'll see what happens here because Jay Powell could over the next several they say you know what you took what I said out of context we're still going to be data dependent that will Janet Yellen she always said let's look at the data and then we'll decide he seems bound and determined\nTo keep raising rate oh yeah guard list of what happens with the economy so to your point yes there is a danger here it's a very fine line of tapping on the brakes or slamming on the brakes they'd been camping on the brakes for three years now\nI mean we're only two and a quarter two and a half now for literally the last three years yeah but now you go from here twelve months for another one and a quarter\nThat's what the market's concerned about so we feed back down to comments a little bit and say oh well we'll see how it goes then we will be OK well part about this trade that it does create some short term fear and that's usually what leads to stock market bottom\nAs opposed to death by a thousand cuts\nWhile I understand that and we also have an election coming up here in the mid term elections in just a few weeks as well and it's going to have an influence on that as well but you got\nThe thirty year home loan hid five percent that's an eight year high and it definitely has put a\nA a cramp on things the volume of purchase applications went down the number of refinance applications went down as well\nUh it's costing more to get the money and obviously it should eventually but I just question the timing of all of us when we're trying to build on the economy and get a foundation laid for a a an economy is ready to take off and they keep ... plus\nPlus the IMF came out yesterday and said the rest of the world's not doing so hot and so that's that has an effect on on on the stock market to\nSure does and keep in mind though trade these long term interest rates are talking about like mortgage rates those aren't directly controlled by the Federal Reserve that's more a function of how the economy's doing the short term rates money market CDs those things are controlled by the Federal Reserve now they they influence long term rates\nBut I don't say it's all connected here [laughter]\nYeah the whole fear has been that they're raising short term rates faster than the long term rates are going up there's usually it's spreading between them right I mean you're going to lend money for Thirty years you'd better get compensated more than all ended up to three months and that hasn't been the case now we're starting to see well those things go up or long term right in short term right\nI Want my friends in the banking business to make money obviously they got to make money and I want people who have money in interest bearing accounts\nAnd ah you know fixed income folks whatever I Want them to make money as well I'm just saying from my perspective and again what do I know a heck I don't know anything other than just watching this stuff for a long time but I'm thinking okay\nYou guys are going way too fast going way too far away too fast and you're going to do this thing down and he got pulled us back into another recession that's the danger that we're facing here here's\nHere's the deal they'll trade remember one of the ... what does the Federal Reserve do when the economy starts to slug they lower interest rates you can't lower them for zero so part of this and that's why the president you heard it say about margin that's what he's referring to these saying this gives them if\nPlease do this once a year\nAnd a lane just about kills herself putting this together every year and plus all the election stuff that's going on this year and everything else that's going

I get kudos to the guy who shot the man and the just the employee told K. U. T. V. police interview the permit holder after the shooting they said he was cooperative\nThey don't know if he's going to face charges that said it is likely to shooting will be interpreted as self defense\nWe see this all the time and other media is not the media is is anti gun so then I got a report on these stories when a law abiding citizen carrying a gun saved the lives of other people and you know who they say the lives of a lot of\nTimes oh the cops\nPolice officers who are in a scuffle with a bad guy and the bad guy gets the cops gun and it just so happens there's an L. P. C. license to carry individual who is nearby or there and they save the lives of the police officer by dropping the suspect before the suspected\nShooter GOP it happens and it also happens in situations just like this where you got in this case it at a Starbucks you got to ... that's being beat over the head she's gonna yeah obviously this guy is is it in my view attempting to kill or if you're going to beat her over the head\nMetal basket and then the guy turns in terms that the guy with the gun and the guy with a gun drops it I'm Sorry but you can't carry a cop with you at all times\nAnd people out there in a lot of different places are unhinged and you see crime all the time\nAnd so when you hear these guys who say well we got to have gun laws and Margot they're discussing it right here in San Antonio more gun laws more restrictions on where guns can be sold and how they can be sold and who can sell them and all those kinds of things and any of those laws and any of those restrictions\nOnly restrict law abiding citizens if I can get one message across concerning this debate in this country the criminals are not driving over to acme guns and buying their guns that's not where the gang bangers bio\nThey don't go to bill's guns are Bobby's guns are Joes guns or shoes guns they don't that's not where they go\nThey bite off the street corner from some drug dealer or they steal it out of somebody's house and they go shoot people with it so the only time and the only people that you're affecting when you put more gun laws\nIt's a guy like this was a license to carry individual in Starbucks to save the young ladies life\nThat young lady is alive today because that guy was there as a citizen he was armed and ready to make stuff happened he saved her life and I I don't expect the media to talk about it\nBecause the you know therefore more gun restrictions but that right there is a prime example as to why law abiding citizens should have free and unfettered access to their guns\nAll the time all the time [noise]\nAll right so the animal a plaza plan was approved by two commissions we'll talk more about that because it's very clear now but not everybody really understands what's going to be going on with this plan will talk more about that and Rand Paul is revealing the media hit a key detail about the GOP baseball attacker\nAnd I I agree with Rand Paul on this entire matter and that if somebody is going to get hurt if they don't back it way down I Know why they're doing it I understand why they're doing is just wrong\nAnd uh they shouldn't be doing the reason that they're doing is because they lost everything else what else do they have they they have tried to run they have tried to do everything they can they they have no message there messages slash and burn\nSo what do they want to do now they destroy people's uh reputations like Brett Kavanaugh and when they lost it that now it's all about the constitution constitution is not right we've got to get rid of the electoral college\nBecause we lost the electoral college was fine until they lost\nAnd talk like what they're doing right now was wrong until they lost and now everything that they say was wrong is now right for them get rid of the electoral college destroy people's lives and livelihood and everything there ...\nPatients and everything about people just destroy them assassinate their characters\nAnd now that you know you can go out there and kick 'em go get them go getting their face run about a restaurant\nBecause they got nothing else what what else are they going to appeal to what else are they going to do at this point they've got nothing\nSo it is getting rid of the constitution a packed the courts they wanted to add to the Supreme Court and now they're\nQuestioning the legitimacy of the Supreme Court that's one of the things that Eric Holder was doing as well it's just not the gym and it's not a legitimate\nA body anymore why because Brett Kavanaugh's on there now and you lost its not legitimate anymore the entire Supreme Court get rid of it I mean really these people have lost their minds that's the bottom line they have lost their minds\nAnd if there's not a red wave to push back against that\nAnd that's going to be the fault of of conservatives and Republicans in this country but that is the answer to all of that\nNot getting back in their face not getting violent with them none of that none of that works what works is when you can show up on November six and caused a red wave in this country and then turn around silently you don't have to say a word and pointed scoreboard that is the biggest when that you could possibly have\nPoint at the school board they cannot win this by the way\nThis is the struggle of our Republic of our day just like our forefathers met their struggle of their day it is our time to meet our struggle of our day and that's what this is\nIf they win this this is going to be the norm this is going to be life in America because they're going to see this if they win in November they're\nGoing to see this as approval for all of these interrogations all these attacks all of this stuff about running Republicans out of restaurants all of these character assassinations they're going to say okay the ... that's what one so do morals that\nAnd the people who still have a little bit of civility on them that are on the left and the Democrats Joe Manchin and people like that that still have half a brain\nThose people are going to have to they're going to be forced into a position of either having to go to that and start you know are employing those kinds of tactics or they're gonna have to get out of politics altogether\nSo the only thing that's going to change all of that and push back against that and actually win against that and the call Matt down it's going to be a red wave it was going to be\nAn over well Ming vote for conservatives and Republicans whether or not you support the Republican Party at this point is irrelevant it is time to hold you know ...\nIf you feel like the Republican Party has left you and doesn't represent you I feel that way I feel your pain I Am right there with you are but it is time to hold your nose and I make sure the Democrats do not get in power\nAnywhere in this country or else this is going to be you're going to be putting a stamp of approval on what apple Brett Kavanaugh what is happening with Ted Cruz at the restaurant what happened was Sarah Sanders at the restaurant Hillary Clinton's comments about being an civil\nA Eric Holder's comment about kicking Republicans all of these things are going to be seen by them as that's what works guys that's what wins\nAnd you can't have that we can't go down that road in the United\nStates of America they are trying to tear us apart\nAs a nation that's what they're attempting to do the Democrats I'm Talking about that's exactly their tactic right now because they don't have anything else left [noise]\n\nWhat was the last time you were sitting in traffic someone honked at you and you considered it a positive experience most of the time when someone ... we get defensive because we think someone's angry with us that's the power of an emotion like anger even if we think someone might be angry with us it upsets us\nThis is one of the reasons the Bible teaches us to be careful with our anger in one place we're taught in your anger do nuts and not let the sun goes down on your anger anger handler you to something wrong something painful or something fearful but then let the anger go before it turns into something bad like contempt contempt diminishes a person's worth\nAnd when people become contemptible to us they become hurt them all this is why Jesus Says in the sermon on the amount that it's not enough to avoid murder deal with the angering your heart before it becomes something worse\nThis is mark after the ... the church of Christ check out our
