and first of all in order to function at all your body needs magnesium it's probably of all the vitamins I could list magnesium is probably the most important vitamin on the planet right now\nI've not heard a whole lot about magnesium ... why is magnesium so important\nThere is over three hundred and twenty five bio chemical reactions that mechanisms involved with it it's almost like a hormone wow and for example if it was low levels of magnesium your heart won't beat\nWho very important factor in life you would say so in\nFact let me just read a list of some of the conditions are associated with magnesium deficiency is okay um you have attention deficit disorder Alzheimer's or anxiety asthma autism chronic fatigue syndrome congestive heart disease caused the patient diabetes\nFibromyalgia high blood pressure insomnia migraine headaches multiple sclerosis muscle cramps Parkinson's osteoporosis and the list goes on and on and on\nAnd then this this is associated with a a lack of magnesium in the money\nSimply a lack of magnesium bully too so it's nothing that really mess around with that what happens is that you need that many of them in your body in order for the calcium to be absorbed\nOh so it's it's a necessary thing in order to get the first component which is calcium\nThat's right they work in combination with each other out there's many more practical applications of this ... formula ... first of all like I said you drink it gets into your system and one of the first thing we use it for in our clinic is for people who are under a lot of

pain muscle spasms migraine headaches there's a whole category of of various I'd like to discuss with you\nWow that's fantastic some of those things that you've named seem to be age related or or things that we experience as we grow older is there a link there yeah\nThere's a vicious circle that I'd like to discuss what happens is that when a person has a magnesium deficiency\nSpecifically magnesium they don't absorb their food as well and so they go into what we call mal absorption syndrome which millions and millions of Americans have and it's not like you feel sick or you know this or that you it might be overtime just starting to feel more tired and tired and tired mhm and that's just a real graduate overtime type of thing\nAnd a lot of people justify that they're getting old and they just need more threats or whatever\nRight and that's what I Would think that what happens is that when when you get less absorption you actually increase the efficiency in your system of museums\nAnd that and that started to take the calcium out of the bones you start getting ... you start getting um muscle loss because it also reduces the muscle mass and pretty soon before you know it you are feeling old you and your body that actually starting to manifest at\nAll due to a simple lack of these nutrient\nCalcium and then they'll let me tell you and it is simple the problem in

Michael ... on the phone today and he's telling us about stress and how important it is to ensure that you've got the proper nutrients in your system specifically calcium and magnesium\nAnd how much of an impact that has on our overall health so I guess one of the things that people should really be aware of is because this is an instant thing that triggers you to say oh I'm sick but you know instead happens gradually over time\nIt's very possible that people might not even be aware that there is a deficiency of calcium and magnesium and thereby\nWell that's the thing is that a deficiency is or not like I'm a water main break into where you have a real noticeable thing the right to their little drips little leaks here and there and so what we have is a cumulative effect\nWhere a person starts to go downhill just a little bit at a time yeah to the point where they don't realize how bad that actually gotten before it's too late\n[laughter] don't you think is you'd mentioned insomnia we talked about that a little bit what about back pain\nCalcium and neither is excellent for back pain because the calcium goes into the muscles magnesium actually help the translators and the nerve and when you take this combat formula many times they will calm your back paid wow\nI Know I I have a couple of years ago I herniated disc and my back ... and I always try and everything and I took out the comebacks formula\nAnd I drank it and I couldn't believe that difference within about a half hour functional again not wasn't completely gone but I I drink it over ten day period and it it's a completely alleviated the problem\nNow what about heart disease\nHeart disease is or something you have to watch out for about ... and going down the genetic line yeah and if anyone had any history of heart disease or you have even had bypass surgery you should be on this complex formula and I can't say that without enough emphasis because it's something that will completely give you a new lease on life\nIsn't that amazing um we talked about arthritis what about joint pain well\nThe arthritic joints really respond to this\nAnd I recently gave a can of this lady who was suffering from fibromyalgia where she was having pain and just about every joint in your body can be entered yeah could be in her neck it could be in her album and um and I gave it to her one week and I saw her the next week\nAnd I swear Chris I did not recognize are really just that the lady that was sixty four years old and the first time I saw her she looked like she was\nEighty four years old and a week later\nShe was bright you had a beautiful smile her eyes were gleaming and I I honestly had to ask my wife who this lady was and and sure enough that she was the one who took a week of ah the formula counteract formula\nAnd um she said she got a really good week of sleep for the first time in years and that her pain was much better and she ordered three more cancer and make it out to her friends and that's amazing\nAnd when I use this with professional athletes I'm a doctor for the U.S Olympic team and I had a number of athletes he within us before their events so they could sleep well and they wake up in their muscles were in real relaxed shape\nYou really wouldn't think that a such a small component of near normal diet can make such a profound impact over the way that you feel\nOr say what's happened is that in the last fifty years the American diet has greatly changed\nAnd the nutrition has greatly changed and add to that in the medications many people are on blood pressure medications or anti anxiety drugs\nOr heart medications and many of these things also blocked the absorption of calcium magnesium in the system you know the very drugs that are trading the conditions that your body is experiencing because that's deficient in ... and many of them is also blocking further absorption\nSome it's really it's really a rat race it sounds like it's a vicious circle\nThanks Chris rates have you with you\nSo let's get right into this whole stress issue you know stress is such a normal part of our daily routine these days but why should we all be concerned about it and more specifically what's going on in our bodies and one of the warning signs that we should be looking for\nA while you know there's two ways to look at stress on is what we call mental stress on the other the other is how stress affects your body as a doctor I'm more interested in how it affects your body sure so the waste stress affects the body is this a what a person's under stress the body transpose as the stress that tension\nAnd your muscles end up contract and everyone feels that and they're in the upper ... right at a doctor I'm more concerned about the muscles that you don't feel\nSuch as the muscles in the arteries oh that guy up and the muscles the heart is a giant myself over and the muscles in and around your digestive tract mhm because these are the things that are resulting in in a heart disease digestive difficulties\nAnd I want to talk a little bit on your show today about nutrition because there are two nutrients that completely handle the body in terms of stress okay now according to the research that I've been involved with it's it's as simple as calcium and magnesium\nCalcium and magnesium right okay\nWhen you're deficient in calcium and magnesium a lot of things can happen counting magnesium for example is needed in order to go to sleep at night and\nHow many people you know they just don't sleep while you wake up tired your body hurt more pretty soon it starts to wear down and pretty soon you get sick and you have a condition that people are suffering for pain and osteoporosis and fibromyalgia and cramps and their legs and we're illnesses so there's something wrong with this picture\nAnd it has to do it not how much calcium someone taking in their diet or how many calcium supplement or how many in Athens you chew it has to do with simple absorption is that calcium getting absorbed into your body\nWith Kelsey um being something to do with stress season calcium for building bones well\nYes okay yeah and it does build your ... but you see one percent of the calcium actually circulates in your blood\nSo in that one percent starts to drop it could affect your heart your brain your kidneys your organs and your body shutdown actually died\nWow this is all one percent of the calcium always has to be in your system and there's two sources of calcium one isn't the diet you know and to us from the bones themself\n... absorb it back from the bones of ...\nThat's right and I say and what you just discussed right now leads to one of the major causes of a condition that the fact and twenty five million Americans right now which is called osteoporosis right which is a weakening of adult now\nAnd that's due to the body deriving the calcium from the bones instead of from the ... tradition yep\nOkay and so we have to do is we have to find a way to put calcium back in the diet now you think that would be really easy sure just drink milk\nJust drink milk or you know a lot of green leafy vegetables and that sort of thing but first of all people don't do that right and second of all the the quality of the calcium that comes from our diet has been decreasing in the last fifty years really yeah because things like pastures Asian who they're irradiated um the calcium as leads from the soil and\nPeople are taking medications that block it so\nThe actual calcium is that being absorbed in the body okay and then you see people taking toms and calcium supplements you know they buy the house would start driving right but these things don't absorbing the body the topic\nFor a couple of reasons one uh when you take a let's say an antacid that had the calcium in it like a ... first of all calcium does that absorb in the body unless it's an anesthetic environment but see what happens when you take a tub with an antacid\nOh okay so even if you're getting calcium in the in the antacid itself is not being absorbed\nI see because it has to be in a in an answer an environment for it to be absorbed\nExactly okay now we have a product called the ... formula\nMy comment formula it's natural and the differences is that the powdered and what happens if you put it in hot water and you mix it up and you drink it down in a liquid instead of a pill\nAnd it absorbed into your system\nWow so that sounds that problem that\nWell yeah because when calcium and easy Myrna liquid state it absorbs ten times better than in any other state\nWow that's great matter of fact yes I'm I'm reading the can right now says a fancy absorbing calcium and magnesium beverage powder\nWell it comes down to absorption one of the ways to tell if you're not observing calcium is take a look at what drugs are taking are you on high blood pressure medication you need something for your kidneys or you want pain medications you need sleeping pills that the calcium and especially the magnesium being absorbed ... you're not going to suffer from all these things\nMy combat formula does absorb incredibly in the body the thing is is that what do you take my comments formula but not like well well I feel better\nHave thousands of people are ready to the doctor pain 'cause I Can't we're thirty minutes after it took to counter the pain in my wrist went away or I was able to sleep for the first time in Iraq I mean this is really amazing\nI Want to take a moment here to let your listeners know that if you want to get a free book

that we've been talking about a including being able to\nExtend your life but you know when you have the government saying look all you need is sixty milligrams of vitamin C I mean you can see where people are confused\nWell Chris I said in the beginning of the show here that there's two problems with the vitamin C. that you can buy one is getting enough of it yeah and second having the right form of vitamin C. here's the thing I did go to the supermarket before\nI got here [laughter] okay and I brought some vitamin C. and I I went and bought these and I'd like to just show you what's out there so let's go through this\nThis particular vitamin C. it has five hundred milligrams of vitamin C in itself right off the bat you'd have to take three tablets to get the same amount of vitamin C that's in my supersede twenty two okay All right All right but I Want you to read some of the ingredients\nAll right so this one has a vitamin C. well it's just one type of score but gas it right it's so it's a single type of vitamin C. okay then it has cellulose now cellulose as ground up newspaper alright the next one is uh vegetables Sterritt Ghassan now that's an oil all over again so the pills come out of the machine when they form\nA and the next one is a silica silica sand sand like the beach\nAll right so here's another one try this one here okay so there was a national brand here right right so it's just five hundred milligrams okay this is a true of all yes All right so take a look at the ingredients okay I'm person green is sucrose sugar okay ... sugar sodium a score but\nThat's a form of vitamin C that's attached to salt so now you're getting sodium\nRight vegetables Derek acid that sat lubricant again and empty and see yellow number six there you go a number\nSix so now

able to drink it down is water soluble goes right to work and your body and it has\nThe proper amount of vitamin C. per survey there's Fifteen hundred milligrams per serving ... there's nothing else on the market like it I've done tons of research vitamin C. has over a hundred thousand studies and it's really survive the test of time what do these studies suggest what are they saying well I'll give you I'll give you a couple of headlines\nThis study was conducted at the University of California and it found that people who took vitamin C above the RDA above sixty milligrams increase their lifespan up to six years\nThey also found that death from cardiovascular disease were reduced over forty percent ... a study reported in the international journal vitamin a nutrition\nConcluded that when you have high concentrations of vitamin senior system blood pressure comes down ... here's another study according to the American Journal of epidemiology\nPeople that had more vitamin C in their diets had greater lung volume and they measure lung volume by Miller leaders and so those who increased their vitamin C. every day had an increase of twenty two millimeters now that's a lot especially if you're an asthmatic a smoker\nIf you're someone that has allergies when you get the lung volume up you get more oxygen in your system our energy that's just sort of vitamin C. wow\nNow earlier you you talked about the connection between vitamin C. and weight loss how does that work\nWell this is kind of groundbreaking research on vitamin C. and weight loss but what happens is vitamin C is a natural appetite suppressant and it also increases your metabolism and your energy when your energy goes up yeah who start feeling better you can go out and take a walk let's burn some of it off\nDoctor but it gives us great to see it again Chris is great to be here you know most of you probably know the doctor can it gives us a nationally recognized authority on both natural and alternative health he's also a very successful chiropractor he's been son out by top Hollywood celebrities\nProfessional athletes Olympic athletes and he continues to be very involved in some of this nation's top health concerns so Dr biggest what is this how secret that you've been talking about\nWell at the secret is actually getting the right amount and the right form of vitamin C.\nVitamin C. All right well uh vitamin C is is not really new though\nNo vitamin C is not new but it's still a very vital and essential nutrient for optimal hell and unfortunately Chris vitamin C. has taken a backseat to other nutritional trans the bottom line is with out enough vitamin C. and the right type of vitamin C.

when you get a foot past going um you can do everything you want to trying to improve it but as long as you keep walking on it is going to keep it worn down\nAnd I guess that's both good and bad and that she has a particular path she likes to follow\nAnd I'm going to tell you it's always no matter what you do even if you get it looking a little bit better is always going to be more worn down and then the you know then the surrounding grass so\nI tend to suggest that you in effect maybe even make it a little bit better pathway for her to run on actually defined it as a path with maybe some decay granted or something like that\nBecause I can tell you compost I can tell you fertilizer I can tell you to oversee that with winter rye but all those things are going to be a temporary fix because it's just it's going to keep getting worn down\nNo matter what you do unless you physically put some sort of barrier there enforcer to run a different path and then whatever used for barriers probably gonna\nCut off the sunlight and the grass is not going to do any better so at this point I Would give in to it and let there be a path from you know porch to back fence and I think that's going to be the most satisfactory thing for you\nBut uh anything you can do to spread those limbs out is going to increase the production from those trees and a man had may come a little bit easier to
