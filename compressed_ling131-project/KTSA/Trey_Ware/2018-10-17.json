was asked about health care and of course Robert Iraq is all about expanding Medicare he's about spanning expanding Medicaid\nHe's about single payer socialized medicine government banking and control of your healthcare social policy is all about that is a Democrat social so he was asked about that last night and how are you going to pay for it ...\nIf universal healthcare is when it cost trillions of dollars what'd you cut from the federal budget or how much you're going to raise my taxes to pay for that let's start with the goal what what is it that we're trying to achieve what makes sure that everyone can see a doctor press positive reception\nRemember the question what are you going to cut from the federal budget or how much you're going to raise my taxes to pay for it that was the direct question All right go ahead\nAnd make sure that everyone can see a doctor for their prescription medications take their child to a therapist being well enough to live to their full potential over the

Iraq Obama we know how much of an empty suit he was\nHe has been anointed by the Democrat leadership to take the lead here and to be a guy that everybody has got to focus on on the left and he's got um\nSwimming remember Obama when he was like we have any water I got another one pass out over here remember that when he was on the first campaign tour do does and the other one passed out over again as our water over here\nThat's what this guy is all about he is a non answer answer and that's exactly what he would bring to the state of Texas He's dangerous he would be dangerous to the state of Texas if he ever became a the senator here\nSo we're talking about that coming right up your phone calls to hunt deer o five nine nine fifty five fifty five that's what I thought about what do you think about it though maybe you're a big Robert ... what do you think two one zero\nFive nine nine fifty five fifty five did you watch the debate\nWas an interesting it's super exciting and did you get all ready to go to the polls and fired up and boy now you're ready to go vote two one zero five nine nine fifty five fifty five your calls comments thoughts questions coming right up Katie essay [noise]\n\nOh no not again it happens every day you're on the road your vehicle transmission fighting for us to live your dream mission is nicer properly results could be costly\nCharging cuts veterans mission expert takes charge started cuts would give you an honest assessment and what do you need to rebuild replacement or just the food chain from minor a major ...

from the federal budget or how much you're going to raise my taxes to pay for it go\nOver the course of their lifetime and I want to make sure that working families pay less for health care costs than they do today so here's some stuff that we can take to get to your answer or we can expand Medicaid this is the state the left hundred billion dollars oh your touch\nA tease I thought you said you're going to get to the answer then you say you were going to answer that direct question that's what you just said here's what we're going to get to the answer the question was I mean just remind you Rob what's the question was what are you gonna come from the federal budget or how much you can raise my taxes to pay for direct question\nOn the table expand Medicaid more working Texans are able to me well enough to go back to work to be there for their families will get introduced Medicare as an option on the\nWrong just a ... round Rob Rob okay what are you going to come from the federal budget and how much you can raise my taxes\nThe increase in premium costs and expand selection and choice and then we can take the lead as the state that is the least ensure to the United states who perhaps and better understand the consequences\nOkay okay I Can't stand anymore I Can't stand you are and that's why your wife screaming at the television last night\nMore than just admitted to ten five nine

hundred if you're tired of dealing with insurance companies that don't return phone calls or they have a last mitigate or you know what that is\nNo I did not hear from all over the world and they weren't talking to people who were here and they were very it out on the radio and I wonder I Wonder why and hopefully somebody else saw that on the end they\nDid that they didn't really see how people from all over the world we're interested in Great Britain Miller and I don't know that they're hoping that Robert when people coming across the border yeah\nOr way that I was wondering if anybody thought that what they thought that perfect the net for other rape yeah wonder white Indian three\nWell ... let me try to let me take a crack at that okay and uh let me try to explain why people from outside of the United states but also from all over the country are watching this race very closely\nThis would be a a feather and the cap if they turn Texas blue and they have been pouring a lot of money in here from sorrow some people like that outside who are trying to buy the races and make no mistake about this at all\nOr Rob O'Rourke has bought and paid for by these people make no mistake that's why he's got thirty eight million dollars this quarter alone right\nThey realize that if they end up turning Texas blue which they had been working on now for I guess a couple of decades working really hard\nIf they're able to do that then you'll never get another conservative Republican president ever again that's the long game and all of this\nBecause with the situation being what it is and by the way over in Florida they have a Democrat socialist leading to be governor of Florida okay he's in he's adorable by ten points\nSo if you lose Florida and you lose taxes up to about conservatives you'll ever see a conservative president ever again in the history of our country\nIt'll be just what they're trying to do is just what they have done to California and the northeast are trying to turn Texas that way because of our number of electoral votes and you do you own a California you own New York and Massachusetts\nOr the northeast and you own taxes and you'll never get another Republican or a conservative president ever again this is all about the presidency this was all about winning over Texas is all about turning Texas blue same thing in Florida if they can win Florida and control Florida and hold Florida and turn Florida blue\nThen again the same thing is true and that's what they're that's why there's so much interest in most these people are very patient they play the long game and when you talk about somebody like a Soros who was buying a candidates in this in this state like crazy and the amount of money to him\nAnd attempts dire and others are pouring into Texas right now trying to turn it blew that's the reason\nI didn't see who your specifically referring to but I Know what the plan is here and why this is so important and we can go back over and over again I refer to this in a blog this morning really who early on that's the name of the blog\nBut when you look at the economic evidence that's happening right now in our country and particularly when you look at the economic evidence is happening in the state of Texas you can't even take a chance at screwing that up\nIt would be the ruins nation of Texas and you ruined Texas and you turn Texas blue and turn it into a Democrat socialist state like Robert O'Rourke is you turn Texas into that\nVenue ruin most of the United states of America we are right here in Texas the last bastion freedom and liberty for the United states of America the rest of these countries until like the big areas again California the northeast and what have you\nThey have slipped to socialism they have a socialistic contracting the and the socialist and the communist are very interested in flipping\nTexas to socialism as well that's why this race is a maximum of importance to both sides and the stakes couldn't be higher [noise]\nThis Ramsey reality check brought to you by the bomb law firm\nHere's Dave Ramsey with today's Ramsey reality check I have a civil rule if someone is bold enough to ask me for my money on bold enough to require they took the necessary steps to improve their behavior in order to receive it for them either welcome help or they'll get mad but helping people I mean\nAnd that's why people like sorrow so pouring money into into ... campaign\nOn and they're working the systems in individual states in Florida's case\nThere are different parts of Florida where Democrats campaign well there are parts of Florida where they don't do very well\nAnd it's a candy strategy that they're using that tried to take it I think at Florida votes for this democratic stamina suicidal not only because of his policies is going to focus in taxes and kill everything that makes the state great\nBut he doesn't like Florida you look at this guy and his staff his staffers keep getting caught folding anything was hatred for the citizens that are supposed to be voting for him I think it's incredibly dangerous to vote for someone that clearly lows the citizens is state\nAs so many of these Democrats do it's amazing that any of these people are in close races that's the medic question about this so called blue wave maybe it's falling apart and a lot of Democrats are going to lose by a couple of points in the end but some of their candidates are so absurd Christian send them how she's still in the race could she hate\nThe people will proceed any more could she loads and despise them because she make it any clearer that that she hates them with every fiber of her being\nBut it's a close race you know it's it's just amazing and what is the lesson of all that if the blue it falls apart and the Republicans when all these racist by one point should they feel good about that or should they feel scared that such lousy Kennedy's came that

that's when they get Gerald in here let me ask this question and then you and I will go to some of these questions about the charter amendments as well so Gerald you're on the TSA your question please\nYes um [noise] well that's just my personal experience several years ago I put together a petition to\nHang on hang on just like a jar let me let me get your right to your question if you don't mind because I'm On a limited time right\nUp the reason why I asked this question it was trying to make this statement by experience is is the city hall had to listen to that it's very um especially in the situation that I was at and\nAnd with things that are coming up right now I was the mayor to explain in detail why we should both do for proposition ...\nOkay All right that's good enough good question and Mr Mayor go right ahead\nYou know appreciate your question there on it and you're right a citizen of disagreed frequently for actors citizens or disagree with just about every decision that the council makes\nA the truth in the matter is the petition threshold has been working in fact if it was it was too high\nWe wouldn't be talking about this right now are on many occasions aged village Applewhite\nUh many occasions additions to the city council we deal with those are in the way the constitution outlines of what this amendment would do is change our constitution and make it really really really easy for any special interests with enough\nMoney to buy their way onto the ballot overrule every single wide\nI on the budget every zoning rule every street every sidewalk every extra cop on the street could be overturned by a single specialist interest with a few thousand dollars that's not giving you more of a boy's back that's taken away by putting special interests are in between you and your elected officials\nDoes it and this was a question that won head emailed in earlier in the wake Mr Mayor does it take the power away\nAnd the people because the city council their elected representatives are not going to have the the say so ultimately it will be special interest is that it is that the main thing here\n[noise] Ah yes because it basically lowers the bar a four petitions that are generated by special interests to pay for a petition had lawyers are from out of town and that's exactly what's happened in this case um there are companies that are sprouting up just for the purposes of being\nBought a by special interests to deceive people into what they're signing to put anything that they want on the ballot\nOr rather than good ideas coming to us now they are going to be someone special interest agenda uh made possible by a special interests who purchased these petitions through position companies\nAll right so a Naomi wrote into and her question was specifically about that what are you concerned about uh not having the power or having the people have more power the people and being more accountable to the people that's her question\nI Want the people at San Antonio to have the power not special interest organizations that go to petition companies to buy their way onto a ballot and I really don't want the citizens of San Antonio because of those kinds of agenda is to suffer from the tax increases and the cuts services that the financial ah agencies and\nUh the economists are telling us are going to happen if that kind of uncertainty is brought to our city people or San Antonio will have\nThe authority and have shown a willingness to\nPetition their government and they do it via their
