I cannot believe what they what they put up in their news\nWhen they put up in their news feeds you know and what they allow you to say and what they don't allow you to see\nUh I I I happen to believe that in my own mind I happen to believe that they manipulate that so you see certain things certain times and you don't see other things that other times you see stories that are favorable to work I Believe and stories that are unfavorable to cruise I Believe\nI truly believe that they're doing that but it didn't play in the news at these different sites because they want a war to win and they got us by the who harsh because what else are you going to do if you're going to participate in the Internet are you going to dissipate in social media these companies run at all so they got you by the who has\nThat so they are swaying public opinion uh by the way that they present the news that's my view on all of that I'm so let's talk about the police saying real quick Castro controversy and I want to be perfectly clear on all this and then I'll take your calls at two one zero\nFive nine nine fifty five fifty five you have walking Castro go into these polling places what keen on patrol I feel safer just kind of like a new ... movie\nYou know it's a ... and the poll God he's just walking around these places kind of lurking hanging out see what he fine\nFirst day a printer broke down and you had to have a press conference about a printer breaking down then he sees a couple of police officers doing their job\nPatrolling aside and then he makes a big scandal about that makes a big hoo ha about that and the next thing you know the police department is getting into him and issuing an order for their guys to not go after they had told the guys to\nGo apparently\nSo let me go through once again the order they came down from assistant chief James flavor and that was supported by chief bill McManus yesterday\nI received information our officers have been observed patrolling through and remaining stationary in the parking lots of polling early polling locations around the city of the last couple of days\nNow I told you that I had received a number of messages from cops yesterday that told me they were told that their roll call to go do it to be there to make sure everything's good do their job now you know I've been told that you guys have been there\nWhile they officers have done nothing wrong patrolling the ... part of the normal duties listen to this for this was important we must consider the viewpoint of those citizens who may have concerns about the presence of authority figures now I'm going to pause there for just a minute because is that the new standard for policing\nIf you're going to say that we are concerned we must consider the viewpoints or those citizens who have concerns about the presence of authority figures than where else are you going to bar and banned cops from being\n\nOr you're going to keep them in I Would imagine that there's probably going to be some people over for us to this you're going to have some real concerns you know about seeing some authority of St cops in their uniforms\nFor our they'd been maybe maybe there's some people that are hanging around over there on ... street near the McDonald's down there looking for a ride for work maybe they would have some concern about ... what do you think\nSo so so how far does this now reach how far out the you extend this and and my other question would be have you already been participating in this have you already been telling cops they don't go here do you have a do you have a no\nGo no show list or go no go list [noise]\nUm let's see what else let's just pick it up consider the points to those citizens who may have concerns about the presence of authority figures such as police officers in close proximity location we're voting is taking place now again we're not talking about cops who are walking through the polls they're not going inside you know going\nThere and let me see ... ... ... ... to see a lot of cigarettes hanging out of Monica limits I Know I went to see who you're voting for none of that nothing is\nThese were two guys outside in a parking lot and where the lines were and were traffic wise that's kind of where you want a cup you know you've got lines people who disagree with each other and you got and you've got a lot of traffic you kinda want to cop\nNearby I Know I Do and plus\nWhen you go to vote you can't take your own good and you can't you can't concealed carry so you have checked out in the car or leave it at home so now you really are vulnerable\nI kind of like the fact that there is a blue badge right over there they're not walking around inside their not intimidated people who'd you vote for ... hey hey you you red shirt come here who you're voting for it they're not doing that none of that was going on none of that\nSo the order continue with this in mind and structure officers to refrain from patrolling through a parking in close proximity to polling locations in the city unless they receive a call for service\nTo that address [laughter] I had a number of people call me as I said okay well I was going to call them [laughter] I'm just go goal is to say the cup over here and voting well that's called services and\nAll this started because walking Castro is starting a pot and that's what he does he's an S. word stir victory or on K TSA were trapped friday Victor\nThat all candidates and all these signs and all this crap or needs to be banned from all polling places that it shouldn't exist anymore but that's you know that's a different dog to hunt with another day you know uh but I think none of that should happen at polling places [noise]\nOkay I just curious as to why he was there is that I didn't hear\nHim I don't know it's it's it's really weird it's kind of like use lurking around these places are looking for stuff on the first day they had a printer malfunction at another place and he lost his mind about it freaked out over a printer failure and then he said last palm was looking for cops so I don't know I I guess he's got that's his new gig he's not busy enough with other stuff in his life I guess\nThe new gig to hang out at polling locations I I don't know I really don't know a shot anger on K TSA ... Charlie\nGood morning trade thank you so much for those callers who just called in to your show I'm just to reiterate what you said my husband and I were going to pull the Republican ... looked at each other and said well we'll we'll wait we can't do that\nBecause if there is a Democrat in a libertarian running ... to the for the libertarian ... we don't want to give that though the way you know encourage\nThat and and the other thing that I'm doing too and I'm not I'm not trying to tell anybody else out to vote but the thing I'm doing is I'm voting against George Bush because we ... I totally if you vote straight Republican then you're automatically vote for him I'm not going to get my vote\nMe neither yeah thank you train yeah\nGood stuff thanks Charlene presented Renee you're on K TSA betrayed go ahead ray [noise] uh\nYeah so you're saying that the police department cannot go to the polling areas when they get a service called\nNo that's not what I'm saying that's that's the only time that they can I said I said exactly the opposite of what you just said it it it's not a stand downloaded that oh yeah it's a standout order no it's not yeah\nBecause if you can download it wouldn't go to the polling place for surface call\nNo I asked my Kelly the head of the Indian yesterday and I'm Sorry your exaggerating a stand to listen to my aunt's are you going to talk over a year interrupting me already whatever have a good day today could be such paying the but what do you call here eight grand you're on K TSA go ahead Adrian\nHey good morning had started to you you too might might my question I coach actually yesterday and didn't get it get get the answer but my my question is who is chief managed his boss who does he answered Cheryl scholar says okay so she gave the order to him who\nCame I don't I don't know she gave the order I don't know I don't know it it all we know is\nThe order that was sent out came from assistant chief James flavor in and then yesterday ah our own ah ah Dennis Foley put up a story here saying the chief backs that order\nI can find one man said yesterday we received several calls about possible voter intimidation due to SAT officers being president at various polling places I'm confident our officers weren't engaged in any of this behavior but we took additional steps out of respect for the political process uh what\nWhat I what concerns me about that is who in the world would be a intimidated by us say PT officers being anywhere near you I guess it I guess if you are breaking the law or you have broken the law or whatever then you would be intimidated by us ADD being anywhere\nTreat treat my question also is how does joking Castro he he's a congressman how does she have the power to to issue any kind of water whatsoever here in San Antonio\nWell who did he who who does he call I don't get this done I don't know see that's the thing I don't know if he called somebody or if they just got the tweets and saw well we better respond to that we were better do something in a hurry we don't want to make the Castro's mad\nWhich is true I mean it it it if if you if you don't know already Adrian the influence of the Castro's downtown particularly on is enormous enormous influence that he has downtown\nOf all the sheriff's going into hard burger over the everyday activities of what happens in the city it's it's a they're they're they're influenced downtown is not is not minimize just because they're they're now federal\nFigures but I don't know if I don't know who if he contacted anybody or if he called somebody said hey this that or the other I Know he put out a tweet and then the police responded to the tweet\nSo there is wrong on both sides there is wrong on on walking side and there's wrong on SAP D's side for issuing this stand on order do not go to these places unless there's a service called\nAnd uh that's that's just wrong these guys patrol that's what they're supposed to do particularly so so so what you're saying is we only want you there is there's going to be a problem otherwise we don't want you there we don't want you to try to prevent\nThe problem we want to wait

reporter then I'm listening to every announcer\nThey're calling these ... these people critics of the president oh\nNo worse than that worse than that they're calling them Trump targets Trump targets on CNN all day yesterday on the grill on the bottom it said all of these packages mailed to Trump talked ten Trump targets\nOkay but the question is instead of calling him critics like they just disagreed with his share of seats why aren't they really calling them out as a people who are calling for the opening a restaurant and gauge it faces oh yeah\nYeah well they're not they're not going to do that it ... this is the hypocrisy of people on the left and that is when they are faced with something that is something they have been talking about for many many months now getting their face we kick them when they're down\nGoing into restaurants and harassing them covering up ... out there doing all kinds of violent acts\nThey're covering up for them and their media you when was the last time you saw a report about antifa weather out there every day I go to Portland, Oregon and see what they're doing up there they cover up for all to the left activities that are harassing or even dangerous or violent but when it comes to somebody on the right and we don't know that this person is from the right that's why I'm saying\nThis thing is got something ask you about it and I can't put my finger on it right now I don't know what it is but it you know if the Democrats can have feelings than I have feelings too\nAnd I feel like there's just something weird about this whole package story particularly since none of them went off thank God but now we're finding out from NBC of all places that several of them that have been examine couldn't have gone up so if this was meant to scare are meant to\nInfluence the election at all who benefits by that who who would benefit by having Democrats targeting was suspicious\nIn art packages in order to make the media have by the way I thought it was also interesting that they all had the same talking points and got on a started to talk about how this is Trump's fall Trump is to blame trumps the guy Trump did this Trump's words\nOkay well you know you immediately went to that what happened to wait\nFor the evidence to come in I I just I don't know what it is but something about this story is under my skin a little bit like I'm going to I I don't know I just I don't feel comfortable with what we're hearing right now James you are on K TSA betray Happy Friday James\nSo I I understand she managed to pull back all the a police officer from the voting on the voting areas because of one phone call or maybe two phone calls so what would happen if twenty or forty or a hundred people call requesting the police officer me there\nWell I I actually had people call yesterday or people who emailed me yesterday first of all let me let me catch you guys up on something I was talking about earlier today\nI received several emails yesterday from officers who said at roll call earlier in the week they were instructed to go to the polling sites you know pay make a pass by 'cause we want to make sure that everybody is safe and everything is good\nAnd then after walking Castro strips of gear because a couple of them actually where they're directing traffic nearby at Los Alamos then all of a sudden essay PT responds to walking Castro and pulls cops back\nUm ... this is a you know many of these officers who who contacted me yesterday complained they say they don't feel like the command staff has their back and that they are now left hanging twisted in the wind here is the original order from assistant chief James flavoring\nLaurence ... average just thanking the or like you said that this whole bomb thing doesn't pass the smell test ...\nUh you know just follow the money I I think who was the first one that receive the bomb\nA George Soros exactly so I mean these are sophisticated and they're all thanks for as we know\nAs well that that's probably don't know and the FBI needs to say whether they're real or not in my in my view because we just don't know if they were but\nIf they were laboratory ... you'd want to send it somewhere you know on the other side knowing that it's a fake I I'm just saying I think for us as a big ...\nEither they were fake and not you know we know that some of them were NBC News has confirmed that several of them were not were not able were not capable of exploding\nSo we know that they were at least fake and that nature [noise] um [noise] I I I just you know something I Can't put my finger on it right now but something's not right about this because I'm thinking about political advantage if in fact this was used for political advantage and it only benefits the Democrats at this point as far as I can tell\nA and the media has treated it that way David you're on K TSA betray friday David what are you thinking about\nGood morning Dr

why\nYou should vote yes on the ah on the three amendments or a be a it was about a meeting a smaller number down to twenty thousand and a longer period of time to be able to collect enough signatures or B is about the city manager of the city managers position\nAnd Steven let's move on to see here which deals with binding arbitration for firefighters\nAnd I know that you were making the point that yesterday Mr Hardman said that uh you guys make on average a hundred and forty two thousand dollars per year and declined to twelve percent increase so tell me about the\nAnger remember is that the majority of the people in this fire department or or firefighters and engineers\nAnd the lieutenant and the captain and when you said that the majority of us make a hundred and forty that\nI didn't say that that was that's what garden I\nKnow that okay I Know that yeah um\nSo I told you I felt that you are my deputy when we're all here I'm In Seventy thousand dollar with fourteen years and as a license paramedic with bachelor degree so I understand that those numbers are not kosher\nI'm outside of that the binding arbitration piece for us is important because the way they do just so everybody understands where we get ready to go to the table I Need all the information I can get to negotiate a contract barely for for my diet and the people that they might call on my my paycheck the citizens and faculty\nAll I Need it off on costing too much or the union members using resources on insurance they shouldn't be using or they go into the ER when they should be going to the doctor I Need to know all that information so we filed open records request that information was never return to so how do I\nDo to the table and discuss what we know is the issue which ensured without having the data that I needed to do it\nSo that's been the stall why should I come to the table I don't have this last so once that happened we said look we're not going to come to the table if you're doing that because what could happen and we could go all the way to the Supreme Court we could lose this day and lose parts that we already negotiate\nSo I think the important thing to remember is the labor association went to the color the arguably the most conservative court in the United states on the state level at one so that tells you\nHow frivolous lawsuit was the Supreme Court literally refused even here and said look lower courts fan so is all this has gone on they still haven't dropped a lawsuit that still pending lawsuits against the fire association over the evergreen clause where they can just\nChange the wording of rape pilot and run it through it yeah that's been another million and a half dollars so to us how do we how do we how do we draw the deadlock the binding arbitration seems to be the key\nWe went to mediation we offered to take over our insurance you give us the money we're spending now will run early and injure what if you fail if we fail will go on the civilian health insurance plan that was hurt that was offered to the city so the understand was there a ... percent raise melt within twenty\nSix million dollar net loss on the contract they offered us so they can say yeah they gave me a ... percent raise but they were going to take away some of the facts lie to the twenty six million dollar negative contracts\nLet me go to a couple of questions that we got here first before our our before we have to wrap up okay\nI'm One of them has to do with the special interests we talked about that with a and whether or not special interests are going to be able to insert themselves isn't that what the firefighters union is doing here is is the question and part B a to that question when it comes just answered that one first ... isn't that what the firefighters union is doing here\nBeing a special interest group here and and be I'm going to cost me in here\nAnd the mayor has said this on the show before just the fact that this was on the ballot proves that the charter a the way it is now and the petition process the way it is now actually works because you guys got your\nAllotted number of signatures and you've got this brought to the city and it set up for a vote now so just the fact we're voting on it proves that the current system works just fine your answers to those\nWell I think the first one is special interest in where their special interest yet almost ... interest for the taxpayer we've done a streetcar ... became directly from taxpayer\nWith no union infusion at all be in a meeting after St Carlo you wanted to do next group left her I mean literally mal endorsed by the Republican and the Democratic party on these issues and so\nAm I have special interest because I helped the taxpayer buying call me a special interest I'll take that all day long as long as I'm taking care of the people that pay my salary on a second side\nWe changed the charter ideal challenge an ordinance that council passed so I like I said before I can change our cities constitution with twenty thousand signatures in six months you know those people but I Can't change the ordinance that council passed\nNo matter what your political party I Hope you'll join me in supporting Richard Price for judge and remember the doctor recommended\nThis message brought to you by mayor pack a committee of concerned positions in ...

you know and received a now by the un I forward Ian James Clapper that there might be a concern that at a polling place people's tempers have got to the point\nWhere somebody could take a swing at somebody else a\n... and I and ... or ... what or worse you know\nWhat's wrong with the presence of police officers they serve all of those and walk in and you know what he's trying to do\nIs this is a dog whistle saying you see he's trying to scare or police or the city by placing please they're just trying to scare away say Hispanic American voters well I don't I I I Want to see everybody vote including Hispanic Americans black Americans white Americans Asian Americans\nI don't want to see illegal aliens vote and we've already heard about too many stories of people\nIn other states who've been registered falsely as foreign nationals but the police don't believe that they police behavior and I think behavior at a polling place is a concern this here and having the police there tends to tamp down bad behavior what's wrong with\nThat well and then it was it was compounded then the assistant chief\nWent ahead and and sent followed the stand in order for you guys not to go don't go to the polling sites unless you're called to go out there\nAnd then when the cheap was asked about it yesterday that she said well received several calls about possible voter intimidation due to SAP officers being president various polling place as well okay uh who would be intimidated\nOr people who shouldn't be there people who shouldn't be voting maybe felons I don't know maybe illegals I don't know but any you know I'm not intimidated by the presence of police I welcome them\nI think the presence of police immediately as a preventative to anybody getting out of line now the presence of least doesn't stop all criminals knows some some criminals\nIn fact here in Portland we had we've had a series of gang shootings yeah some of them right in front of police officers right where police officers are present so there are some bold criminals out there these days but\nHaving them at a polling place is a good preventative and if you're intimidated as an American citizen and a non felon by the presence of beliefs there is something along well\nYou and and what do we just what did they just communicate\nBut they they just said that every polling places a gun free zone 'cause I Can't carry mine to a polling place so they just said that every polling places a gun free zone the police will not be there so they just told police this is where you ... go no go zone and then to top it off they just do it all the bad guys\nWhere the good guys aren't that's just unbelievable\nNow trade you just made me sad because you know I live in the middle of a crazy liberal place yesterday and Oregon is savannah\nOn the ... river and I always thought of Texas as conservative we don't have polling place anymore because we have this crazy fraud written vote by mail nonsense but back when there are worth polling places and I had to carry permit I could carry at a polling place what is you got to get that change\nAll of these days that are\nGoing to give up your civil rights yeah at ...\nPleasure and it's kinda it's kind of ironic isn't it but bottom line is here this should have never happened we have a\nWe have a a a political person here who is trolling the polls the polling locations and he has been he lost his stuff the first day because a printer went down had nothing to do with voting so I think he's trying to make excuses he's trying to find scapegoats if something doesn't go his way and number two is talk of the party bosses 'cause\nHe's all about the big vote now he wants to be big guy on the on the big map and so he wants to he wants to impress the party Russia's look I stood up to the cops in San Antonio\nDo you uh I understand interviewed the police union or do you use the police union at least sounding off on this sounds outrageous\nOh yeah well and and what he said was we will hold the chief in the in the command staff accountable if ah if God Forbid anything were to happen at a polling location we will hold them accountable I don't know what that means I don't know how they would hold them accountable but they would put the blame squarely on the command staff of essay pd\nI think this is an insult to police officers it is high respect police this just dead wrong by the way we were supposed to do a live broadcast from a college campus this week you know why we were shut down Russia college we have as I said a great carry a law and I carry every damn caring right now in fact I've got a new Walter PBS\nOh nice size of the rare it's\nThin and it it's easy to carry and I've had a permit now\nFor about a quarter century and uh the university said we're going to punish the students if you invite washing the campus now they can't prohibit me because I can carry on a college campus but they told the students the college Republicans if you have him on a do a live broadcast\nWe will take away the funding from your group will disenfranchise your group as a student organization you may\nFace the individual discipline I mean they are the biggest bullies in the world and and they don't have any ... illegal leg to stand on but they will harass people and and it's just dead wrong well\nSpeaking of live broadcast and then I'll let you go after this you and I knew coming down here in United to go to the border and do a couple of where large shows from the border of serious I Would\nLove to do it out of love to do now is the caravan arriving before election day or they arriving in\nMiss January ... yeah it's going to look like after election day we don't know exactly because some of them are peeling off",
