that appeared before the Supreme Court\nThat executing their delayed delayed delays strategy against nominee Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court\nThey blatant political claim positive by Democrats as their objection now to his purported lack of judicial temperament they moved on over the weekend they got away from the sexual claims and I started out talking about this guy doesn't have the judicial temperament\nTo the point where the New York times wrote a piece yesterday that's being lambasted by the administration shame that in Nineteen eighty five through ice that a guy after a you'll be forty concert\nAnd that's not the type of person that we want on the Supreme Court if somebody's gonna throw ice that a guy after a concert [noise] the idea\nBecause judge Kavanaugh reacted with indignation last week to slander said he has a gang rape is Dan because he observed that the unabashed left wing smears against him were\nWell left wing spheres he is unfit to be an object to cherish and that's what they're going on now as opposed to like a normal human being and a perceptive wanted that oh of\nCourse the best measure we have all how someone will perform and a government offices that person has already perform when they're in that office or in a very similar one\nRight or the best measure we have with the seriousness in good faith of a critics claim against Saddam today is whether the critic consistently levels similar charges in similar situations\nWell Brett Kavanaugh has been a judge for a dozen years on one of the most important judicial tribute ... in America the United states court of appeals the DC circuit in that office not only has he issued over three hundred opinions which have been broadly admired for their craftsmanship and heavily relied on\nSupreme Court another federal court he has also been widely widely praised for his judicial temperament violet against colleagues and bar association is not one time\nNot once as anybody brought up a problem with his temperament are a problem with his drinking or that he's just a ... a slobbering a fall down drunk who's walking into walls but that's the way\nThe Democrats are now betraying him and the media is now portraying him ... you notice how quickly after her allegations were made last week before the Senate panel\nThe Democrats dropped her so quick learning about blobs before they're not even mentioning her name anymore and they moved on to what he's just a drunk this guy's just a drunk they they are doing all they can in every single way and every possible uh\nA conviction they can try to to bring up that this guy\nIs they're trying to destroy this man's life\nBut Democrats are in a place right now it's either rural or ruin that's there that is why they're thinking is\nRight now they will either rules is they will either rule our government and rule over us or they will ruin everything and they will ruin lives and\nDo whatever they feel like they need to do to rule and the week made Republicans are giving them plenty of latitude and plenty of ground and plenty of room to do that they're allowing them\nTo run all over this guy Enron all over the normal do a process in our country and destroy lives all along the way\nWhen they should have set up a long time ago and said no you're not going to do this we're gonna have a vote instead of that they have said well yeah OK you can look at this and you can look at that and it's never ending\nAnd now we moved on to a well this guy's just drunk and you can't trust him to be out there they're going to do the next thing is going to be as pedophilia\nThe next thing it's got to be ... you know something else they're just going to continue to do thing we're bringing up these salacious and unfounded charges against him just trying to slander his name and every single way that they can every single way that they\nCan they're sick the left in this country is sick this is what they do to people that they disagree with this is how they treat people\nAnd as Lindsey Graham said and yes he was in passionate about it because he feels so much about this country but as he said God I Hope they never get back in power\nThe way they're treating a Brett Kavanaugh right now they can treat anybody that way that has been my whole point along this if they can do this to him and they can destroy this man's character this way going back to Nineteen eighty five you through eyes with somebody at a concert\nIf they can do this they have they could do it to you and they will do it to you this is exactly\nWhat fascist do this is exactly how a a a a totalitarian governments are they have this is the way they do things\nThey do away with due process they do away with the presumption of innocence they lock people up just on accusations and charges we used to do it in this country in the sixteen hundreds itself would burn people at the stake\nI guarantee you he would be a a a a smoking heap of ash right now if this was the sixteen hundreds\nBecause the Democrat left in this country is sick it's beyond just a political battle they are sick\nAnd they'll continue to bring up these things and to do these things to to to\nDestroy anybody who gets in there with anybody do matter who it is this is this is beyond Brett Kavanaugh this is this is whoever's in their way of ruling over us\n\nIf you go back and look at his record with the diverse group of ... that he meant toward they'd been in high demand for Supreme Court\nClerk ships and other distinguished positions in the legal profession and that's part of the thing here here's the truth of the matter they know his record is stellar\nI'm a ...\nThis is what I Want to say to these people that are NBC her sitting in judgment up there\nA okay fine sit in judgment but let's start digging your stuff that's why I've said this about a Beto O'Rourke Rob O'Rourke and these incidents back in the Nineteen nineties the DUI that he says didn't happen the way that the police say it happened he's challenging the police on that well the only way we're going to do right\nIs to have a full FBI investigation\nAnd if he wants to be a senator from the state of Texas the FBI ought to crawl up in there and find out the truth\nOf what happened then did he drive a car drunk to the crash that car and did he tried to escape the scene if that happened the FBI can find that out and can let us know as people of Texas before we go to the polls next month whether or not he is lying or the police are lying because the two can't be the same\nHe says that he didn't try to leave that scene he said it publicly and a debate with Ted Cruz a couple of weeks ago did he or didn't he tried to leave that scene\nDid he or didn't he tried to break into the University of Texas at El Paso did he or didn't tea do some things with some stocks based on information that he had\nThese are all questions that the people of Texas deserve to have answered before they seek crews and old Rourke\nOn the piece of paper on the computer screen in front of them in just a few short weeks\nAnd of course at FBI investigation is the way to get to the bottom of anything that right you wanna get to the bottom of anything in this country\nThan what we have to do is demanding FBI investigation and I as a citizen of the state of Texas demanding an FBI investigation into Robert Beto O'Rourke and these matters did they happen the way that he said they happen to the police said they happen to people to state of Texas deserve to know he\nCan get out of that around the state with ... and you know vote him out again they\nCan do that all they want all day long I don't care what the FBI or crawl up enormous fight out the truth about this guy and see if he really\nIs who he says he is any really did what he said he did or didn't do\nUs wage growth has a Seventeen month high according to a new study released by glass door is not expected\nTo slow down anytime soon they expect wages to contend it arises demand remains for workers throughout a number of industries healthcare roles\nLike pharmacy technician and emergency medical technician saw annual pay grow by six point eight percent at five point seven percent respectively that could indicate by the way big opportunities in those field\nBecause those types of jobs require what human interaction and very difficult to automate despite increased demand so that's cool [noise]\nMinimum wage hikes crush twenty states have helped to boost traditionally lower wage rose to like those a bank tellers they're up seven and a half percent bartenders rep six point six percent\nFed chair Jerome Powell is striking a note of optimism during all this he says benefits\nVacation time and so on a show for it should be used as a measure of wage growth as well as more and more people are getting more and more benefits now in addition to higher pay you you mix all that together he's absolutely right\nUh you'd look at the entire package the entire compensation package and whatever that includes it might include vacation time it might include bonuses it might include a certain time\nOff you know to some people are is more important to have more time off that it is more money to some people\nUh and also when you look at a uh other benefits that they may receive from their employer if there's a a car allowance if there's phone all that as compensation all it goes into the compensation package\nAnd we see all of that now rising across the board and now some other good news Republicans have sped legislation through the

Bush did which to stop the clock and dispatched the FBI and the Anita Hill Clarence Thomas Casey FBI interview twenty two witnesses and they testified\nA in this case the reverse is sharpening the testimonies or for a career as a corrupt first judge Kavanaugh is locked in toward version of events that he gave all under oath\nBefore knowing all the allegations against some very very perilous situation highly unprofessional\nA pot boiling only a political and I don't know I don't know how it's going to your your\nThere are words about being political this all just seems so very political and now we have some people coming out of the woodwork making these specious claims\nOf gang rape and things of that nature uh over and over again you had somebody saying now he threw ice it somebody during a you'll be forty concert back in Nineteen eighty five or this is going to be an interesting week I Believe of ah allegations that are just going to be flying around like that\nYeah [noise] well here's the problem that can try and some I don't think it's perjury uh there there is an independent crime called misleading Congress now he clearly gave the impression that in in his heels he didn't drink to excess he wasn't below jurists and they didn't blackout\nWas drinking to excess and being belligerent and blacking out as long as you don't harm anybody is certainly not a crime and your use but to give a misleading impression well under oath\nThat you didn't do something that you did do is what is potentially the crime for him you remember that great a pitcher Roger Clemens who was summoned before a house subcommittee and asked about the contents of this year and then they accused him of lying I might have turned out they forgot to administer the two of them so\nThey couldn't prosecute them for perjury but they did prosecute inform mislead in Congress and independent cause you can actually give truthful answers and be prosecuted for misleading Congress if the truthful answers are misleading\nThat's the danger or that he faces hear it but but the committee has already signed off on them where they're going to deal with the FBI report even if it does show\nThey would us that he was misleading and I bet it was a trunk or they was belligerent or or that he he blacked out when they can do is they're going to reopen their hearings and we'll go through another\nA hateful events likely dead last Thursday I learned virgin territory here and again I don't know how it ends\nWhen when we take a look at\nIn I'm In different does to the outcome and you know when he was nominated my first reaction was for the ... the opposite of what the president said he would nominate [noise] this is somebody straight from the heart of the establishment this is a judge was written that on your iPhone you have zero\nPrivacy and the government can tap your phones and capture your keystrokes as long as it's doing doing it for intelligence or national security purposes now that is not a matter of Sony and reading of the constitution\n... when we look at where he has been now for the past twelve years on the DC circuit which is a very you know a highly respected circuit of course and the three hundred opinions that he has written\nThe women that he has a passed on to the Supreme Court as as clerks who have come out to testify under oath mentally perjury to his find character and who he is as a person\nUh conduct when he was sixteen or Seventeen or when he was in college is that a political when it comes to a judge and again being an inversion territory how far back do we now a need to go on politicians I Am an nominee\nI don't I don't think it's a political at all unless the U.S lied about it under oath ah or misled Congress I mean normally the FBI does not go into your youth unless there's some extreme\nOr event there and the president is correct he has had six FBI background checks before but they did not go into a useful for followed a I guess it just wasn't a it wasn't deemed irrelevant to them\nAgain the issue is not did he do this stuff but did he mislead show the Senate Judiciary committee about it here's another issue he's going to have this tape for the rest of\nIt was let's see that's not just about to say I just ask you that because what if the you know what if they come back and they say hey he'd been telling the truth\nShut down all the way from the beginning he has been truthful and everything that he has said every witness that we have a question and investigate it had been right on to to line up exactly with what he said all the way up and down the line the man's a reputation\nHas been absolutely assassinated by the Democrats on that panel\nWhile Democrats are going to say he can't hear cases that involve the Democratic party because he attacked the Democrats by name women are going to say we don't want to hear our cases even if he's not confirmed then it goes back\nTo the second highest court in the land which is where he sets now he's going to have the same taint a Justice Thomas has that changed after twenty seven years not withstanding brilliant and gifted\nFantastic and ... yes ... like\nI don't know if this does not have a happy ending ... even as he is a concern you know Thirty years from now somebody who was not even a law school will be nominated for the Supreme Court and we'll go through this again and look at how they can live in a matter was handled for guy ...\nWell I I said we go back to the way it was for a hundred and fifty plus years in this country and take it out of the hands of the Senate Judiciary committee and take it right to the floor that the Senate do their investigative work on a vote on him yes or no whoever they are the future nominees are and let's get on with life this whole politicization of this guy and\nIn there trying to reach out and want to know that makes me\nSick to be free down [noise] for decades the United states has been a willing\nUnderwriter of friends and foes alike we've been propping up the world's institutions we'd been bankrolling the peace initiatives in far\nReaches of the globe has been coming out of our back pocket and these other countries have been more than happy more than happy and so have the politicians\nOn both part in both parties on both sides yeah I'll have been more than happy to allow the United states to bankroll all the stuff that's been going on in the world and kind of a cat named Trump but he says no and I could do that anymore\nHe demands that other nations pull their weight on the funding of NATO or exiting the hospital un human rights council all the stuff that he has been doing that as a global\nIs just freaked out it's all about America First this NAFTA deal that he just reworked is all about putting America First the idea that the WTO allows China to impose outside tariffs on imports\nAnd ... international a commitment because it is a developing nation is totally absurd and these vast global organizations taking decades to adjust to emerging economic realities is just absurd\nTrump's impatient he wants change right now and he's working on making that change right now the long time and patience with the outdated NAFTA treaty well no he's not been alone and is it is not a NAFTA is not popular in the country labor leaders have railed against the job losses that followed from the fact in fact\nWhen President Clinton signed it in Nineteen Ninety three\nHe promised that NAFTA would lead to an export boom to Mexico that it would create two hundred thousand jobs in two years in a million jobs in five years has done directly the opposite of Bill Clinton said it was going to do\nIn fact the left leaning economic policy Institute the left leaning economic policy Institute said by twenty ten trade deficit with Mexico headed eliminated six hundred and eighty two thousand nine hundred good us jobs and most\nSixty one percent in manufacturing\nWe remember during the campaign when Barack Obama infamously said read guy that you keep talking about I'm not gonna advertised by saying his name but those jobs are not coming back what does he have some magic wand that he's going to have to get those jobs\nBack and yes ... wages magic wand and those jobs are coming back to the country it's a win for Trump the announcement that he made yesterday replacing NAFTA is a win for Donald Trump he insisted\nOn the campaign trail that if he were elected he'd renegotiate trade deals to help us workers are manufacturers became the first GOP presidential candidate in more than a generation to win the states of Michigan Wisconsin and Pennsylvania and now that this deal is done as soon as the Congress passes it\nIf Republicans stay in power they will pass it if they if they're out of power removed from power next month\nThen they won't pass it\nThe new deal imposes requirements the cars and trucks imported from Mexico and Canada to qualify for a duty free access to be manufactured Seventy five percent components\nFrom North America that also requires that a significant amount of work to be done by sixteen dollar an hour labor that means down in Mexico no more cheap wages\nSo I was also a new concessions for Canada on dairy this big for our farmers here's something is going to point to in states such as Wisconsin where it's an important issue and the president also has come under criticism for a trade policy to impose these steep tariffs on imports from us allies\nAnd he said yesterday without the terrorists we wouldn't be talking here but all this stuff you see happening here and with the European Union everything you see happening with these trade deals all focused on bringing one country to the table\nChina now you got to take a while we didn't get hair overnight we didn't hand over power\nAnd control of our economy today's world forces overnight it took a long time and it's

where now\n\nBack to the whole thing a little bit later on but I got to take a quick break from that and\nTalking about something locally here that I'm very concerned about and I just want you to be aware of it so that\nYou can be tuned in\nAnd and stay on top of this one I don't want to just wouldn't go underneath radar it concerns your access to guns in San Antonio so you have those or propose rules for local gun retailers in San Antonio or paint a broad\nPicture forty just so that we know where all this is in the state of California this past weekend governor Jerry Brown just signed some new gun legislation outlawing gun sales of any kind of used to be just hand guns but now it's of any kind of hunting weapons or whatever to anybody under the age of Twenty one\nYou're going to serve in the military you can vote you could do all of that you can even be in his state illegally but you can't buy a gun till you're over the age of Twenty one and done of any kind\nOf basically what this does is it chips away at the rights that are granted by the constitution owning a gun is not a privilege if you have that in your mind if you have been taught that if anybody has said that to you and the government\nHas been giving you that by implication for years but it's a privilege not a right it is not a privilege it is a right and it's granted by the constitution\nAnd so here we sit in California with them limiting the rights of adults that are granted by the constitution of the United states there there continue to put more and more limits on them something else and the most insidious part of this legislation that he signed\nIs just based on an accusation somebody can have their guns taken away from them\nAnd they are guilty there's just not sound familiar until they prove themselves in a sense of that accusation\nSo somebody who is mad at someone somebody who works with somebody a spouse can say I think that person as a threat to\nThe police show up and take the gun away there's no evidence has been presented there is no charge that's been made there certainly been knowing paneling of a grand jury was\nHandled it handed down a bill there's nothing that's happened other than just somebody saying that person as a threat that person is a danger oh well let's go get their gun they the the authorities take your gun and hold your gun until you prove that you're not a threat\nWhole idea of due process the whole idea of the Fourth Amendment that I Know it was great concern to many of you completely gone completely gone in California are you saying well that's California\nHow does that affect me here well first of all that should be troubling in any state in a union and that\nGoes on okay but the second thing is\nThis city council in San Antonio with the exception of Perry and broadcasts they want to be so much like California it's not even funny as why have have named at San Fran Antonio because they would love to take all the policies that are that have wrecked California and put them right here inside it looks sixteen oh four and they're trying to do it\nAnd and when it comes to the gun thing back in June\nOr the council which city staff and said hey ah looking into what you can do on gun control how can we put more gun control into effect in San Antonio as a municipality because the way it works is the state is the one who was supposed to regulate the access\nTo guns where you can buy them in from whom you can buy them and you got the ATF FBI ATF will get involved and all that\nSo city ... zoning law ... cities have the authority to regulate locations of certain businesses so we have the right to\nRegulate where what is sold in San Antonio show they are putting together a plan is going to be soon presented to the full city council\nThat will say to those who sell guns I'm Talking about lawful gun sellers I'm not talking about Charlie out the back of his truck although Charlie out the back of his truck is legal\nI'm Talking about law for gun sellers who have these businesses business friends and all that the ATF has signed off on on all that city council coming along and saying you can't operate\nThere because you're too close to a school or you're too close to a church or you're too\nClose to this that or the other play you know there's houses over there and people live on those houses over there you can't be selling guns here\nThe city I was also looking at code\nTo include and defined firearm firearm sales guns miss and all of that so it would encompass a whole bunch of other people\nInto this if approved\nAbout sixty or half of existing gun shops in San Antonio would be out of compliance with the new rules about half\nOf the gun shops in San Antonio will be out of compliance with the new rules how would you like to wear the stroke of a pen makes sixty or half of an industry out of compliance with the new rules that's exactly what the city council is talking about doing limiting\nWhere guns will be sold in San Antonio now back in June June twenty six\nDeputy city attorney Edward ... mom so there are ways to get gun regulations passed including through the city zoning laws conditions for releasing defendants from jail on bond conditions are procurement of city business conditions for city incentives and the pursuit of state legislative action\nCouncilman Greg

today Donald Brazil by the way over on the uh Democrats said she says\nThat the Democrats are going to have a historic year this year it is their year it's going to be absolutely huge\nFor the Democrats this year she says no I don't believe much of what Donald Brazil has to say not to Brazil was the one who took questions from CNN and gave him to Hillary Clinton so Hillary could study a bone up on the questions and it still didn't do any good when she met Donald Trump in the CNN interview\nSo the Donald Brazil is a waste of my time but uh she's she's out there telling people that these different conferences now the Democrats are going to have a historic year this year they're going to take back control of both houses\nOf Congress they're going to hold the seat open here on a cabin up until they get a Democratic president in twenty twenty that as the planet that's what they're doing meanwhile some of you who called and talked about the Democratic senator from Hawaii\nOr that is a lousy Hirono she today this morning says she has reports and and concerns about reports an anecdotal testimony that Brett Kavanaugh was aggressive when he drunk in high school and college\nShe says the portrayal of himself as a uh practically a choir boy is very much contradicted by his roommates in college as well as people who knew him in high school it goes to how he behaves when he was drunk she said he's very aggressive as very aggressive behavior be belligerent when he's drunk\nFor someone to say I never did any of this one is contradicted by people who knew him one has to wonder so this is the fact that they are taking now that they have this one set up\nSo that whatever they get and testimony from anybody a and the FBI investigation they are going to be able to just say look he's belligerent he's not fit to sit on the Supreme Court although his history on the DC circuit court totally allies any of that argument push any of that argument to arrest\nThere is nothing in his pastor and his history that he has done from the bench or in dealing with people that he has worked with anything that's been one complaint that has been lodged against him and now all of a sudden we are to believe because her own a senator Hirono tells\nUh who by the way she's the one that Lindsey Graham pointed the finger at and yelled at the other day for saying that she wanted to hold the seat open until twenty twenty that is their plan\nSo an hour to believe after he's had a stellar career and not a blemish on his record and as promoted women or just all kinds of ah just outstanding women on to be being court said the Supreme Court we are to believe that he's a staggering fall down belligerent drunks alcoholic\nA man who was on top of the world like that who has made it that far who went through Yale Law school who kept ... of every minute of his life since uh since high school\nMade it to this point in his life has a beautiful family with beautiful daughters now based on a new window and be a a A R B and substantiated uncorroborated or claims the statements of political hit men and women we are to believe that he's a fall down belligerent\nDrunks [noise] this is just where we are headed right now and this is a a decision I think that we have to make\nIt if we are happy with\nWith what's happening right now and the character assassination and the political his job that's been put out on this man if we're happy with that than let's just make sure that the Democrats get back in power and that they run the show in just a few weeks let's make sure that happens because that is exactly what they're going to do and if they do it to him they can do it to anybody\nIt's what fascists do it's what dictatorships do it's with communist countries have done put out his jobs on their political opponents\nThey end up dragging them before a court of public opinion and totally destroying people and ruining their lives in the lives of their family without evidence to back it up\nAnd then they deploy the various agencies they have after they have made an accusation then they deploy the various agencies to try to put together the evidence to support their accusation and that's exactly what we're going through this week\nAnd you notice it is not subtle at all but the game has changed from the sexual allegations they're not talking about for what was the last time you heard of Democrats say four\n\nShe is a she she's gone now as far as they're concerned boom she served a purpose they're out of there now I told you they didn't care about her I told you that they care about is slaughtering Brett Kavanaugh's a reputation at this point\nThat's what they're attempting to do so now they're on the new things and belligerent drunk who just stumbles around all the time you stumble around all the time in high school I never could get anything done these stumbling around all the time in college we found a few people to tell us that\nAny through ice on a guy that concert horrible human being that he is so I\nHope that the American people will not stand for this and that the American people are going to go enough and we're not going to do this anymore and they will stand up and say end of it in fact just a few minutes ago I read this to you", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Trey Ware", "city": "San Antonio", "day": "02"}
