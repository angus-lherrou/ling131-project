I'm sending up the military is the military and they're standing there and one thing that will ... captured we don't let them out you know we're not going to lead gang members\nBut what if they apply for asylum isn't the law because Congress and they ... we're going to hold them until such time as a trial where we ended up facility we're going to put up we're going to build ten cities were gonna put tense up all over the place we're not going to build structures and spend all\nOf this you know hundreds of millions of dollars we're going to have a chance they're going to be very nice and they're going to wait and if they don't get asylum they get out\nAll right so can the president indeed refused to accept asylum applications well attorneys now are saying that's absolutely true the first paragraph in the immigration nationality asylum provisions provides that aliens physically president of the United states may and the word is may apply for asylum\nSecond paragraph provides the following three ...\nExceptions that aside and maybe in the night on the basis of disqualifying conduct safe third country\nAnd having been convicted of particular serious crime so these are the things that the president can do he can harden the border with these troops as he is doing right now five thousand two hundred of them and they can also denied their asylum request that sounds like what he was telling Laura Ingraham last night as they're not going to do that\nThat they are going to build tent cities and put them in tents and let them wait until their asylum hearing happens\nNow the way it used to work is that once they stuck into and the United states these agencies would come last December if you remember here in San Antonio the truck was found over by splash town somebody from essay pd went over there and took command of the situation away from ice\nAnd took these illegals downtown and then release them to agencies\nRight here in San Antonio which then turn around and release them out into our community\nInstead of forcing them\nTo stay in contact so we could put them through the normal asylum process and what happens once they're released like they were in San Antonio last December they'd ever come back for their asylum hearing they're out in the end of the United states and they become\nPart of that eleven million better living illegally in the United states and then twelve million then Thirteen million and fourteen million the next thing you know\nYou turn around and ten years you get twenty million people living illegally in the United states because we took them in their requested asylum we let them go and they never came back for their asylum hearing and we don't have any recourse at that point\nOnce we turn them loose and they just fall into the fabric of America out there somewhere they stay and they stay forever\nAnd the president is trying to prevent that by saying we're going to build these tent cities and we're going to force them to stay in these tent cities until their asylum hearing happens and if that's weeks or months or years then that's what it's going to take but we're not going to allow them to go out of the fabric of society he is visiting Pittsburgh today after the synagogue attack\nHe and the first lady Melania are going to visit Pittsburgh to express the support of the American people angry\nWith the Pittsburgh community shots fired into the south date and Republican Party office\n... county Republican Party officials in South Daytona Florida found their headquarters windows\nShut out yesterday shot with a gun rounds of ammunition\nAlong with a glass shattered in front of the entrance the Republican headquarters in ... county had four bullet holes discovered inside the office now earlier this month that Tea Party activists target at the metropolitan Republican club in Manhattan the Republicans are under attack\nAntifa spray painted an anarchist symbol on the clubs doors and smash this window and deeper sad or attack is merely the beginning we are not pass it we are not civil and we will not apologize we are one week from the elections expect all this to ramp up\nWe're one week now and Ted Cruz's in front of Bobby O'Rourke um you know I've been calling them Robert O'Rourke or Rob\nBecause when he got to college that's what he wanted we did some digging we found out when he was little he demanded to be called Bobby [laughter] never never one time was he ever did he ever demand to be called ... until he decided he was going to run for senator\nSomebody called and body or Rob or something like that 'cause that's what he wanted done so Bobby Bobby behind fifty one forty six percent of the Quinnipiac University\nSenator Ted Cruz also a head of Bobby and the gender gap he wins man fifty six to twenty to thirty nine percent and body can only managed fifty two to forty five percent edge among women so it's close a in a while the red Sox end up going to the White House they got details about that coming up the president says I Love this country\nSo what does it mean when he says he's a nationalist what does he mean by that well he address that issue as well last night and if you've ever traveled on sixteen oh four between Seventy eight and a bar or a yeah sixteen and far between Seventy eight or nine ten over there by ran off you know it can be a nightmare well\nBooker and Eric Holder or they were discussing and she said\nThey all look alike\nThat's an interesting what does he mean by they all look alike I Wonder I Wonder if Donald Trump was talking about Cory Booker and Eric Holder can't tell the difference to them because\nThey all look alike they all look alike\nNow nobody said anything about this concerning the Hillary joke there but you know\nThat if it was told by Donald Trump boy would they be all over that\nYeah I Know they all look alike and they all look alike wow\nThat are racist kind of joke isn't it a racist non joke ... you say All right so the manager of the Boston Red Sox said Sunday it's unclear whether the table but is it the White House manager Alex Cora said at the team as vital\nTo meet with President Donald Trump there's got to be a conversation about Nineteen members as to whether or not they want to go ... is a native of Puerto Rico and he does not like Donald Trump John Henry the principal owner of the red Sox says the White House has yet to invite the team I like for the White House just get out of the infighting methane business\nAnd if they want to see the same and they want to you know how to team up go see the team there go to Boston hang out with the team they're good inviting them up to the White House because just this just dumb at this point uh the president said last night what he meant by being a national says he loves the country defending calling himself a nationalist\nThe word nationalism has taken off for the last this connotation of feeling anti Semitism hate even violence do you think that is fair and do you want to clarify what nationalism means new\nTo me I don't have to laugh I miss I Love the country and means I'm fighting for the country I look into these low Lewis and nationalist I'm somebody that wants to take care of our country because for many many years you know there's better than anybody else our leaders of any more worried about the world and they have about the United states and they leave us in a mess whether it's two wars whether it's uh\nThe economy weather is bad weather is all of the things that they've done including putting in the wrong Supreme Court justices ... we've really put two great ones and now I'm proud of this country and I call that nationalism Michael and being a nationalist and I don't see any of the connotation and then\nAll right so the president is one hundred percent correct about that when he's talking about that word and what he means by that word is that the global to sue a bit of that power before have really screw things up got us into the longest war we've ever been in cost American taxpayers trillions upon trillions of dollars\nTo uphold states that should have failed and should have collapsed a long long time ago but you know we thought they were too big to fail and uh and and we were more interested when it came to Obama and the bushes and the Clintons more interested in what happened around the globe and taking care of all these other countries all around the globe to the point where\nWe got to the point and and it took you know several administrations different presidents to get us there but we've got to the point where a bottle went on the policy tour it was actually\nVowing to other leaders of other countries that's how I how far our country had eroded in the eyes of the world we weren't out bowing to these other countries having our leader go around as Brock Obama and vowed to them\nAnd a Donald Trump is simply saying America First sets it America First and that's all the plan is here uh he makes perfectly good sense when he says tech start planning two hundred million dollar upgrades lip sixteen oh four on the northeast side the silver hereby Randolph\nIt runs

there in the White House putting together an executive order which would essentially say birthright citizenship in here and you're sounding off on this so much more concerning this topic David you're on K TSA betrayed go ahead David\n[noise] I I just had to comment on the right to the ship ah won it in a sort of either to circumvent ... of our immigration in that uh if someone knows that they have a child in this country then uh that\nCharles ... says ah it avoids our uh our actual immigration system because at a later when that child turns they pool then they can claim the parents as dependent and then they're sitting there\nAnd they have access to all of our uh you know a social programs and so for ... and number two at a same thing with um\nOur our borders are set up to where we allow people to come in and shock ... and the ... that they they are coming in the shop and not just coming in to have a baby which happens to so uh I think\nThat the birthright citizenship as it stands is set of eyes is a certain mention of our system\nAll right thank you David Breashears Eric you're on K TSA betray your thoughts on all the ...\nYeah I just wanted to play devil's advocate at a gas because you had a caller earlier that said\nThat you know it was it was going to be hard to push and I could explain some of that myself because\nI'm for example a for children that are born here it's one thing for immigration officers they they want to see you know a ballad burst if get now you got to prove that parents are us citizens even you would have to prove that your parents are us citizens [noise] I'm\nSure that your case so is one parent a U.S citizen one's nine or ... harm and after that uh you'd you'd really have to amend the immigration and nationality act it'd be very hard a burden on immigration agents now they have to scrutinize parents parental citizenship\nAnd uh I just felt like we haven't even figured out that way yet and now here we are we're going to scrutinize children potentially born in the United states but now they've got to prove that both their parents were us citizens as well\nAll right thank you Eric ... you're on the TSA would try and go ahead Nick\nYeah man I just wanted to comment on something that caller said earlier about the tent cities that are going to be set up I mean I was listening yesterday and someone called in um you know from Fort Sam\nSaying they're getting ready to send medical things down there and unfortunately that's exactly what this is going to turn into it's going to turn into a humanitarian type scenario and these people are going to be down there for years this is going to be like a if you take a country like Jordan\nIs having all the refugees who are coming from Syria we're going to have the exact same thing on our borders okay thank you ... you're on the usa go right ahead\nI um I just wanted to say I'm\nI'm all for her and then the birthright citizenship because I Believe it's because of like food stamps and the eighties had good intentions but people are taking advantage of the system like crazy um the last caller and they're still let them they're a little bit I was going to ask what the proposed a method was going to be for it but the criteria for citizenship after they ended up I think he answered that so\nI think it's being presented Robert you're on K TSA would try and go ahead Robert\nThe money trail was why didn't make a comment is ...\nAnd that's the Chinese are going in there they're pregnant women from China coming over here having their babies like China the reason why we're we're behind and all his because we've never really done anything about it\nIf you go back and look at the history of the fourteenth amendment that was a problem at that time with China and gypsies is what they called people coming from foreign countries at that time it was an issue then\nAnd there is an argument to be made that the the framers who put together the fourteenth amendment at that time never intended to be made for a are are are applied to a foreign national who would come here and just have a baby a that was meant to be for the people that were here in their argument that's the argument that they made\nIt should be made for the people that were here is actually made for blacks and slaves at that time to nationalize them and make them us citizens so I you know there's an argument to be made on both sides and it has been made sense\nThis fourteenth amendment came about Pete you're on K TSA go right ahead ...\nGood morning I was wondering if there's something in the old could be inserted in the ... type deal about\nIllegal ... suddenly you know sleep traders good steak but you know we get into the workforce and the other thing\nEver since Reagan I've been

sure what we're doing up there on bases and stuff like that you understand what I'm\nSure you're talking about nearby where they can respond in a hurry to any kind of border issue that may come up thanks Pete I appreciate it Richard you're on K TSA betray go ahead Richard\nYeah morning trying I Love your show love our president and I for one with the birthright citizenship I think that\nYou know I mean where with one parent ban an American citizen I Believe that it would be okay but if both parents are from another country I don't believe that their child ought to be an American citizen\nBut and that thing with the can't I don't think that the refugees are left are flat across the border for can't even be you know I Love our president but I think that has to be you know over in Mexico I don't think that they should have 'em over here on the United states thought\nThe changing of the Alamo moving the senator from putting up the wall around the Alamo grounds and so on and
