I really need people that are rhetoric willing in well eating Jews Willie ... we've\nHad crazy people in our society deranged an evil people in our society for quite some time\nThat's not sure it will do so saying that it's getting to this point and that's the cause of what happened in Pittsburgh that the cause of the person mailing the the device just through\nYou know you just said we're becoming hyper partisan you're against it and you become hyper person\n[noise] I don't mean to be hyper partisan and I don't mean\nBy all I'm saying is LA we're we're not all ... I Want to left very reads about what were your brother I Want to your name okay\nAll right I Want to address one thing that you said that nobody wants to open borders I Would disagree with that tell me one Democrat\nWhat their policy is in ... in any of the the legal immigration plan to secure the border tell me any of them that have said\nThat this is our plan and we need to have border enforcement and we need a because you'll hear a lot of we need comprehensive immigration reform but they'll never get into the specifics of what should be included in that comprehensive immigration reform when it comes to border control\nWhat you have ... ... ... what you have a right now you think about this Trump is being blamed for the ...\n\nWell you can be blamed the guy\nHe's being blamed that he doesn't care and the and the and the point is because he said we're going to stop and that the border and Democrats are saying no they all should be able to get through because they're only looking for the American dream and that's what's fair\nWell then at that point is nice rare but if you believe that as the mainstream now of the Democratic party believes you may be a liberal and you may say you disagree with it but it's what your party now endorses\nThey may not you know they may not use the term open border but that's what they mean go ahead I'm Sorry but\nIt is it is unfortunate that that\nPerception of the Democratic party is now collaborated but I I Would I Would venture to tell you that no president in the past three or four administrations has deported more illegal immigrants than ...\nHe deported more immigrants than any President Trump Bush Clinton Reagan none of them\nOkay and I I don't know I Love to know what I hear leaning Democrat okay aunts open borders okay one day here's here's we're line here or there if we want safety already said here here's a point at one\nTime we we can debate the numbers some other time but let's say that's absolutely true and nobody ... deported more than President Obama\nThen why is Trump being demonized for believing the same thing that Brock Obama believed it things are hyperbole ... has\nA little bit less than ... than Obama did when it comes to his ...\nHis real fast and the way you talk 'cause I went to the way he talks about it not want to see not what he wants to do nothing subtle people are against what he wants to do that where you're trying to say\nOh I'm trying to say is the is it seems to me or as someone who is your brother is your fellow American citizen and I love you and I have a ton of conservative trends Republican friends\nWe're all brothers we're all brothers\nWhat I'm saying is that it seems to me that Trump and the way he characterizes\nPeople who are in need and if you were in their position if you were in the same position you want the best for your family you want you would want the best for your friends you you would want the best for yourself you want the best life it seems to me that\nYou're an advocate but what is not the left can you not where after that we're jets just guilty okay well let me we're is Jared we're using language just take character ride right right well here's not ... and here's the point is ugly right now that people are dying in life and I'm I'm Sorry okay All right bill that are dying as a result\nOf hatred and partisanship coming from both sides and I will tell you that the left as justice guilty\nOkay here's not saints here's a point that I Want to get too because you this is very important because one of the things that that really\nGets to conservatives because conservatives have compassion and I believe and I believe that ... and I believe that that the the yanks when we're we've got some\nInterference or I I Believe the Trump is compassionate I Believe Trump's rhetoric at times goes over the top ... example [laughter] you know the example of going to give [laughter]\nKeeping the conspiracy going the cruise Ted Cruz's father was part of the Kennedy assassination so to me that was the high level anything since then has actually taken down a little bit because that's one heck of an allegation so we understand that when it comes to hyperbole he can go over the top\nBut don't you care about the substance\nIsn't only the hyperbole then is that what you're claiming Democrats are Democrats only care about how\nYou say it's not what you say\nAnd you also have to understand when it comes to the theory that exist in America by a lot of people including Trump when you see that Democrats wish to protect\nIllegal immigrant criminals this is not ultra partisan to get people angry it is the reality of what exists today\nDating reality is not hate talk but when you have the Democrats who prefer their preference is the safety and security of illegal immigrant criminals over American citizens\nYeah you're going to get people angry including the president\nMhm yup what's gonna happen\nUm look and by the way the whole thing with the remember the president said the rapist thing and you know it's you know you and I for example we've said you could take quotes that we have said and and you know in the context of not knowing other things you could take it out of context as soon as that was said he goes no I mean the the bad people not the good ones and he said we know there are good people tried to come across\nA the the border we can't do it so we clarified that a long long time ago in fact be clarified that right after it happened yes but again it was a what they did was they took it and they ran with it that that all are rapists and now\nInvolved and starts talking about the second amendment ... and then that debate goes on ah\nTo sit and discuss what rhetoric may dry but a mass\nShooter to do what they want it's I guess on your part it would be a guest on my part\nNone of us know you don't know\nWhat sets off people and so to say we need to ... do we need to temper the rhetoric across the board\nUm I think we should uh as conservatives because I think we can win every issue without doing so I understand why the left and I understand why some people on the right do it I disagree with it but I understand why they do it the leftist nothing else to go on\nThe last caller I like I said it was really interesting he was talking about how he needed to get rid of the hyper partisanship and then he went into hyper partisanship\n\nWell and and and saying that he doesn't know anybody that's for open borders I don't know anybody that well the fact of the matter is is that there are there are people out there that are calling for open borders I think we sort of convince ... and here's the thing I I Would ask a huge ask those that use side with\nAnd I mean the people running for office or that are holding office right now ask them what level of enforcement on the border\nDo they believe it it's a very simple question uh\nBut we live in a nation with free speech we're not going to get rid of free speech the second amendment isn't going away free speech is going to stay a there is a party that was just to get rid of it ours is not that party\nWell and they're very they're working very hard right now to to do that and and if you think to the last ... I don't think that doesn't exist then go to talk to the people of California by the way you're using the wrong pronoun there is a penalty of up to a year in jail and that law for a reason\nWhen I say ours I mean conservative mhm I said party I meant conservative because Republicans as you remember McCain was a Republican assigned McCain or that or a sponsor McCain fined gold and Bush signed saying that he knew parts of it were unconstitutional but hold up the courts deal with it and you and I were in serious when he did that\nSo so there you know if if you if you think that you know you're the colored in describing well were your brothers were you know we we tried to paint everyone has as someone who thinks the Sam\nOn the left but that's not the case\nTell me it's not extreme in New York when they say if you used the wrong pronoun we can find you up to the point that it would shut your business down\nIn California [noise] it's in the law [noise] they can put you in jail for using the wrong pronouns [noise] now tell me that's not a three [noise]\n\n\nAs soon as ... radio on Westwood One\nMyth or show listen anywhere at any time on demand to catch up on Eric and Gary's topics of the day visit red eye radio show dot com and click on demand that red eye radio show dot com\nIf you're forming today you know all about taking real well here's one risk you don't have to take any more risk of ID I be internal diesel injector deposits because now cynics ruby field messed improving um diesel fuel has an advance and Jeff ... to prevent id ID so you don't have to risk and gender\nFailure clogged filters in downtime andme more cynics ruby field masters even backed by a ten year ten thousand our warning for even less peace of mind power alone synergism ran to the age\n... electronics is proud to support the fight against breast cancer by partnering with bright pink travel centers of America and Petro stopping center to bring you the twenty nine LCD right think CB radio this limited edition right did CB radio is helping to save lives wrestling ovarian cancer\nI Am how women to liberal activists for every radios home was making a donation if I think in the fight against cancer the right to see the radios available for a limited time ... travel centers of America and Petro stopping centers\nAttention owner operators have you tired of chasing empty promises RSVP is looking for you to join their team offering a dollar Seventy five per mile for drivers or two dollars per mile for teams are asked me ... all miles that hadn't back\nHome or not an air vocabulary they're no trailer rentals needed a male hidden secret how our I think the today and ate and ate RSVP three six five that's a A R S P three six five four apply online at RSVP I\nOn the dot com that's RSVP I.

Radio Welcome to the show high\n... uh uh some of those little ... as an American black who are conservative\n... when you started off the show\nTalking about how you see a fight those values severance pay ah especially when it comes to the African American male sham election with you when did when I caught a working or interest in my everyday life because that's just a\nGroup of people for my life ... the centered around and they always ask me why are you a conservative and being black is because I'm I've fend for myself and what's the alternative uh socialism type but we'll go to where if you're a Christian as you say you're a Christian um those systems\nThey're Adams to what you believe you know and if you are a male black male talking about racism\nUnder those this book because you say something that the uh the ruling party or ruled a mob doesn't like you're you're you're going to be in jail or be ostracized so\nI mean if you're that you're getting fat and now you're not thinking about about all these other systems that you don't even know that she'll promoted just because it's not a Republican issue you're you're you're not educated yourself on what the system you really do what they really are\nI\nI Can't argue with anything that you just said they have a they they really don't understand at times what they're promoting\nAnd James ... I've said this the the biggest challenge that we face today is talk show host is not debating the issues it's debating against ignorance people actually don't know what they're actually promoting to me that's the most credit if I\nGo ahead go ahead yeah because if I asked my my African American person that that I dumped speaking with or Latino person you know I'm I asked them because I learned this from you guys what\nAre you for what I mean I Know what your gas but what are you for and and because most of them they were a kid I truly what they're for this particular with their gas and as a black person I have to say to them that\nMy skin color doesn't dictate how I live my life it informs me on ignorant people in my vitamin but it does dictate to me how I think how I live so therefore uh ... you and you're saying right something as the problem do really\nStand what that is America races or you're talking about individual people who act it correctly\nRight you have to go down that ... and I think that's what we you know battle against all the time because there had been we've changed the definition of things or people label certain things and we have to go back because you just displayed there James James we have to go back and ask them okay\nWhat is it that you mean by that specifically what kind of actions are behavior you talking about when it comes to people that you believe a racist because we have to go back to every uh you know Republican a presidential candidate and Bill Maher said it\nYou know during the twenty six team a a ... election season well the other guys Mitt Romney and\nUh you know George W. Bush and John McCain while they weren't Hitler Hitler but but definitely this guy is really Hitler but that's the that's the lower than what they really want to come out and and make you believe that this guy or whoever it is the most recent as Iraq the current threat\nIs the one that is is is the biggest threat to you right now the only way they can get away with that or they think they can get away with that is by creating a monster and the person\nYou're not a James I saw the a young black Leadership Conference that the President Trump spoke to the other day and I saw one of the young people that was interviewed that said I'm finally off the plantation\nAnd when he said that I went wow that's going to drive liberals just crazy but to me and I'm not black but to me when he said that\nWhat it was was I I'm I'm Out of the I'm Out of the mindset of groupthink that line it I'm involved in group think find being told that I must think this way because of the color of my skin and then my mind is still in the plantation\nAnd that that's what I tried some other ... you're you're you're pointing the finger at a a Republican plantation what I'm saying what what ... are you a are on right now that one I allow you to fake as you really think\nBecause when when you talk to black folks about the homosexual affair and the marriage thing or whatever if you talk to the mission by issue as their lives up with\nMore of a conservative mindset but because of their best so brave brainwashed into your thinking of racism racism racism racism you know it clouds their their their their judgment\nYou know I Wonder 'cause you know we talked about the identity politics with a with the ... with the Democrats in in the ...\nThe politics that have really I think come to the forefront because they're so radical is you know number one the transgender movement where if you're\nA a man you can be a woman and the the country in law's must ah recognize you that way and then what we've got into now is transracial that if you're black you can be white and if you're white you can be black\nLegally and I started thinking about that and\nWonder how many 'cause we said this we said what the trans gender it seemed that there was more acceptance and when they jumped to the trans racial\nI said I think you're going to get a lot of blowback from a lot of black leaders out there stating wait a minute so you can be whatever race you want whenever you want to be it and I thought that was really interesting I Wonder if people thought that that was ... just a ... a lot of minorities might have seen that and said okay\nMaybe this is time for me to get on a different mindset as to where the Democrats are going\nTo the extent of the challenges so what does this fight fend for a way yeah was it all in vain yeah right\nNo that's I I think that's the question that that many of us have been asking for a long time I mean when you think of the mindset from the the the the left right now that you can be whatever you wish to be now that includes gender or race\nSo there because there's transgender ... there's also a trans racial is them and they want you to believe well if you'd that's how you identify will hold on a second\nBecause if if you look at a you know the the the civil rights are protected groups created under the civil rights act if there if you can belong if anyone can belong to any protected group", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "San Antonio", "day": "29"}
