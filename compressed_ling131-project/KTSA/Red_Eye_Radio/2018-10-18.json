state and about the people voting for them\nAnd I just wanted to say that I I live here where we vote on that certainly not Governor Brown name and the whole state of sanctuary state which I don't I don't know how many of the city's pay attention get mine do some of them have actually voted against a following his directions\nBut I don't recall ever hearing any load about sanctuary cities out here\nAnd you know they weren't you know it wasn't so they ... about it it's just a judge and Democrats an officer very liberal extremely left just a Democrat is in office and he just decided that's a good idea does it and I from what I understand San Francisco's kind of a dump now just partly what is that\nWhen I was there a few months ago and I'm used to it was amazing when I was walking the streets with\nMy kid or someone yelled at us now look at this hand this hand as a weapon and then another time something that someone says something about a night that doesn't count how dirty it is now I didn't see this but they were needles all over certain sections I think they said market street and of course the problem with the trash and the\nAnd the homelessness is a problem but that's true yes you know everywhere in California right\nYes uh-huh but I think uh I I miss San Francisco in a long time I don't really go up there that much I mean it's quite far from San Diego and I've I've just never been into their way of thinking so um yeah but it's\nIt's it's ... it's the only thing we vote on and I wanted to ask you one other thing I didn't mention is to fellow I spoke with first but that you have you heard the thing about the the um birth tourism it it was on our wretched this just yeah I mentioned this to a few people and they had not heard of it\nAnd it actually was on television some some time ago on twenty twenty or dateline or one of those where they fly on these Chinese women that are pregnant uh-huh and they they have this place all set up and they go there and they have the babies get their little American citizenship for the baby and leave\nThen leave yeah no I actually I did hear that\nWomen going into hospitals yep they've got to figure it out and look people take advantage of the weaknesses in anything right especially your in laws source we of course we call that anchor babies right to so they come here and they have a baby and then there and they have all the rights\nThrongs of course is wrong at an awful\nLot of people have not heard about that because I've I've told that to the United states politicians here and they well they are people that work for them and they had heard of that so I mean I'm Glad to get to say it on on national radio so people can know what's going on\nIt's we're very close to the border here so it's I mean people come over here and dumped the baby's all the time I say dumping I mean they have them and I and I just I don't think it's right I don't think a lot of the country and the other countries in the world do that\n... somebody had to be an adult I said to the baby out deals citizenship and they said no because he was born in an air force us air force base so I don't know why we're handing out citizenship like if I can do it you know it's it's it's a paradigm they're actually and yeah go ahead at\nThe actual do Sylvia there was a reason for it which is a ... ... with with the slavery issue we want to make sure that they weren't taking advantage of it any way but of course if you pass a law\nAnd for every law by the way there's a phrase I've heard was a one time a solution every problem was the one time a solution to something else so you you mean well and you pass something and then people figure out how to take advantage oh I Would do the same thing\nWhen I Lived a say in Asia and the thing I could get my kids have American citizenship if they're just born here well I'm going to time my trip so that I have the baby yeah of course that could go wrong if the baby's late

Republican and they what what what ... what is there an Obama\nWell I I see I see a difference I thought Bill Clinton was much more about himself you know ah\nHe wanted the fame he wanted the the the admiration he wanted to be loved and I don't think he was his principles were strong as the bomber who's now now leftist who believes what he says right trained by ... and all that kind of stuff\nNot trained by a ... well it certainly was there yeah and that and so is totally different Obama really believe this stuff\nAnd was the maybe the first left this well maybe not the first I'm thinking of even Roosevelt was a pretty liberal out there but certainly now and that left us and uh he remember what he says the seven days before his a victory and he wanted to fundamentally transform America\nWould say that except for get progress went out and I left and\nSo you have a history right what you are I don't know Clinton Clinton was not so much a leftist is about himself in it he in Hillary making money the power of it all and then you said something about welfare you didn't finish your welfare reform you know he went with\nA Gingrich agreed with him because his principles we're not that strong it wasn't about that with Bill Clinton let's go to a ... in Pittsburgh you're under his mark\nWhat thank you for taking my call\nI'm calling because when it gets um comment about the illegal aliens getting ... children in this country their children are not\nAutomatic consider sense because their parents was not under the solvent tree I mean American government say these people from China that fly over and give their children aren't citizens and that um they probably\nAre that are that mine mine are they are\nNo they're not that kind of misunderstanding because their parent is not an American citizen they weren't\nUnder they don't have any other yeah to me if\nI well I don't want to argue that you may be right but my understanding is if their child is born here that's why they're called an anchor baby and those anchor babies are American citizens\nWell that's a ... a propaganda that once you to think that way that the ... the parent has to be under the sovereignty of the American government\nAnd gets to give you another example often American ... does lead as many many decades in another country and has children their children aren't automatically says 'cause they add add some kind of lengths that residents say in the United states before they hand yet\nBut that's not true Frank or babies they don't have to they don't have to the parents don't have\nTo have a ... as you say in France be citizens have sovereignty and ...\nAnd the color skin let us know if we're wrong but that's not my understanding that if if they're born here and that's why you see the people come here all the time he we talked about that a pregnancy in the hospital that people come here from other countries and tried to time and so the baby can be born here\nI if I'm wrong call me an eight six six or Ninety red Iowa I Want to know I don't want to say something that's incorrect\nLet's go to\nLet's go to rich in Charleston South Carolina richer on with mark\nMark a good job and I don't say silly and because we had a concept when I was in the navy you're sitting in the chair you're the commanding officer you are doing a great job okay I think um Yes sir Yes sir great great job like I said I'm On my point is this here's here's the thing\nWith the purest definition of terrorism as I understand it terrorism relies on the the fear of the use or the fear of this\nThreat of force of violence coercion intimidation to subdue the opinions abuse the will of the people that is directed at so I think it would be safe to save her at the left is by and large are domestic terrorists\n\nThat would be something I Would think that that's that's that's where I'd go with that I mean if if I mean look there they're shooting at the ballpark shooting up Steve ... you know I mean the by the grace of God the man still alive today\nOkay um you just you just had a conversation with a gentleman a couple of callers ago and I I think you made the comment correct me if

they going to do now mhm\nSo you know I Hope that people are going to vote the way they see the facts rather than not vote or certain way because of the fear of intimidation oh gosh well and the anti
