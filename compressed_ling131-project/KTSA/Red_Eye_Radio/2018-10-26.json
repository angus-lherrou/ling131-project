I I the reality is I I voted for her [noise] um I supported her but she does things that um [noise] she kept fell for herself\nAnd she makes a big mistakes eloquent so there you go [noise]\nSo what you're saying is cheap believe shouldn't run and twenty [laughter] forget about Gillum we're clear on that what about twenty twenty\nYou know because here's the thing you know the bubble that the Clintons have always lived in but many people living inside the beltway or inside of the\nBut ... beltway um the ... they they when they when they go on the you know a speech tour or or you know um if they if they go out and just do some rallies right\nOr it is the case for any of them right or left that those rallies are filled with Friendly's for the most part I mean except for outside on the sidewalk they're filled with Friendly's in other words the Clintons have been surrounded by people who have been telling them they're the greatest for a long long time\nWhen you step outside that you step away from it a bit I think Hillary got some of this even when she was running and twenty sixteen remember the reporters that approached her during the campaign season and started asking questions about bill\nThen they had to pretty much at that point Debbie Wasserman Schultz was hiding Hillary [laughter]\nWhere's Hillary was the question and you ... ... ... they had to create that while they had to build a wall around Hillary so that they you know she was not approachable so she's been told by a lot of people oh you should run again you should run again you should run again\nBut it really will be their own terminals that will tell them you know our millennials on board\nNow that's a very different question as to whether or not she should go on and endorse or she could she help Gillum or any other candidate right now in the left\nIt is a very different question in terms of what she run or or should she run or would you vote for her and twenty twenty many of those same people that just criticized for maybe a few of them might vote for her\nBut I don't know that for sure because by the time we get to twenty twenty I don't know that you're millennials going to look at that and go yeah she's just not the problem we need somebody you knew and fresher gentleman besides her\nJust you know because I was actually watching the the the video over here so you didn't have access you weren't looking at the video but the woman who said\nThat she should there just for fundraising and she was older I'm going to get she yeah she was fifty plus I'm guessing she was the same woman or who said we don't trust her right that she's not trustworthy and that's interesting because somebody whose experience Hillary Clinton\nThe other two were younger there they were probably in their thirties so they probably don't go all the way back to\nAs many of us do Hillary Clinton and Hillary care way back when\nWhen uh you know she was in charge of of putting together a you know some type of single payer health care system in America in the early nineties\nUh so I thought that was really interesting yeah she can raise money but then we don't want to hear from or we don't want her image around we don't want her people don't people don't trust her and what she means as Democrats don't trust her she didn't trust her right\nAnd I when I found that just to be a I found that to be really really really interesting one other point that I Want to make her because we hear this all the time and we've addressed it before\nBut it came up again the media this week is at Trump's rallies when they talked about Hillary in lock her up that that is it that's it you know instability that that is look you're talking about a political rally and you're also talking about you know why why are they saying lock her up you have to go back to you know what's it about just because she exist\nAnd she opposed you lock her up no that goes back to what that goes back to the whole email scandal where people can identify what the crime was you could look at the law and say this is a crime that she broke and many other people who did this anybody else who did this\nAny normal person who allowed top secrets you know to be so accessible and broke the law and she did would end up in jail that's what that's based on not just based on the on what the left is attempting to portray as just pure instability they don't like her so they want to put her in jail no it's based\nOn her behavior what she did and the fact that Republicans have looked at it and said and and many have looked at it even not just Republicans conservatives with other libertarians and say I actually broke the law right she put the server in her house that's breaking the law she knew\nThat people were going to have you know at that at that level as secretary of state that every foreign government is every\nUh unfriendly and probably friendly foreign government is looking to tap into anything they possibly can to find out what you're doing\nAs secretary of state by you doing that unfriendly is where we were able to get into some of our top secrets you knew it and you did it so you could hide emails from the freedom of Information Act\nThat's a crime you know there's two crimes they're\nThe Espionage Act and trying to avoid the freedom of Information Act that's what it's about now you might say well but she never went to court it doesn't take away the fact that nobody disagrees with what the law is or what she actually did\nWell it's different than the chant by Rosie O'Donnell on the white or in front of the White House you know that is based on\nNothing gets based on fall so it's you know saying that this the current president is an agent of the of of Russia a and that and you know again implying or that and saying in some cases that he got there or to the White House illegally\nIn the in the case of lock her up it's based on a crime that nobody debates was broken by her\n... that was a law that was broken by her a crime that was committed we know it we can point to it now again it is rhetoric but it's it's the people what they're what the point that they're making is she should be in jail she's not above\nThe law right and it's also the fact that the system you know lock her up is also an attack of the system and the and the department of justice at that time right for not following the law right\nSo that isn't that isn't a again\nThe same as in any way justifying\nViolence\nThat's what is being portrayed I just want to hit that 'cause we hit that before when when uh the you know they were being criticized at the rallies for saying that\nAnd when you would read the articles that would say it was horrible they they didn't even understand what the point was that even know why the people were saying it right they didn't even addressed that particular point so if you just hear lock her up lock her up and you have no clue as the majority of Americans don't understand the constitution if you have no clue of what happened in ...\nThe team and its millennial said we don't care about that right anymore well then you look at it and so yeah it's unfair what they're saying about ... was not unfair no do you want to if you want to get in we do have a line open your calls and comments coming up eight six six Ninety ...\nTips from Jay Jay Keller and

in so much to us to talk about but I just wanted to address something\nThat you that you had said during the bottom of the hour and it was you know when we were talking a ... from an earlier conversation and talking about that you know the heated rhetoric of you know calling a Trump Hitler that you know I ... and going back in because we'd brought this up months and months and months ago\nI I don't even know it might have been after the school shooting much I'm not really sure but when we talked about\nLook heated rhetoric out there and what it means you know what you're communicating now we've never been one that have drawn the heated rhetoric and blamed the people of heated rhetoric for somebody who stopped kill somebody we didn't blame Bernie Sanders or anybody else no when ... after the school shooting we didn't we didn't do that but uh we brought up you know just\nHow inflammatory that kind of rhetoric is because what you're saying is Trump\nIs the same as a guy who committed you know a genocide of six million Jews ... which of course is just the most bizarre statement you could ever make in the only reason you do that is to inflame a rage\nIn people that's why you do it mhm because you believe that they'll actually by that and they'll be in theory aided\nOr with it and then you've gotta you've completed the brainwashing by doing that\nYou and I remember that during the Obama administration you brought this up uh uh to me just now when he was being called dictator right we had to get on the air and say guy stopped that right went on the issues is not a dictator he want he want\nHe was voted in by the people the United states conservatives and Republicans might have found distasteful but he's not a dictator\nWell and they were talking about the you know the the the idea of right the idea of a him acting uh you know again using the egg executive Penn\nInstead of going to Congress every president has that power we don't agree with that method right but every president has that power um and and you know it was about you know cap and trade and things like that that that he was essentially apple made implementing a through uh the EPA\nEvery president has that power didn't have the power for a recess appointments land league\nSupported the court stopped him he he lost in right I I think you can find every president eventually you know when they served their their terms have been rejected\nBy the courts and some executive order that they have ... up you know a put out do they try to stretch the power that they have yeah you have to make 'em dictators no no a dictator would be somebody who was not elected yeah he was the\nDuly elected and and the other part of that as we need to remind you that that's how people vote whether it's two thousand eight two thousand twelve this\nIs how the people voted uh you don't but the Democrats want you to believe that it's not how the people who voted um or there or we shouldn't have the ... like they may every excuse in the book it was the Russians\nAre we've got to get rid of the electoral college that's the problem um the uh the the majority of the people didn't vote for him if what if this is what it comes down to this is the process we have in place\nWe habit or reason and we respect the constitution\nAnd that process but I think it's very important as we talked about before for\nA ... and we we spent quite a bit of time on this this week is for us not to be that don't argue like them right right they have lost because of the way that they have argued ...\nSo even though it may satisfy your primal urge or instinct to rage outage somebody\nLike they're doing to you and you get a moment of satisfaction out of it\nIt's one of the reasons that they're losing but you and I said this\nMany times when he was true\nMhm and when you look at the things that we believe they work mhm that's why we promote them\nThat's why we do the kind of show that we do we spend a lot of time talking about this yesterday that's why we break down everything that's why we get down\nTo the issues that had and we get pushback from people on the right when we do that by the way mhm there are some not all but there are some of the right they'd want to believe the rhetoric they want to believe the height you know you and I ... and that's why we talked about dictator remember when\nUh we would sit here Obama's Muslim and we said where's the evidence right while his father now where's the evidence that that's what he believes if you look at what he believes what does he believe he believes more in the church of Jeremiah Wright mhm which wasn't preaching\nYou know Islam but was preaching hey\nAnd not Christianity but was preaching a radical hate him or hate America or a\nMessage message and thank you very much ... [laughter]\nTo friday or hate America message ... as we said come on if you look at Obama certainly not religious what do you think\nThat somebody like Obama worships anybody else out there do you really really think that you really think he's a devoted that there is a got up there that tells him what to do ... please and so we had some fun with it but we said no the evidence doesn't show that at all evidence matters across the board and we've pushed back because we've done that\nUh one of the biggest push back we had was when we made fun of jade helm Fifteen remembering ... Fifteen ... remember the number of people that called us and were furious at us\nBecause we were a mock and it was ridiculous\nOh the government's secret they're going to be in Texas and it's these a

reporting the China eavesdrop on President Trump's phone calls the times says Mr Trump continues to use an on secured iPhone despite warnings or the Chinese and Russians are listening in experts say the risks of a non secured phone go beyond listening in on calls\nThose same intelligence services could potentially a compromise that phone so it could be used as a microphone or even a video camera to record meetings a and other activities that the president's involved and that doesn't even while the phone call\nFormer homeland security under secretary Jon Cohen is an ABC News consulted the president announced a plan to lower some prescription drug prices he laments that people overseas pay much less than Americans for the same medications the world's\nRapes the benefits of American Genius and innovation while American citizens and especially our great seniors who are hit the hardest pick up the tab but no longer\nThe president's plan would not apply to medications you buy at

the chief of staff and advisors to the president that look\nHand this over to the guy gee allow him to do what he does and don't say well the everybody speculating in the media everybody mhm\nOr about the bombs and then what the motivation is\nNeither speculating ... nobody's even nobody speculate nobody's analyzing nobody's saying what I haven't seen one story anywhere maybe one existed I haven't seen I Would love to see mhm or somebody has made the same points that we have oh wow\nWhy did you give it to the inspector general there's a limit on raising the whole thing was trained the story was initially framed that uh we had foreign allies that didn't want us to release this information\nOr we heard one story said it was the British Government because of Christopher Steele and we said well wait a minute why would you pay attention to them they don't know what the top secret information is they don't know what the president had I don't know what you have they don't know what's in the Pfizer warned so why would you pay attention to them\nAnd if you were going to not release it because things were top secret\nYou would have gone to probably your secretary of state who would be dealing with those governments and and there's also an ex director of the CIA and you'd be going to Dan Coats your own director of national intelligence you wouldn't be given it to the inspector general\nWho only looks for one thing and that's corruption and therefore once was declassified and people saw what was declassified in the White House they looked and said there are probably possible crimes here\nAnd before we released is we need the first given to the inspector general of the United states to go after the corruption that we see how come nobody has written that story\nRight and if somebody has I haven't seen it I've not seen any major publication right the possibility of that story and why this all went to the inspector general why would you give it to the inspector general\nYou saw something that you believe warranted his offices action\n\nAnd what his office deals with is corruption so you're giving him the only the only path that you can go down is you're giving him evidence of corruption in the FBI and the department of justice there is no other path to go down right\nAnd nothing on the story right\nBecause if you didn't believe if if the president looked at that and didn't believe there was some kind of wrongdoing\nThan there would be no reason to contact or was it would be only if you believe if you saw it and said wow this looks like there's a possible wrongdoing within the department of justice\nThat's up to a horror which to write the report was handed over because that's what the inspector general does\n... and by the way we'd be bringing this up and thanks to many of our listeners who I get a few a week\n... people running the emails saying what's going on right what's your guy for a round thing you hear anything I mean we haven't seen any stories on it either of what's going on I mean that should be one of the biggest stories right now and and who should be reporting this biggest story who should be encouraging it Republicans are they no\nNo no no\nAnd I would think that that the media would be curious\nI Would think that uh Catherine heritage or or someone else like that would be curious you know anyone that that is a not in the mainstream media but ... but you know someone who has done some really great work in\nAll I Would think Katherine heritage Fox News would be on a consistently I Would think the

[noise] and\nRadio he's are coming I'm hearing from our eight six six Ninety ... one of the things we love talking about they're the most is the uh the economy\nOr the show you know are going back in different incarnations all the way back to Nineteen sixty nine or ... and our dealings with the transportation industry as always\nAh had that particular issue bent on economics and so when I saw this today I said okay this is something that we have to bring up so people can understand about the economy at large it was the wall Street Journal's analysis of Commerce Department\nStatistics out on why we're doing better what is driving the increase\nIn the gross in the GDP in the increase in economic growth\nWhat is you know what is driving it and their analysis is almost half of the increase\nFrom April of twenty Seventeen from last year till this year now new numbers are coming out this morning but based on the numbers that are that came out from last month\nAlmost half of the increase in our economy is due to increased government spending\nAnd they looked at you know really from the majority of the Obama administration where the uh economic uh growth was the average GDP was to point two percent\nAnd compared it to the two point nine percent economic growth that we've had since April twenty Seventeen just under three percent\nWhich as you know we know is it is a good thing a defense spending has increased drastically\nThat's one of the major reasons and increased government spending that has helped the the GDP a defense spending was contracted at an annual rate get this Eric ... to point one percent from two thousand nine to twenty Seventeen ...\nAnd they really go back to you know the president's real you know the really the first budget when he had no influence on it just wasn't looking at right ah to growing at a two point nine percent rate since April twenty Seventeen\nSo it was a huge difference in defense spending that turnaround added a point to one percentage points to the ... on average to the nation's overall economic growth rate according to the Commerce Department\nWhen a including faster spending on non defense items and spending at state and local levels increased government spending\nAccounted for a point three four percentage point of the point seven percent point increase in the growth rate since April twenty Seventeen which means\nUh the economy has grown a two point nine percent\nUh since April twenty Seventeen the last quarter was what for for one was ... right was it was a very good courtroom uh almost half of that has been because of government spending\nIf now it has also increased other factors are at play faster business investment due in part to energy investing can trigger point contributed point three percentage points to the growth rate\nFaster consumer spending accounts for about a third of the pick up a slowdown in home building has some track that two percentage points from that growth rate\nTheir concern in as as we said before is once the government spending moderate\nThe net increase goes away\nAnd as we said before the truth grows and if you listen to the show you know we've been consistent uh irrespective of whether it's been a Republican president or a Democrat president uh the GDP is not the most accurate way it's the way that we use and it's become the accepted way\nIt's never been the most uh uh accurate way we believe to truly a show the indication of economic growth\nBecause money being transferred back and forth or government spending is viewed the exact same way as private sector profits and sales and we believe that that storage\nThe actual growth rate of any economy but it's been consistent from democratic presidents to a Republican presidents well it's important to monitor the true expansion of wealth\nYes and that's and that is the that is the increase in goods and services produced by the private sector not that we don't support an increase in defense spending no we're ... we're just talking about how we analyzed how it applies to the economy is doing so without the increased in government spending\nOr you would have had a a\n... of growth rate of of two point five six percent up from the two point two percent from the Obama administration the point is how critical it is because you see the increase you see the increase in a huge increase why because of fossil fuels\nWhich drives the majority of the private sector increase in GDP that's still what's driving the majority increase in GDP in the private sector it's still not as much as government spending\nRight since April of of twenty Seventeen that's how much you know we have increased government spending over the last roughly year and a half\nWhen that government spending goes away so does the GDP increase that's why we have been so concerned and we have taken a great deal of criticism from people who used to agree with us but now disagree with us\nOn the increase of increasing the cost of goods by terrorists and as we've stayed it doesn't matter who you are doesn't matter whether you call yourself a Republican or conservative or liberal a socialist a capitalist if you believe\nThat an increased cost in goods\nIn the marketplace benefits the economy then you don't know what you're talking about it's that simple and so that's why we have always been so concerned about trade and about artificially increasing the cost of goods and services\nWhen we've talked about the president and the new NAFTA the president's number one accomplishment on the new NAFTA has been what\nWhat he believes he has done to the car industry\nWhich will increase the cost of buying a car in the United states in Canada in Mexico and we'll make it harder to sell that product made in the United states overseas\nWhich was what the president claimed he wanted on trade and we will continue to say this on tariffs the president does all over the place and when you're all over the place on a particular issue one has to ask do you have any idea what you're talking about well\nAnd as we uh break down the GDP Growth and you look at it right now and the way that there's this long lead and then they point this out on this Wall Street journal article for items like aircraft carriers and things like this so we're likely to see as this money goes through the ... a Pentagon and then it's actually spent and\nUse the local company that I recommend want them to check the damage coal two one zero Seventy five zero nine nine four one place where you have with something solid and secure Stevens

all the fake hate crimes that happen\nNational news and I believe almost every single one of them was fake ... all the huge stories that came out about\nA ... hate crimes from Trump supporters ended up being fake right and so we know people will uh will do it look we look at the cabinet and the fact Grassley going after and saying look\n... and sweating to glide mhm we're going out to where we are I Believe we should prosecute them because I Believe that they they lied what is the extent that people will do it we don't know I mean we're we're we're we are in New territory as to people willing to become sacrificial lambs\n... and ... and I think it's important to look at the\nDynamics of either possibility politically like if it's somebody who supports Trump or the dynamics of that the ultimately it potentially could hurt Republicans in Trump if it is if it's found that it is someone that support strong\nAgain potentially ... but it's you look at the other side being the false flag\nOr being someone who is liberal and is sending it out and is doing it in an effort to make the the uh the the administration Republicans in general uh but but you I think you have to look at it certainly\nA Trump himself especially look bad that would be the the attempt right\nIt's depending on who the person is it's likely not going to do I guess politically much damage one way or the other except for the fact that you add I think on the left the behavior on the left here recently\nWhen you have Maxine Waters getting their face every opportunity\nYou have the ah\nTed Cruz being shouted

thought as we might think into it we're not going to stop mhm\nAs it as a nation of free speech stopped going to stop them\nJust store but he knows did it stop or after the attempted assassination of Republican congressmen on a baseball field or did as it ratcheted up\nIn a way if we go to the Michael Moore comment that we played earlier whereas on MSNBC with everything going on as a time to ratchet it now it's time for our side\nTo wrap it up so it's not it's not going to stop it doesn't stop in a society that has free speech\nLike we have it is and go now you need to pointed out you also have to understand why people use it mhm and that's why we have stayed in and we we spend a lot of time this week saying that I don't want people did agree with my position to be using that type of rhetoric right why\nNumber one I don't believe it's the right thing to do ... number two they do use it because they need to do it they had no other outlet they don't have the substance of the ideas of with them they have to do it they feel they need to do it because they don't believe that they can convince anybody\nAny other way except to threaten them and intimidate them we don't need to do that when I say we\nAre I mean people that believe in the conservative philosophy you don't need to do that\nNo no\nYou can when you can win them over with logic in common sense the reason that a Claire McCaskill says she's separating herself from the crazy Democrats\n\nIs because she realizes that ... I've got to come across as somebody who is a common sense critical thinking person because that's what will attract\nYou know the the the the people out there if I Pretend that has a critical thinking person and don't align myself with the crazy Democrats than people are more likely to accept me that's how you get the independence as we said you're not going to convince\nYou're not going to convince a loyal Republican devout Democrat you're not going to convince a loyal Democrat to vote Republican it's those people in the middle that you are trying to get\nThe Democrats believe the only way to get them is to intimidate them with fear\nWe don't as conservatives we don't need they need to do it because they had no other and I'm coming from their point of view they need to do it because they can't back up the ideas\nRight I I I think it will be interesting to see what happens the developments you and I've been watching and monitoring the uh\nThe uh uh all the news agencies overnight a and to see if there's any movement there with this new focus on Florida and and the possibility that the ... in terms of the authorities believing that at least some of these packages were sent through a a post office there in Florida\nIn the in the coming hours I think ... and over the weekend or possibly you're going to see this this story kind of play out wants the authorities again once they find that location they won't be long before we run the identity and and again it could be as soon as today\nA or at least have a description of the person\nThen after that assuming that the person is is a is captured in and and taken into custody of live it's quite possible we could learn a lot more about the motivation of the person even if they\nAren't taken alive\nIf we learn the identity often do you go to their social media page or something like this and you see a history of maybe comments that were made and you can see their political affiliation but if we learn that motivation I don't know what changes about the election right now because you look at the bigger things right\nUm\nThey are I think the Kavanaugh thing the the the caravan situation or immigration in general and and what's going on and\nWhere conservatives are I think with with ah with all of the above\nThis was not the group that goes out and protest is not the grassroots people are screaming get out and vote get out and vote get out and vote\nIt is the silent site that has made up their mind they were outraged by what happened during the Kavanaugh process and they will act on it\nThat that

get value on we'll give you a special deal if you order volume one and two years ago\n[noise]\nFollow draws a review [noise] it's\nWhat I radio he is our economy and I'm hearing ... eight six six Ninety right are you ready for audio cut of the week\nSure and and I will admit I didn't know if I was going to use this one because I have executive privilege to pick you do yeah when did I get promoted to judge\nI don't know that was that was more just imagery oh so I'm not your actual John Deere figurehead judge great I did it to make it seem like we have some kind of democracy I have a figurehead robe no but I think if you didn't think it was worthy of being the audio cut of the week you would say so\nAnd if I said no what would happen you'd still play it right now I'd ask you I I'd be fair I I Am a fair guy I'd say well what is your suggestion but the Claire McCaskill radio ad has to be it mhm I think so and and it just I thought about it last night when I when I heard that in the\nDebate that's that's been taped apparently that\nShe called for civility mhm well she can't even be civil with her own party the Democrats mhm\nAnd you want me to prove it I'll play her latest at if you haven't heard this you'll stop what you're doing it unless you're driving\nClaire McCaskill's add the with just a week to win a little over a week to go in a dead heat really ... when you say\nOh that's about as close of all races you're going to see in the Senate right now yeah I saw hold it was about what one the last poll yeah I think so heritage Claire McCaskill's latest at\nThe Capitol ... nothing about this job Holly guy well no ... yeah lawyer who worked in any support those terrible what does he do now\nWell I think we just elected him to attorney general he's a man and are cute and fewer criminals\nAnd it never even tried a case and hasn't hall even caught hanging at the gym and our bottom line during work hours I saw that at least ... well the one thing how he did do was use our tax dollars to follow that lawsuit and protections for preexisting medical conditions\nTotally helping the insurance company and not well I don't always agree with Claire McCaskill buttons you work hard fighting against those tariffs doing all those town halls record not afraid to stand up against her own party and Claire not one of those crazy Democrats she worked\nNot one of those crazy Democrats and we would look we've ... and set it you know ... of course we left\nUh besides just laughing there's serious side to this it's decided that this was a Senate race so it means they're doing polling research like you can imagine you have to try to find out how to get the edge this was a dead heat how do we get those undecided independents\nThat you know that seemed to be leaning more conservative ...\nUh right now how do we get them to lean my way separate myself from not ah the extreme portion of my party or even the leadership\nIt's the crazy Democrats an Arab picked up on this yesterday when you said it's using the word crazy Democrat but using that term means that the feedback that Claire McCaskill is getting we fear that you're one of those crazy Democrats which comes right from the Kavanaugh hearings I Believe\nAnd if you look at the the it's likely from ... research that was done and the comments that were made during that call out research or any kind of research that has done\nI keep in mind again official campaign ad you hear her voice on the ad for reasons that by law she has to be on that ad and so they use that word crazy\nBefore Democrats for a reason because it's likely get was it was said that way by people they're concerned are going to vote right instead of left\nAnd they're trying to persuade them or trying to influence them and and let them know that she's not one of the problem is is that it's likely in part because of the Kavanaugh saying and her vote in the capital thing\nAnd we said that you don't have to be uh\nYou know someone else or who's on the committee you don't have to be a Kamala Harris or anyone else who did something you know that you consider to be\nCrazy or your voters potentially consider to be crazy in order to feel the effect of it\nIf you vote no then you're going to essentially condoned that kind of behavior and I think that's what she in part is facing right now in her state and that is your vote was everything that they needed some of those independents needed\nA to make their decision and could well this decide their vote on election day if it hasn't already an early voting\nYou will\nHave because I'm sure they'll be in some of the weekend shows you'll see some analysis of this as they do the analysis of the different commercials but I looked at this has more than just affective Republican advertising or Republican rhetoric\nI Do believe because I'm trying to think of any ad where I've heard the Republicans say the crazy Democrats ...\nUh I don't know a ... or ... ...\nI don't know I don't know if it's if Trump is use at a in a in a rally or not\nBut the fact is that ... this is in these independents that you're trying to convince in fact I was just thinking\nDuring the bottom of the hour break after our last segment I was thinking to myself 'cause we were talking about people that go out and vote that\nI went out and voted the other day early voting hours go out and vote it's just a habit I'll I'll I'll always vote I voted before I was ever a talk show host you always went out and voted dad made sure when you've got to be Eighteen he's spread out the newspaper everybody goes and vote she live in this house\nThere were two rules you didn't tell you who to vote for he'd give you his ideas of who he thinks you should vote for but you had to vote you would no choice you lived in his house you voted\nAnd when you were sixteen you've got your drivers permit to get your licence and you did not wait those are the two things you couldn't say wow I really don't you know couldn't be you know saying oh we don't know that wasn't happening in my family maybe my sisters but now my brother and I we wanted our licenses ASAP and so we were happy for that rule\nAt Eighteen it was like a ... but we had we had to vote so that was built inside of me I really don't understand the mentality which is why when we talk so much about independence this week we've got into arguments when people say well don't people don't react that way well you don't know and I don't know what we're saying is it's a possibility\nAnd when we say it's a possibility I've been getting the reaction back you know it's an absolute that nobody would react that way well you don't know that and that's why all these advertisements are going on because the politicians don't know that\nAnd so that's why they put out all these particular ads I don't know what it's like I don't know how to find somebody who only\nI'm undecided I don't know if I'm going to vote yet I might vote I might not both but I'm undecided and all this massive advertising that is pounded my way I don't know what gets that person off there but as an undecided independent to go out and vote", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "city": "San Antonio", "day": "26"}
