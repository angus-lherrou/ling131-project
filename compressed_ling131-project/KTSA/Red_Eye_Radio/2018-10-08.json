I. B. L. E.\nWell that's a big deal now it's not eighty percent not Ninety percent but sixty percent well when you a fuel elections and the point being is that we stepped back from\nThe insanity and the display the show that's being put on by the left here\nAnd the behavior by the left I mean I'm not saying it's not real I'm not saying people aren't going to react to it ah you know cirrhosis can can back whatever he wants to and people can act the way they want to and even on the Senate Judiciary committee they can say the most insane things\nIf they believe it's going to get them political points well it just might\nIn your state of Hawaii or California\nBut if you believe it's going to win the argument with the people of America you're flat out wrong\nAnd and that's why I think ... and and again this is a not a ... analysis of facts ... this is just my my gut feeling from\nWhat I what I've seen what I've heard the personal response that I just generally talk to people over the last uh a couple of weeks were more independent or non political who have paid attention to this and even though they do sympathize\nAnd because this is one of the things would just really ticked off a ton of people including a ton of women that I Know and that are that are of more ... a more conservative was if you didn't believe her\nThan your for rape ...\nIf you don't believe in the rape if you don't believe in the rape allegation\nAlone without cooperating evidence if you don't absolutely believe the allegation then\nYou're as much a rapist yourself because you're enabling raping our society\nRight well that kicked off a ton of women that I Know who just went wait a minute and I and I gave you the example two of my my buddy independent Bob\nWho said what what's the thing that you always believed the woman you don't believe anything but evidence and to me that's where the Democrats jump the shark is most of most Americans which is why you see the sixty percent and I bet you that sixty percent\nI bet you that other forty percent that so we don't want to confirm Kavanaugh had nothing to do was just the fact that they'd rather have a more liberal judge or if Trump pick somebody they don't want him\nBut I guarantee you that the majority of Americans looked at that process and said no you don't always believe the woman you have to have it so you don't believe always believe the man you don't always believe a woman they don't always lead anybody it's the evidence that you make the judgment on\nAnd yeah these senators are accusing him of being a rapist without the evidence without the evidence and in fact their kids and being a gang rape is\nWithout the evidence of of being there they say believe all women or men or women don't tell the truth but it's a majority doesn't matter that's why we judge every case individually because that's the only way that you can do it in America and I do believe that ... Americans\nUnderstand that they understand\nBasic fairness and when they see I'm not just the radicals but the mainstream of the Democrat Party the mainstream of the party that are arguably\nHas more people supporting it mhm not by much but maybe more people supporting it then the Republicans mhm just looking at the last election on the popular vote that the electoral college vote\nOr when they see that they say I don't really wished to be a part of that that's just that's crossing the line that that's no type of\nAnd and and when you find out that you know that the fact is they're the ones that burned Dr Ford\nIt was a Dianne Feinstein she burn victim Chinese the one that wouldn't keep the anonymity\nOf the victim right it was the ... who leaked it it was the Democrats right it was either find Feinstein's office or one of her staffers or it was the the the congresswoman mhm right was it was it or or her staff\nThat said it had to be one of those do right\nAnd so when you look at it you ... all you see is from the Democrats is manipulation across the board character assassination across the board not the no belief and the presumption of innocence the stereotyping the bigotry\nAll women all need to be believed a white man white men are white men can't and people look at this day and age and it's\nJust like stomp it well I think you two we have to keep in mind the and this isn't a this was recent history we don't have to go back and so the Democrats\nSixties recent history you have in it because again the same side that said we're going to stand up for women called the women who voted for Trump self massage them as they in fact the candidate herself after she lost\nWell the problem is is that women listen to their husbands the husbands tell them how to vote enrichment stupid\nBecause your husband has to tell you how about your son even your boss tells you how to vote your stupid and can't make a decision for yourself what she has it Democrats\nThere to be believed or not if they vote with their hearts and minds and the twenty sixteen election against Hillary no theirself massage units which first they will tell you for whatever reason they hate women\nPolitical history headlines right here or San Francisco chronicle activists blame white women after Susan Collins says she'll vote for Kavanaugh right ah [laughter] ah critics blame white women the rap after Susan Collins a a a cabin up a a\nSpeech yeah because ... was women women were were the oppress women were the victims in general and she'll they lost and now it's that women of color are the victims\nThey blame white women well I don't know Dr forge genetic makeup or her her ethnicity background but she appears to be and a white\nWoman and and what it comes across as is you just will do anything to get a win right you won't show compassion to a victim you will slander people you will to feign people you will say that the presumption of innocence\nShould not be part of the the the the process you say at one point that all women should be believed than you demonize other women\nAre there is no consistency to the mindset except we will do anything to get a win and I do believe that's why you had the reaction of many independents who say there's a complete total lack of any type of fairness\nAny type of ... it's the Democrats were screaming for civility like McCain and as you and I said after the McCain's funeral we said by the way this will be gone Monday\nMhm this will be gone as soon as the hearing so this was all completely gone and you've seen them taking it up to a level where there was a possibility if McCain was alive today and he and Lindsey Graham would have stood side\nBy side yes I could see a John McCain after the behavior of the left in this process making the same type of comments that Lindsey Graham Mick [noise] eight six six Ninety read I\nRead on the radio with a record ...

this country and let people\nIs that you know hurtful saves a red states where prop one\nNow what I saw you know what I think about this process now we were talking before we came out they are and I said that you have a list of ... the all the people that the president has that are on the less for potential nominees math what's your point four\nYears five point this is a list of compiling November but he actually put it out or during the campaign they're twenty something people on this list I'm asking Chuck Schumer than five nine three name one that would be okay with the\nFriends have

the other side wants to cancel the election so Chuck\nYou want somebody new look at this list and say if there's anybody of great too but what you want to do is Senator Schumer is overturned the election they take the judges were not going to let you take the judges if you want to paint judges then you need to win the White House\nWhen a a bottle once I voted for two judges that have hit so

upset because how would not want to generalize McCarthyism things good\nAnd I think I can survive in South Carolina is\nWell you know the thing is is that\nUh I think Lindsey Graham needs to get off the [laughter] that was what he really thinks first of all I think it is going to be a positive if he's campaigning I'm a second of all I think the momentum from the from uh the uh the outrage that he delivered\nA there on Capitol Hill that day\nI think will I I think that is that needs to be carried through but not just through the election not just through the mid term election\nIt needs to be carried through in that attitude needs to be carried through a on important things that that ah that matter beyond that including a legislative items and other than and who knows what kinds of other nomination process we may go through\nA while a Trump still president but uh you know making some very solid point\nOr the left was going to\nYou know they used to it when it's convenient that's what they do they point to the right\nAnd Lindsey Graham and the you know since Trump has been president anything that doesn't go along with you know any comment ah that that counters the president the left one do you use that and and and and really kind of a position Lindsey Graham to be\nThe by porters and willing to cross the aisle Republican that John McCain was and in some ways he was\nBut of course you're demonized now you're Hitler\nBecause you stand for something on its merits you stand for something\nBased on their behavior of the left and your outraged and rightly\nSo well you know the thing is and reading Frank Bruni has come to New York times that none of it relates to the actual\nCase and what he was talking about there is it's it's about the fact that Lindsey Graham has had differences with Donald Trump right and\nYou know in Trump is you know been in a Trump has been mean to him and called them names and things like that and there's been an animosity between the two and therefore [laughter] somehow Lindsey Graham shouldn't be taking from side with Trump's candidate I mean I went to him and he doesn't get what\nWe said earlier this whole cabinet thing wasn't about Trump\nIt really wasn't a Bernie doesn't get that and I don't know I I'd have to go back on and and count the number of comments made for or against Trump or from Lindsey Graham\nBut Lindsey Graham's a when he issued his concern that day or a week ago last Thursday\nIt was based on the lack of merits of the case and the ... and on the larger a much to a larger extent I pretty much the treatment of Kavanaugh by\n[noise]\nIt's\nRunning running out he's our hunting and I'm\nMary McNamara eight six six Ninety or rather I just reading here from a Alan Dershowitz I saw him couldn't find the audio anywhere but I did see him a speaking after the confirmation on Fox News and he said Democrats don't try to conduct The Revenge ah inquisition\nAll right you know don't don't try to impeach it's not gonna it's not going to work out for you if you attempt to do that and you should probably\nUnconstitutional to try to impeach him for something that he did when he was not an office right you know that he did as a teenager that is that the point you're going to try to bring\nYou know bring up I mean there is no I mean they're going to try that you're going to try to make the perjury claim right again when there is no evidence for perjury or you know whatsoever and uh and and so uh it's like really you're going to bring that up and he is just\nAnd they do not and he made it known he said look I don't want to Brett Kavanaugh on them mhm 'cause I don't want to go but if the Democrats want to pick a Supreme Court justices win the presidency right\nThat's what you have to do and and that would be you know going forward a your best bet in fact if you're on the left and we you and I talked about this off here last week\nLook to play would be look okay Kevin seated but we can't let this happen again we can't have a third justice cheated by the current president I mean that would be the argument from the left or I guess the a proposition or concern issued to the rank and file\n'em but the left doesn't operate that way the failure or with all due respect that Mr Dershowitz in his appeal to the left\nI'm really is to it is to not recognize what the left has all found out they don't care about the process they don't care about whether or not there's a case there or not they don't care about anything else just keeps screaming whining crying\nOr you know foul and that's what they'll do\nNow that's what we want them to do because it's working it's actually working right now because the rest of America looks at it and recognizes that for the silly behavior and at times outrageous behavior that it is\nAnd I don't know what's gonna happen you know I I read all the polls and everything else but I don't know because to have something like this happens so close to the election yeah so I think that has United the Republican Party like I've never seen before and I don't look I don't know how if it's motivated the the Democrats because\nIt twenty six team didn't motivate the Democrats mhm right and they hated trumpet that point mhm uh will the motivation be there now or is it more despair from the the the Democrats\nAnd well the Republicans who have definitely been

itself is incredible yet right being told that was your major talking point you've got to believe\nThat the the alleged victim the alleged victim if it's a woman alleged victim must be believe we've seen the science we know it\nMust believe the and then you get a second and third\nThat also are not credible then you start destroying that narrative at that point for it I Believe that's what they're probably saying even though they're the ones that claim you need to believe all the women all the time and they held eagles not ... they're they're yeah they're just you know even Chuck Todd is making the point well that really isn't\nTrue yeah well so is the this is the version of a right after the twenty sixteen election or we need to go to the heartland and listen to their voices ... yeah that's basically what you see except for the fact\nThat it had greater substance en route and relevance to it I mean they ... they were right by the way uh in in in November of twenty sixteen when they said that but there was no expectation they were going to do just that in this case they're looking back on it and and recognizing\nAnd again they were part of carrying that narrative\nHelping to form those narratives along the way and then saying yeah well we shouldn't have played it that way it shouldn't have been played that way\nYou when when you look at well I have an Audi a stormy Daniels'\nCase that\nAnd no one absolutely no one is shocked that a playboy billionaire had an affair\nNo and\nAgain not shocked not surprised and also not politically motivated either way by it but the left creates these narratives they give out and out of the the the ability to introduce the credibility if you will from their perspective not ours to introduce the sweating to claim\nIt must be because he's got a legitimate claim and legal claim against Trump now there must be something that he's got was sweating it it must be legit\nIf it's against Trump Trump so it hasn't come out because there there must be some legitimacy to it even if there is that right I guess the the the only other point that I'd like to make is because this is what I Wonder and again this is a completely totally unfounded allegation without anything to back it up whatsoever but everybody will understand my point\nWhat does Joe Manchin have on Schumer [laughter]\nAnd Feinstein and and

Congress from his office or well congresswoman at her office who just can't remember her name at the moment more Dianne Feinstein and his or her and her staff bribing wanted that's only who could be and and they seem to throw the blame at her dirt right well\nAnd during the hearing you heard Dianne Feinstein are addressing a chairman Grassley and saying I don't ... you know basically I don't know about my staff because I haven't actually asked them directly I don't believe they get it but I have not asked them if they did directly let's go to\nGary in sparks Nevada Gary you're on radio walk into the show\n[laughter] Hi how are you cut or got his um\nThe Republicans they keep complaining about all the things that the Democrats do but they never a press charges against anybody is like for for perjury or Hillary Clinton or Dianne Feinstein and so on it's like telling a bank robber by complaining about it\nLike delta ... we're not going to hell whoa whoa\nWhere's the perjury Audi approved the perjury\nHow do you prove the perjury prime well you know ... if you don't want to take that one out by Dianne Feinstein\nWell OK well one of those ... ... ... well my point is we go point by point why what you lead they should do so you're blowing out\nYour first point you don't go after Ford so then who do you charge next than on if you're not going to charge for who's the next one\nOkay Dianne Feinstein with her what she has a spy at a at a chauffeur\nWhile I Believe that there should be an investigation do I believe that yes of course right I I I Believe there should be investigation they are not so I Would agree\nWith you on that and I believe they have that in their problem is they're they're ... I Believe they are promising that there will be an investigation they want to look into that\nBut they never make that charge Hillary Clinton was emails there's\nWell that was all ... that's ... that's followed that wasn't Republicans fault no that was the guy\nThat was combing who clearly was politically driven and then that's something you couldn't control in that moment right\nWell do you expect the the Democrats just stop doing any of\nYou know with I don't know what it did get them but what did this behavior get them ultimately in twenty sixteen\nIt's a loss it is but because of the reason Gary that they bring it up on Capitol Hill that somebody in elected office would bring these up by these items up on Capitol Hill because\nWe've set about uh you know if you go back to uh the email thing with a with Hillary or even back to lying about been God's me which was an intern of itself a crime although it should be but it isn't a you look and see what exactly what we've said is that on the email specifically on the email\nOr investigation and the whole no reasonable prosecutor would would uh prosecuted\nWe said well it what matters here's the court of public opinion what you did and ultimately she lost in November or twenty sixteen and and thank you for the call it is not\nAlways that that and not that she's above the law or we believe they should have pursued that but I if given a choice\nHaving her in jail or is not as great as not having her in the White House\nYou know here's here's the uh the the the point about four to ... maybe he was responding in sparks Nevada was responding to when we were talking to the last\nCaller about a mark judge following a defamation of character lawsuit well when you when you go after a private citizen you have to at least have some type of evidence that this happened\nBut he said she said a of a of a private citizen can get you into trouble but still might not go to the level of perjury perjury as you would have to prove you would have to have another witness dating she's lying about it right uh you\nKnow ... or it was you know you know I I don't I'm\nI'm trying to think of ones you know somebody has been hit with defamation of character but when it's something that is just so obvious can't be true mhm uh and and so my point was I I don't know the doctor Ford situation", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "city": "San Antonio", "day": "08"}
