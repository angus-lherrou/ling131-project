[noise]\nYeah smart back with you again and taking your calls and let's go to Ron in New York City you're on with mark\nHey how're you doing pretty me mark will ...\nOkay listen you you're talking about candidates potential democratic candidates or whatever all up is president the the uh we've got two very real possibilities there in the northeast\nA weed out number one you have to governor of New York area ... calling AmeriCorps amongst sorry Andrew Cuomo her son to marry a ... or work out there\nA quite a legacy is topless governor now governor [laughter] and now you have um\nMichael Bloomberg who if you if if you realize the latest reports you switch sides he's no longer public there is now a Democrat officially\nOh I thought he was an independent for us it became a Democrat [laughter]\nYeah I voted Republican independent and back and forth now he's now he's apparently he said a Democrat\nBasically you you read in the fine print of it and you realize that he's taking up the slack for failed democratic leaders who who could convey a proper impression to the Democrats or to the public as to what they were\nI mean you had yet Hillary Clinton was a complete will train wreck and had Bernie Sanders has complete broad\nBut credit the credibility issue with Michael Bloomberg is is very good because the man is also you look it compare him on his on a scale you know put them on ... they have the same thing in common they got very broad experience with city and state and federal governments they know what they're talking about\nAh also they're quite affluent very rich people and their their head screwed on in the similar but shall we say different direction I won't say out different and my my fear personally\nIs that if Michael Bloomberg was elected to the presidency of the United states we're going to have a very strange turn around on the bench where he I suspect he will bring in his own agenda\nAnd at the same time it's not a bad agenda but he will alter the premise on which the current president Donald Trump is is is proceeding as if he does that and God Knows what can happen\nBut I think those are the only two candidates they're liable because their populace route the northeast and in the mid west I might add especially Michael Bloomberg\nReally high and you know I can understand that they're popular maybe in New York but I don't think it carries far past or maybe I don't know in the ... I don't think there is known as the mid west yeah Cuomo is is the governor but I don't think bloom or I guess it's easier to people you support by the way\nYeah and and that so that your real quick real quick I Know you're pressing the time but the the previous callers who type rated the idea of Hillary getting away with murder listen you want the honest truth of it\nI no doubt you wish for two or potential prosecuted at if you bring me out I've got a like a couple of hundred names to maybe two hundred names and I'll bring them down and to keep people in Congress and Senate people who basically made her way easier for her\nWell I I wouldn't hold up past a Hillary otherwise the word was that she had stuff on Obama I don't know that she has stuff on lots of other people knowing or Arabs I wouldn't argue with you on that could\nYou sit down to Geneva Republican you could sit down and don't count Bloomberg that you could sit down and have a cup of coffee with\nUh quite frankly very few and far between I Would say that a Lindsey Lindsey Graham strikes me as a very profound man he's a he's a really decent guy and he's he's got a heart and he's got he's got a mind and he's got a compassion for for the people at this country\nA he's a he's a Republican correct so yeah you know I I I I Would think that ideally he'd make a great pie minimum at minimum you'd make or break the the uh supposed to a you know I mean look at Trump Trump is already wise you chose a as\nAs the tea and it's it's great insurance ... behind you sew anything ever God Forbid goes dramatically raunchy get resolved you got it you've got a man who could step into your shoes and probably do just as well as you\nWell you you run your very articulate and you are blind challenge do for a Republican you did very well so I appreciate your color and you have a great night thanks so much and let's go to because ah yeah we have time right you can in is that Hammond, Indiana\nI wanted to speak to the question of of prosecuting Hillary Clinton [noise] um ... you don't want much world or if you lose an election you out one or two choices you to leave the country or you go to jail or worse\nAre are more of the reasons we're a stable democracy is because there are certain political norms that we don't royal ate\nAll remember on the set aside the loser the possibilities Democrats going through ten years of Donald Trump's tax returns after he leaves office or think back to the Bush administration a lot of people thought that the enhanced interrogation was unlawful\nRight so so we don't I don't think we want to get into a pattern where the incoming administration prosecutes the leader the leaders of the ... the former administration leaders of the other party\nBecause our our politics have become too hostile as idiots we need to take a step back and understand that there are certain traditions that are critical all through our are having a stable democracy we have and rule of law is only one of the\n... well that's an interesting point\nBecause you know a lot of people and the other side I think he shouldn't be above the law but as you point out she has a unique position of also having been the opposing candidate which of course doesn't explain what the what what what they what wait a second what the FBI and the Justice Department did with a soft coup trying to get rid of the incoming president\nSo this is a very complicated situation and she may I mean that's the\nJoy and here's the Justice Department though but I Will give you one further illustrates my point after the civil war\nRight the Confederate Sam had committed treason obviously committed treason yet we do not try to lock them up because it was more important than the rule of law that we come back together\nGood a good point can I you know I said you may not hurt me I said whoever talked me last night in quite said that get but that's what I was thinking on this issue with Hillary a you made a good point that's a great point when the civil war I appreciate you could you have coffee with on the other side or a silent when it\nProbably I Would probably lean toward a Ben Sasse\nUh-huh and he's bright guy\nYeah he's he's things things that are good you did you pass the test you did very well thanks so much\nHere I Am I Can't stand Tucker cross that have you ever watched than Fox News got these people answering questions in the news that's kind of dumb but this is interesting because\nWho'd you get along with people the way it used to be with Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan you get along people on the opposing party and and get away from the politics for a little while because you would least respected them speaking and respecting them let's go to Lynn in Pittsburgh Lynn you're on with mark", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "San Antonio", "day": "17"}
