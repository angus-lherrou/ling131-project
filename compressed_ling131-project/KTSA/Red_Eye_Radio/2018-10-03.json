I mean we talked about this years ago that Vegas was kind of building out these venues all over town to have\nThe the music festivals because those music festivals of all different genres we're drawing huge crowds\nThe eighties festivals do do really well\nUh when I was on vacation recently I saw um a an ad at one of the local venues for a like an oldies festival it was a the the Motown stuff and and older use and they were all going to be on stage in one night and so those things do really really well\nAh some of the artists don't like it because according to my friend then they feel like they don't get enough states ... you may only get a thirty or forty minutes does that yeah you know and the ideas come out and play your hits right and which is exactly why the people were there they don't really want to hear your\nNew album [laughter] and I really don't here's my new stuff now they go hey you got to see an end to it because they the the eighties towards doing it they had like\nSix or seven Vance right like well how can they are six or seven bed 'cause they all get out and play thirty forty five minutes a one after another yet every once I hit and you're sitting there and you you walk you walk in and every moment of it is enjoyable which brings you back the next year to ... to see it again\nAnd unless you have a catalog like an iron maiden or a metallic or or this summer a journey and death leopard oh yeah of course I mean they had about ...\nString of hits like they have an entire catalogue of music ... where each\nBand can go out and do a full set but it's it's sort of going back to like in the fifties in early sixties when they used to do that they should take the artist out they'd only play their heads no I think we're starting to sometimes you know if you've ever about that thing you do if you ever saw that movie that I used to be that way you do a lot with highly yeah\nWhen when he was first doing shows but people first of all were surprised that he was white when he showed up to 'em and you had a very diverse crowd that would show up for his music but a lot of those places that he played\nIt was almost like a festival kind of scenario because you have so many artist that was his early days later on on on a tour with um a Hank Snow a Johnny Horton and Elvis was helping her yeah\nAnd you know you're you're ... you're

book\nAnd Eric early review and he's our time Gary eight six six Ninety\nOr read I was Bryan we were just talking to yeah by the way he's Eric I'm Gary ... a just a a couple of things quickly here that that I respectfully disagree with him a on when he the one of the first things you said was that the\nThe these these Democrats are saying all this that you know they're not only democratic as they're not on the credit wiping rhinos or Ronald ... well he ... he said conservatives or they should get he said concert okay because you're talking about something different button but these are mainstream Democrats\nOr that they these are the Democrats up today they may not be a my grandfather who was who would say hey I'm by high grandfather and my dad's side today who was a the Democrat he helped form\nThe Democrat Party in the town that I grew up in in New York because it was a Republican town or early early part of the twentieth century\nAnd when he came there he he immigrated from Canada and he ... because of the\nBut the prejudiced against a Irish Catholics in Ontario mhm is family came and yet and so when he came salt was one party Johnny said I Want to ... among them other party my grandfather today would be considered an absolute right wing conservative ... of\nUh so uh you know to just sit there and but but when you look at the Democratic party today which are seen as the mainstream meantime find signs of mainstream of the Democrats ... ... this is the Senate Judiciary committee that you're talking about right this is a mainstream Democrat as you can get\nAnd so I Would disagree with you when you say the the the the what's going on the today's Democrats today's Democrat right uh uh rhinos aren't conservative but rhinos uh our Republican\nThey're the they're the bride if you look at at at how many are right now on Capitol Hill the Republicans have you do the headcount and and and do the put the real test in terms of being a real conservative well that many of them are in fact most of them failed that test\nWe forget were rhinos came from because everything by the way the swamp as involved as about everything about from what the original meaning Watson rhinos used to be\nThose Republicans who would spend like Democrats ... well ... almost all the Republicans today including the president ... ... they're not\nYou know about the debts right nobody's talking about the debt anymore one of the reasons Trump got elected\nWas because when Paul Ryan was what do you know after John painter accidents days left and Paul Ryan came aboard\nAnd Republicans were furious that were screaming but truck Trump was talking about it\nAbout how you know if they could they came in and he said nope the budget that rubber Ryan came in the budget it's been done has done and we're going to move on and people were furious and Paul Ryan became the rhino they they they've got to care about spending that help motivate Trump\nMhm\nYou know to where he became you know a Trump than we need to get this budget down we need to you know do these things now the Republican Party they don't care about spending\nNo so yeah rhino rhinos may not be conservative but rhinos are the mainstream of the Republican Party right today they are and even the administration\nMhm it would not have been acceptable it would not have been acceptable\nFrom any previous Republican administration before this one as we talked about yesterday we talked about the trade deal to do the trade deal with Canada and Mexico and had the stipulation on the automobile companies like we had that would have been absolutely unacceptable and ... and and the debt and then what the projected deficit yes a is somewhere around a trillion or ...\nOr more you know when we look at that are over the is it over the next year I think they'd be next fiscal year um that wouldn't have been acceptable in fact I remember\nWhen Obama came in to to power came into the presidency he was talking about well I inherited\nThat huge deficit remember that mhm which by the way we had to point out well you were actually a part of it 'cause you voted for that seven hundred billion dollar package so you were part of that you didn't inherited you helped to make it happen it wouldn't have happened\nAh without the Democrats voting for it as well including him but the point being is that\nBack in two thousand this would have been you know early two thousand nine but two thousand nine they were talking about it even the Democrats were talking about it or they you know the now they were talking about it because they wanted to put that on\nOn George W. Bush and they wanted to you know they wanted him to own it completely because\nEverything was Bush's fault remember but rubber ... rhinos ... rhino started before that but then on rhinos became the swamp yes but rhinos on the swamp was\nWhen all we're really came to the fruition especially when McConnell and pain or they were saying weren't toughen up in the budgets when you look at you know twenty twelve twenty Thirteen twenty fourteen the Republicans were furious and conservatives still had a solid hold of the Republican Party that's gone when that was it that uh that\nThat that ah Paul Ryan proposed the balancing the budget and it would have taken until twenty\nThirty oh that that was a that would have been a freak out that well that right now it would have been the it was the the summer of the the whole camp it was the summer when\nYou know a of of ah twenty ... well okay it was the summer spring sort of only get so it was before this one or two of election but yeah All right so you have that scenario and he was called a radical\nYou know for wanting to balance the budget by twenty thirty right I mean that was oh no no no that's that's unacceptable now we give the the president credit or in fact I I think that falls on his shoulders the credit for getting the corporate tax rate down to Twenty one because\nYou and I thought that was never going to have right based on the rhinos on Capitol Hill and the fact that they couldn't get it\nDone right but but that tax cuts have never been the it's always been the spending rhino when the swamp had was always directed at the out of control spending in Washington not necessarily the belief in tax cuts and that was really I'm In my opinion drove the anger and created the rhino when the swamps\nThe spending the spending the only on the on the campaigning on twenty sixteen\n... no ... even earlier than that remember you know you and I sitting here in the late at night when they enter came out and they were trying to shut down the government uh uh again in the shop down the shutdowns have never been about tax cuts shutdowns have been about\nSpending and and when the Republicans wouldn't stand up to the Democrats you're right they were held rhinos him recalled the swamp Trump was coming in to get rid of the swamp gas stop the spending to stop this yeah and even going out to the the the school lunch program\nYou know and the rhinos back then going oh no we can't cut anything ... and so when you're that goes back to you so much for when you got twenty Fifteen\nAnd you know and and a banner was leaving and Ryan was coming in Bangor didn't like messy so he went to work for a tobacco company right and so Ryan came in and and ... remember that but the thing was the everybody expected Ryan Republicans", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "city": "San Antonio", "day": "03"}
