why is that\nThe story even for news busters I mean I Know news busters typically they're promoting the or they're reporting on the media yes you know if it were CNN saying that or ESPN which I'm sure they have well blank\nThem it was a cabinet gr blank to people that are buying set of people who objected to come away okay\nAll right I ... what Eric I I've said this before though when\nEvery single

controls go whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa one thing we we can tell you with age as we know how it used to be back that not only\nAre there more news sources out there\nBut you just brought it up ... not not only they're more news sources out there\nBut you have to realize that heart access to information to find out exactly what's going on is greater than it's ever been before we were growing up and they could say whatever they want and if you want to research it it would take serious time to do the research\nTo actually know what was going on yet might we say that people are actually more

Graham ... earlier and someone said you know so tell me you guys are you surprised\nAnd and we said no one of the reason I wasn't surprised as when you know when you see would find finds a Dianne Feinstein did ... that she did not follow the protocol of the Judiciary Committee\nAnd she kept it secret I mean that is so against the protocol\nOf what you do on the Senate Judiciary committee that he was livid and the fact that there is a great belief that was the Democrats that actually kept her name secret and then betrayed heard trust\nAnd the leak the name in order to delay the ... the the cabinet nominees the Kavanaugh nomination are not nomination but the you know the the the uh coming up being confirmed the ... and Kevin confirmation and then when you had the\nSenator from a a Hawaii on the Sunday Morning news show for example and this week being asked are you confident the ah this is Renault we are you confident the Democrats didn't leak the letter a\nShe didn't answer the question right\nShip so you know you don't have confidence from the Democrats that was stepping up all this wasn't on the left who was stayed in the other day standing I'll come on I mean we all know they did it was on\nCNN it was or was it uh I think ah tapper Jake Tapper asking the panel yeah uh that at you know the same row the it's clear now that the Democrats somebody ah in that party leaked right and there and the and the response was somewhat\nRight and\nAnd so you you know they did it and so Lindsey Graham being on the Judiciary Committee mean to them that's in fury aiding because it's something that I Know Lindsey Graham has never done ... and there's a certain protocol that you're supposed to do understanding what's your role as a senator is\nLindsey Graham may be at times are part of what was used to be ... be called the swamp ... but as we know the swamp as involved in Washington DC uh especially when Republicans look at it are Trump supporters will get her even Trump looks at you know what the swamp is\nAnd\nThat's I think what are the other reasons that Lindsey Graham was just so infuriated ... and why he led off at that at that point because you know you you think about it remember first it was an immediate knowing he should be disqualified he's not qualified for this whatsoever secondly\nThey hit ... an allegation an extremely serious allegation from the Senate Judiciary committee she got word of it she's a ranking member ...\nShe's supposed to bring it to the Senate Judiciary committee or tell the woman look or I can bring the says to the ... committee but your name's eventually gonna become known we keep it secret for a while but I Need to bring it to the ... committee and then we'll have the FBI do we keep your name out of it until then but at some point if you wish to continue\nThen\nYou know we can keep it anonymous in the in the FBI in Korea but after that if you wish to continue than your name will become well known she didn't do that you know\n\nAnd so everything along the line of who paid for the the ... you know a ... lie detector uh the the suggestion of a law firm everything that has gone and then you get to the point where they leak or name\nAnd\nYou know they they they link her name the people that were supposed to protect her and that has to drive somebody like Lindsey Graham just out of his mind as it as it did he feels he has been completely betrayed our point is\nYou're just learning that now when I was like Jeff Flake you know I I'm I'm guessing he found some point he was going to make friends with a lot of people on the left remember he was doing the whole ... thing when he announced he wasn't going to run\nYou know this isn't this isn't a the way it should be uh the politics has gotten so ugly but on friday she was being cold out and even after he decided to go to the White House basically an F the administration request demand really\nHe was not going to vote on the floor he would in committee but not on the floor\nOr the confirmation then as soon as that came out there were others basically on the left coming out and calling him out still ... because they if they believe in this to my approach it is never about working with the other side\nOr coming together the two sides coming together it's Republicans coming over to the left\nThey don't hail Joe mansion there's somebody who is bipartisan while technically he is but he's not\nGetting them he's not getting any points with his own party now he doesn't get any praised for no no McCain did the media doesn't praise them no McCain did I mean after McCain was Hitler after he ran for president for it and then went away and was no longer a threat\nYou know and then and then after his passing he was praised by the left but it's always someone on the right who goes left it's not the other way around let's go to Peter in New York City Peter you're on right on Radio Welcome to the show\nBut I Do very good [noise] [noise]

especially when you have such a huge\nInvestment surplus into the United states\nSo we knew that wasn't going to happen and so to us we thought there was a lot of wasted energy and the administration trying to\nAh have such incredible trade war rhetoric with Canada Mexico when Europe\nWhen there was really no reason to have it and and with the Asian countries as as well but I Do think that when you see it you're going to see everybody claim their little victories here or there already sunk Canada\nSaying okay this is a great deal of great deals so they're going to be promoting their victories it'll be interesting to see the media in the United states promoting what is viewed as a victory and as we said you have to understand that when it comes to trade now a victory for a particular country is when the consumer has to pay more\nFor a product yeah that's how posterior backwards we are on ... it's a victory or consumers pay more to say\nBut somehow that's that's\nThe way that it is it so that's how it's promoted yeah that was promoted that's the one that comes through ... that have that the political positive is what they say we're hurting the economy slightly All right good [laughter] that's because the consumers pay because the consumers pay right\nAnd if the idea is protectionism which it is for targeted industry which it is then by definition you're asking well you're allowing that industry to raise its prices it's not just about being the ...\nIt's about paying higher prices for the industry that you say you're protecting\nAnd it's the first initial impact as we've always talked about the initial impact as when you see that there's an over supply in the market and they can't sell it for as we've seen with the with the many different growers in the United states\nWhen the Chinese tariffs hit and then they had to sell it you know that's what initially happens at rock bottom prices ... ah you know everything because they need to get rid of it\nAnd then when the adjustment gums those prices will go the way right is that they'll go way up afterwards after you get rid of the stock the demon tore\nThat you already have that you have to get rid of and that's why you had so many was the pork producers of Iowa get killed over the last four to five months and because of those particular terrorists because they had to drastically lower for as we shut all on\nA economics is simply how people respond to incentive\nThat's it right\nOr ... or you can say just instead of instead of one way distance that's it ... or anything else his opinion\nAnd the president can change that nobody can change that you can you can distort the market you can help one industry wall hurting another industry but you can't change how people respond to it and send them a disincentive\nAnd so when you do that when you decide to raise prices you hurt the overall economy if you decide to raise taxes whether it's income tax or attached to terrorists you hurt industry\nYeah and it's that simple and I don't decide that Eric doesn't as we get people mad when we say that one of those some tax is helping the economy no they don't\nKnow no\nThey hurting the economy and so um I I Can't change it you can't change that none of us can change it the president can change it all you do is to start the market in some way\nAnd that's the that's the only effect of it and then there then there's inevitably the reaction against that\nBecause when the economy if the economy starts thinking if steel and aluminum products start skyrocketing which they will by definition than the consumer is going to react to that\nWith the consumer reacts to that the economy changes that's when you have to have another political answer which is the opposite political answer that you gave her the first place\nYou undo what you did eventually\nA lot of a of our listeners lined up to talk about cabinet or the FBI investigation was some audio coming up to your calls
