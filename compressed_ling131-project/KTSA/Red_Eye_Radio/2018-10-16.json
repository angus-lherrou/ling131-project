paid by George Soros\nMaybe anyhow but you know okay All right a number of states have laws which were passed\nAnd these laws were aimed at the Ku Klux Klan now the Ku Klux Klan very famously late twenties Nineteen thirty for example would do these marches and they weren't there full regalia such as it was right including a full hook covering covering their edge\nRight\nStates pass laws saying you and you can demonstrate you can march which you cannot cover your head you cannot obscure your head\n\nAnd I know you want to again I go ahead to the point is I've seen this video with these anti pot demonstrators have dark glasses they have a ... yeah on their lower part of their face or they have a ... type masks right those ski mask types the hatch right ... right\nThere are scary face they're violating it like ... why are they being rushed it\nAh I don't know ... number one thing\nAnd they're violating they're violating these laws because their faces obscured\nWell but you know

was just I just thought of as you know this ... joy for states to make a lot of money just think it just has a clan law like this alone like this say it say it's a small fine right like five hundred dollars or whatever it is Jack the sign up to like five thousand dollars\nActually five hundred to me\nA check is going up to thousands and thousands of dollars right now these people are on somebody's face\nThe payroll they don't have any money\nYou make a great point you make my point of the problem is that the mayor's don't want to please to enforce the laws and so in effect you can get away with it at Berkeley and and other towns like Portland a ... that's where your problem is\nThat they're letting him and you you make a great point may probably they can't hide their faces that makes perfect sense to me\nWell why doesn't make sense where I shouldn't say that is I think we got a challenge Tim in Columbia South Carolina go ahead\nYeah um yeah ... the guy that limited period

R.\nAnd AOL dot com let's go to David in St Louis you're on with mark [noise]\nOkay thank you mark guy a a I'm a two times a shown the revolution I'm very old blood and one of the things that really concerns me\nThis immigration thing is a it would not bother me at that roundup every single illegal immigrant put them out of the country get in line and respect those that have been waiting to get into our country\nBut even before that uh what do you say ... or a black American okay what do you would take some of these billions of dollars we're spending on these illegal immigrants and get into our inner cities\nPut in some very good schools uh provide some very good teachers pay them well\nAnd look at black America hand up a does anybody have a problem with that I'll listen to your answer off air and thank you sir\nYeah absolutely does amaze me you you make a good point that does amaze me that minority communities vote heavily for Democrats as an example who are selling out to legal immigrants hurting their very constituents right because often minorities tend to be\nCan be or should put it that way at the lower end of the economic scale and looking for that first job or or for jobs with the lowest skills and their so called leaders sell them out\nActually ... sessions was very good on that and I think you pointed out to President Trump\nI have a lot of problems with them but it wasn't on that and so who's defending the people the workers and the people who need jobs it's certainly not the Democrats not on that side not when they support unfettered uh illegal immigration so that part I don't get that someone mentioned Maxine Waters\nThey blindly vote for her there's a famous talk show host whose mother told me she was a family friend and she told me she would be one of those people you know what the polls were they\nUh help people out and they check them in and all that kinda stuff and people would come to her with this card from Maxine Waters about everybody who devote four\nAnd she would try to tell them by the way you're you're not in this area and they get very upset Maxine told me to come here and that was it the fact that these she sold out her so called the people in the sense that votes for policies that certainly favor legal immigration\n... they didn't know that they didn't understand that no one's ever explain that to them that's why I often say the reason people vote for the left\nOr Democrats for that matter because they've never heard our side\nAnd I know over ... side as the conservative side constitutional aside is much harder to explain and I think that the has is a fact that people have to consider let's go to Rick in Los Angeles recount market market\nA market so much for taking my call before making my what I Do want to preface this by saying I Am the son of legal immigrants my parents escaped Nazi Europe in Nineteen forty one\nThey were lucky to get into this country needs to sponsor it went through Ellis Island so I don't have a lot of sympathy for those that you know break into this country illegally and you know they want more you know I could not economic hardship my parents were running for their lives\nThere is a different that's number one and they still came here legally number two thanks to the idiots running their lovely state of California where I live\nUh and you know we're trying to make it a sanctuary steak\nShe the laws changed you didn't know it just due to the constitution all of sudden changed it's no longer illegal to break into the state of California she once you get here as long as you get in and then you don't break any other laws too good to go\nThat this has been this is the new law that you didn't know was like rewritten into the constitution\nAnd it is the most ... upsetting\nA circumstance and you'll also notice it's gone from illegal alien which was the actual correct term to illegal immigrants to document it now you noticed the left they don't even say illegal immigrant anymore everyone's everyone's an immigrant illegal legal does matter everyone's in number Clint\nIs what are they left this has become yeah I didn't do that but the left certainly has a\n... done very well with the language we we'd lose to them all the time I don't know if you know but I Do live in Los Angeles in Los Angeles area so I I was just what you're talking about and for people to do know there was something on the ballot to secede\nFrom the rest of the country and I I was saying that I'd be one of the first to sign it on my way out to Texas has made a lot of sense to me\n[laughter] than a foreigner become its own state of but of course I'm never allow that to happen because Democrats would never went on another election a nationwide\nBut you're right you're right about illegal immigration you write about the fact that we used to be illegal alien but they win the battle of the language rights pro choice for his pro life\nA livable wage I got to talk about that some more that you know our business over ... livable wage you know it doesn't always employed but they when the language ... oh yeah I forgot the big one a global warming became climate change when it was too cold at certain times that they're really good\nAt winning the battle of the language and when you could find terms you tend to when\nYou are you making really good point yeah they're always moving the goalpost because it's a it's it's how they operate so\nSo I'm going to have to ask before I let you see before you go I got to ask you this why are you still living in Los Angeles\nYou know I still love the lifestyle and like yeah you know you're here up up up paying a picture for you and you'll notice very well\nI I have family in orange county San Diego okay and you're probably going to go down there for Thanksgiving so it's November it's Seventy five degrees you hit that stretch where you are or get you know around um [noise] oh where the ... nuclear reactors are where's that\nYeah the ... I I have not us can do to wherever yeah we both lost the guy\nI Can't can't think of the name right and you hit that strip of of the Pacific ocean and you're in your car and you're going sixty five and you're listening to great music you can't beat it it's still it's still the place they come here in droves it's still the place to live\nSolve finished with this and my brother comes out from Texas and he says there's only one redeeming value left to California and that's the weather and that's kind of what you say yeah thanks thanks for your call I sure is very much", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "San Antonio", "day": "16"}
