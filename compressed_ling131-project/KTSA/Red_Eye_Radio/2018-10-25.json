well I'm In good morning thanks for being here as we are not just a twelve\nDays from uh the election and you know you and I had talked earlier will play it again here will play a little bit again the radio ad from\nA [laughter] I'm\nClaire McCaskill Claire McCaskill I don't know why it had a blank on her last name Claire McCaskill from ... Missouri\nA rare where they had two guys talking and and you know this was her campaign ads saying she's not like one of she felt like the ... Democrats right and you know again that was the message that she wanted to put out there with her approval of Boston as an outside group doing\nThe actual commercial right and we said that's really interesting because that means that in their polling\nThey realize and and as you said Eric to use the word crazy not extreme but crazy\nRight Claire McCaskill a\nMainstream Democrat found that in the last couple of weeks in an election where she's\nBehind a still a toss up but she's still behind that she needs to use the term crazy\nDemocrats I'm not like one of those crazy Democrats ... and it was and and I just have to come upon this article here and I'm just doing some scanning here a few moments ago\nFrom A Douglas shown who is the the ... the former Democratic pollster who's on Fox News all the time right and just you know and and uh again since he's been a democratic pollster and he's identified\nA throughout his life as a as as a Democrat he said the Democrats have a problem or a serious problem\nBut one that they have yet to acknowledge fully or frankly at all what's the problem here it is Democrats a boost so far in the ... the Republicans of attacks on them for being extremists and too far in the clutches of they're tired out of touch leadership have been working\n...\nRepublican campaign is now simple just focus on how far left the Democrats are and how beholden its candidates particularly congressional candidates are to the unpopular democratic leadership in both the house\nAnd the Senate I've argued here and elsewhere the Democrats need new leadership I've also suggested that\nCandidates were rejected their leadership are likely to do better than those who remain quiet take the money and suffer the political consequences but right now as we head into the final two weeks of the election campaign\nIt appears that both the Senate and potentially the house races are tightening and it appears that Donald Trump's attacks on the Democratic party for being out of touch with the electorate and too confrontational\nAs well as led by two failed leaders of the past are working\nRest assured the Republicans have failed to take advantage of what\nHas been their principal opportunity which has to run on the economy\nAnd get credit for something that voters themselves the is improving\nAnd beneficial you what I've said the exact same thing the Republicans still and even the administration\nFocus on things outside\nOf where they have clear victories that are clear to the American public\nAnd at times decide to get into the mud when there's no reason to get into the mud right as we said you do for the win every single time once you get that when you move on to the next when you don't weaken your when a exist that being said\nThe care of them currently moving from uh the Mexico Guatemala border towards the United states gets Trump's and the Republicans a chance to double down on immigration and issue the Democrats themselves remained vulnerable on\n\nWhy are the Democrats vulnerable on immigration because they have not just about the attack that they are for open borders bingo\nWe've been saying for years and this is what we said pretty much throughout the show yesterday and and uh earlier this week as well they have to be positioned very clearly the question has to be asked where do you stand on the border\nThey must be forced to say it because it's very clear to most people but but they're going to have to answer the question what level of border enforcement do support\nWhat don't use the word comprehensive\nExactly what do you support we know you don't want the wall that's a given what do you support we know what you don't want what do you want\nHe said again I have argued elsewhere the party should have been raised in immigration compromise where the wall would be built in exchange for a pathway to citizenship for the eleven to twelve million immigrants not here legally remember he's a lifelong\nUh uh you know a Democrat and a former Democratic pollster just you understand but that's really a lot of what we have said that we have ... as we said yesterday and I believe the day before\nOn on the whole caravan thing this was a perfect opportunity for the Republicans and the president to back them into a corner\nAnd go after the Democratic leadership and state what do you want because I still hear it from Democrats what we need to have this comprehensive immigration reform and nobody ever asked them what that means right what does that mean specifically what do you want\nAnd he talks about it here are I Would you be for the would you be for a pathway to citizenship for the immigrants that are here and then a wall is to be built and anybody who comes here in the future must go back and\n\nAre you for that that but you can't\nWe have said it's impossible to have a debate right now and has been for the last Thirteen Years yeah because when you when I came on the show together the issue we had to go back and looked at this yesterday in the history of our show the first thing that we really discuss was a\nWas a like a Kennedy a McCain McCain Kennedy mhm which was the amnesty that was two thousand five just it they they made the decisions a couple of weeks after you and I started working together right\nAnd so for Thirteen Years the Democrats have not had to tell the American public where they stand on illegal immigration what would they do\nWhat with their plan be thinking about this and that by the way that say Republican failure mhm because of Republican should be demanding every ... every time they talk about illegal immigration it shouldn't be the Democrats\n... ... it should be as we've said you make the accusation Democrats one open borders\nAnd when they cry you our line fine then you tell me specifically what kind of deal you would want done issue them the challenge and that's what was shown as saying here that again they haven't had to answer they haven't had\nTo they don't they some of them don't agree with the open borders but they don't denounce it either and he also talked about the elimination of ice how you had that and there wasn't a massive response from Democrats saying well that's ridiculous you don't get rid of ice\nStevens roofing Seventy five zero nine nine for checking about online at Stevens or even gotten that that number again

they mailed had to be used not extremists Democrat right or not that I disagree with my party at times but I'm not one of those crazy Democrats and the dog was shown saying the same thing there from what they can see the pollsters\nThat is telling them that independence and this has to be independent of independence and undecided are leaning more towards Republicans than they normally do\nBecause

we've said we've discussed is a little bit and and gone through the different questions or as others have yesterday and and we we've asked the question that if it was it if they are like that if they were alive bombs\nAnd and they would have gone off a\nThen you have to look at that in a different way that if clearly none of them were alive bombs mhm that it would it be there'd been an attempt to scare or an attempt a possibility of an attempt\nTo ah you know look at major figures in the Democratic party but are not like well by members of the right in this country\nAnd you know try to you know give the tried to send the message that they're out to get them\n... or that you know ... if if it was you know if it was it was a real bombing that's but if it was a fake bomb it would be was it said by somebody on the left to try to blame the right there's a whole bunch of different scenarios and questions you would ask is an investigator based on whether\nThe bombs were actually live or whether they were fake bombs\nRight [noise] yeah and we can only ... will only know that if and when they find the person who or persons who response right\nAnd that could be never so that the you can bet right now they have a number of great leads especially with the fact the nature of of how males sorted or by the secret service or in the in terms of the the Clintons when you look at and and the Obamas when you look at that situation\nUm that I think you have to take into consideration\nWhat they already know about that you know patterns of behavior by people who do such a thing\nAnd and their resources are there probably on to some pretty solid leads right now then add to that of course cameras being everywhere\nSo you will you know as soon as we get information we can start having that discussion but we want to point that out that you're seeing that story from National Review go viral it's important to have the discussion based on facts based on what we know right and there is a difference and we may learn\nThat uh the authorities and and authorities will tell us or might tell us at some point that those devices were effectively harmless because they weren't set to go off but that is not what you're seeing here and there's a pie report that was the source of the national review article\nAgain just looking at social media overnight it has gone it has gone viral ... that said there was a we don't know that yet and I Associated Press story does not state that and it's important that\nYou know facts were brought up I was reading the daily wire story where they they talked about the a reporter for CNN and that looked at Martha ... who was interviewing\nOne of a one of the bomb experts right and this bomb expert gave out all the possibilities who said look could be somebody from the right and he said it could be a you know it could be but you know a\nForeign state that is trying to destroy the you know this trying to disrupt the election or as you said it could be a false flag from somebody on the left mhm\nSo what the CNN reporter put out was only the response from this expert of that it was somebody on the left and left out when this expert said it can be somebody from the right\n... it could be a foreign actor or could be a false flag from somebody on the left because the election is just two weeks away where I brought up all the possibilities and investigator would bring out\nAnd what did the CNN reporter to weed out just deport the report that apparently media matters poured out which is a leftist leaning or or you know media organization media\nA truth organization where they only put out ... just his opinion\nIn the most divisive in that moment\nAnd it's so obvious and they seem to be completely and totally clueless are unaware that it's like I'd die you're just saying you're against the divisiveness\n... you are committing the ultimate sort of divisive is like blaming somebody and you don't have any of the facts you don't know what the facts are and you've already come to a conclusion of who's to blame that that is the ultimate and being a divisive media outlet\nTell us where we're wrong eight six six Ninety right eye\nIn

say the Republicans either divisiveness calling Democrats crazy no she's a Democrat mhm and in the ad because this ad was you'll hear her say just approved by or\nA where she calls because it's approved by her this was her ad calling Democrats she's not like those crazy Democrats when we go All right\nAnd left and right now just nothing already know about this jobs highly guy well no holiday yeah lawyer who worked in any support those terrible what does he do now well I think we just elected\nHim to attorney general he's a man and our prosecutors are criminals and it never even tried to ... and having hall even caught hanging at the gym\nNow buying them lying during work hours or I saw that at least ... around the one thing how he did do is use our tax dollars are filed a lawsuit and protections for preexisting medical conditions yeah\nTotally health insurance company and not I don't always agree with Claire McCaskill by work hard fighting against those terrorists doing all those town hall of course not afraid to stand up against her own party and Claire not one of those crazy Democrat and she works right in the middle\n[laughter] ... yeah\n[laughter] so a couple of things there her first of all the word crazy that was very specific they use that for a reason that was done because it came back and some kind of research\nAh and it was probably the number one word used by\nPeople that are undecided to send a center this is why you have the one guy I don't always agree with Claire McCaskill for especially when she acts like a crazy Democrat um no they wouldn't do it [laughter] when he that was a positioning statement I don't always agree with Claire McCaskill\nWell who does except maybe Claire McCaskill [laughter] I don't know if one person on the planet she's probably had disagreements with everyone but it but that's the positioning ... you're going to say that the basically ... well I Do now she's in the middle and uh you know the other guy\nHe buys wine and goes to the gym [noise] theater there's there's your political argument why do we need a guy that buys wine and goes to the gym that's that's really what I\nWhat I find interesting is you know where politics has come to today and uh and in this case on that on the Democrats' side\nWhere you have to say I don't agree with her all the time she's willing to compromise ... and she's not one of the crazy yeah use that word not one of the crazy Democrats and\nI I've always found that that interesting why can't a politician say here's where I stand on this issue this ... this issue if you like me vote for me if you don't\nWell nothing I can do about if I paid for by because I only vote I don't vote for people that I don't agree\nWith the vast majority on the issues with\nAh yeah and and by the way I Need to say something in the spirit of full disclosure here I Would buy wine at the gym if they sold it\nOkay and if I went to a gym a but [laughter] it's it is one of those it's it's it's a horrible attempt I hate the contrived all Judy Bob what are you thinking in terms zero vote\nIt's you can use real real people but that's not what they did here they're trying to portray real people or the sentiment of people\nUm and\nThey probably couldn't find it to be ...\nI I Will set it aside I mean with if you look at the the issue that they were concerned about most in that at a uh it was terrorists\nYes and we've talked about the mid west it was something that we talked about yesterday and that the the the the the farmer that is some of the backbone of the Trump support Democrats are going directly at because of their loss of business because of the the the terrorists mostly due to the Chinese so\nIt is something we we ... we were you brought that up in the last couple of days when we talk about okay what might affect the Democrats\nTo help them win or what might affect the Republicans to help them win what is the strategy that they're using but in that ad it was terrorists twice\nHere's the interest interesting question outside of farmers that that was targeted to in Missouri\nIf you went up to the average person in the street and said what do you think about ... do you think they'd have any idea what they were in a nation we're Seventy five percent of the American public cannot tell you what the three branches of government dar yeah\nUm you know it's it it really is about the president's I guess in the state of the industry the particular ... and and and that is the case in in huge farm states it even if you're not a farmer\nUm ... yeah right wow you know like you know to you know the effect on the farmers and they bring very vocal about it if you're in that said even if you're not a former\nAh you know again depending on the impacts that they they felt it was\nWorth uh making that point ah\nWhich you know we'll see if\nWait works or if any of this works er here within two weeks\n[noise] it's a I I think the most notable point is the word crazy yeah because it is it it\nThat positioning was I'm not going the way of of others in my party because keep in mind she she's not trying to position this and this is her\nYou heard her say it she approves this message this is her campaign that\nShe's not saying the people that are protesters\nShe's referring to her ... her party and we have to point out that we've pointed out you know over the last several weeks these are the mainstream high ranking members of the party\nThat she's referring to here\nIn terms of the word crazy that's what that's what they're trying to that's how they're trying to do the positioning hear that word is very important because it likely came back and research\nAnd we made the point earlier that it wasn't she didn't use the word I'm not with the extreme part of my party or she didn't say I don't always agree\nYou know uh you know with my my party in at ... approach or are you writing again it wasn't it ... the men having the conversation didn't say well she doesn't always agree with her party and there's some extreme is you know in there that she doesn't she's ... it was the term\nAs you brought up and so rightly it was the term they felt the term crazy Democrat and ... that she rejects the crazy Democrats you had to be put into that ad right where the momentum they believe might be moving towards Holly and not her", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio",
