I wanted twenty these these plans will probably grow [laughter] in terms of the political promise behind them but they were offering these plans you'd be viewed as a right wing conservative and has seen months up because I mean think about it\nUm you do have to offer more and more as we go along right I mean that's that has to be in terms of the political promised the free stuff has to be you know more and more\nAre we broke it down earlier on the you know before on the nearly fifty K.\nA that's a that that the poorest of children by the time they're Eighteen would have in this account and the and the treasury well the problem with that is that you know you're talking about a political promise right you're talking about something that's going to happen in the future so by the time that it actually\nStarted began you know on twenty twenty two if Cory Booker too\nWas to become president right I'm not only with the you know the breakdown of you know they won't be enough\nBut the timeline will be wrong because well wait a minute I just I just my my child's already born\nMy child's Thirteen this my child going to get something my child just started\nCollege and I just spent a lot of money raising my child be these were my child going to get C B pro rated right while because you can talk about paying off the college loan right years later I mean even the Obamas had college loans when they went into\nThe White House or do but if if because that's something you could handle it if you did the political promise I'm just talking about promising something on um talk I'm not talking about funding it or the reality of it I'm Talking to relive I'm Talking about the\nThe the the reality of a political promise connecting with someone motivating them enough to vote for them\nThat's all that is that's that's that's the only thing in this equation because you think about it oh wait a minute\nA you know a a Ocasio Cortez is promising or Kamala Harris was promising me this on the living wage right okay that's that's his or Ocasio Cortez is saying ah will ah will will pay for college\nWhich would include your college you're existing college loan or in some cases right will pay off your college mom um\nThose are those can be retroactive or can be a future promise for people who are voting now not only if you're talking about the you know the people who might vote Democrat or or might be in the center are being independent and look at this idea and go well well well that could work\nOr does it really effectively work with their particular situation\nAnd then on top of that or does that interest me if if I'm really thinking about a generation who's having fewer kids\nThere's the book or plan even resonate with them we were kids I I Know what about me\nI'm not I don't I'm not worried about my children because I don't really plan on having a family I'm giving my children the debt well yeah [laughter] I'm not going to have kids because it's too expensive even with your fifty thousand dollar plan enough it's not enough so I'm not ... oh wait a minute\nBy the thousand\nDollars doesn't help with raising my child now\nThat's what I Need to ... dollars a year at the exact and help with raising my child now that's because the idea is that we\nHave you know we have too many kids in these poor families that by the time they're Eighteen they're\nA disadvantage because they can't afford college were home and all of this all these items well no no no no no you're you're not you're not trying to get the future vote of those kids who haven't been born yet you're trying to get there\nBut you know would be parents votes right now and they're thinking to themselves well no I've got a number of reasons why\nThey don't want to have a family 'cause I Can't afford it you're not giving me so it's never going to be All right\nSo now I'm so Camilla Harris gets my vote because she's promising me six thousand dollars if she gets a lot and how it how would my kid exactly as long as six thousand now\nAnd or Bernie gives me or maybe Kamala Harris comes adds onto it and says free college for everybody and she gets my vote too because she's going to include existing college loans and of course for healthcare yes Medicare to right yeah so the what you can give me no\n... or ... my kid you're fifty thousand I Know I'm not having kids ... thousand Eighteen years from now no and and my kid gets it I don't get ... no no I'd rather get the six thousand dollars now\nAll the ways that will give me ... will know give me the six to ... don't get me six thousand dollars give me Fifteen thousand dollars to raise my kids now right instead of the fifty thousand dollars at my kid could use down the road right no I Want it now and give me at now\nGimme gimme gimme gimme gimme that then you're not trying to get the vote of the the baby that's yet to be born you're trying to get the adult boats they don't care about the future\nThey care about now see they're not thinking we're ... we're trying to tell them Gary we can do the strategy for I don't know a couple of million apiece they're just not thinking you're either not going big enough or you're not going direct enough\nLet's go to William in Virginia William welcome you're on ...

I Believe it was also Chris Cuomo\nOn a separate en route yeah on a separate interview that ask the questions\nOr to a case you're Cortez and I forgot who the other one Gillum from Florida oh okay and and so it was Cuomo asking them about Frank ... about how ... how you pay for it and none of them can answer it right but the fact is even on for for those because we always get\nWell don't you understand you're gonna save a lot more money even with the savings that had been taken into account right\nAbout Bernie Sanders and and you know has talked about the Medicare for all\nOr cage of protests and Gillum whatever ab promoted\nEverybody knows it can't be paid for right you're going to have to borrow huge amounts of money to do it why because the public will not allow you to raise taxes to that I'm Out right it's that simple how do we know because Vermont said no just\nBill payer why they couldn't afford it remember California ... didn't Ronald said no just single payer California one of the bill yeah\nCalifornia was saying okay single payer but we ... we didn't put a funding mechanism in the bill and then you had one lawmaker say well we can't we can't we can't do this we we have to have a funding mechanism\nWell no\nJust just pass it just pass it without a funding mechanism Basset worry about the idea and I was threatened by the way for them to get out saying no we can't do this because there's no funding mechanism you have to have a funding mechanism\nWell borrow we can print more money\nWhy not just printed up money to make everyone a billionaire forget

up\nA race that a lot of people are are still calling it\nA journey this article and Fox taught a box not Fox talking about undecided voters are independent voters and they said you know they they roughly and this was from yesterday ... ten percent of voters are undecided [laughter] they said a lot of undecided voters probably won't even vote\nOkay I was I I was actually going to ask that that or I was curious about that\nWhen we talked about it earlier how many of those are going because if you think about where midterms are right\nUh there is a lot of excitement especially for the people who follow it but how much of excitement how much excitement generally speaking is there about the midterms for the average American\nI I really wonder I I it's it's typically it's not the turnout that you're going to see at a at a major election year a presidential election year\nAnd so right now are we looking at the average so for the independence could you see\nA number of them just staying home they're not moderated what what are the other or that there are just right at you know populist version here ... they're they're upset with both parties are they're not excited by either party\nI you know and and when you're you're talking about independence and undecided mhm ah again yeah there could be a difference between an independent and an undecided when there's a lot of overlap in there\nWell because it because I because the the difference really is the turnout\nAnd and as a they talk about here in this box story this year as undecided voters ... are more moderate and conservative\nOr\nThey talked to one pollsters said before the contentious fight over Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination the undecided voter head leaned Republican the overly part is the nature of the Supreme Court battle help consolidate\nThe GOP support so to actually strengthen the they they believe the undecided voter who was leaning more Republican more\nUndecided were leading more Republican\nAnd they believe helped to consolidate but said don't know if that will last you know the extra weeks all the way up till the election right so the undecided vote has had a GOP link to it so it makes sense of cabin up produce some G. O. P. consolidation whether it endures to election day or not is another issue\nYeah because when you ... the differences is when you look at the undecided a in a likely voter pole and that's different than a independence overall who are unaffiliated with one side of the other because they may not necessarily fit that likely voter category\nI found this uh uh interesting ah\nThey talks the two here in the ... article Barbara a cabal of ... university and uh I Believe part of the ... poll or send details on the voters and so they could be persuaded\nThat they found in Wisconsin Minnesota in Nevada in general those voters were more likely to say they were independent and to identify India logically as moderate or conservative\n\nIn Wisconsin Fifteen Percent of voters say their Senate vote is persuadable Seventy one percent are independent while thirty nine percent say they're conservative and thirty six percent said that they are\nModerate but then again I to me what is moderate mean anymore are people willing to say they're liberal right I Know a ton of people that say they're moderate and there are liberal on model yeah yeah so to me that term moderate versus people still have people who are liberal still have an aversion\nTo get my man that they're liberally were moderate right well\nAnd [laughter] you know it's it's sometimes it also uh the independent while I lean Democrat I lean Republican and and how does that change between elections right we had how many of them\nIn twenty sixteen that leaned Democrat but didn't vote Democrat or\nThe other point to make an undecided voters women are more likely to be undecided voters in twenty eight team which means in a way because they say a lot of undecided voters are are in mid term are less likely to vote does that mean with the women vote would be hurt which traditionally would hurt Democrats\n[noise] Mm\n[noise] yeah it interesting that you can go through all these you know pollsters doing all their analytical data and it's still means nothing because we can figure out what the voters actually going to do when they go to the poll depending on us we've talked about all this week all the different variables that encompass you know\nThe encompass this election and make this election and this midterm election completely and totally unique even up to the point of something that will drive I Believe voters to the polls which is completely unusual for an election season like this which is\nThe caravan coming through Mexico which has the potential of bringing immigration not the cabinet vote but immigration back to the number one issue as it has been over the last year and a half which clearly favors the Republicans\n[noise] you know I'm again it it really is it it's always about turnout but right now it's also about motivation where was the cabinet thing last it does last for conservatives\nIt doesn't last for Republicans does it lasts for Democrats the same way\nDoes it lasts for independence who lean Republican because they're not Lincoln's or because I don't know\nWell because if you look at the numbers in the Senate races I mean most are calling it right now saying in the Senate looks like the Republicans will hold a set\nSo what would be what would be the the lasting effect on the ... as a Democrat\nBut it in that it it would be well we need to you know capture the Senate to block\nOr you know Trump's nominations right we need to we need to do that but if they believe looking at the polls well we're not going to get that anyway so I'm not motivated to go for the opposite of that we need to get the vote out but if they see this as an uphill battle that there's no way to get the majority of the ...\nThe cabinet thing doesn't have an effect for somebody on on the left\nTheoretically it just doesn't it just because the\nThe point would be well we need to make sure that he doesn't get to see another constructions and if you see it it's it's inevitable that the Republicans will keep the Senate\nKnow it's interesting I've not seen an ad anywhere Internet that has said don't all don't allow Trump to pick up\nSupreme Court justice maybe that's running somewhere right right right I have not seen it yet and I'm surprised I haven't seen it because in the last couple of days I've seen a ton of political ads on the different channels that I go to especially the different sports channels on Saturday ... that are covering some of these regional football games around the country I've seen\nA lot of that\nAnd you would think that that would be one ad that would be out there is that is that just not a selling point right now there are Democrats tested that and that's just not working because you would think that would be the one thing mhm luck vote for this senator don't give Trump another shot at picking another Supreme Court justice light cabinet right\nAnd I even born at very least ... leave cabin out of it we cannot let Trump\nPick another Supreme Court justice at an end it there I haven't seen that either but it may be there but I haven't seen\nO'Rourke has even use that I don't know I don't know I don't know\nIn and out of that and I've seen is that and I've seen a ton of his ads where we had last week right\nI mean that would be the that would be the crying call when it to have a lasting effect from even if you don't mention capital to have a lasting effect from the ... I think\nEither poles or their internal poll saying that that is not resonating with their rank and file\nOr do they know as a you know as the party looking at going look you're going to get your for whatever reason your money is wasted in this area you're at and money is wasted in this area\nUh over free stuff just just make the promises and move on eight six six Ninety read I\nHad the realm of combat in global hunger and malnutrition what is the U.S department of agriculture doing to encourage the younger generation to take up these causes\nDuring a Norman ... dialogue keynote speech friday under secretary for trade and for an agricultural affairs had McKinney entered his own question by setting examples of USDA programs involved in those efforts\nWere very very proud to fund and support the boardwalk fellows program\nWhere scientists that ad professionals from developing countries emerging markets are hosted by partners at American land grant universities for multi week education and collaboration sessions\nAnd similar USDA supported program is the Cochrane fellows which involves a shorter trading period there is also hands out efforts around the globe through programs like McGovern bill\nThere's three parts at speeding but it's also education and so forth and they do have some nutrition elements to that\nA rod bad reporting for the U.S department of agriculture in Washington DC\nThe USDA report is sponsored by cynics road master XL premium highway diesel fuel and shell row tele [noise]\nDish H.

started this is exactly what he said in Nevada ah yeah no I you know or you don't get to take the lower taxes and the growth you don't get to take the claim a you know based on things that right now are working toward the economy that the economists\nAre saying you know one of the reasons I was going through a lot of his his uh his speech because one of the things that we have talked about in ... and I want to get back briefly the one we played a part of a President Trump and and Ted Cruz and talked about the you know the the the power of the the power base that they actually are\nAre in in the state of Texas said just a couple of years ago when there was a split you know there were there were conservatives who like Trump\nThat became never Trump or ... yeah right ... may never Trump ... they thought it was just they it was unforgivable for for ... for them to see\nThat Cruz had been marginalized inside the Republican Party and they blame Trump port\nYeah or whether it was and and and I I Would say that the\nUh the low point of that or could call it a high point or low points depending on your point of view\nWas when Ted Cruz was booed at the Republican National convention somebody like Ted Cruz\nAs probably one of the most conservative members of Congress in the Republican Party was food yeah\nAnd you know you can go back to the whole you know the the Kennedy thing in his father being you know keeping the conspiracy theory going about him being part of the Kennedy assassination you know the whole line Ted did you hear now he's called he called him a beautiful dead yeah\nIt's a beautifully that look this happens in politics all the time maybe to not that the degree of insults or accusations of conspiracy theories but the fact is\nA you know Kevin up a little cabin also part of it you cannot take out the fear now that Republicans have by seeing the realization of what they believed the mainstream of the Democratic Democratic Party has become\nAnd and that is the party that does not believe in the constitution they don't believe in due process they don't believe in in uh uh the presumption of innocence if it's not their person\nWe've seen everything that has gone out and we see the suspicion that Republicans have when they see what's going to come out of this whole FBI investigation what was the FBI doing what was the department of justice doing you'd you'd think about all that and the differences between\nOr the the anger between the crews and Trump ... uh uh you know parties factions are gone yeah I mean it's United what you saw what you saw yesterday in Houston\nWas a huge symbolic uniting it was almost\nIt was almost that was the celebration of the that's that's how I took that was the almost\nThe celebration of the ... of of the Republican Party from everything that went on from Kavanaugh yeah even though it is an all it's it's it's more than just that but to me that was the symbol that it showed a lot of people that look okay we're all\nRepublicans most of us are conservatives yeah we even if we're moderate and moderate conservatives we can't have that party in power because they'd been blunt\nWhat they believe in and we and we do believe I I Believe this is part of their statement we do believe that if they don't believe in the constitution if they don't believe in due process if they don't believe in the first amendment if they don't believe in the second amendment people are being blood and saying well then what makes you American\nYeah and I know sounds probably harsh just some people but if you don't believe in you and I've talked about this for the longest time if you don't believe in the constitution if you don't believe in those basic tenants than what you actually believe in well and and\nWhat kind of country do you really want right what is it that you want a your country to be you know you look at the the never Trump has the conservatives and I think the Kavanaugh effect was was a you know something that was\nI opening for a lot of them who realized okay a couple of times\nOr this president has shown a his efforts in terms of the highest court you and I by the way can can officially called this the Breitbart Andrew Breitbart effect\nYes because and twenty twelve just weeks before he died a we asked him as as we were talking to them why should we support or a moderate like Mitt Romney it was inevitable Mitt Romney was going to become the nominee a appeared he would even early that year\nOr why should we do that and his answer was guys I'm a stone's throw as I sit here and talk to you from ... it's all about SCOTUS\nSo they're ... it's it's different you can have a conservatives say well never Trump and maybe maybe I you know\nThink about it and twenty twenty in terms of uh you know we'll look and see what what happens in twenty twenty ride I didn't vote for him and twenty sixteen I stayed home or whatever\nBut in terms of the mid term\nWhile yes they're supporting Trump there were there a couple of things at least Trump will do this on ... so I've got to get out I've got to vote I've got to be motivated to get out there and allow him to be able to possibly seat another constructions\nBut it's exactly what you said to it is\nThey're they're you were going to have to build that Republican wall around the constitution and around the process that is in place that preserves the constitution\nAnd and I think that's really a strong it at us a strong addition to uh the Trump momentum ... to have conservatives who are idiot logically driven who do know the constitution and do know", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "city": "San Antonio", "day": "23"}
