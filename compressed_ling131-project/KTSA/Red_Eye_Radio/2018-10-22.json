completely yeah and what he was talking about on the campaign compared to what he was but he actually got and promoted look good at what he got was completely different\nThan when he was running for his campaign as we've said if his most loyal if the always Trump voters want to support it and go with that we're fine with that because all we care about is the actual substance what did you actually get and does it promote more free trade to promote\nA more more good things but the ultimate thing that he promoted what's actually negative it raises the cost of cars in the United states Canada and Mexico and that's a bad thing mhm and now\nI think the average person who understands economics who was caught up in the political I dollar tree will admit that's a bad part of the deal the always Trump or just ignore big nor does if it doesn't exist were not just going to go there he got the deal he said he was going to redo NAFTA he\nDid NAFTA but what was it NAFTA I don't care don't want to know and that's fine that's part of a demographic that's going to vote for every president that I'm sure but that's not the only demographic that voted for Trump we broke it down to eight different demographics\nAbout six months after the election\nAnd there's a ton of people that in that age demographics is more now more United\nAnd you can even add an nine than there which are the never Trump ... which have now come aboard mhm so Trump for all of the good and the bad has United with the help of Kavanaugh and the help of the Democrats and then speaking bluntly about what they want this\nCountry to become\nA have United around Trump and they do look at Trump he is that I think your head that isn't\nThem right then and I think\nYou look at the end and you said this earlier if you want to look at the ... the the real rockstar look at the terms in terms of performance in terms of getting things about Trump over they come on I'm close because\nThe one thing that that is going to always resonate with American people is a good economy\nIt's going to be a man I'm doing okay everybody in my family seems to be doing okay a job status doing OK and or getting better\nYou look at the unemployment numbers in and these kittens were the liberal media can't argue any of those points anymore they can't break it down because you you just simply can't those numbers now they can be manipulated\nBut in breaking them down in terms of the performance as as long as we've used the same standard standard\nWith the same standard of approach basically on those numbers\nYou cannot have a debate about the unemployment or the GDP or anything else because the last president was judged by the same exact standards all of this basically wraps up into one thing\nWhat is it that the other side wants to do and is that a threat to this\nExisting ... you know economy right now in other words a you know I'm really I'm I Am doing a little bit better you know my job is doing better or making a little more whatever it might be I'm I'm checking home a little more taxes are lower [noise]\nNot only that but I remember you know we said this and I don't know if anybody's ever used the exact same words that we used and I think we used to probably [noise] ah I think this was early in the primaries and we continue to say it all the way through the election\nAnd we and and the media has completely missed is totally ... but it's not just that ... the analysis that I was telling you that I read yesterday the Trump is the average ... average person the average person looks at them as the average person what does that entail the average person if you cause that to me doesn't describe\nThe the the substance at just that's labeling people I use an average person therefore he likes Trump's\nBecause Trump relates to the average person because they believe he's like the average person what does that mean\nAnd you and I actually use the L Word back way back in the in in the campaign I Believe that and and I believe this too but I Believe the Trump loves America mhm\nAnd I believe he loves Americans and he loves Americans first\nUm\nBut he loves Americans and I think the people that support him I think part of the political I dollar tree which is different than Obama's political I dollar tree\nRight is it they look at him and they say here's a guy that truly loves America and he loves me he cares about me yeah he's rude and yeah he's crude but when it gets down to with a lot\nI'm from the anger that we believe that he shares with us that these other people don't love America ... and we love America and how do we love it and now the left ... meters would get insulted we love America no you don't you don't believe in due process\nYeah both Cuomo America's never been great right but ... exactly mhm that you you really you really don't you don't really believe in the first amendment you don't really believe in the second amendment you don't know believe in due process you don't believe in a presumption of innocence what do you really love about America you and I had brought this up for over ten years when we've gone\nThrough certain issues and said what if you don't care about this and you don't care about the constitution 'cause what makes us Americans do we live in the same geographical place oh no\nIt's we share an idea and what is that idea we've got the ideas the constitution and the United state us and when you have a group of people are political party were checked that\nThis is a bubble thought\n'cause that's what the Democrats will try or just a bunch of Baba is out there so Trump Globes America we love America or\nWhat I mean I Love America to actually if you don't believe in the constitution you don't love America\nYou may love the concept of what you as a group all think America should be but you don't love America the way that it exists under the current constitution and the rules and regulations that we have you and I talked about it when you talked about\nThe fact now that they're talking about well the president needs to remember the president's seat is no longer effective or that needs to go yeah the the the electoral college needs to go to the Senate needs to go and what they don't understand what those are key words that you don't believe in individual liberty\nBecause we are not a direct democracy we are a constitutional republic\nAnd the reason we are is to protect the rights of the minority yes to protect the individual rights and the rights of the minority exactly what they claim that they believe the Democrats claim that they they think about so we look at all that and that's all part of loving America so\nWhen you hear when I say that I've always got responds oh that is above the thing that he loves American we don't know based on\nThe actual specifics of what the Democratic Party is promoting ... we're all in for which is anti constitutional mindset and an anti constitution oh yeah and we can make that point and you and I said for the longest time\nBut it's still left that doesn't believe in the first amendment oh for them yeah mhm but for others they don't and we have broken that down before they don't believe in the second amendment and now they don't believe in due process under the law when it's inconvenient for them there was not a presumption of innocence\nThat mindset is wrong and we've talked about that you know the support of the judges when the judge has become activists judges\nAnd how that is an American and unconstitutional and how they promote that mhm\nAnd so the average person I think she's at and Trump is anything they look at Trump and I look at Trump and you look at Trump is anything but an authoritarian and a fascist even at times though his words we like ... you don't say that\nYeah I when you look at what he actually doesn't what he promotes in the long run it's all constitutional\nYes it's all part of the process that was put in place hundreds of years ago I mean it it's but this is this is what\nWe have to this is what it has to come down to if we're not going to win the Senate we need to get rid of it that we're not going to win\nThe electoral college vote than to get rid of him and get rid of it we need to get rid of the constitution wanted Dustin when it does or on me when we don't win the White House we need to get rid of the presidency that's anti American\nThat\nNo it's not well what America for ... it's not America we don't like it when all of the constitution if we don't have the form of government that we have that it's no longer America\nWhat do you believe in besides the Fifth Amendment [laughter] besides exactly [laughter] eight six six Ninety read I\nRead I read a record

was trying to get you guys' opinion on it only has been like completely different ... in this narrow it Kevin on that so just came up to my attention\nOkay and then let's say it was completely disarm so\nWhat group of conservatives or Republicans would be like ... like ... where I Am Jewish thing or shove it like\nI didn't have any ... who who are going to go on our side will be games all ... states orderly\nThat nobody knows ... you're if you're talking about\nThe behavior of the the uh the uh interrupted disruptive kind of and we're getting some interference when your costs will let you go um if you're talking about the disruptive type of behavior or the after the the committee vote\nOn Kavanaugh the Kamala Harris and and uh and others walking out that kind of behavior who on the right would do that\nI don't know of anybody that would do that our point was that it would have been a different scenario based on the media treatment of\nA set individual had everything but that's really more about the media treat 'em and what we do and we did go back in and talked about the working down of the um\nUh you know what how they have active or behaved as the judge during the confirmation process for sort of my or or for Linda Kagan\nAnd what they might do in a in a certain scenario but that was based on their behavior as a judge you still had\nRepublicans vote for them we used to hide and that was their treatment of them was based on again how they would behave as a judge that was part of a what Lindsey Graham is saying\nYou know he voted for Alina Kagan and sort of my work and so what the behavior be you know\nI'm a uh\nA ... well a Lindsey Graham getting up and walking out likely not no because I think what you saw and Lindsey Graham and\nUh his uh emotional or the you know statement that day during that hearing when Kavanaugh was there was based on the ... the behavior of those on the left and how they were treating this\nAnd essentially a shredding the process and and I think that's what that's what that was if it had you know\nA liberal president and it was a a liberal justice or liberal judge a that had been appointed and during this process there was a conservative leaning or a you know a woman who accused him of doing something with the behavior be different by the media would have been treated the same\nLikely not no but it was kind of a you know with all due respect to well the answer I think we all know that any critical thinkers ... I don't expect they\nLindsey Graham or or another conservative on the committee or or Republican on the committed to get up and do what ... you know after the committee vote get up and storm out\nThat wasn't the point\nYou know but I'll Wait wait a minute and again you can't make the case he was trying to make the case that it was the same and I'm like no it was unprecedented what happened right are you even look at Justice Thomas you know that goes back you know twenty five\nOr ... that goes back twenty five years ago and and uh you know he those hearings were held and then but then but then he was he was you know confirmed and I believe some Democrats even cross the line and voted for him yes they did I Believe that yes they did well I Believe that was a Democrat said at the time\n...\nYeah uh so yeah so you know they they ... but this was unprecedented nothing nothing we've ever seen a ... in our lifetime or in modern times has has been like this so to even question that\nTo me uh shows ignorance and that doesn't mean stupidity it means a lack of knowledge ah on on history and that's why we brought up he said that didn't happen with sort of money earned that didn't happen with Kagan there were people that disagree with that because we we believe\nThat sort of my or and Kagan many times not all the time\nOn the with\nThe cell tower right to cell tower case of the cell tower that they agreed with ... they you know that ah they use the in their writings they used um\nPrior judgment or by opinion written by ... majority opinion written by Scalia\nIs ... exactly that was the stress in the right to use but in many of their many of their answers and many of their\nTheir decisions we believe they legislate\nWhich is not their role which is why we were against their nomination but it was based on judiciously what they would do not by what we want each and every day mhm mhm well what the job of the\nJudges and that's the difference and that's something that we brought up with the whole Kavanaugh hearings that we said look ... you know conservatism Republicans stop had to stop arguing\nThe same premise that Democrats are arguing right Republicans keep arguing most conservative versus a liberal justice no it's not ... I'm not voting for a conservative judge\nI'm voting for a construction is an originalist I'm voting for a judge irrespective of what they wish the government to be each and every day understand\nThat their role is not to make law either left or right\nThere their job under the constitution is to interpret what the law says\nYou know it's interesting too is that as we got to the uh the the closer to the the\nUltimate vote on on a cabin on you know I made the point that even the liberal justices\nRespect the process in my opinion based on experience and I think one thing you can look at one judgment you can look at from ... was recess appointments which was ...\nYeah against Obama against Obama yeah because if you look at that that really was something that was very clear on what the process yes and so\nRespecting not only in the process of how you know the confirmation process of of of how that's done but also again the process at the highest court I Do believe and\nYou know you can say what you will about the opinions written by a Ginsburg or or whether they're dissenting or majority opinion you can we can tear us apart and say well they're wrong about this or the wrong about that or we disagree with this or that\nThe vast majority of the issues that they disagree with Trump on\nHis his tone yes which is it\nSimilar to what they are a lot of the left criticizes him for his words in his town\nAnd it's not so much the job that he's done\nYou know they may pick apart you know whatever it is the tariff babies [laughter] by the way we are the original ... babies um but but but they may pick a\nPart these things or this or that but\nUltimately if you got down and you were to ask the never Trump or is a conservative never truckers\nUh well okay the corporate tax rate Twenty one percent did you think that was going to happen or do you applaud that do agree with that um the unemployment rate the GDP where we are right now uh do you think we're moving in a good direction and the president's done a good job on a number of items\nI don't know how you would do that even as a never trying\nAnd I I Believe the president should fight more when it comes to the debt he's taking little victories us I'm cutting the federal government this much but it's doing nothing to solve the budget problem was he ... he throws those he throws that out but\nThe fact is he knows he's not the legislative branch and yes he knows he the one power ... this isn't this isn't the precedent alone that has you know created this deficit spending\nThese other Republicans in Congress including a significant portion of conservative or formerly conservative [laughter] ... who wants to identify right conservative Republican congressional members that are also wanting to spend my eight eight a ton of money well\nWell how did they get tax is done Roy Moore last\nYeah and they realized oh my gosh we got to get things done because we may lose the Senate at some point we've got this slim\nYou know victory here are slim margin now and it they didn't have the Republicans in the Senate didn't get it done until after that lost the president had been working toward that but again this answer tight if they're not going to do anything right\nI think the president should still work harder and still talk about it more which he does not ... you probably and and I I'm thinking that probably the White House says look we can't win this because our own party doesn't care any more about the\n... well you know which is what's really disappointing I guess the downside of this capital of the thing or what have may have motivated a lot of people or whether it's the never Trump or his or or the the moderate Republicans a who now are standing up for conservative principles again\nIt could be too little too late not not in the Senate but in the house\nAnd the president and the Republicans it just imagine that that the Republicans maintain power in the house and the Senate the motivation to get things let's now work on getting things done right that's\nVery real but it can happen if the house isn't fair\nIf you lose the house [noise] it's going to be limited in what you can

court something when you know to be something else\nI don't know the details of why the Justice Department lawyers did not know false affidavits were being filed with me but I was very relieved that I did not accept them and that I allowed limited discovery into what had happened during a tense exchange with Justice Department lawyer Robert Prince\nLambert pressed issue accusing prince\nAbusing

living in a regional [noise] radio\n[noise] all\nAcross America a six six Ninety red eye he is aren't currently non Gary McNamara\nThanks so much for being here this morning or early voting starts so for us here today in Texas I don't know when it starts across the nation for other ah states but just Fifteen days away from election day in so much talk about us we've been doing throughout the morning back you we go let's talk to Mike in Washington state Mike Hi you're on the radio I might\nThank you this whole meal or the thing is just like it's just so frustrating for the voters because it drags on and on he's coming up with nothing it's false accusations and it's I think we're going to win the house because of it because people are sick and tired of it\n... it's interesting because there there was a report that was out last week my dad said a ... mall or a to issue his the core of his report after the midterm and I'm Wondering why after the midterm\nAnd and what's going on why is the media\nThey just a band in this story and I mean they've banned in this story completely there's really nothing going on like what you saw up until a I don't know what a couple of months ago maybe\nAnd then when the house I well I I don't know that we will but it's interesting Mike\nThere what I don't believe was is this uh like the FiveThirtyEight thing saying that you know they an eighty five percent chance that the Democrats will take the house\nBecause you have to get into all the different polls and all these districts and I mean there's a ton of them but then we can break it down much easier into those thirty one tossup seats right that that right now according to our she'd be there are thirty one tossup seats\nThere are things like a Texas thirty two\nUh Pete Sessions and his Democratic challenger is someone who was in the last poll which was twenty eight days ago\nToday a was within a point now we\nKnow because we live here in in this area we know that that district is a north of Dallas County uh and so there has been a ... a demographic shift that's been going on that shift has been happening really over the last uh probably\nA three to five years but really over the last few years especially because so much growth in this area brings individuals and for jobs right so there's a the the demographics change so that could be an accurate ... we don't know my question is why are we seeing those big posters in these\nA toss up districts and why we're seeing these new polls come out especially a couple of weeks out because if you're looking at the house you would think that there was some interest there by the media in order to hire these pollsters these major pollsters are to do a more in depth polls we maybe we'll see some starting this morning\nAnd into next week a and over the next couple of weeks as election day is one week from tomorrow but my question is\nReally not if five thirty eight or any of them are wrong because um who was it that\nHad the basically the the it was like a fifty fifty on the houses that NPR a couple of weeks ago they said it was you know yeah yeah so and and it came out to eat yesterday that in\nWhat is it likely of voters or the Republicans are moving closer right okay that that came out just yesterday I think I have writers somewhere yeah\nThe the the story here but it's so much tougher to tell on those house seats I just I I Wonder that if we're going to gain in the in the in the Senate mhm and so that's you know that's looking at populations across the state and right here\nOr that\nYou know I just wonder how they extrapolated out to so many of these races where if they're using the public polls out there there are so few of them\nSo few and far between how they use those ... if you're going to the internal polling polling which I'm sure as being done by the campaigns right and you you would have the better you know a better guess at that right yeah it it gets here it is a a a Dems mid term advantage narrows\nAmong registered voters yeah my new national poll a few weeks before the midterm election shows the chances of a blue wave are far from a slam dunk for the Democrats the NBC Wall Street Journal poll released a Sunday shows forty eight percent of registered voters\nWould prefer having Democrats in control of Congress compared to forty one percent supporting the GOP these seven point gap is narrowing from a ... point gap that Democrats headed September I don't know if that tells you anything though\nWell and and again I mean registered voters ... we gotta talk route likely voters and then again what the motivation is on election day this we've been talking about this\nIt has changed since the Kavanaugh confirmations leading up to and since I don't know to what extent I Can't tell you what motivated the left or the right more we do know\nThere's no doubt the right is motivated Republicans are motivated right now are they more motivated than Democrats I Can't tell you that\nNow I I watch it on the Mike called before we started talking about you know the the whole Russian collusion at the top of the hour and I say that because my was not driven to call\nBased on what we had said and therefore he you know became passionate about giving his point of view across my called with that passion\nAbout the Russian collusion investigation and his anger and his feeling that this could possibly changed the election you know and and move it to the Republicans before we ever started talking about I think that's important because I don't find many people like Mike ... I don't think honestly\nNow we've covered everything when it comes to the whole Russian collusion from day one that we've asked\nEvery question known to man kind of we do think that we have looked at more\nOr as investigators in partisans\nAnd we believe that hey that with everything going on and with the Pfizer warranted and and everything there that we are going to find out\nThat probably the Democrats were up to a lot more hijackings than the Republicans ever dreamed of actually doing it as we know already the only evidence\nOf clothing with the Russians in any way directly or indirectly\nWould be the DNC and the Hillary campaign to\nGive me the money to uh Perkins gave it to a fusion GPS gave it to the former spy Christopher Steele who said he got his information his salacious on verified information\nOr against Donald Trump from people close to the Kremlin right so the only people that colluded in any way with the Russians were the Democrats from the information that we have\nAt this particular point but I don't think right now that's driving anybody to go to the polls\nNo it really isn't um\nIt it could it is it an underlying factor as a part of the larger I guess scenario with Republicans or conservatives are based on following you know the work of of many really great reporters who who really brought to light so many things in this thing if you really followed it but", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "city": "San Antonio", "day": "22"}
