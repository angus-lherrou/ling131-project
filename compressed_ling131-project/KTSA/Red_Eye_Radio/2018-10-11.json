six six Ninety run I let's get an update on now\nTropical storm Michael as we turn to meteorologist Tom hale good morning John good morning All right so where are we with a with Michael and uh what is the the storm in terms of the power of this storm still look like\nWell the power of the storm is still there at about five thousand feet we've got wins that are blowing at about eighty miles an hour or they have diminished all that much and with thunderstorms those thunderstorm wins the downdraft translate some of that wind so we have higher gas and so for that reason alone\nAt wind is still an issue especially when it gets across into North Carolina because uh we talked about this for four days in advance as Florence was coming in\nThat they had already had some saturation from a remnant a of a tropical storm\nThat pushed its way on through and and of course when obviously\nFlorence came through a villa low lying areas that are run up through a\nFayetteville and a south of Raleigh that entire area is still very saturated John trout touched on it and he said trees are sitting in mud and that's exactly what it is we had ... that's the event that we had in the Carolinas\nWith the very slow moving Florence and as this storm moves up through there I think there'll be a lot more ... and also there's going to be\nObviously a good deal more flooding now yes they're likely to get about two inches of rain in that area but it doesn't take much for a little bit of flooding to a\nReef re and develop and it's west of there where the heavy flooding is actually going to be taking place up toward Raleigh and then back up a\nA up into Virginia a Lynchburg, Virginia Roanoke, Virginia everything on the eastern side of the mountains there\nUh up to Charlotte and nor folk that entire area I'm gonna see anywhere from a\nThree to as much as eight inches of rain as it gets further on up um and there's a you know why not to include here are the folks over Allen the outer banks from okra coke island\nJust down towards the south end up to duck or they're under a storm surge watch in effect\n... and and\nHow I I guess what is the potential there in terms of that storm surge uh and and what the the height might be\nA four feet okay to demography yeah uh you know it'll inundate some neighborhoods some some areas where it'll come out of the banks um but um it's when you think about it it it just goes to the power of this now tropical storm\nAnd its Winfield yeah right yeah and ... ... that's\nJust amazing I mean if you look at the the power of Michael has came ashore a a Wednesday afternoon and something that we touched on yesterday during our program and that is the the because of that power because of that energy behind this storm and it grew after of course\nUh we got off the air uh the it intensified that that means it's a longer lasting a storm so you're expecting Michael to still be a tropical storm a strength in terms of uh the when it goes back out over the water\nAnd reaches Ireland yeah yeah why why so [laughter] yeah\nWell ah to our friends in Europe or you know um you can have whereas we hope you does does that does that are on the water is warming up that far north in the Atlantic to keep it going then\nYes no guy yeah wow I did\nI just assume by the time we got to ... probably be cool down so I'm surprised to hear that but the outer still warming up yeah\nHell and and and that's why we're having these storms and the you know the the normal hurricane season ends at the beginning of November right and so at this point there's a reason to that extent this is the fourth\nA major hurricane that we've had in the month of October period and so yeah that's and that's simply a and it was unusual to have a major hurricane to begin with in October\nWhen you consider that there's been four of them total and and so and the last nine something that just sticks in my mind was and I can't remember which one of you said\nWell is it gonna kind of lose some power as it comes into shore and and I and my immediate reaction was no no [laughter] yeah yeah right\nYeah and you were right 'cause I I'd asked that question which brings into another question that is just a just personal interest to me\nAnd and that is when you get it from ... you know turn ... tornadoes hurricanes get their energy from the warm water right yes All right so do does that mean\nThat a hurricane like this does it then does it as a result that it's taking the energy from the water just the water actually cool down\nA yeah actually it does because what it does is causes up willing or which by the way is a very bad thing if you like oysters\nAnd [laughter] just letting you know [laughter] not a\nGood or Easter season\nRight I'd hate or the came in and Nineteen eighty five was the last storm that hit this area of Florida and and and Cape came in\nHold onto your hat at Mexico beach wow the same place wow and for that entire year and I and I'm not sure it might have been longer than that it devastated the oyster crop\nOf the Appalachian bay um you know ... right area while\nWhile in turn of the life of Michael you know from the time that it was officially a tropical storm too you know looking at the forecast as you mentioned a back out over water in the Atlantic or is this going to be one of the longest living storms in terms of the the life this band the time that Michael is active\nUm no I don't think so you've you've stumped me on that one because we've got some that don't even make it here but for some reason they just spin around in the mid Atlantic right we're in the western Atlantic and so I've never I've never looked into that yeah\nYeah um it it just seems that a ... and you mentioned this earlier talking about you know we always\nOften we'll talk about a storm the remnants of the remnants of and as you mentioned we this we're not going to get to that point in terms of it being over land here we're not going to talk about the remnants of Michael it will be still tropical storm Michael overland\nYes it is to Charlotte to Raleigh and Norfolk\nYeah and that's where I Am concerned about a lot when it goes you know for that whole area up there the Hampton Roads area that area just floods [noise] yeah\nAnd and so I mean we didn't talk a lot about it a lot with Florence but it was flooding in Florence it was nothing compared to the flooding that was going on\nStevens roofing it's Seventy five zero nine nine for checking about online at Stevens roofing dot net that phone number again Seventy five zero nine

I Wonder if there's pressure inside Congress again this is pure speculation\nBut inside St look if you're going to do after we got to get the steel and aluminum done we're not going to do and we're gonna do it let's get everything done and that's putting pressure on the on on the White House or the fact is yeah you know having now is going to\nAt least stabilize the market with some good and bad as we have gone through and we have gone through a a nap to because we do believe\nThat if if the new NAFTA passes\n[laughter] it'd be trade agreement formerly known as NAFTA if it passes it's going to hurt the auto industry it's not going to help the auto industry is going to make cars more expensive that's not a good thing now initially when you say it it's something that may not hit the market at that particular point\nYou know at at but when you take everything together the worries about regulation in the tech sector or all of a sudden the the you know the the fed or raising rates are the fact that the bond yields are going up again it's taken us taking us more interest money\nOr to to service the the the the debt and the possibility of the trade war with China where there there isn't doesn't seem to be any type of conclusion and still a great uncertainty about\nA steel and aluminum tariffs and still and uncertainty whether you know Congress really hasn't there's been no indication from Congress or the leadership in Congress about the trade agreement formerly known as NAFTA ...\nWell you mentioned now or the the terrorists and the PG taking a ten percent hit yesterday\nA and you this is a very old company but talking about raw materials and the cost of raw materials and and so as you know there\nAre essentially they're manufacture a and and distributor of of uh of of coding and special materials specialty materials but that is also part of the auto industry\nSo the the the car sales ah the automobile sales have or seemed to have stalled out for now or what's behind that are certainly you know that the cost of automobiles is going up and that is directly related to terrorists then\nThere's a greater demand for used cars at when there's a greater demand for any group in terms of\nProducts that cost goes up so it it is it's a number of things that hit start to hit all at once and you go back to All right well how much of this is controlled by either the fed or the federal government\nAnd how much of this this cost of government and right now you could look at terrorists and I think you could look well that interest rates have ran and you see those two right now sticking out but everything that we just said here is related to what government regulation\nEverything that we just and I didn't even think about that until you just said it\nThere and I'm like wow everything is government regulation is so you can actually make the argument that her it irrespective whether it's trade agreement government regulation the fed rate you know ah on on interest rates are the the debt that with the debt that we haven't servicing our our debt all of it goes back to\n[laughter] in in some way a\nGovernment or regulation and when we talk about the tech industry and what are they worried about government regulation so it all gets back to that we said this before and you look when we you know we've gotten into great debates and\nDisagreements with the administration about ah you know their their policy on tariffs therefore or new labeled turf babies\nOr the president came up with a but the look the in the real world you raise prices it hurts when the economy and the story right\nYou can sit there and go rah rah rah usa usa you can have all the chance you want but if you raise the cost of goods and services it always hurts an economy and hurts workers and just because you wish to chant or you know just say America First\nBut at the point is being made that the the feds don't need to raise rates right now well you are admitting you're saying that our policy is also affecting you have to admit that any policy by any governing entity\nIs is affecting negatively right terrorists or whatever it might be right ... ... ... regulation\nAnd taxes because that's what a tariff it doesn't matter whether you call it a terror for an income tax whatever if your tax if you're raising the cost of doing business is always going to her\nWell and and that will see in the coming days where where the market rebound so if they believe this has long lived if they if they're going to be long lived if if they believe that the administration is going to do an about face on terrorists and and the tears even in the situation with China\nBecause it's it's affecting negatively way too many producers here in the U.

storm as a now we turn to a meteorologist Tom hale who joined us good morning Tom\nGood morning don't let that fool you right yeah because uh you you you look at the footprint of of a tropical\nStorm Michael now a which has been wreaking havoc on on a Georgia and headed for the Carolinas\nAnd it's it's the satellite photos or just a amazing or just ... and and this this storm again still has plenty of energy or what are we looking at a I Know we're a scheduled to get an update or within twenty five minutes or so\nBut yeah the last update has it at sustained winds right now at roughly sixty miles an hour I'm guessing we can expect in the next report that to decrease\nI Would think so it should drop to probably fifty if that um it may still maintain itself but I think a ten mile an hour drop is reasonable although it at looking at it in radar and just kind of clocking it died I I don't think it'll drive more than ten miles\nIt might pick up a mile and forward speed gone to the northeast it may be Twenty one miles an hour\nAnd I'd earlier predicted it would exit the United states at about twenty three to twenty five miles an hour [noise]\nAh but that's not going to be until it gets up into Virginia before it exits outta here yeah um yeah it's a um it it it's an incredible storm it let me give you a little kind of a broad overview\nOkay along the coast and the outer banks they're gonna see storm surge from the storm in the Carolinas of two to four feet that's water inundation rice and then you can at high tide waves which could cause some problems\nIt's not the biggest one there then we'll be another one or not the biggest one it will be feeder band soon we'll be talking about the potential for tornadoes now these tornadoes and the feeder bans the feeder bans are coming in from the east and moving off to the west so that kind of curbing from southeastern northwest\nAnd the bans have individual storms at 'em and they're moving out to about forty miles an hour now those individual storms are capable of breeds spin offs tornadoes in the individual little super Sal soon as we get into the afternoon those storms will be heating up\nIn the afternoon maximum heat\nAnd that's going to happen primarily over the Carol North Carolina's where you're going to see that the greatest potential for tornado activity but it's a wind\nAnd so whether it's torn an addict wind or it's a sustained tropical force winds to forty to forty five miles an hour\nIt's going to do damage and a lot of that damage is going to be treated damage and it's got to be in North Carolina because what's going on in North Carolina\nOr what has gone on as Florence and so it's saturated soils and so these trees that we've noticed that most of them because of the wind have been toppled over we've seen a lot of root ball photos right on on\nTelevision mhm so\nBoom overcome the trees now what are the trees hit\nThe power lines\nBingo so we got the trees hitting power lines and we currently have seven hundred and thirty five thousand customers now that's they count customers is homes right\nOkay multiply that by two assuming there's only two people affected by every home and we know that number is low and and here it already one and a half million people already without power and that number is going to grow as it gets into the Carolinas and I think\nThe next big numbers for power outages are going to be in the Carolinas during Florence between the Carolinas that over seven hundred and fifty thousand power outages and I think this is capable of of if not repeating it at least bringing in another four to five hundred thousand\nCustomers yeah and so we're going to get a will get over the two million mark on on people affected without any kind of power\nAnd then you have the question they were staging people for power in Pensacola and just draw a circle around from Pensacola around this whole area\nA thousands of power of of trucks utility trucks right and they're going to go into the areas they can get into for so maybe the Carolinas and Georgia and so forth are going to have a better shot at getting power even though they did stage I Believe the number was up to Nineteen hundred power trucks\nUh around the uh Pensacola area and around the panhandle and so you know they're going to be working as hard as I possibly can but just the physical flooding an inundation and the damage and the debris is going to limit the time that it's going to take for them to get their power back so I still believe that\nThe landfall area the pan handle the took the greatest brunt is going to have the longest period of time to restore power I mean [noise]\nFace it there's a lot of places they don't have to restore power to any more but they still have to be able to address the power lines that went there\nSure yeah the infrastructure itself has to be restored and and as you mentioned\nYou may not be a a customer are there any longer unfortunately but\nStill is a a a a an infrastructure because down that line of course there are other customers that that has to have to be a half to get that power and have it to restore the the if you look at uh the uh the impact there as it came ashore\nA hurricane Michael again one for the record books you and I ... I was asking you the question kind of put you on the spot\nLast last hour but you you actually answered it on the spot very well and and were corrected generally speaking talking about the longest lasting\nA hurricane and and I found a little data their weather dot com about ah this would be a hurricane John back in Nineteen Ninety four which had a a thirty day run a this thing traveled nearly eighty two hundred miles and all out in the Pacific\nEffect of Hawaii but then kept going and but ah roughly a thirty day run but I mean if you look at and you mentioned this earlier and it it is something to remind folks that are still in the path of Michael that\nTypically and very often we see a that a storm or or hurricane starts to fall apart over land and then we we hear words like the remnants of but they're on them remnants and again this is a well formed tropical storm a that is traveling uh right now headed for the Carolinas and wreaking havoc\nOn on Georgia and uh and then we'll go back out over the ocean ah we also\nWant to go or you name it extra tropical once it goes out over the ocean ... okay and and write\nIs it's it's no longer in the it's a no longer a tropical storm in the tropical zones or so forth and it's going to lose power to forty miles an hour and then it'll regained power and that regained powers considered extra tropical but it's ... you're right in in nailing it here [noise]\nThe it it may not be the thirty day storm that meanders out there and because it's making good time but it's definitely covering a lot of terrain", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "city": "San Antonio", "day": "11"}
