Ninety miles per hour moment north northwest at twelve miles per hour still expected to hit\nA the pan handle a coast of uh of Florida right now as a a hurricane strength or three over a hundred and ten mile an hour wins a and probably some time uh eight nine ten am tomorrow morning as what\nThey're talking about yeah Wednesday morning yeah so uh it's a there are a number of things here ah that we're following of course the the the locals and the officials are they're all all along uh the Big Bend area of the Florida a Gulf Coast\nA and what's going on plenty of uh of information are pouring out of that area\nBut also by the updates from the national Hurricane Center another update on the way in less than twenty five minutes and we'll bring you the latest as we get it at our meteorologist or John trout is on that\nStory of course and we'll be following the storm or in the coming days so I'm again or advice please heed the warnings of follow the advice and instructions by\nLocal authorities in state authorities there in Florida as this is a very dangerous storm life threatening in terms of ah all elements of the storm storm surge flooding from range and wins a all combined you expecting over twelve inches in those areas where the\nWhere the hurricane when it moves overland right yeah yes and and and and then later in the week bringing\nA ... some rain that they don't need to areas that are still recovering from\nFrom Florence because the ground as John pointed out earlier John trout are pointed out earlier that it is already saturated there in those areas that were affected by Florence and any rain or is just going to create problems so ah not just over the next ah twenty four to thirty six hours but of course\nAs Michael moose and one more a flooding and other threats along a that a storm path\nOr will certainly be something that people need to pay attention to\nA head of Michael's Atlantic ah\nYou know you and I talked about yesterday which was like wow a after this you know after the last really over two weeks of the judge a cabin on the the hearings and\nAnd the ... the confirmation and everything that has gone out in the ... all the different uh allegations\nOf a sudden we got to Monday yesterday and I woke up and it was there is nothing it was almost like a big exhale where it's like okay and where do we go next we need a day to figure out where the news goes because it wasn't really a big news day right of uh yesterday and it's when I came to the\nThought where I said what's the issue for Democrats with everything that I've discussed over the last two years I actually woke up yesterday thinking what are the Democrats have right what are they gonna you besides impeachment\nYou know what is ... you know what is the issue I think about this era we went through and and even just just before we got to the cabinet nomination it was still know Mahler investigation Trump pollution you and I I I can remember ah\nThe ah the was it the the the Thursday or the ... the Thursday or the friday when when Chuck Todd said you'd better not miss work tomorrow that had to be like what was\nThat ... right around Labor Day that was the friday had to buy into Labor Day when and and that was because you know Mueller's going to let the investigation nobody's even talking about Russian collusion now it's done on anybody's radar it seems like that was\nTen years ago and that's how fast the the cycle has has moved you know what is on people's minds and so when I woke up yesterday I started thinking what are Democrats thinking the issue is what's the issue that they can go after Trump out what's the issue that will even grab\nDemocrats right now to say oh yeah okay that's the issue\nYou and I talked about the fact that the un coming out and saying OK it's time for\nOur annual we're doomed to update because of global warming\nAnd we're thinking of the Democrat's gonna jump on that they've been jumping on that since the beginning of the Obama administration that and raised on a consistent basis\nAnd so I was looking at you earlier and saying I'm waiting for the race baiting to start some time by the end of the week because it's been their old standby says what they've always use now even though at the same time the American people have said they don't care yeah we don't believe those are the top issues we don't believe race relations\nOr the top issue we believe we get along with each other really well are you folks in Washington may not and you people that belong to a certain groups or or you know or may not but for the most part we get along and global warming well you haven't made your case\nVast majority of America let me go get a burger ... I ... I mean seriously that's words that but you know and we ... we actually stay to during the Obama administration I'll never forget where we said are they doing this on purpose do they actually think that\nWe don't talk about the issues of the day if we don't talk about the economy 'cause remember the economy never had three percent growth the entire time with the Obama administration and you and I would talk about this all the time saying there seems to be no interest in talking about making the economy better no it wasn't even as a story that was being discussed\nAnd and they just went back to global warming and and race\nSo I really find it interesting as to as we are now just a little under a month from uh from election time that you watch what's the Democrats issue what do they actually going to use besides impeachment if they think that's going to work which brings me to this article Wall Street journal Bobby Jindal\nFormer a former governor of of\nAh Louisiana ... two thousand two thousand sixty Democrats try some self restraint and I I like Bobby Jindal but this may be a little bit delusional\n[laughter] with a straight [laughter] F a it's\nNot certain the Democrats just want to read parts of it because I actually started laughing during it\nOr it's not certain but that's okay he's trying to be an optimist mhm I'm being a complete and total sitting here at this moment but I think justifiable I can justify it it's not certain the Democrats will retake the house but if they do they will likely ignore\nTheir leaders preferences and pushed to impeach President Trump or perhaps justice cabin up\nIn a swap with Clinton their opposition's Democrats now lecture the nation that unseemly personal behavior makes the president unfit for office while Republicans and says his private morality has no impact on those his public duties\nThis is more a than a interesting irony impeachment would undoubtedly energize Mr Trump's base\nFalls Stevens

one is listening to any more the the protesters over because the protesters see it as not being effective and the rest of America sees that as well moving on and going back to their life\nUh and and so now the campaigning has to be the appeal so was the what do what what are the Democrats do what do they offer what are the offering\nExcept not Trump block Trump and not that that's not a motivator

person\nAnd so what you're what you're doing is you're saying the constitutional republic that we live under which is the United states of America that the United states America has to go\nSo we chose the talk was get rid of the presidency get rid of the electoral college get rid of the Senate or make the Supreme Court a liberal legislative um ah a branch\nGet rid of all borders and at the same time uh provide all health care to people yeah all college to people [laughter] everything is free yes so get rid of the United states and make everything free right I'm running for Congress right Liza like me right\nWell my question ... who's going to be there to give it to you I don't know know what if there's ... there's anarchy and there's no right if there's no real\nUm 'cause the government that's what you're going to get because by the way we're never going to get all those were not getting rid of the Senate\nAnd not going to we're getting an accurate might get rid of some in the Senate [laughter] but nobody ever in four weeks but it's but it's worth going now and I think it's very important because we did ask what is the issue the issue is that the ... not the Republicans\nJust to Republicans but the United states has failed and it goes to the power to look into that you've you've followed the narrative the founding fathers were flawed they were slave owners therefore anything that they created should be dissipated\nAnd everything that they came up with is wrong the electoral college was only there to protect slavery in the Senate was only there to protect slavery that's the narrative that you're getting it's not true but that's the narrative that you're getting a ... from them from them now so right ah it's interesting let's destroy\nThe entire country that's just because that's what you'd be doing much destroyed the concept of our constitutional republic destroy it and give everybody stuff for free\nYes or anybody in with it [noise]\nWell I don't know what are we going to do 'em all get together and go loot Citibank [laughter]\nIt's not going to be any there anybody there to the federal government and a federal government has to give them their charter right so I don't know how it's going to work maybe like a western okay so we all get horses\nBand Iraq back to a barter system Mm where you go you go into town with your wagon load up some flour and sugar and licorice whip yes and\nThen you tell the there'll be plenty of general store owner [laughter] and then it oh and a cigar then if it's going to be a general if it's going to be a a Clint Eastwood movie\nThen you tell the general store owner that you will be by on friday to pay him\nWith a goat well you\nKnow it it just shows the insanity because that's where we're at and you and I played earlier we had to you because we didn't get chest play last week the case you're Cortez ... are talking about how you know what has to be improved in Congress and it was just a bunch of blather it made no sense at all or we just finished day we went after we finish it we want\nThat go on slight somebody tried to explain to her organizing and getting people to the pole\nBut that's not how it came out she yeah she confused it with that's how she would run ... right yeah it was just it would just bizarre um\nAnd so really what you're doing doing is you're dealing with you're dealing with a group of people that have had a temper tantrum yeah they're not happy that they won so we need to destroy everything because\nThat's what's keeping us from winning which keeping us from winning is that the United states is flawed that's not even the Republicans anymore right it's our laws it's our constitution everything has to be rewritten everything has to be read done\nWell they are admitting by default that the system as was intended by our founders is defeating them yes and the only way to get around it is to do away with a system\nWell and do away with the country because you're never going to get the country that they want right\nYou're not going to get ... the vast majority of states to allow California ... New York and Texas and Florida to control the country that's not going to happen\nYou know and so the only thing that you would be able to do would be\nDestroyed the United states\nWell if you destroy the United states and split it up into areas where you wish to live your liberal dream\nUm ... that's not going to work as you probably aren't going to be able to borrow any money to support it being a brand new country yeah without any assets yeah and then as we said we here in Texas we will just we will combined ourselves with Mexico will combine all of our energy resources and we'll call ourselves Texaco\nArea we can do it\nWe have um of ours we control things here in Texas but we do have a where the government lots of cattle ranches so we're going to eat we have a lots of oil so we're going to a well we're going to get to wherever we need to go\nRead a drive cars and eat beef yes and make cars we make cars eat a Dallas and San Antonio so yeah why not eight six six and nine ...
