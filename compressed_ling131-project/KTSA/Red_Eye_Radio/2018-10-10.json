killer\nA meteorologist John trout and I guess we're expecting another uh update here in just a little over two hours from the national Hurricane Center\n[noise] yeah we'll get another one and by then we'll know whether it should arrive as a cat three or cat for but I don't want people to split hairs on bat when we categorize tornadoes we're only talking about the wind speed we saw from Hurricane Florence or a couple of weeks ago and we saw\nLast year from Hurricane Harvey that the category does not matter as much when we're talking about flooding because\nOnly the wind speeds or part of the categories one of the things I dislike about this effort Simpson scale the real killer here is never the wind it's always the flooding people think they can get through the roadways they can they can ride it out but ah [noise]\nThose floodwaters are very destructive very dangerous and very unpredictable\nCertainly a meteorologist a John ah trout we'll be following the story of course and and the storm\nA in a throughout the day and then a ... as its path continues inland and by the way what should we expect are we still on target or to see a few inches of rain for those areas in the Carolinas affected by Florence\nA little less than we talked about yesterday I mentioned or possibly a foot of rain that's been scaled back by a couple inches but Ah yes those areas locally or could see a some a ... foot rainfall total amounts into Georgia\nInto the Carolinas North Carolina and again don't forget the potential for tornadoes spawn from the system\nAll right John John trapper John John we

could lose power or may not be safe to drink water or from the tap and so there are a number of things that could become\nExtremely problematic and of course uh the officials and all of us want you to be safe and and to be able to survive this that things can be replaced that people can uh\nAnd it was just a fifty five minutes ago that the uh the new advisory came out from the national hurricane

couple of weeks ago or Mitch McConnell are at the uh the the airport or\nA a Jeff Flake in the the the elevator uh what's you know what's going on right now the the call number from Maxine Waters remember when Maxine Waters and she might have been really ignited that that political flame of\nOf actually Democrats to elected office to buy that was calling it\nA you know and and so we saw what happened this past weekend we saw what happened to Ted Cruz saw what happened to Mitch McConnell saw what happened to Jeff Flake\nOr the conversation on CNN yesterday it's not a mob it's just a people expressing their their uh their their their viewpoints and it's like well most of America looks at it and when they see people screaming and yelling and going into into a private place not an organized protest\nOr organized protest Americans are fine with you bought a new protest and you're with tens of thousands of other people and it's a peaceful protest and that's fine Americans don't want riots Americans don't want mob rule they don't want you go they they don't uh most Americans don't approve\nOf the fact that you're going into a place that is not your property trespassing just to the point of harassing for a you know a ... some you know somebody else has happened in Ted Cruz's place but that call to harass people at anywhere uh\nYesterday a Rand Paul again and you know Rand Paul's wife\nOr has been on this year for the last uh a couple of weeks talking about the instability Kentucky Senator Rand Paul on Tuesday took aim with the rhetoric employed by senator Cory Booker and others accusing them of ratcheting up the conversation or to the point where unstable people could commit violence\nSaid Paul to Kentucky radio host I fear there's going to be at an assassination why I really worry that someone is going to be killed and that those who are in a war ratcheting up the conversations those who are saying get in their face\nThere have to realize that they bear some responsibility if this this elevates the violence these are people that are unstable poll says we don't want to encourage them we have to somehow ratchet down and say we're not encouraging them the violence and violence is never okay or there's never a reason\nUh to resolve things that weigh directly calling on Booker\nWho last July told activist do get up in the face of some congresspeople Paul referenced his own uh salt of the hands of a neighbor\nAs well as last year's a baseball field shooting which Representative Steve ... was wounded to show that unstable people can easily take things are too far and then we talk about the fact that Hillary\nTalked about you know no civility right share her call ... so you've mainstream did completely now with Hillary comes out you can't get more mainstream Democrat over the last Twenty years so Hillary now calling for ... you know instability number one we talked about the fact that\nThey actually think this is an effective way to go\nTo they actually think that politicians you know calling for it now to the point of Hillary Clinton saying can have civility which is to call for instability ... which is the calls to harass people in their private life\nAnd I that would the first thing that hit me was\nWas they think this is going to be effective\nBut then you get to the point of the Hillary now bringing it up where she feels comfortable saying it looks Hillary's a follower she'll be asked you and not take an opinion on anything if she believes\nThat it is perceived as radical at all to anybody in her base ... we've seen it before remember when she was up in Canada there and\nShe was asked about the pipeline right I'm not going to comment on that because other people right now are making a decision look you're running for president it this is still a an issue we need to know what your thoughts on a dark and she didn't want to take a side\nRight and so now here's Hillary Clinton calling for instability and and and you think think about this so now it's becoming mainstream\nAnd and and what it why instability over what what is the issue you're calling for due process\nYou're calling for a presumption of innocence you're calling for preponderance of evidence\nYou're saying where's the evidence you're coming out because this is and we talked about this yesterday what came out of this whole thing ah you know from from Democrats is if you believe in due process than you are enabling rapists\nAnd therefore you deserve no civility because of it which is of course that's their definition it's not the definition of people that believe in due process under the law\nPeople to believe and due process under the law obviously are not advocating rape or sexual assault than any other crime right\nAnd that's the point and so I think about it that it's very important to get to the actual issue what is the point that they view that is so radical that the writers taking ... instability must lead and it's that simple point the belief in due process\nAnd evidence in any case to show the guilt to anybody and not just an allegation that is what has set off even the mainstream now of the Democratic party to call for in civility this is\nHow far how low\nWe always wonder we always asked a question how long will they go you know calling somebody a Nazi you know and and and saying that that's been for a long time but you get to the point now where they're calling for instability based\nOn people's opinion on the other side that evidence is how you judge somebody's guilt right due process\nShould apply and all of these cases which means\nYou look for the evidence to find somebody who's skilled you don't believe anybody because of their demographic because of their gender because of their race because of their age you believe people because the evidence backs what they what they say now you can believe that\nYou can sit there and why I think that sounded credible\nThat doesn't mean that that person that you look at them\nAnd called them a rapist because that's what they were doing they were calling him arenas and the gang rapist yes I Believe her which means they believe you did it yes they believe cabin odd it at the evidence isn't there right never been there right yet that's what their state and because you don't agree with them\nBecause you say no I Believe in the preponderance of evidence I Believe in the presumption\nOf of uh of of innocence I don't believe anybody just because they say if I Need evidence and when somebody stories change I'm suspicious\nThose are all rational critical thinking commonsense arguments and the Democrats if you believe that way are now calling for instability to harass you everywhere even invade your privacy where ever you are\nAnd it's not just the ah the old guard and Maxine Waters or Hillary Clinton is Cory Booker\nPeople that are called the future of the party as a voter ... it's now Hillary yes well and and you know that you can easily just miss a Maxine Waters in the Hillary as the old guard\nBut the future of the party is this so if if Hillary jumping out well by the way\nHillary's jumping on board as you mentioned because everybody else's because all she sees this as the future of the part and she and she also believes it's the mainstream of yeah it's already it's ... for the bowling saying it's okay to call to for instability because somebody believes and due process\nA presumption of innocence a preponderance of the evidence to decide somebody whether you believe\nSomebody is guilty or not you went from weeks ago people talking about John McCain and we need more stability to the official call for instability in just a matter of weeks I you believe in due process under the constitution you believe in uh the presumption of\nInnocence you don't believe somebody just because they say at the evidence has to prove it in their story should remain consistent you believe those kinds of things which are imbedded in the constitution of the United states\nThan you are a rape enable us to get a rapist enable is that what you are right and because you are no stability towards you that is their opinion\nRight now I have to ask you is that insane or what well and before you try and dismiss\nRand Paul and his concerns you have to remember on the day that Steve ... got shot

have insomnia and I have vowed I Will not sleep until I find the cause of it\nIs yeah it it will will will talking mostly coming up there and let him in a little bit more important things out there that are much more important meteorologist Tom hale as your guest caught up on hurricane Michael and a ... a good morning again from as you predicted hurricane Michael now had a gory for\nYes yes it is category for I agree with you all asleep pardon either way [laughter]\nI said you were working brings I'm awake in fact right now but I was very does reason\nThis is what these storms do and uh you know\nEvery once in a while you get to be able to capitalize on that adrenalin rush and um because you know a meteorologist one of the few things that we get to do and as broadcasters in our lifetime has to maybe save a life yeah\nAnd and and and here we have an opportunity because we're being heard from one end of the coast to the other side of the United states\nAnd every one of these people who are listening right now have family and friends or know someone who has family and friends hurt along this coast and and so I'm making the suggestion that you get in touch with your family and friends and make sure that they're doing the right thing\nA simple example in Panama City beach\nUh there are six possibly now seven shelters that are open so if you've decided to stay along\nThe beach front um and and not move inland maybe a ... you don't have to you can you can move inland to to a little town called fountain up to a two thirty one\nOr or you can take it a little bit further and an ad on up to\nA interstate twenty if you want to go that's only an hour drive up the road to an\nInterstate excuse me interstate ten [noise] um the simple thing is that you need to get out of harm's way\nUm when we talk about a category for storm I I Want to put this in perspective and and and and not a slow moving storm like we saw was ...\nIt was a category ... storm that hit Puerto Rico last year\nIt's called Irma and we've all seen the pictures and the devastation now\nDevastation is relative to what it hits so if it's a rotted tree it it could take a breeze to take that thing out\nUm if the homes are not built to handle hurricanes or they haven't had hurricanes in a long time and the building standards have become lax that's what the same story you get greater amounts of devastation [noise]\nUm here\nThis is something that they have not seen along this coastline historically period um along the ... of the Panama City beach to Tallahassee Pensacola Beach simply put the panhandle and then the Big Bend area that's the\nArea that swoops around\nAnd and and swings down to cedar key uh there hasn't been a category ... storm hit and so that's in itself something that nobody can relate to and when you can't relate to something\nYou relate to what you can and what you can uh if somebody has been around since Nineteen eighty five [noise] that would be caked ... and and and Kate was quite a devastating storm\nA and at that point\nYou have to say to yourself well if you haven't been around for Kate you know what other things have come by well\nAh there's been very few October storms to begin with I'm this storm is in October storm math he was an October storm\nAnd there was a a failure but a Celia was a major all these are major storms but a failure was offshore and so it didn't have that kind of a an effect on Florida and so right now if you're listening or if you have family and friends along that area you need to understand that\nThat on Wednesday evening one hundred mile an hour gusts are going to be common and that's after it's come onshore\nUm tomorrow evening because we're expecting a still a landfall sometime around three to four o'clock and that means that it'll speed up a little bit before it comes to shore\nBuyouts gone gone to the north of twelve so\nAnd of course uh you know it's been pointed out time and time again not just the wins and ... and the destruction of property and and presenting a danger to humans but but really the flooding in the storm surge here the water that comes along with a storm like this\nI'm being a potentially life threatening in fact it is life threatening and is often deadly um\nAnd and that is something to be aware of it is not just the strength of the storm in terms of wins but also the water that it's going to deliver a both and storm surge and rainfall\nWell yeah you know remember the the ... in in past it used to be the lightning lightning was like the number one whether killer and you know why lightning isn't the number one whether killer ... because we convinced everybody not to go out and the lightning right [laughter]\nOkay yeah indoors is lightning right but you know we've done a really lousy job at convincing people to use commonsense when they're on the road and they're driving and and we had over thirty people in the Carolinas\nDrowned because they decided they were going to be tougher and they knew what they were doing better than the people who are telling them to stay off the road right now and and\nAnd and so yeah a a storm surge is usually felt along the coast and let's say maybe five to ten miles inland\nWherever there is a waterway that that water from the Gulf of Mexico can move its way and [noise]\nAnd so whether you're an Appalachian cola or you are in Panama City\nOr you're swinging around uh uh toward the coastline just south of Perry and the big band that you're looking at a storm surge that's going to be easily nine feet ...\nCould be less right can be up to nine feet or even Thirteen actually the weather service has got a plot at nine to Thirteen feet in that area\nFor those of us who have never witnessed that first and I just described the dynamics of a storm surge especially one with the potential of a nine to twelve feet or more as you mention\nThat because you know we've seen the recent video from the nominee in Indonesia and we know so we can see that kind of force in terms of a storm surge I mean one of the dynamics of that what I describe that to us what takes place during the storm\nYeah because I'm looking here I'm looking here like it at Panama City beach for example that's you know are you right there I mean there's no there's no barrier it's not one of the bays it's right there what is what is the fact how far I mean that goes in a pretty long way doesn't it", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "city": "San Antonio", "day": "10"}
