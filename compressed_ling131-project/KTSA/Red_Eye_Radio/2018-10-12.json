deal\nThe tariffs from what I Know unless they have made exceptions to the ruins and some of those cases still remain with Canada and Mexico so\nYou know we stayed at when we looked at the you know when when we looked at the the trade deal formerly known as NAFTA for the most part they're really much isn't much of a difference\nAh you you know the I saw especially on social media Trump promised to rewrite NAFTA now he did a little bit\nBut he didn't do anything that he planned that he said he was going to do which was I'm going to reduce one hundred and fifty billion dollar trade deficit right that this that this isn't going to do it there were a little wins here or there\nThe problem with the the new trade deal as we said that will be a long term problem is\nAnd the president views it as a victory is raising the cost or to buy a car\nIn Mexico the United states and Canada making it more expensive to produce the car therefore making it more expensive to buy a car\nAnd making it less likely that the president one of the president's number one goal which is to be able to produce products here and sell them overseas\nHas just been flushed down the toilet because it's going to be more expensive to manufacture vehicles here which is exactly the opposite if you wish to sell them overseas right\nIt's the one thing there but it's there a couple of things but it's really the one major thing where I have no idea where the president's stance on it as we know he has changed his mind on he'll change his mind on on trade in a week he'll go from as he did one for me in a complete protection is\nJust sounded like a total free trader I've no idea where he really stands I Do know though that in this in the the\nUh trade deal formerly known as NAFTA that he viewed what he did to raise the price of buying a\nCar and producing the car in North America he put that as as his number one victory mhm which we have said that's what drives us crazy that's why we're tariffs babies\n[laughter] the original therapy but the original Tara babies as the president said now you know somebody we you know we laugh at it I Wonder how many farmers were laughing\nAt that comments off well because the ... you know he talks about protecting the farmers in the move on ethanol which was not a mandate and likely will have little if any impact because the\nThe the the the fuel producers don't ... don't want it they don't want the higher blend the it it may sound like a good deal will be able to uh sell the Fifteen in the summer first of all here comes the lawsuit here comes a lawsuit here comes a lawsuit um but\nIt will but even because at the refinery level you don't have to do the special summer blend\nBut when there's no market for it than there would be a ... a glut of the product\nAnd for the consumer that temporarily my might be a good thing but the point is we're not going to get to eat Fifteen without a mandate and he knows politically outside of the corn belt you can't get that done it too so but\nAppeasing farmers and and using that politically on on the ah on the tariffs\nAnd then they came back and said well we're going to give you billions of dollars to help you which you just admitted it's hurting them to that extent and they came back and said that's a tiny number compared to what\nWe were losing and the fact that we're losing the ability to be in that supply chain and once we lose that and we're not dependable in that world supply chain they're going to go somewhere else so it's not just well the tariffs hurt us until they're lifted it's the fact that we may never get back in those markets again because\nThese countries don't know when you'll use national emergency or trade deal you know or\nOr the the the fact of of ah the we need to get a you know a new trade deal or whatever to to uh to to terrify\nYou're not ... anymore you're not a consistent supply chain exactly and that is a problem that the you have but ah you know we noticed that you know it was obvious the president used the greatest victory\nAnd that's the weird thing on trade to begin with countries always talk about their trade victories and their trade victories were always when their citizens have to pay more money for goods and services but we don't know how that's a victory\nRight we can't figure that one out here's one thing or to media asked that question mhm yeah\nI mean as an when when you look at it and you know you you talk about the supply chain Canada saying you know or Mexico saying they're going to go to Canada and work out a deal you know for pork whereas we call it Canadian Bacon and the when they set up that supply chain if they're happy with that agreement why did they go back to us for\n\nWhat would they are\nWith any of those products from a domestic producer if you believe that the government is going to step in and disrupt that process\nThen you're going to make another long term deal elsewhere with someone else are we said this during the you know the um during the permit tore him after the\nUh when when the Gulf spill happened the BP thing that\nThat whole thing where you had companies are producers from uh the U.S saying well we can you know go somewhere else if we're going to do offshore drilling and you're not going to give us a permit back you know we can go somewhere else you don't just make that decision short term right\nAnd so you're you're gonna have to make long term plans because you can't deal with you know the the shift in policy\nOr you know on a ... at the staff of finger\nAnd and frankly\nThe ethanol thing has become you know the for the ethanol farmers that's one thing but you look at the entire farming community and I'm Talking to political you know support if they're hurt going into and and this is what we haven't been able to gauge\nYou go to Iowa\nI mean and for those people that the New York times I'm listening when you go to Iowa let me describe before Iowa is is this state in the middle of the country but when you go there it is all connected to farm it just like Texas has oil directly or indirectly\nI mean that is the driver there when you go to the to the the farm belt\nThat's everything what's the impact\nRight now of chairs politically votes for Republicans and in twenty twenty ... at the midterm this year and in twenty twenty for the president and his reelection because keep in mind\nThey may support Republicans who are on board for terrorists this time and twenty Eighteen at the midterms\nAre they going to support the president who owns that completely if it's still ongoing in twenty twenty\nNot surprised by what happened the last couple of days you know you and I talked about it but\nAnd we said look the big terrorists were hit on September twenty eight mhm so I'm not surprised that when you look at you know steel and aluminum and how they have skyrocketed since the beginning of the year right and we said look eventually it's going to be a point where the market's going to say look you're raising prices too uh too much and when the terrorists went into effect on September twenty eight\nOr when the president is trying to get Iran a you know the sanctions on Iran which means the world oil market is going to you know increase the cost of oil even though we are producing\nA more when steel aluminum or up when we uh we had been told the fourth quarter could be hit because of the two hundred billion dollars in tariffs at ten percent that went in\nLots of ... September twenty eight eventually the market's going to react to that you can't raise raising the cost of doing business is never a positive for the economy right but everything that we've talked about and everything that every financial magazine has talked about\nAbout why the stock market has been hit us to do to what government action mhm regulation tech companies right a tariffs\nThe the the the fed our our national debt and the bond interest rates going up all of its related to what government intervention in some way eight six six Ninety red eye\nTips from Jay Jay Keller and associates incorporated on customer service does your motor carrier provide uniforms for you to wear on the job does your company require drivers to adhere to a dress code\nIf the answer to both questions is no then it might be a good idea to Institute a self imposed dress code of parents can say plenty about a person the driver who shows up at a delivery dressed in a professional manner gives the customer a better impression of the company and the individuals they're working with\nIf you're in the middle of the long run be sure to pack enough clean clothes for the journey driving could be grueling and demanding as the old saying goes close make demands\nAnd fresh clothing can help you feel more comfortable while on the road and when taking breaks for a meal this tip was brought to you by Jay Jay killer and associates incorporated visit us on Jay Jay Keller dot com\nThis has been the marriage or drive a report Roger you buy pilot flying J shell real jealous and merits war after market run with the bowl [noise]\nVoice a red or radio with a record ...

S. continue for the most part even with the terrorists in place they said there are still moderately strong well\nIt doesn't change the the uh trade deficit\nRight a scenario is is not likely to change it wasn't going to change with the new NAFTA you know so that that thing is kind of off the table\nBut with China you have a couple of concerns the the very valid concern is the intellectual property consider\nMhm that's the real thing that the president asked to address I mean the tariffs thing is going to have to be remedied but it's going to they're going to have to there's going to have to be\nAnd it's not just pressure from the U.S when the ... when the president announced that he was going to or it was announced that the president would be going to try to sit down with a she in China well\nThat's we need everybody got that table on our side of the table the rest of the world needs to be in China's face saying this can't happen anymore you got to play by the rules\nThe\nBecause of the ... if you look at the the steel and aluminum tariffs if those are in place long term you're going to see you're going to see an adjustment on the stock market and stock market is the least of your concerns the reason it's adjusting as because things are becoming more expensive like you mentioned uh the fed with interest rates\nAre the the you know I agree or disagree the sanctions on Iran is is causing a lot of the global uh oil prices too\nGo up on the Saudis have some play in that to us and we'll see if they ramp up production and and and our enable and change that and it is an incentive a a\nAgain because it makes it more profitable for American producer yes and and were eventually going to get to that point I Believe\nI well it depends on who's in Washington but I Believe we will get to the point of self sufficiency where you know we can produce for the United states and export at the same time which is a which will be a great point\nA to a to get to we're not there yet but as we the ... really one of the most under reported stories\nOf the entire year ...\nIs that the United states\nIs now on it happened about three weeks ago became the number one producer of oil in the world mhm\nYeah um and and this is it I mean you if you put in place all the things of that will make an economy great again [laughter] um and they did by the way I think\nThat's the number one reason I Can't hear supporting a uh the uh the the president his tax bill went way way down\n[laughter] but um the you know the [laughter] that'd be enough for me [laughter] it's not the case for me though mine went up a but but the line to get right\nSo the but but you put in place all those dynamics for great economy and all it's working up until what the ... three numbers we talked about the GDP numbers from the second quarter and said hey this is great\nBut what is the third quarter fourth quarter and then first quarter of next year look like if the cost of raw materials is still high and increasing still going up that is a negative that is strictly\nControlled by the government that is something that U.S policy put in place that doesn't need to be there look\nThough have you know in and we said we stayed with China and the intellectual property yeah we understand we understand the case there we didn't understand Canada Mexico or Europe or even a for the most part are not that you couldn't have done a few things different in in TPP but remember the great victories of the dairy with Canada was already in the\nCapital I had already agreed to that yes I'm a you know ... before so that was lauded as a great victory and uh but that was something we already had before and decided not you know the Trump Administration decided\nYou know not to uh to take that you and I went through and and and uh as you know Wall Street journal and others didn't look actually at the the new NAFTA and then there's not much change from the\nOld NAFTA the biggest victory that the president has claimed\nThat he claimed was the fact that the terrorists worked\nTo get what he wanted with the automobile industry right along he did in the automobile industry was increased the cost of producing an automobile\nIn Mexico in the United states and in Canada yeah nobody is debating that that's not what happened right and that's viewed as a victory well if I remember\nTwo of the president's major goals his goals his state of goals was to reduce the one hundred and fifty billion dollar trade deficit\nI don't see how this does it because the majority of the new NAFTA does is the exact same as the old NAFTA ... except for automobiles the dairy which would have been in TPP anyway only increases the U.S market to Canada by one percent mhm\nUh and uh the rest is still the same right so you ask okay what were the what were the because that the president's trying to make the terrorists are worth it because we got we wanted in automobiles what did you get\nThey look at it and say okay\nThis this is you know insanity the fact that it went this way they don't\nUh applied the left believes that they apply their feelings directly to it in their feelings fleet that is the case for some\nBut most Americans look at it practically speaking and going you know this is a big deal to vote to be able to vote is a big deal and if there to the point where they are you know in that likely voter category this is why those polls start to shape the way they do and that's why likely voter gives you a better read but\nThey look at that and go you know it's a big deal on election day to get up and go cast my vote\nYou know I Know people show up and they're driven by you know a slogan they're driven by whatever imagery\nBut we can't forget the people that take it very serious they consider things they may not be immersed in it every day like we are for whatever reason\nBut they will show up and they make an informed decision and often it is a reaction Chuck Todd on a ... and and Chuck Todd was saying well a lot of people get it wrong in and say twenty sixteen was a referendum on Trump but it really was a referendum on Hillary\nThat was a small part of it what what Chuck Todd us for getting here because they are discussing the polls in the mid term is is about you know the house in the Senate and not a presidential election and his point what he was implying that Hillary's not here to be the the bad guy right\nWell what\nChuck is forgetting is the real facts of how the Republicans in districts all over America outperformed Trump and that it wasn't a referendum on Hillary it was a referendum on the left\n... you know that that's a great point of the other point brought by the color of their ... and I think you can't underestimate this is that Americans may not know the three branches of government right\nUh you know and and that's what the polls show Seventy five percent of Americans roughly could not tell you all three branches of government they might know one or two or ... zero but they couldn't tell you all three as you said you need to know all three to understand how the government actually works they may not be able to tell you the freedoms and the first amendment\nBut think about when it comes to due process\nThink about since Perry Mason let's go through all the lawyer shows that have been that

S. P. S. that has not publicly disclosed Amazon declined to comment on the price hikes and the postal service declined to answer questions\nAny potential impact on the company the increases for partial select were steeper than in previous previous years us the best of the new rates are results of a regular review process and are set to take effect on January twenty seven subject to approval from the postal Regulatory Commission\nAlright\nA Trump has repeatedly allege that Amazon is to blame for the postal services financial woes\nAnd accuses the e commerce giant ripping off the agency and treating it like a delivery boy the president created a special task force in April to examine\nThe postal services business model sparking speculation that he would use it to raise shipping rates on Amazon ... a Trump equates Amazon with the Washington Post which is owned by\nAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos and as a target of Trump's anger about media coverage\nSo there you go from this is from political fuck it's just a [noise] then again they\nHave a long term deal with them they're not affected by it right if that if that you know the pricing deal is in place and and look at what ... not a ... I mean just in general if you talk about his a\nSupply chain his delivery each a chain a from a to B a to Z I guess\nIt was clear that that when he started making large purchases on his freight company that he was going to be doing more of his own delivery and so while he can't do it all\nBecause you have I don't know I don't know what the even what the numbers in terms of overall numbers of sellers on Amazon\nThe point being is that there are things coming from all over the world that are sold on Amazon and so it would be impossible for although these those has done other things [laughter] that people didn't see coming uh I don't think any time soon he will have he will control completely his own his own ...\nUh but he is doing that more and more and that was to shut out more and more the the the um FedEx and UPS\nDelivery that was costing him more and more costing the consumer more and more and he said this is not about shutting out the little guy and in fact is about creating more opportunity for the little guy and now they they you can go out and get your own local delivery\nUh buy your own local delivery a set up for a for Amazon and by the vans and everything else\nAnd be a part of that and and there's opportunity there it was about creating a uh basically the the ability or more and more to control pricing to keep prices low on Amazon according to these ...\nHe's the U.

I mean seriously they was it was one of those hold\nMy beer moment but if if if if you look at the entire week and you know just looking back at this week before we had off on vacation that ... you know we started the beginning of the week and really it was the fact that the the the message from the whole cabinet hearings if you believe in due process\nYou are a rapist enabler right if you believe has to do the mindset of due process that if you don't believe the allegation that's how crazy doesn't unite talked about that over the last thirty forty fifty sixty years the number lawyer shows on TV starting with Perry Mason\nYou know you go through ... like I'm probably missing a ton of them wants one with William Shatner Boston Legal just ... you know the answer and you know and then law and order for almost the last Thirty years ... law and order everybody understands with people may not know the three branches of government they may not know the constitution they may not be able to\nTell you you know the freedoms you have in the first amendment all things that we are brought up over the last couple of months\nBut it's part of our culture it's part you know in an innocent until proven guilty that evidence decides that something that's even beyond what we're taught about the infrastructure of how the constitution works that's part of our popular culture it's in\nSo many TV shows out there over the last forty or fifty years and I think they just ... it was a huge mistake in calculation by the Democrats to believe that they couldn't sell that\nTo the American people 'cause I guarantee you if you're a Democrat out here right now you know\n... that that was a stupid move by the\nThat if they want to go post cabinet post cabin off but coming out with those statements that a woman is always to be believed everyone knows is pure trash\nYes nobody is to always be believed just because of their demographic their gender or race whatever everybody knows it's the evidence but they actually tried to sell that to the American\nUh uh the people and you think about is just it's just it's nuts and then by the time we got to the middle of the week it was the Democrats promoting instability including the mainstream\nOf the the Democratic Party or like a Hillary Clinton or we saw Eric Holder come out then backtracked if everybody knows that's not what I meant [laughter] somebody wrote than don't use the word kick\n[laughter] and you know to you know where we are uh you know right now looking at the polls and seeing how they're all going to react mhm yeah\nAnd it is it and it is also the wagging the finger toward people simply for believing in the process\nThere they're being a indirectly condemned for doing so yes saying that you're essentially on a person's side and that you support\nWhat we allege he did write your which goes against it and think about it\nI I think the perfect example the perfect imagery is the ACLU what they used to be amazed he'll use as to what they had become today that the presumption of innocence means nothing nothing to the American civil liberties union anymore it shows used something accord with Americans understand\nAnd the ACLU probably did decades of uh of damage a ... to themselves by saying that doesn't matter that the allegation matters by taking a side instead of defending the constitution\nAnd that's when it gets down to and so like I said it's going to be really interesting to see what happens but it's amazing what the Democrats have tried to sell this week instability and due process means nothing right wow ... eight six six Ninety red eye\nThe latest consumer price index shows no change for what we pay for food at the supermarkets and retail stores from the previous month yet as

immigrant\nEh\nShe also was or some oh I I wrote to the other part of it right there you get that that the main part of the main parts so there you go calling the people of Arizona craze\n\nUh we would suggest to the mic Sally campaign well if you if you want if your goal is to work in the Senate\n... the the United States Senate\nAnd represent the people of Arizona just uh just for starters don't call the people of that state crazy\nYou know in a time she focused in on the Republicans but at the time she did not when she\n... short so assume she because she's probably going to say well Republicans are crazy\nBecause she's ... that that might be how she defense or something which by the way well she does well that would hurt her because she's trying to position herself as somebody who was by ... so just assume that okay because we can you can hear it already she was just talking about the crazy Republicans\nWell not for somebody who says they're going to be a moderate and work with both parties\nBecause keep in mind I mean this is a the Jeff Flake seat but it's also the state that was represented a by the late John McCain and the left hailed him after after he passed\nThat's for being someone who essentially rose about politics and work with both sides actually that was not the case in the end and they weren't describing it his behavior in the Senate correctly he moved to the left\nThey didn't move to the right to be clear but ah on that on on that point\nShe is trying to position herself and appeal to the people that might have supported John became\nRight yeah I looked up\nCuomo can get away with saying conservatives are welcome in New York right yes even the ones that are there because we know that I and and writing and just being on you get a you can get away with that and the New York yeah you can get away with probably saying it in California right\nAnd you can be a Democrat say look I Know all of people are nuts everybody here is crazy and we're not right and still get elected as long as you promote democratic values might be a little bit different in Arizona\nThat's that's where the differences because you had essentially to a historically speaking and soft Republicans\nI remember he said he'd rather than an extreme conservatives in a who oppose abortion and support gun rights have no place in the state yeah that's a huge number of people in New York state\nGuess either by the way um you know and this and this is that said that terminology thing and I I Know I'm splitting hairs and preaching to the choir in terms of our audience it's not gun rights it's my rights\nUh yeah the gun doesn't advertising doesn't that doesn't have any rights that gun has no right to John doesn't have any\nRights I assume all of the the guns rights when I put it in my cold live fingers it's the people's right yes\nA very interesting I just want to get to the top because you happen to bring this up and I didn't know about this ... employees on the Las Vegas strip fear being replaced by robots and you were telling me there is actually these and I'm looking at it right now that they've come up with these drink robots that will make bartenders obsolete yes\nAnd you can come as the design I've seen I don't know if this is in\nPlace in Vegas just yet but the design I've seen also includes you walk up to the kiosk or the kiosk is even invested into the counter like they do the are they actually have like a a if you go up to a bar and the gambling city ah for those who don't gamble or never been\nWhen you sit at a bar you can get your drinks actually for free if you're gambling and they'll put the right there at the seat there is a video poker thing you can play mhm right\nBy the way the drinks not free [laughter] it'll cost you whatever you lose and video [laughter] to be clear you mean they're not giving yeah anything ... now that uh that are just that they don't deserve to buy a bunch of alcohol and lose money on it no\nI'm the those [laughter] getting back to the robot thing [laughter] I'm a I'm not sure what the strippers will look like", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "city": "San
