by creating this illusion that things are a certain way\nBy changing the meaning of words by by by uh instilling into young very young children\nThat things are a certain way when they're not\n... it's the the whole idea of just the the very you may think mundane or\nOr or or or not to great of a a an issue these days but we go back to taking the competition out of a sports or taking a\nThe the grading out of schools\n\nIf we're not to measure our own success along the way then how do we know we're successful\nIf we're not to to to measure against others then who are we to do what are we to

and the good coach will tell them that team did this learn from that don't be jealous don't be envious do it better than they did it\nSee that's the difference is in the real world because you get kicked to the curb there's competition everywhere you you look\nBut if we create this fantasy that the world owes you something simply because you exist\nThat it never stop or your special just because you exist and and that's it that you have earned it because you're special we haven't heard any right to thing your work is what earns it I mean it it doesn't matter what you achieve today even\nDo cat rest on their laurels because the world the real world expects you to produce tomorrow\nAnd look I I agree with you on that when they started and that really started the late eighties early nineties will no we're not going to have competition no with Frank and the kids would always know the score everybody got trophies ... and ... ... exactly and then the trophy means what\nNothing I remember driving a truck has no meaning my granddaughter one of my granddaughters and they had started\nWith a with baseball and she came up to me and I said okay so you know how to go they it was a short season ... they were very young she was six or seven and she says I I said so so what did you think your first season of a baseball\nShe goes oh it's okay I mean I I like playing I said well how did it wind up while we didn't do too All right she goes but we've got a trophy [laughter]\nShe goes yeah well we didn't earn a trophy we just got one for for being there\nAnd she goes I don't really care to put that trophy on a shelf or anything I don't know that I Would want to keep that trove [laughter] because it doesn't mean anything see this is the this is the this is right here this these are the fall so it's when we assigned value to something\nBecause we say it has value or the the participation trophy or we say well the or the government trying to assign value well that worker deserves Fifteen dollars an hour\nThat's not that's not how society right on the voting because they because they exist right and that's not how was it a society\nIs is the only way that you can judge that value in the private sector it's very simple and I talked to accompany today and I said well\nWhat's what's been going on you know with you guys what we had to hire three thousand people in the last year alone that's huge and I said I said wow that's\nIt's a it's a it's a problem but it's a good problem to have in growth right the growing economy over the last year to Eighteen months has been so stellar for them that they've had to hire three thousand people\nSee we always talk about the the employee and well they are but we need to protect the jobs no we need to protect capitalism capitalism will create the jobs\nThe expansion of well there's where the value is and that doesn't capitalism doesn't care the color of your skin where you came from or anything else it's about what you can do every day when you show up\nRight that's how I became a good basketball player but every other than that everything every other team I got cut from\nAnd I my parents said oh you cry and then the ten minutes later you get back up and you'd be doing it again but you crowd we felt so sorry for you and I said best thing that ever happened so yeah best thing that have signed up to best

talk and analyze the mid term elections we've talked about the strong and weak points\nFor the Republicans are and the strongly points for the the Democrats one thing that Democrats brought up\nA now we think they may have had it too late but it's still doesn't mean that people don't recognize that especially\nIf you know this is this was a time of the year when a all of us I mean we here at at at our job\nThat are put in for you know benefits here are the last uh ten days or so a lot of other companies are doing it a Obamacare but you know premiums are are coming in now and we had said this back then that the Republicans left this thing wide open\nThat you know they did a horrible job or a you know when it came to especially premiums that we're going to sky rocket\nAnd we said they've got to come up with something as to what they're going to do when they really happen and Newt Gingrich wrote an article for Fox News and said the twenty Eighteen mid term elections were less than two weeks away this three days ago\nAnd many polls show there was a sizable block of independent voters who have not yet made up their minds at the same time health care remains the number one issue for the American people\nThe best way for the Republicans to earn the votes of these undecided voters and honor commitments to the Republicans who are already support them urge to clearly articulate how they would fix the broken healthcare system\nAnd he goes to the whole thing that the should be Republican principles ah for the book for America's a Republican principles for America's health and health care system we believe that every American should have the opportunity to live a long and healthy life supported by a healthcare system that is simple to use innovative and affordable\nWe believe that every American should up his or her choice of the doctors and insurance that meets his or her specific needs we believe the healthcare system should be transparent about health care cost and quality of treatment options and that this information should be available to every American and assemble understandable wasteful patients can make better decisions\nAbout their own health we believe in protecting patients\nWith preexisting conditions so they can obtain affordable health insurance coverage we believe in the importance of American Medical innovation that leads the to the breakthroughs that dramatically improve health outcomes while significantly lowering costs we believe that a doctor patient relationship\nIs the center of ineffective healthcare system and it should not be disrupted\nBy micro management from public and private bureaucracies we believe American seniors have earned their health care benefits and that they their families and their doctors should make their own medical decisions not an elected government boards bureaucrats are private third party\nPayers are middle men we believe in a competitive healthcare market where private sector innovation works to strengthen public programs\nOne size fits all government controlled healthcare interferes with doctor patient relationship knee caps new medical breakthroughs provides less asked access to treatment and leads to long wait times for critical care we believe that the current health care system\nAnd America is far too expensive while it is very good at treating people when they become sick it is much less effective\nAt helping Americans remain healthy which is equally as important we believe the goal of health reform should be to build on what's working and fix what's not destroying what's good about our healthcare system\nIn an attempt to fix what's bad is not acceptable step towards a better future and then he goes on to the Republican accomplishment so they go to the accomplishments [noise] you know including eliminating the Obamacare individual mandate\nOr the uh uh six billion new to fight opioid epidemic the past the right to try legislation passed historic VA mission\nUh at the Trump Administration providing more affordable health care options for Americans through association healthcare plans and short term limited to ration plans so they go through that there's ten different ones there then they say the Republican promises for digital improvements\nIf the American people re elect Republicans to a majority in the house and Senate we pledge to enact a series of practical in specific changes based on what works in the public and private sectors to build a better healthcare system a system will keep people healthy and provide effective treatments and economic security for those who get sick\nThese legislative changes will and they go through the pre existing condition which really goes back to the block grant right\nWe do we do so by committing the resources necessary for states to try new approaches like high risk pools and re insurance so everyone regardless of medical history has access to affordable insurance but again it goes to the states\nThe states make a decision as to what they wish to do right and further reduce the cost of prescription drugs by requiring additional transparency and accountability across the entire prescription drug supply chain\nA lower premiums for individuals and small businesses by eliminating the health insurance tax\nReducing Washington's mandates of limited choices the drive up costs for insurance strengthen Medicare by protecting Medicare part D patients from excessive out of pocket costs maximize medical innovation that go through that but basically go through all the things that they should that they should actually do\nThis has been a failure of the Republican Party completely\nThere is something that probably Ryan should should have been talking about on a consistent basis there should have been a marketing plan for this with massive television ads\nLeading up to the election that if you will act as if this is our plan this is our contract ... and Newt Gingrich bringing it out and this was two days ago it's too late oh yeah yeah it ...\nIt's not going to work uh now we're inside of a week first of all it's because a Newt Gingrich is is only going to ... no one is going to uh pay attention to Newt except for the choir\nOr because that's who he's preaching to but you're right with a ... Paul Ryan at the beginning of this year we talked about in twenty sixteen all of the we're going to do away with was Obamacare we're going to do away with Obamacare we will\nDo away with Obamacare and then by the time they got there the sentiment by the rank and file a changed and it was like okay well we'll do away with the\nSome of the Obama Care and then they finally got to\nThe individual mandate which of course then under the funding mechanism\nAnd then forced them eventually will force them\nTo pay for it in another way premiums going up all of the ... which is exactly what we're seeing and we we talked about that disconnect between twenty sixteen and the end of last year\nNow you have this this whole new cycle and and whole new opportunity to essentially launch the new plan based on what you know about the public sentiment and they do know what then\nWhy wouldn't you do that to say if you give us if if if if we are in charge this is what we want to do and go at a joint by point as Newt Gingrich to\nAn end and it should have been it should've been Ryan and the president yeah this is what we're going to do look it isn't done yet and you promote the daylights out of it

common sense and explaining of the issue of health care to the American people right right same doing nothing and having premiums skyrocket is the way to go is the only choice is ridiculous notes eventually you have to defend what you believe\nRight well and at some point they're going to have to act on health care at some point that that has to be done right because the the premiums going up and as especially as a result of the regulation that's in place right now is\nIt all the reasons that were to be tolerated by the orange thing again which brought it up as as you said besides the economy it's number one issue for Americans and Democrats have a huge paper and it right now because of what the Republicans did\nYep yep you break it you pay for it that simple\nSo it is an issue in this election is what we're not seeing it Gingrich is saying that he's got a little bit of experience in that kind of territory ...\nWell because it is especially right now is you mentioned I mean

make it an election issue that you make an election issue that yeah you you say like well you have the power is not going to\nGet done now but if we got the Senate and we got our White House here's what we would do so so what you do is you bring it up and you still bring it up and it doesn't get passed and you bring it up again right you bring it up as an election issue mhm yeah he's I think you\nYou were an throw it against the wall and knowing it's going buddies that resistance\nIf if your Democrats and you take the house you've got to ... you have to make your statement to you're far left base that you wish to energize yeah and you're not going to do with little tweaks here and there are ... of different government spending out there no no\nNo you're not going to look you you're not going to make any any ground or anything short of the big game the big prize is not going to is not going to work for you I here's another one\nBecause remember how infrastructure was a big thing just a couple of months ago [laughter] ah\nI mean everybody's memories remember Ronald\nAll right but the Democrats the Democrats get in the house and let's spend a ton of money the president will go for well we know that that was no now the Senate won't go for the Senate and well okay so here's a question here's a question though\n[laughter]\nDo the Democrats in the house believe that there are things that the president will side\nWith him on but can they risk that in that they would be appealing to the president to get the work\nDone and to try and convince the Senate no that is on infrastructure not not on Medicare because they have agreed with the president before and it has some change their attitude\nTowards them\nSo that's not a threat of them working with the president and that's not going to be outright Schumer's already done it\nWith with\nBudget things have already work they've already worked together on some of this stuff so [noise] um so they they're willing to work with them and then than separate themselves from the ... especially if it's spending money\nWell though see I see it's never billionaire beside him while he's trying to get into the law and the point Adam and call them Hitler yes we have set up a ferret White House\nIt's never been about where he actually stands politically mhm because as we said the president is actually a on judges yes he is a construction which would make him a conservative\nThere he is on tax cuts\nYou and I haven't talked about the fact that you know when republic that the Democrats running for office of talked about we need to increase corporate taxes back to twenty five percent and we went wow used to be thirty five\nAnd we you know we we mentioned that would have a couple of Democrats brought it up when did you get that corporate tax backup they would even put it back up to thirty five percent which is a huge win\nFor conservatives out there but on government spending you know the president's up there talking about OK age age of ... each of the branches of the executive branch has to cut five percent that's nothing now with the increased spending in other areas that that that happens right\nBut I just you know with ... not much is going to get done if they Democrats take the house nothing's going to get done over the next\nTwo years at a ... everything everything will be positioning yes it will be the run up for twenty twenty right because Democrats\nControl what legislation would get through the house so wouldn't matter even if the Republicans had a shot at at getting some things passed because you had some Democrat representatives let's say they had a\nTwo or three there is a possibility Democrats might only have a house by two or three votes right as a possibility of Anthony yes it is but they can also control what actually gets on the floor because they have the leadership at that point yes\n\nSo I don't see anything\nOver the next two years getting done except for positioning statements made by everybody and\nThe other possibility I Would see is using the house cause you and I talked about okay they can say let's do it in the structure bill and working with the president because the president has big ... big and infrastructure and ...\nAnd you get enough Republicans and Democrats in the Senate to get that done yeah so I don't think in the Senate well ... probably not as like not the Senate 'cause I just don't think Mitch McConnell would I I just don't think it would get through not if you're not if you increase the amount of ... I think that would be\nUm I I could be wrong I could be wrong I've ever remember there's only really what do we say a conservative and a half\nOkay oh here's the question does the majority leader assuming that the Republicans you know hold the Senate which it looks like they will but\nThat does the sacrifice that on infrastructure knowing people don't care about infrastructure or spend it with and that's a great point it's not the big gotcha issue data that a medical care for all would\nI I guess I Would I guess I Would look at this and and um say I am I guess my point was will if the Democrats took the house would they attempt to divide the executive branch from the Senate\n\nBy coming up with things that they believe the president would like that the Senate Republicans would not want well here's an here's an indoor I tried to put a wedge going into twenty twenty okay with the president criticizing the Senate as you get as you're heading towards twenty twenty so your ultimate play\nHere's what I mean the Democrats clearly want they want the the the Senate the house and the White House\nSo\nIn playing the president against the Senate it's all about you know if if they would want to get something done you know for the sake of getting it done you know what I mean having something look we've ... we've accomplished we got this than we can get a lot more done if we get the Senate White House ah so I guess there's\nPossibility open that up and and it would be a good play hey the precedent is that he would support this and this and this and this is what we're supporting we're showing bi partisanship [laughter]\nIt's a bipartisan by by willing to work with the president that he's on something he's already clearly stated he ... he supports the only problem right now is the Republicans in the Senate by the way I Do oh I Know no I I was I was just thinking whoever runs\nFor the Democrats that the the the model for the Democrats in twenty twenty is\nBipartisanship and civility [noise] no I mean\nI think they're going to try and pretend that and what what do you do you flowed out some some things that infrastructure not that it's a small thing but it's not one of those hot button issues\nSo a few floats something I don't know that it will be infrastructure but you say that look we know the president's supports a investment and I hate the word investment in infrastructure uh and he has said that before\nAnd was not able to get it done when his side control the house now we control it and we're willing to work\nWith him except the Senate does not\nWe call on the president to work with the GOP in the Senate to get this done we're willing to work with the president on this meanwhile we'd like to attach Medicare for all to all of this yes and also the president is either [laughter]\n[laughter]\nWow don't he's ISIS but weren't was dissolved with uh this is all hypothetical our minds are just drifting right now and while we find a way we're not
