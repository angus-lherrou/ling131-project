have a debate people call us and say well you guys you're never going to convince everybody that's not the point the point is never to convince everybody in the political process in this country where you are roughly have forty percent Republican forty percent\nAh a Democrat it's the twenty percent in between\nAnd when you get up to sixty percent convinced the majority of independence and that's how you win elections you make the case you stick to common sense\nTo critical thinking and you'll still be able to get the majority of Americans to agree with you except for the national debt\nMhm\nAh so there you go they found the people that when people are told a the three of the three name what this does not cooperate the accusations of a doctor forward opinion shifts decisively in Kavanaugh's favor as a daily wire reported on Monday polls by you govern Reuters found that people largely believe what benefits they're affiliated party\nMore than two thirds of Democrats believe the sexual allegations against Kavanaugh while roughly the same percentage of Republicans do not\nOverall you God found that forty one percent belief for thirty five percent believe Kavanaugh Reuters found forty two percent belief Ford and thirty one percent believe Cavanaugh\nA Harris Poll chair Mark Penn a former Bill Clinton polls to report in Sunday\nThat the Harris Poll study found that forty percent who saw or read parts of the testimony\nLast Thursday felt that Ford alone seem credible while twenty three percent some cabin all alone seem credible that means just themselves without anything else no evidence around it but a total of twenty seven percent so they both seem believable\nDust sixty seven percent of the of the total felt that Ford was credible fifty percent\nUh felt cabinet was credible so there you go sixty seven fifty\nOr the Harris Poll study really gets interesting\nAnd its findings on the impact of the FBI investigation and on the issue of cooperation the credibility of the testimony does not appear to be a decisive factor writes pen rather the question comes down to cooperation as the standard for tipping public opinion on whether Kavanaugh should've send to the highest score\nWhen the response we're told with three name witnesses did not cooperate Ford's claim fifty seven percent said they were in favor of his confirmation if the FBI fines no cooperation of Ford's claims sixty percent said Kavanaugh should be confirmed penned reports so there you go\nAs we shut all the time it gets down to the evidence we stayed at from the very very beginning and that's why what the Democrats are selling independence aren't buying\nAnybody who has an out some critical thinking understands\nThe presumption of innocence even in a study in like this the Democrats tried for a short time to use the the uh the phrase well or this isn't a court of law it's a job interview yeah\nAmericans understand the fairness and number one most job interviews do not have an FBI investigation by the way only only certain jobs this is an appointment to a branch of government and it is one political party\nNot just your employer is a political party trying to defend the character of that long term federal judge\nOr who has been nominated to this particular job Americans understand that they tried to use it for a short time and and they really didn't work because Americans to understand it unless you are a part as you look at this and you say sorry not enough here and that's why a you know the the Harvard\nPoll Harris Poll that Mark Penn took to me indicates what America really thinks and it shows that the Democrats are convincing anybody\nOther than themselves well and and that's that's it but when this is the this is the I guess downside for them of the media carrying their stories and their narrative\nIs that\nIt makes a lot of people feel like well I don't know she's going to win the election it makes a lot of people feel like it's going to go this way or that the reality is this when it's often not\nBecause of willful ignorance drives all of this people that are very uh [noise] in fact clear about staying away from the actual details of the story last will make a decision\nAnd in a situation like this we have to be reminded that that's how political pressure is built\nWell\nIf you start asking questions and pointing out the details\nAnd they only have to really be informed of an ... just a really short list of those details the opinion start to ... to change to the point that there is no political pressure against the Republicans in the vote for\nCapital I I think I can safely say this I Believe that out of all the determining factor of how people make their opinions and there may be ten different factors\nI think the leading won the the leading factor of people are making you know that that making their opinions is ignorance mhm I really do yeah because uh we we deal with it every day and they are but in
