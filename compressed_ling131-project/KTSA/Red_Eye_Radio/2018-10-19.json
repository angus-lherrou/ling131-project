sad maybe let's go to the gallon in I'm Sorry a Mikhail in Corpus Christi\nAre you doing today sir real well\nYou know I'm a I'm a libertarian or I go to college so I'm not Republican and I'm not Democrat and I got to be honest with you you know I've heard it from both sides you know I've been called a racist in a big hit and what have you from the left it and you know I call it the cold you know\nA snowflake you know from the right and I think it really comes down to\nThis country is being torn apart it seems to me um by their politics it seems that people are kind of unable to sit down and just you know\nDiscussed or politics and work towards you know a a better in America you know together and I will have to say I'm not trying to figure out but\nThe Republicans in the right wing or almost just as bad about it is\nYeah I don't see that and so by the way I was thinking I was listening to what you say it and you said snowflake and I think it's like it's not like calling someone a racist or a big hit your people and I ... and you could be a snowflake and being on the Republican side just means\nYou know things offend you got upset easily you can't handle things I don't mind being called a snowflake it's not anything like being called a racist for um a whole form or anything else the snow's liquid those even I even like snowflakes so even your comparison makes a senior

stem\nFrom also a kind of I'm not really being able to hold your candidate accountable\nAnd I think that's one thing that you know Republicans and the right we could do to further their message and I think it would hope so much more to kind of get your ideas out there of course is just my opinion but a caller earlier had commented on the second amendment and I'm very pro second ...\nYou know you have a right wing or is like you said that really are Second Amendment we you know if that's what you agree and you want to ban bump stocks and you want to raise you know the age of Twenty one and that's fine but that's not something you agree with\nA mean old your candidates accountable to that I Would think\nIt's funny you say that because it's funny I have a different view I think that Republicans do turn on their own much more than Democrats to your mayor ah remember at the health care vote it was all Democrats not one Republican\nOr Bill Clinton impeachment that none of the Democrats would sign on Kavanaugh you had one Democrat who the Trump won by forty points in West Virginia so you can understand why he may have voted for his nomination\nThey the Democrats the less really stick together whereas I don't know you've never heard me before but George W. Bush as an example is position on illegal immigration I could never accept that there's so many things and a lot of us disagreed with him in Iraq\nOr we do it and go against our own so I just want you to see I have a different view I think that we do hold him accountable I I couldn't stand Lindsey Graham's position on illegal immigration but he was a great on camera [noise]\nUh I I think our side really does hold these people accountable and the other side doesn't isn't that funny depends on your perspective what age are you how old are you\nSir I'm Twenty years old\nYeah you're very articulate that I thought you were young but I think as I could be wrong but if you check out politics you continue to follow this stuff I think you'll see that people on my side conservatives Republicans we as an example we don't we don't have ... people were just finding that out\nUm even on social media we I don't care what if you know I'd I'd marry someone who was conservative that that shared my I mean that was a liberal that your minds values but I don't you can see the other side of doesn't feel the way they hate the President Trump and people who side with him so much that they're willing to abandon their the daughters willing to abandon the father\nI don't see that and say hey McGill you I had no longer Ptolemy and Marcus the show dot com if you listen to me long I have a feeling after a while I can adjust the pick maybe might or\nWhat do you think okay for you and thank you so much thanks and kill it was a lot of fun talking to you\nAnd I want to talk to the rest of you at eight six six Ninety red eye eight six six nine o seven thirty three thirty nine tell me your experiences with people on the other side in your family among your friends even on your acquaintances on Facebook what they do when they find out oh my God\nShe or he is or Republican oh my God I imagine he's even\nConservative or he voted for Donald Trump how could you guys let's see what we see that this guy's a bumbling fools right that's what they think that this guy's a racist or homophobic or a massage and if you you mentioned it how could you not see that answer\nWe don't see 'cause we don't see the facts we think it's very emotional and listen to the media so much let me know what you think Marcus are filling in on red eye radio\nLooking to purchase your own trucker trailer exile financial company may be able to help with financing Eric Gifford without trial tells us about the company and the process of getting approved\nStarted back in two thousand for two thousand eight we opened our first brick and mortar office and we've been serving truckers through today with an a plus business writing for the baby and we don't go by credit score we actually look at their credit profile experience in the industry stability factors we treat them as a person not a score we look for the way to get them up\nFood and into their own the truck especially the guys just starting out and getting into their first trip commercial trucks the medium duty to the class eight trucks all type trader so all types as well just not brand new equipment we specialize in just the used equipment generally an approval within twenty four\nForty eight hours after that depending on how fast the customer wants to move they can be in the new truck\nThan three to seven days total go to ... a G.

sister with your ... el ... everywhere I had to go you know my sister went and I look back now and I absolutely love that you know and um but we're really tight all the way through and and um you know similar I think it was my senior year my parents got divorced and so we got a little\nYou know a state of my dad and mom and and we got a little separation but we never let the distance or um\nGet it between us we stayed in contact and uh she became a flight attendant for a while for gene a flight attendant excuse me and you know she would let me use our passive and we would fly places here\nAnd um and then you know slowly as family comes in you know you can maybe don't talk as much but we always talk and um\nAnd we always had the same views for the longest time you know maybe a couple of little differences here and there but um\nShe started traveling a lot to Europe and this that and company back started talking about how you know America does the U.S does this wrong or the u._s. should be more like this country and this and that is so you know it's just a little kind of like OK okay whatever\nWell um we never really talked about politics until this past election and um and still during the primaries um you know I hadn't made my choice that I think most people you know they had made the choice and I was between crews and Trump and as she was more of a Bernie Sanders\nShe was all about Bernie Sanders and um but she was happy with Hillary and so as it got closer and closer when I actually started leaning orders trial\nWe we started getting serious serious debates you know and then I'm In June my son my youngest son was graduating and she was supposed to come out to the graduation and um\nMy son and her just had a tremendous tremendous uh a relationship and um\nTwo weeks prior to the um to the graduation we had a conversation on the phone or like a you know what when you get here when I got talking about politics and this is about politics about my son graduation and um and then the week before the graduation she called\nAnd she said because I'm a Trump supporter she can't come to my house\nAnd we have not spoken since that day and I I've reached out or a couple of top and a couple of times you know China is a a a relationship with my nephew doing nothing meant nothing\nFeel so sorry few I I you know it just breaks my heart and and you have to wonder what what about your son I mean she didn't seem to care about that either the the fact that you get poor Trump was enough to break a ball the relationship\nBetween a brother or sister in your chair so much over those years\nIt is incredible what's going on out there and I I just uh you know ... cliche but it is hard to even hear the story\nDo don't give up maybe someday she'll come around she obviously got an ... billion socialism in Europe and what's going on there if you ask most of your opinions I don't think many of them be happy with what's going on I don't know what she saw a but uh it's it's depressing hang in there my friend okay it'll it'll come around sometimes\nJust hang in there um I was just thinking of a you know people are funny that way I worked at a at a station ... in uh Los Angeles as I said I don't want to say too much about it except one of the whole was had a\n... have this a gal on whose father was a famous I don't want to see what he did to put it in it was pretty famous at us in this day\nAnd they didn't talk for a hundred and Twenty years or something and then um one day a host said to me you know mark a\nHer father died and she didn't even know it and I had to tell her the news and she said a whole wow I never got a chance to say goodbye so they hadn't talked to her I think it was at least Twenty years and you think that\nFinally when he passed on but it was too late to say goodbye to him\nBecause she disowned him all those years before it ever personal reasons so one has to think that eventually hope people come around before something serious happens and I always tell my students you can never tell someone you love enough that you love them because life is very short but when you hear the family stories a brother and sister daughter\nWhenever that because of politics they disown their parent or their brother who they know their whole life assuming there's nothing terrible going on in the relationship just over politics and you see that almost always on the on the left hand side\nVery discouraging but are brought up the topic because it does happen it is something that needs to be talked about like let's go to Amanda in Woodbridge, Virginia you're on with mark\nMark it's great to talk to you I'm I'm a Republican and conservative my whole life and I wanted to the military right after high school and um\nIt most of the people um that lead in the military worth which are because they felt like the Republicans were the only one that would ever support\nA raise for you know the military pay as I kind of you know just that okay well that's there for me that I'm for them\nUm and then as time went on um when I'm\nThe first are you\nOh go walk him about um I just remember you know listening to the radio and and just being like I Need to find someone that talking about this 'cause\nAt the time I was driving a lot and and the spending a lot of time in the car and he just wanted to listen and you know I've found conservative radio and\nYou know I haven't really talked about it with other people until people started asking me who you're going to vote for oh why are you voting for them and it was like people started coming to me and pulling an addict me I wasn't I was pushing anything on them\nAnd um when it came down to trumpet with like for a lot of people around me it was the straw that broke the camel's back and they just walked away from their friends and relatives just stop paying my friend and I\nAnd they just how can you you know I used for somebody who's just you know terrible and I'm just like\nYou're not going to stand I getting mad at Republicans for Twenty years for letting the media and the and the Democrats walk all over I mean this guy won't let anyone walk all over him\nAnd he still conservative saying things like our country better and you know I I still see people rallied against\nHim and I'm just like wait a minute we're the greatest economy in the in the country's ever seen you know we have I mean you see jobs for truck drivers ... feet five thousand dollar bonuses for someone to start that job you know I mean\nMark how ya doing [noise] ah I'm Seventy six years old I have some lifelong friends from college or we when we've gone through a lot together\nUh [noise] I was a godfather to one of their shows and I was best man up their wedding or the girl's been like a sister to me like family and I called recently that check can because she's going through about ... rats cancer\nAnd then or a ... and in fact they were at the doctor's office at that time and her husband is for me she said that on the less Irene now Donald Trump\nAn would no longer speak to me and one thing they were outraged about was that I guess Donald Trump said that\nThis Don Lemon character I'd never even seen him a is eight and ... and uh she said they said that's very insulting to call a black person what most people I Know why you know most black people are ignorant in fact this drawing the line with anyway\nI have a two other lifelong friends are very liberal\nOr over the years they've always known that I lean to the right I mean that's a former marine and they kind of expect it out of me but they're like family we're we don't discuss politics much but I really love getting in touch with them or you know they live in different cities all these people [noise] but anyway [laughter]\nI thought well maybe if I could get my true friends still ... we'll talk radio maybe they kinda get readjusted you know but uh I wasn't really hurt but I just kind of amazed\n[noise] well for everything I'm hearing none of it surprises me you know what you ought to do you want to make a deal with them that are you tell them the listener read our radio or whatever you choose and then you'll listen to some of their stuff for you know read a book that you believe in that might influence them and they can do the same to you try to open it up\nWhen I I ... yeah but they they said was that renounced Donald Trump they don't [laughter] I might get in you know all of them [laughter]\nI I just even love the term unless you've written now talk Trump [noise] I don't know what does that make me think of ... or announced year are you know I actually have an extra ... or something you you got her and renounce denounce everything to do with Donald Trump wow this stuff is just\nBeyond the pale and so the question is I don't know if I'm right why do they hate him so much it's not us policies because many of them would agree that the country's doing better if they if you're one of the statistics of the numbers the lowest level a plaque unemployment\nOr the same thing with a you know Hispanics women are doing pretty well but if you talk about the salary increases wage increases highest than they've been in years ah unemployment rate for everybody's very low wage jobs you can't even fill jobs there are so many jobs available now into his economy\nAre and you just go out one thing after another so they can't look at facts it's gotta be emotion I think the guy he just up a phone or any doesn't have his own policy with some of the

Mexico and elsewhere just because they could walk in doesn't give them any more right to stay here than people who may be waiting ten years to get into the country\n[laughter] exactly yeah and that's you know again again going back to your initial question we support legal immigration we obviously support people coming through the legal channel mock coming here illegally but we also support controls the legal immigration system you know you go back a few books were out America's history we had the great wave at the end of a\nAn of a Nineteen century the turn of the century but really that was a different time I mean when you go back to look at that America was rapidly expanding we were moving westward we were in the middle of a ... or building\nBuilding roads and and and uh you know railroad tracks and the country was just expanding so quickly I think the ... but I saw was that GDP was doubling basically every three years in the United states um but we were bringing people in at a rate of about nine hundred thousand to a million per year\nOver the last Fifteen to Twenty years we've been bringing people in that roughly the same rate even a little bit higher this past year fiscal you're twenty Seventeen we bought in one point when ... bought her a ... not expanding as quickly as it was during the great wave but if you go back and you look at the time\nBetween the end of World War two and and really Nineteen Ninety is wanted all change or you look at that time period and that's the time or the country built the strongest\nMost stable middle class that that the world has ever seen before and the average immigration rate during that time period was about three hundred and fifty thousand so again\nWe'd like to reduce illegal immigration from its current level of about one point one million down to you know at least five hundred thousand it and and and just see\nYou know what kind of an impact on our on our economy we believe that without a positive impact not just on our economy wages we think it's the wages go up here in the United\nStates I mean it's amazing the unions and the left the don't support you in that aspect of at least what do you think of people like Ann Coulter suggest we should take a pause in legal immigration to get this thing fix than straightened out\nThere are there have been a lot of suggestions like that throughout\nThroughout the years and it's in the early Nineteen nineties I said it all changed around Nineteen Ninety there was the immigration act like Ninety that really exploded legal immigration to the point that we're at now and in the early nineties when we saw the ramping up of legal immigration sauce go from bringing in roughly\nFour or five hundred thousand people are here during the\n... the Nineteen eighties to more than a million per year in the early nineties there you do as a representative at the time before he moved over to the Senate became Senate majority leader he actually introduced a bill that calls for an immigration or you know he actually said Democrats\nCalling for more tournaments on immigration to we actually as an organization called for an immigration oratory him back in two thousand nine when the stock market crashed\nAnd and we have the huge jobs crisis millions and millions of people losing their jobs every month or so we didn't think it was wise policy ... printing in more than a hundred and fifty thousand you foreign workers every single month went when a million Americans for job get him off that just makes sense to us so we called for one back that\nNow under current circumstances\nYou know the economy's doing pretty well we're creating stronger number of jobs about a hundred and fifty thousand jobs per\nMonth but again if we're bringing more than a hundred and fifty thousand you foreign workers every single month for still bringing in more foreign workers and the economy is great for jobs\nSo I don't think we need a fault tore him but again I think I think if we made some changes like like what runners caught and David courteous suggested in the White House has mentioned energy and Microsoft and and the visa lottery that would at least reduce legal immigration by about\nThree to four hundred thousand I think that would have a huge impact I don't know for necessarily at a point where we need a full large tar am but certainly I think if you side Ghana and other jobs crisis like we had about ten years ago and that that a moratorium should be considered\nIt is interesting theory talking about Harry Reid the changing but he wasn't the only one Hillary whoever you want to mention and the American public needs to hear this maybe some of your your decision or other political leaders that these guys are all on the other side they did you do with the wind when it benefits them politically or power was\nYeah and in fact that the immigration act of Nineteen Ninety part of that ... that there was a lot of concern that it would have the actual impact that it did and not that's exploding legal immigration up to one point want more than one million illegal immigrants per year so one of the things that they they\nAdded into legislation was that after a few years there will be a bipartisan congressional commission that would review the impacts on the legislation and make recommendations based on what was happening after passage of a law so that led to Bill Clinton is\nObviously a Democrat created this bipartisan commission of the Nineteen nineties any assigned Barbara Jordan the former ... and nobody would accused Barbara Jordan ...\nAnd her democratic regret credentials as the chairwoman of about bipartisan congressional commission and the Jordan commission recommended or what what we\nWe advocate for today is it called for ending chain migration and ending the visa lottery or reducing legal immigration to their recommendation was to reduce it down to about five hundred and fifty thousand\nWhich at that time the current level was about a million which is around where it's at today so so there was bipartisan support for this but you had a huge push over the years especially in the early years in the in the mid to late nineties you had a huge\nPush from big business U.S Chamber of commerce groups like that\nThat that always want more workers because they look at it as as as a a a\nSupply and demand issue if you have a large pool of labor than you can keep wages lower it's just simple again price supply and demand type type very um so you have the big business groups pushing for more immigration and in the mid to late Nineteen nineties\nBut then you start to see more of a special interest groups the immigration attorneys um some of the some of the um\n[noise] some of the more ethnic based groups after that to ... start to get a ... a large interest in legal immigration naturally when you started to see a shift in the Democratic party\nWell so that you know I ... during the week I've been mentioning so you had the conspiracy not a conspiracy but then there's mutual coming together adventurous the Democrats want more votes they see the power Republicans calling the country club Republicans like the wall Street Journal I told my listeners they start the title of the editorial it would say\nA talk of as if they're going to talk about illegal immigration and somewhere in the middle aged which on me and talk about how great immigrant and swear and I thought OK you guys to see into my subscription if you're going to play with language the same way\nBut Barbara Jordan was an example of the old line Democrat right where they did things what they thought was the best of the country not a power at any cost\nBut we have Chris ... from numbers usa you can tell from the ways responding my questions he really is an expert on this and he questions you have about the history of what's going on now and I'm going to ask them because the relevant thing in the news right now all these refugees that would be refugees are asking for political asylum coming from Honduras\nI think that's time for the election will ask him what he thinks about that and what we

[noise] and my special\nGuest is a Christian Malinowski from numbers usa he's the deputy director I'm about to hit my first caller but how did you get involved what made you get involved in the organization I never asked you that\n[laughter] well it was ... when I first came to the organization a hike came uh mainly to use some that I was a website content manager so I came out to run on the Web sites and really didn't get involved in in a policy and or or even\nEven the leadership I'm like I Am out but [noise] but once you once you get involved in the immigration issue and you get interested in and and\nAnd you see the impact that was that again large scale bounce emigration on to an illegal immigration are having the United states it it it's hard not to get hooked on it so I just stuck with it and and have been working on it ever since\nYeah and I like to John Lennon coat life is what happens do when you're busy making other plans [laughter] it's funny how you All right ... Albert in Lakewood, California you're on with mark and with Chris\nYes hello yes we're here okay how can a\nMark I wanted to get up above the refugee problem I Want to get tough with you and they wanted to ask you why should why should we be responsible for another country's problems with each other\nWith a refugee Haywood gangs and drugs and they and they want to come up here and uh some of them are ... stories are made up they make up stories this year there be\nBeing called ... a refugee why why is it our problem ... theory but you're you're you're at you're okay\nSure but I'm going to the being lucky enough to have Chris here although I my simple answer is we shouldn't be but let's see what Chris says the same numbers usa [noise]\nRight right you know in the last segment we were talking about pets\nThat if if you if you asked everybody in the world who wants to ... who wants to come in the United states that number would probably be about three to four billion um there there's no way we can take in the world's poor it's it's it's just not going to happen so you know deal to allow the lucky few and those countries to get out to comment or\nDo you do what's better for everybody and and and to try to help those countries out there people in their home countries so it's it's the second option that we support so um\nIt you know we don't think we can solve the world's problems by\nBy just allowing everybody to come to the United states uh so yeah my my answer would be let's help them there instead it's\nIt's a lot more effective and it's a lot more cheap and I think it's a lot more beneficial for all of us now for ... the caravan that's heading our way of they can only be a sigh lease refugees um they would be\nThey would actually be considered a ... if they actually the United states and then claim asylum so\nThey can only claim asylum if they actually get\nInto the United states so you know my first\nMy first advice if I could it buys the tropics history she would be don't let them in the country if they can't get in the country then they can't claim asylum so do whatever you can I think I think the actions so far to the administration has taken by by\nA pleading wave by threatening foreign aid for Honduras Guatemala El Salvador Mexico and say hey we're not going to give you your foreign aid if you allow this caravan just to come on obstructed up to\nThe United states I'm an inch and it looks like it hasn't worked to too much with the Central American countries but Mexico is at least giving me appearance\nThat that they're going to try to stop this caravan from from reaching the U.S Mexico border um that they're taking it fairly seriously at least they're giving an impression that they're taking it very strict barely seriously so off to see what actually happens when they when they reach Mexico's southern border and want to gain entry into Iraq into Mexico\nTo get up to the United states but again that the caller was absolutely right what they're going to try to do is they're going to try to game our asylum system once they get here they're either going to try to\nGet in illegally undetected or they're going to come through a um a portrait\nTree and claim asylum or when they if they do try to come in illegally undetected but get detected and apprehended by border patrol then they'll entered their asylum played by defensive asylum place but again they can't enter an asylum plea unless they get into the United states so my recommendation is\nKeep 'em outside of the United states see if Mexico will allow us to move our asylum educators and say okay if you seriously want to be ... or ... as ... here in the United states than what we'll do is we'll send our asylum educators to you\nWill hear your case and then we'll only allow you into the United states if you pass through the initial test which is a credible fear test but I think\nThat I mean again ... you won't want to do when we both agree wait a second it's mark how are you want to re button when we both agreed with you [laughter]\n... yeah yeah I'm well here's your here's here's my problem we got it wrong here you know third call they're called ... they're called homeless we got sixty thousand people in in California under sneak their their bedroom and there are women children\n... and ... ... ... why ... why are we to churn with the other people's problems when we got her if you can't you can't take care of the Iraqis are homeless refugees here that's my point I'm going to bring out here in Philly they take care of that\nI say let the government and the ... of the of the or the or where they came from the government here who I Am\nIn the responsible is like we should try to take care of our homeless man\nAnd and and women and children do you see what I'm saying\nOh I'm so I'll leave that I'm going to let Chris and we do follow you can go ahead ... ...\nYeah no no I couldn't agree with you more ... and that's the reason why we take the position that we take on immigration or we want to reduce legal immigration levels as well because\nWe have our own issues here in the United states that that we need to take care of now when we're dealing with foreign aid and what what what money do we give to other countries to think there's a there's\nA number of different things that we could do like the first that plays a little bit more into a while for a policy type all so there are strategic reasons why we provide foreign aid to some of these countries that we\nWe provide we've provided to I think just as as as the world leader you know the United states is the biggest strongest nation on earth we do have to take a little bit of responsibility to make sure that there is you know that\nThat that there are human rights violations and governments are not pressing their people things like that around the world and uh we've we've always done that throughout our at\nYou know throughout our two hundred year or two hundred and fifty year history [noise] um so when it comes to that but I think there are also other things that the government to do I think the government can encourage business to go down at a fast and some of these countries maybe give them some sort of a tax break for investing in some of these more needy countries\nIn helping to rebuild those countries so there are other ways besides just foreign aid\nBut but I think going back to your original point couldn't agree with you more I think that's why we can't take", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "year": "2018", "city":
