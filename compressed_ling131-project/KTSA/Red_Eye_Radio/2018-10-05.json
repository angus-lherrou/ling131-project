time for the vote so that tells us is probably going to be a late Saturday Night but\nYou know I I I think about all the and I'm sitting here just contemplating and thinking of all the\nAll the protests the violence the civil disobedience when certain things you know a a when Trump was elected to you know the the women's march show all all of these things that go on\nAnd if you look over the last eight years and the number of protest remember Occupy Wall street ... you know all all that that that the that went on all the the the occupying of city properties and everything else that went on what you're seeing now\nAnd you have a party that constantly does that you have another party that really doesn't do that at All right you see now the getting into the faces of people which can be\nQuite intimidating but here's the question is it effective for them right has it been effective in and you go all the way back like I said we go let's go back to the Obama administration\nI mean you can look at you can look at the uh you can look at the uh the Tea Party but the Tea Party was completely and totally non non violent did not know know riots no tear gas nothing like that in ... so you look at it and you get into the Occupy Wall Street right right where you're actually trespassing\nAnd you know taking over and wanting to camp out and you know there were riots in certain cities that that happened\nWhen the police tried to push them off but at this is almost the exclusive domain of the left and therefore the Democrats sure yeah and you think about the run that they have had since all of this\nYou know really I'll I'll look at Occupy Wall street as just the beginning of of this portion of it has it been effective for them when it comes to the vote do people actually respond to it or do they believe that the intimidation\nTactics\nWill actually work and change for example they're not you know you you you could see\nIf they might be a you know threatening a just a a you know the the senators that are on you know a lot of you know on the edge right now right okay on the margins but they're not they're going after everybody ... whether it's Grassley\nDoesn't care what their McConnell what do they really think that that's affected or is it the fact that when you are just so full of rage\nBecause that's what it is it's just insane\nRage that they're filled with right just anger and ... and and rage isn't just a desperation tactic or do they actually believe that it is effective I just I I really wonder and [laughter] and I was thinking to myself here before I started talking about this\nI'd love to sit down and talk with them all that wouldn't be possible [laughter]\nSo I'm never going to find out because I'm not going to be able to sit down and say you don't tell us what's your strategy is that right well I I I think after\nThe flights a thing I think they feel empowered to some extent they feel that it is effective to some extent but I think it's probably a ... a lot of I was gonna say little of both I think it's a lot of both actually that they believe\nAfter confronting mansion and after you know the behavior in restaurants and everything else and shaming people out of restaurants I mean think about that Gary that youre not protesters in a restaurant\nYou work there it's your job and you refuse in one case to do it\nBecause Sarah Huckabee Sanders is eating the food you're going to prepare and serve can you imagine that can you imagine being in that mentality\nNo\nIf I worked in a restaurant I don't care what I was doing in that restaurant\nAnd bar rock Obama and his family came in\nThe last thing that I Would do is refused to do my job\nMe not doing my job is not going to change his politics or change anything that I disagreed with that he did\nAnd that's the mentality but that's where they that's where they live but we go back to the one restaurant where you had a man\nHappened to be African American wearing a make America great again hat\nAnd the staff was shaming him at a stable to the point that his companion I don't know if it was his girlfriend or his wife was in tears\nAnd they kept it up they kept it up they kept it up I Can't imagine\nI cannot imagine I wouldn't be able to face my friends and family if I did something\nSo despicable\nJust shameful just shameful if you want to talk about getting a picket going out on the steps the SCOTUS as long as you're not trespassing are breaking the law I encourage that I don't care what you believe I don't care what you're promoting are protesting for or against\nAnd I remember it was about you know we've talked about it before is probably about seven years ago when um and and you know the person that I'm Talking about ...\nAnd it was really a somebody who I considered it a casual friend ... you know ... do the more professional eating and and uh they were in a conversation and it was a ... a black man who was a huge fan of my show\nNow I sort of knew her politics were more of\nThe liberal bent but she went absolutely insane we know we haven't talked since that point and she completely rejected me as a friend because in a conversation a black man said he loved our show right\nThink about that and that was really my first taste of that type of sanity\nBecause that person you refer to as you described it before I went\nFrom zero to you know basically right or just just a small talk we do have good to see a a thanks for stopping by that kind of thing to all of a sudden over the top rage right we could not believe that somebody of color\nWould be listening to and more so be a fan of the ... right\n\nAnd you remember when it happened and I asked like I've sort of like laughing I was like well I I Can't ... this was it was so bizarre and so insane but maybe that was the early warning system for me it right on a personal level on on a personal most impressed right on our understanding that that and and that's exactly what we're\nWe're we're facing because the rage and bitterness I Believe is probably still there today in this person yeah I have is just I I Can't imagine that kind of mindset I have\nFriends that I still a love dearly that listen to our show and I've known them since grade school\nAnd we still connect on a few times a week on Facebook\nBut we see each other on a regular basis and everything else we love each other we tease each other about the politics and there was no way that either of us none of us would ever draw that line and say well you can't be my friend I Can't there's no way we can have the debate just like family\nBut not for the far left not for many\nBut I'm not far let it wasn't even what I said it was at a black man like yeah we talked and the person that was a little bit

broadens it out beyond the El Paso district where he serves look he's he's the king of El Paso no doubt politically\nUm\nThe well outside of the the cartels that are operating in with all due respect to the cartels [laughter]\nUm the the whole idea though is that you've got to broaden it beyond the El Paso district right I mean he can win the Paso district as long as he wants to run for that house seat um and I have friends there that say oh man he's got his hands and everything you\nYou know so um yeah uh that's different though when you broadened it out to the rest of Texas now certainly he's done better than um a lot of the people who jumped into different races\nOr the former ah Dallas County sheriff Lupe Lupe Valdez uh and uh you know her running against ah the the current Governor Greg Abbott um that's you know again\nHe's he's very well in the lead but well when you broaden it out to the state right level you've gotta go wild you've got to realize that you you have to pretend you're in the middle well\nThen and that's a bit of Russia's trying to do is try and do you try to picture himself and he's not in the middle on anything no but he he realizes that he has to lie even to get demos he can't be truthful even with Democrats in taxes and hope to get elected and yet the realization I mean the Democrats used to be that way all the time they used to\nWe need to move to the middle we need to move to the middle we got to move to the middle we've got to move to the middle\nAnd and then over the last ten years or so no they were going to basically this is where we are I

October remember he held it would've been you know would have been the convention\nWhere you have to invest\nIn ... when he was at the stadium the football stadium in in in Denver and they had like ... it looked like he was a you know the the the entire\nStage it was set up Wendy's Ehlers mhm and everything else where he look quite like some Greek forum yes yes ... and ... and people going crazy and and remember and his first term Evan Thomas from Newsweek at the time he's God blight yeah\nHe's he's a ... you'd always post partisan he's God like heath hovers over the rest of us he's the

wants the liberal basically the liberals to are you guys stay outside of Texas\nLook we've got our liberal places in in Texas now there are plenty of the districts that are blue and counties that are blue including the county we broadcast\nFrom yeah but but here the the point is though the point is not who he would have gotten in addition if he would have got Obama ... but the fact is he knew he could reject Obama publicly yet\nBut then the signs of an ongoing ideas into us core yeah doesn't care yeah Obama means nothing to know any\nI Know that's that's exactly what I'm what I'm getting too

the allegations supported by any other evidence anybody else who has been sexually abused we have tremendous compassion and sympathy for them\nBut they have no credit no more credibility speaking on this particular issue on this particular case than anybody else in our justice system the\nOnly thing that matters is evidence and and our justice system which is the criminal justice system it's also the civil justice system it's also on the political justice system the presumption of innocence and the presentation of evidence to back up an allegation\n\nIs required and there's a responsibility I Believe of every American to ensure that that is the way that the process is held up whether it's in the arena political ideas that may not be the criminal justice system\nBut it's the same responsibility that people have not to defame other people's character for their own immediate political wants and the\nThe some of the arguments that you've heard what one of the younger ones that I thought was the beauty well are they um they they started with the Merrick Garland or because they they they they would nominate him so Republicans got what they deserved yeah excuse me\nThis is something that has been talked about for a long time Chuck Schumer brought it up back when in two thousand nine ...\nWhen he said in an election year no and and Bush or should be was a Bush no\nWas it was before two thousand nine or because it was it had to be during Bush is it'd be during the Bush was before two thousand nine but Schumer brought it up a during the Bush administration went and just just a ... in case one of the Supreme Court justices died said we should not be the the policy of the Senate\nTo nominate a a Supreme Court justice during a presidential election year right by the way the stink wasn't as big it was for a little bit and then people realize oh Hillary is going to kill Trump so we don't have to worry about it we'll just get it afterwards but delaying a nomination\nThat has been an idea\nThat both Democrats and Republicans have been promoted for a couple of months to allow the next president who all the polls and all the Democrats thought would be Hillary Clinton is not the same as the famed mean a person's\nCharacter by calling them calling that\nOr send a gang rapist\nA sexual assault tour without any evidence besides an allegation which the witnesses that the people that brought those allegations about their witnesses could not cooperated\nAnd in the case of Dr Ford who claimed she has the evidence that would cooperate it she refuses to give it to the body that would make that decision which is the Senate Judiciary committee\n\nSo to make that case I mean that's probably the strongest argument which is a weak argument that I've heard was\nWell since I held the darling murder Carlin's will they deserved it what do you mean that was done through the majority leader stadium nope we've got the majority\nMhm but ah we'll\nHold it even if we have the majority after the next president does elect bright irrespective of whether it's a Democrat or Republican that's the same as defame ing and destroying somebody's life right with allegations that are not provable\nI didn't see any attacks on Merrick Garland none\nAnd so everything that you know ... every allegation that has been\nBrought up is suspect mhm uh\nBecause the witnesses that they brought forward could not cooperate it right the things that they said changed that the the the alleged victims claim changed as we went along\nAnd that's what we go by in our system whether it's the political whether it's political justice whether it's civil justice or whether it's criminal justice the presumption a vivid evidence and the fact that an allegation and stop and think about it the protesters right now that you saw yesterday and you're going to see all day again today\nThat may get arrested again today and there may be you know ... thousand more who knows they're saying believe the survivors which means you always believe the accuser will do they believe that no we all know they don't know we all know that sort of August arguments you believe the accuser if they're on our political side\nThis is the social media or approach now to ah to activists or activism there it's exactly what you see on social media we don't we talk about the fact that real people don't live their lives like you know people uh act on social media\nWe talk about that a lot well the people who are activists far\nLeft trolls and celebrities do\nThey live in a virtual world will celebrities live in a virtual world that's what they do for a living anyway\nThere immersed in it I mean it it is not for them that's nothing different you just live the fantasy and the family fantasy is whatever it is whatever whatever you say it is because you have a blank canvass\nThat's exactly how they think that's how they act what you're seeing here is social social media type activism taken to the streets\nThat\nDoesn't have to be backed up by anything I posted it therefore it's real I say it therefore it's true\nDoesn't work that way you know in the real world friday so overall when we look at the last two weeks and who knows what the vote will be this weekend I I I don't know I mean I haven't seen any a count yet um and I guess we we will see right and we will know when we come back in Sunday night Monday morning\nAll I Know it was for the last two weeks of covering this\nUh there's not been an issue where there's been more passion since the election but I have not seen this type of unity in the Republican Party and think about it think about what it would take I mean I\nI didn't think that you would see the unity in the Republican Party this soon and it's solid right now\nBecause I think they now see\nThat whatever their differences are with Donald Trump whatever ear or ... whatever irritate them about the the the president whatever they find unacceptable about the president and I'm Talking about the never Trump or is a lot of Republican conservative\nThey looked at it and they finally have come home why because they look them they've said these people are political opposition is in sane that things that we hold so dearly here in this country\nYou know what what really binds us the belief\nOf individual civil rights then you've seen the complete capitulation of the American civil liberties union as as Tucker Carlson called them you're just a hack organization now have gotten that they don't care about civil liberties anymore finally the realization\nTo Republicans across the board that you have a party that doesn't any more give a damn about the civil rights of Americans they don't care that's the message\nThat has been sent to Republicans and that's why you have the type of unity that you have here as we go into the vote and as you've seen really come together over the last\nTwo weeks it's been quick yeah yeah very quick yeah all your calls and comments coming up be liked and then we ... if you would like to go and we would love to hear from you got more audio touched a coming up eight six six Ninety ride I\nWait and

Second Amendment rights\nAre are gone due process rights don't matter anymore a presumption of innocence doesn't matter because of our politics know the old school liberal didn't believe in a bigger centralized government but they wanted they what they even with the big central government they still wanted especially\nThe bill of rights was sacred to them and and it no longer is but here's ... which talking about Cory Booker standing doesn't matter whether it's innocent or whether he's guilty\nIt's just so many allegations that he needs to step down here is a response\nDancing professor that that's a size that it doesn't matter whether it's ... just\n... well it sounds very familiar when I was in college that's what they said about people who are accused living communists yes as a matter of there and and the guilty if somebody is accused me of being a communist\nAnd you angrily responded and said you're not then hey you don't have the temperament to have a job\nAnd it's just a job interview if you're getting fired for being a professor after forty years and what's the difference if you're innocent or guilty somebody has said you're a communist this was all the way back to the inquisition when they would call you in first and make you testify and then they present\nThe evidence look once you're accused the most heinous crime imaginable it turns into a trial where you have due process here where the burden of proof is on the other side where the evidence has to be clear and convincing in America we don't allow people to destroy other people's reputations in careers\nBased on it in print some guilt the way the ACLU now says he ACLU says we should presumed guilt not presume in is that\nFor a hundred years defending due process it's exactly what they're saying so you are liberal you have lived her life in a liberal world Martha's Vineyard Keno liberals to them ever say look I don't agree with Kavanaugh hate prompts [noise] but\nI agree with you that it took us is worth preserving other liberals who feel that way\nI found very very few of them for example today seven hundred law professors a signed a letter they asked me to sign it I refused I wrote a dissent saying he now no longer has the judicial temperament well can you imagine if this were a liberal who had been appointed by liberal president who had been accused Norwood acted similarly\nI don't think a single one of those professors would have signed that letter they will fail the shoe on the other foot test\nSenator Booker why I like and no there's just dead wrong this is all about partisanship is the opposite\nWhat's happening and if it was the Democrats who are putting up candidate everybody would be having the opposite way and so it is partisanship and I think the premise of our constitution never intended the confirmation process to look anything like I have great\nYeah I ... and ... and that's it I mean we we talk about the process\nYou know it's it's telling that we're at this point and still at this point in fact heightened your you'll likely see the chaos heightened today and tomorrow\nUp until the main vote on so late Saturday or early Sunday Morning whenever it happens but we're at this point but it is all of this chaos\nBefore the actual vote and what is it that that matters it's only about the vote I mean this is further proof that this was only about the delay delay it as long as you can in hopes an outside hope I guess that Kavanaugh would pull his own confirmation\nAnd withdraw his own confirmation and or the president would do it um that wasn't going to happen or the once once the ... got loud that wasn't going to happen but this president and and now we know very clearly it certainly isn't going to happen by the nominee himself but\nYou look at this entire process and it has been distorted greatly there is no guarantee here that that Kavanaugh would will be confirmed with the actual legitimate process of all of this in place\nWell you know when you when you hear Dershowitz or talk about you know McCarthyism ... and and what happened at that time when\nYou know you someone who accuse you of being a communist and so you'd get enraged and they say well sorry you don't have the temperament the allegation itself meant you were blacklisted right the the the fact that you lost it at anything was used an a you know against you\nAre and I thought ... which you know really when he said he said so you've been a director forty years and now you're losing control because somebody's calling you commented on the temperament for the job so you're out your blacklisted from the the ... you know from the industry and\nIt's something that liberals used to have in their mind and I think the important thing is and it's obvious because you and I have\nThan having this discussion a back and forth because it is the left it is you know ...\nWe call it the supposed to be anti fascist yet what are they promote what is their actual mindset it's authoritarianism and its fascism it's a you must live the life that that that we that that we wish you to live\nAnd what you see here what you see here from the Democrats the mindset that they're promoting everybody that you see Michael Moore and Amy Schumer and whoever whatever Hollywood people are down there screaming and yelling about you know a Brett Brett Kavanaugh and believe\nThe accuser that the the the defendant has no rights at all the defendant is automatically guilty that is the mindset of a fascist\nYes that's not the mindset", "show_name":
