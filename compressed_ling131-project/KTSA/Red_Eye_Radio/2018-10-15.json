leaving your home\nWell not long ago at thirty nine year old entrepreneur from a billionaire family spent twenty million dollars in three years to find the best home based business in North America he researched Seventy different companies and when he found the only one that had a real long term potential he bought it\nAnd right now he's looking for people to help him turn this company into his next billion dollar success story so if you're serious about making money from home without having to leave your home will grab a pen because I'm about to give you the address of a website where you can learn all about this unique in rare opportunity\nWrite this down WWW dot go here next dot com\nNow get on your computer and go to this site now part time or fulltime your income is based totally on your performance interested\nGo here next dot com and say goodbye to your boss tomorrow go here next dot com\nAnd he admitted that was part of the reason he was for an additional FBI investigation Jeff Flake is a fool this delayed did not unite the country as he suggested or placate the Democrats it further divided us\nThis was all a show to delay the process so they can get in power Lindsey Graham had it just right\nThis is all about power and I could take it more easily if they just said what they felt hey we just wanted to let you guys because we want to get in power and then you can't have the Supreme Court judge or what I Wish they would it be honest about that\nBut there are a bunch of phony Hippocratic hypocritical leftists they discussed me tell me what you're thinking eight six six Ninety red eye but it's worse than that because we have now taken away one of our most basic rights\nThe presumption of innocence you can charge anyone I said this before with any crime you want and you don't even need to have proper ending evidence it doesn't matter if they're innocent you can still ruining their lives and there are no consequences for the cues this important\nBecause you have to prove they did it with mouse if they didn't intentionally do it then they get away with this do you remember I don't know if you remember this Reagan sector of labor I think it was secretary Donovan that's the name that comes to me\nHe was asked after it was found innocent after he was accused of I don't even remember what it was they said something like what are you going to do next and he said something like\nWhere do I go to get my reputation back\nAnd some like Feinstein senator finds have the nerve to question Kevin O's belligerence and demeanor at the hearings what was he supposed to do send in Feinstein after you've helped destroy his life act ever so serene as you ruined his life I wouldn't have\nI Would have let them it wears his bank account for all the good work he has done for all these years later\nHow did Bill Clinton stay is president after what he did with the complicity of use Senator Feinstein and others in the Senate those hearings were not a good week for America and I wanted to know what you think because it relates to my whole point about civil war\nI Want to know what you think eight six six nine to read I\nMatched with Christine for I'm getting a chance you guys can hear me I was on another show a few weeks ago so I'm getting this off my chest the second time I'm very fortunate I Do I think she was attacked yes she appears credible in that regard the judge Kavanaugh commit that attack I doubt very much\nEspecially since no one could corroborate her story I when I say I think she was attacked I don't know exactly what happened\nAnd whether some of this could have been in her imagination because there are a lot of inconsistencies in our story she doesn't she got there how she got home one that was exactly why she didn't tell others at the party or anyone else for decades after that\nSo now as I said we've reached the stage where all you need are allegations so what's to prevent hundreds of people from now on making accusations and stalling every nomination they don't want\nAnd ruining everybody's reputation in the process\nNow there's going to be no way to get off this merry go round just accused accused and accuse\nIt's a new Democrats strategy that has not worked\nThanks to Senator Flake and Murkowski flake at least vote afford\n[noise] but Murkowski didn't I think she I think there's some movement or recall her and she needs to be recalled\nThe rest of those fools who allow this process to take place look by the way that sleazy lawyer what his client claimed about Kevin [noise] same can be yours with a flick of your cell phone\nDo the Democrats as I said last hour understand where all of this is going\nDo you remember Harry Reid starting the nuclear option with the judges and now we can just do a fifty fifty one\nAnd yet the reaction did you hear the reaction of the righteous\nSenator Feinstein as a quote it showed him to be aggressive in bowling here's what Joe Biden said he witnessed a degree of invective blind rage and Bruce partisanship that threatens not only the Senate and the Supreme Court it threatens the basic faith in fairness and justice that binds this country together\nIs he getting that's a Democrat play book and Mitt Romney or another genius I mean I was a delegate for them by the way I've got to make and full disclosure he announced the support the decision to wait a week another example\nWhy he lost he doesn't know how to fight these people and that's a point do you have to know how to fight them I was going to ask you your least favorite person that you watch during that week and perhaps senator Mazie her on her own or however you say your name my top your list especially after comments that men should just shut up\nShe and she by the way a week or so ago she was asked if she was confident Democrats didn't strategically leak Christine forms accusations against capita just days before a committee vote\nI think it was here's a quote are confident the Democrats didn't leak that letter and how to respond to senator Graham's charge that it was inappropriate for the Democrats to refer to a doctor for a referred to a lawyer hosts George Stephanopoulos asked her own on ABC's This week\nAnd what a chance of she spelled spotted all of these things called do not focused on what we should be focusing which has the credibility of judge Kavanaugh she responded before calling Kevin O's claim some political conspiracy against them bizarre\nShe didn't answer and stuff like that to me and her and she goes on and by the way even as all of these accusations about this being politically motivated or being tossed around everyone acknowledges including judge Kavanaugh that Dr Ford is not being politically motivated\nBy the way she her own has suggested Kevin I did not deserve did you catch this he did not deserve due process because of his outcomes driven conservative legal philosophy that is very clear to get it if you're on the right\nYou don't deserve the process of being a a a proven guilty just the accusation is not\nSo she may not have been politically motivated afford what you used her you and your masters in deception used her\nThis is all just crazy and I I Love with Graham said he's going to get to the bottom of its suggesting that someone then find science officer one affords attorneys may have been responsible for strategically delaying the leak deploying the link to harm Kavanaugh's chances\nAre it's just amazing as he said those actually Senator Hatch so this the goalpost moving never stops\nAnd here's my summation then we'll take your calls the only force is the way you and your cronies conducted the circus\nAnd maybe the ... to cross the ACLU the American civil liberties union yeah right they chimed in because they too are left to screw up before they our civil liberties group and so they came out against this nomination and I quote\nThe ... board of directors deeply concerned by the allegations raised in recent weeks has made a rare exception to his longstanding policy and voted to oppose the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh they passed a resolution stating they pose the confirmation of judge Kevin of the Supreme Court there aren't credible allegations\nThis is the ACLU allegations that judge Kevin O's engage the serious misconduct you mean like Bill Clinton did you say anything then that have not been adequately investigated by the Senate\nWhat would it be advocates adequate seven FBI checks eight nine what does it Dr forge credible testimony subsequent allegations of sexual misconduct\nYou mean the great thing that even the times wouldn't publish the inadequate investigation maybe they can investigate better and judge Kavanaugh's testament to the leaders of the doubt about it is a fitness to serve as an associate justice of the Supreme Court\nAnd this is not a decision take lightly we cannot remain silent on these extraordinary circumstances about a lifetime appointment to the hardest core to the land and try to shorten it the standards for such an appointment and the burden is on the nominee the burden on the nominee to prove that something that happened how exactly does one do that\nThe burden is not met as long as they're unresolved questions regarding the credible allegations of sexual assaults assault get it on resolved allegations so if they can never resolve it which they can't because there is no cooperation then voila you've never be confirmed\nAnd it it goes on and on I I don't want to make your two depressed but there does again based on allegations I Want to know I just want to know where in the past the ACLU wanted someone convicted because of allegations\nBut this is what the Democrats and the left have no soul there was no place to go with all of this except down on the other and the loss of a piece of America\nTelling me what you think of all of this application of the selection of innocence and self righteousness of those on the left and the fool's on our side and if you agree with me that we're about or in the middle of a second civil war\nEight six six Ninety red eye or the same number

and he's never been in trouble he's in orange county\nA you know typically the president's party loses the the the party that President empower loop they lose seats\nI think it'd be very close and maybe we'll get lucky and we won't lose the house but I'm really afraid of that happening there's not like we're the poll showed that\nYou know that a Trump was gonna win any one it so it's it's possible but that's what I'm saying time in the event of a lot of people going out and then they don't expect to go out because the Democrats motivate they hate President Trump\nThey hated Kavanaugh they want no part of this\nAnd they're coming out in droves I think and so we have to match that kind of a passion so I'm not really answering a dimension\nThe day in the mood I I tend to be optimistic but uh let's see if you ask me to vote today I'll I'll do my optimism saying we'll just barely hold on and that's what I'd like to see happen but you can let me know what you think and

before I was a talk show hosts\nSo I Know what it's like and in fact I never told this I think I call the talk shows ... uh once and I was nervous that was tough in our two and a till you get on you to know when you were going to be on to those doing very well let's go to Mike in ... California Mike you're on with mark\nThanks for taking the call yeah thank you for taking the call you\nKnow I'm driving home and I I just got home and what I'm thinking is you know I'm not a lawyer but I think most people understand the statement I'm sure you do there is a letter of the law and then there's the spirit of the law and in both ... and\nWhat you have is what the law says and what's practice commonly in the course we all know and what\nThe law is supposed to create ads you know the way we look at the overall picture of any type of legal potential legal situation and what we basically are it seems to me pretty simple you got to minors\nA fresh from what I read said she was sixteen and he was Seventeen every time my buddies growing up\nGotten in trouble or my those relatives thank God acted parents kept me in line didn't gain too much trouble but you know they look at what miners do and they are still the record for they they they they do they call its budget they raise OK bottom line is\nThat a lot of that is considered a by the judges word games out there with players ... what track this this was this kid on and then what did they end up doing with their lives so is so is there a chain\nThere's no record of it she never claimed rape there's no physical evidence and so there's no physical wind was frost it brings in the law even as a lighter so there was nothing committed as a lighter that started record\nAnd he's a lighter but yet they race things minors to deter serious you know they they race one liners do in the area a burglary robbery fest all types of things\nAnd she never explained anything you know other than what she said but to me\nThere isn't it and it's clear they're both miners liquid he went on a Jew and accomplished and looked out hard he worked in his life and he he always show class he never got his friends or anybody to bring up her past\nSo you know maybe she has got a spotted Jagger that maybe she does it but he never talked about bringing anybody on or to talk about how she ... she hung out with\nI just think you know it it's very obvious what's happening which takes place and you know that's that's my comment there minors there's not enough to anywhere in this ah they're minors deal with everybody else does and the court system and the only way to the federal courts\nWhen it's minors involved what ... what do you do with what they do all the ... and by the way he had no record so that's like that's what I call it\n... el ...\nSure Mike ...\nThat's ... ... you brought up a lot of great points look\nWho does a new program that Obama certainly encourage the law was passed the where the Florida a shooter murder a man program where they didn't want to go on high school kids on the records of high school students even if they got in trouble which is one of the I think there was thirty five thirty six incidents I don't even remember\nWhere they would have found that he had a problem but there is a program to make sure that people can live their lives and not let you know something here or something there get in a way of them being successful\nRight he had nothing even this I suggested it who knows what really happened even if he was part of it in some way these high school kids as you were talking about these were minors and what about us thirty some odd years where is his bank account\nOf all the could stuffy did well it wasn't about that if you just look\nAs you said about the spirit of the law of the literature law\nHe really wasn't guilty of anything but it didn't matter what the Democrats were up to they were just trying to stall has to make sure he didn't get on the Supreme Court they have this feeling that maybe if they won the Senate which they're not going to do more you know they could make some difference and who the nominee was I don't think that's going to happen\nSo they were out to destroy him it didn't matter who\n... pressing Trump would've appointed they would have been out to get him that's why it's such a hypocritical monstrosity to watch this so such a bunch of ... there was Blumenthal I don't think I mentioned him tonight [noise] he said at one point to that a lie telling one lie could disqualify yet\nHe told lies about his service in in the military it's well known as you just want to talk about that is true and I never feel you're living on another planet\nAnd that way I watch what goes on but it wasn't really about the spirit of the letter of the law it was about ...\nAnd that's why the ... it was held for months or weeks whatever it was a you got to know what's going on and that's why they they don't care if they destroy your body it's all about power and Lindsey Graham at at the best it's all about winning and he says he's not cutting out the you know what\nA and these were his friends but no it's it's ... it's reached new lows that's wife knows just joining us I mentioned the first hour than we have a new civil war going on a with a soft civil war not\n... it's a it's it's really a fight for the soul of this country let me know what you think let's go to mark in Fort Joni California mark you're on with
