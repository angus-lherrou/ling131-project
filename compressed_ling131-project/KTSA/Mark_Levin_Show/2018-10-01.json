deeper investigation can't we all agree on that\nThat was eliminated when USA Today took down the one story deleted the tweet and put out a new story not in the regular sports section but in the opinionated sports section doesn't matter whether you asked a question\n\nIt's a hit piece what's you're trying to portray is that you suspect him as a pedophile\nAnd\nIt got me a little bit because I've writer for Thirty years I'd like I said no one when I was a teenager\n\nAnd I and I look at this and and I over the last year or so I Will admit that I could see in some of his personal post you know you could you could tell he didn't like Trump but that's okay I mean come on I got friends who do that I've Facebook friends who do that all the time we never ever got into a political conversation\nEver on Facebook right ah but I did see that you could tell that the you know that that it was in there it was in there somewhere but that's that's fine because people have their political opinions and I'm fine with that we've all got our family members and friends that disagree with some politics all the time\nAnd again I haven't seen or what it since we were teenagers so I I you know I don't know but like I said\nUm\nI always thought that he wrote with class this is completely classless article a it's a hit job it's unwarranted\nOr it is not up at all\nTo the sports journalistic standards but I knew from Arab Brady\nWhen\nHe started writing as a local writer and then went with USA Today probably for the first you know for for the last you know Thirty years this was just an absolute hippies and and what gets me angry about this Eric you know you and I've done talk radio for a long long time and sometimes we may get a little bit of overheated whatever but\nWe never really get we've never really gotten ourselves in any trouble referred to apologize for anything that we sat on the air you know we're management comes in you must apologized because the sponsors are all Bailey and that's because number one we don't think I you and I don't think in any kind of radical ways to begin with\nWe're not hateful people we don't hate anybody\nBut I've always said if somebody says on the radio and loses that for a little bit to me that's a little bit more understanding even if you tweet it out and it's just a sentence but white here what he did he wrote an\nArticle this was absolutely premeditated it was a premeditated job apparently because of the range that he feels of anything that's relating to Trump\nWell and this is you know the indicative of the ... the mentality of you on the left this is just one more in a long line of people that are now just throwing everything at the cabinet nominations\nBecause they have room to do and you know how you know is wrong and now he knows he's wrong\nBecause the editors or somebody got involved and said this goes to the opinion section you got to take out these sentences because these aren't fact based at all because he called it a credible accusation ... that's a political statement that is not a statement of fact\nNo and\nThe the the fact that the u._s._a. today had to delete the tweet oh and then he deleted his Facebook page completely he deleted for a reason\nBecause he knew the blowback that was coming why because what he wrote was an absolute it piece on a man where there is zero evidence except for the allegation that he's ever done anything wrong\nWell again they you know for them now the claim is reality\n\nAnd so this goes to not just a hippies but a hit piece on his family\n\nNot he's not capable of making unbiased decisions not we're against him because he might overturn roe v Wade\nNot anything else it\nWas a hit job directed toward his children it involves the activities of his children ... imagine had somebody done this with Brock Obama and his daughter or that person would be unemployed by now\n\nThat person would be done if they were especially if they were working for a major news organization like USA Today\nThat that would have been over\n\nAnd and but this is what the left sees as when this is what they see is acceptable tactics\nAnd it will continue now thanks to ... and it's not acceptable in their nose writer Erik ... doesn't care if I'm sure Eric breeding knows it just so somebody says to him to the conversation they don't think I'm referring to you [laughter]\nAnd they don't care they don't care it said that it's unacceptable because it's acceptable to them because anything to stop ...\nAnd anything to stop this nomination process\n\nJust reprehensible what he did in USA Today and and they wonder and then the gas that Kavanaugh was passionately defending himself yeah\nExactly\nYeah you're a bunch of hypocrites you know
