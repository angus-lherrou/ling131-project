don't want the Senate if you don't want the electoral college if you believe that the Supreme Court is the legislative branch and should be making up law when that was not their intent when you don't believe in the first amendment\nWhen you don't believe in the second amendment when you don't believe in due process under the law when you don't believe that the print in the presumption of innocence\nYou really don't believe in this country right you have no idea what the country's about and\nWe understand now on the show we believe that that\nThe majority of our audience and the majority of conservatives understands the separation of powers we've talked about that a lot we've talked about how the majority of America though so close to Seventy five percent does not\nBut if you understand the concept of the are by camera legislature you understand why we have a house of representatives you understand why we have a set it you understand why Great Britain as a house of lords in the house of commons\nYou understand that the founding fathers of the United states\nThey wanted a separation of powers the thing that they were most scared of was that a ... ... group a particular group of ... a a person a small\nGroup of people a particular kind of a legislature or a court or presidency\nThey were scared to death that power could be concentrated in one of those areas and they they were trying to avoid that more than anything because they had looked at the history of the world\nAnd seen how authoritarianism works and they didn't want it\nAnd the by camera legislature was a compromise made by the Congress and when you look at it the house of representatives uh you have I think fifty three house members in California only one in Wyoming\nWhy bigger population and California fewer people in a ... in Wyoming voltage\nTwo senators a that was done for a reason that was done sold the house would more represent the United states by population and by region but the Senate and on and\nAnd by the way the the reason that are you a are elected for two years\nIs so you're closer to the people in more accountable to the people if they wanted they believe that the house of representatives would be closer to mob rule than a Senate [laughter] [laughter] and but so they they but they wanted it they wanted the the the\nCongress to be closer to the people small areas you know of the country were you represented you know that area of the country and you had more power of the state\nBecause if you had more population and a bigger state you had more representation in\nThe house but they also wanted in every state wanted the ability to have some kind of equal employed\nSo the big states could not rule over the little states yeah that was the reason right the reason the bill of rights exist the reason that we are a constitutional Republican not a direct democracy is why\nSeparation of powers and also protection of individual rights and protection of states' rights\nAnd that's why it was done and do things move slower yes but founding fathers were worried so much about legislation moving slowly through\nThey preferred that than mob rule\nThe reason the electoral college that exist today is so you can't have mob rule\nOr you can't have the big states not knowing what the future was going to be in this country where the big states would totally dominate in the executive branch mhm it was all it was all thought up not to have the separation of powers so power to not congregate in one area\nAnd as we said when it comes to the by camera legislature to give them to give the people one body which is the house\nAnd then the Senate which is to per state which is six years so\nThey could be more long term looking at a country where they weren't voted in every single or every two years and the senators were more likely to look at what was best for the country\nAnd not just the region that the congressional membership\nOr represents I'm most room of I daresay that the vast majority of the left have no idea of I think most people I listen to our show do and understand you know everything that I said but I don't believe that the left understands that at all or cares to understand I don't think\nThey care about it because what they want is again a and as they often engage in and fantasy they created in their mind a fantasy of what the nation should be\nI mean they create a in their mind a fantasy of what the what the government should be giving you every day so the makeup of that government needs to change to fit that fantasy\nMost often they're okay with doing that they don't understand the process they don't care to understand the process\nThey don't care why it was set up this way\nAnd you know it's interesting because you look at what happened after Trump was elected and you have\nPeople on the left you know the end at at at that point start talking about uh we want our guns because not all but some on the left we want our guns because ah of the possibility of a tyrannical government\nHey welcome to the second amendment about their excuse the point of course directly to this\nPresident but it was about the same idea basic idea of the second amendment and\nIt's often too little too late for the left they call for something something changes well we didn't know what was going to be that just one small example was Obamacare not that it was small but much smaller than of course change through your way with the Senate completely\nWe didn't know we were going to happen but we thought someone else was going to pay for it\nYeah well lesson more\nYou start coming in and you start changing the very foundation of the constitution and they do believe this is this is really been the game

I Know when the Republican base is motivated\nUm and they are quite motivated right now I I don't know\nThat they're uh they're motivated and their unified or when when I saw that what George W. Bush how many times and he called Collins and\nHe called her numerous times during this whole process and is George W. Bush mhm to push for a Trump nominee mhm for for the Supreme Court this says you're not at everybody and I think one of the reasons that she's not everybody is look we dealt with Trump\nFor the last two years the people in the Republican Party that just can't stand and all of a sudden the last three weeks I woke up and what hoops\nHe sees are really not our enemy is really not our political enemy there may be some things that we don't like we don't like his tone we don't like this we don't like it'd be exaggerates we don't like\nWhen he doesn't tell the truth at times but he's a lot better than these insane people on the other side I Believe that that's what a lot of never Trump ... maybe not all but I think it's a ... well it's just that everybody except Bill Kristol\n[laughter] well [laughter] it's interesting [laughter] and that's not going to happen and possibly George Will uh but [laughter] but\nThe the the the the idea\nIf you look at it and I I find it kind of a interesting that that George W. Bush the same president who said well Simon campaign finance law I Know parts of this are unconstitutional but I'll let the courts work it out [noise] called Collins to make sure that the court gets it right\nUm but but [laughter] that that\nIdea is set by the way right by the way great observation I miss yeah well I I just uh you know but but certainly anyone from the Bush family doing anything to support a a Trump nominee is is definitely notable but\nIt also goes beyond what we use it while it goes right to what we will set and goes beyond the the political aspect of this that and removes it from the current White House because it is\nAbout the long term makeup of the court and George W. Bush of course recognizing that I'm certain um as many of us do and it is\nAlso recognizing a indirectly involved we haven't and I would love to hear from the former president on this or asking the question or if if it is the case with him we pointed out it is the work that the president does now we can go back and forth on the comments made\nA the and the communication errors and and things even on the issues that we disagree with ah we we are the original tariffs babies [laughter]\nAnd then have\nThose discussions but we've said from the beginning\nIt is the reason that you from the beginning so you know ultimately with your vote that it becomes known as it always is that buying their decision\nAnd then along the way regardless of whether or not and I saw somebody in my neighborhood with for Ted Cruz signs in their yard I thought you know not one\nNot too but a total of four they're really really voting for a group and so our time for time I'm ... and and I thought I thought to myself you know okay that's that's the that kind of enthusiasm\nUm even if we were to show that uh we don't do and we don't do endorsements because again as we mentioned earlier I don't believe they really do anything it tells it it might tell your audience which way you're going but there are the the point is is that we have the discussion\nOn the ideas and we believe that our audience and the rest of the country is smart enough to make their own decisions they may be willfully ignorant not our listeners but others may be willfully ignorant along the way they can make their decision\nOr you know or are there still capable of finding the information whether they choose to or not but ultimately it is about ah when that person is elected if I\nIf I'm campaigning for them if I'm doing a a volunteer work for them if I donate to their campaign I'm skills from day one going to watch them\nOn on the issues on their work you judge them on the work and then of course the head of that work you are back them in order to you know uh to to\nHave them do that work to keep them in place to do that work and you see a George W. Bush or anybody else that came together in most did on the right ah for judge Kavanaugh's confirmation and it really was about\nWhat the work and and and the results of the work of this president by nominating Kavanaugh but also the Senate or more importantly and more recently uh the work there and why it's important for Republicans in this case right now to be banded together\nA because it used to be where we could have the discussion will still have them I'm sure\nOf the you know the far right conservatives on Capitol Hill versus the moderates um but the ... and one of those moderates along the way would include Lindsey Graham I was just going to I was just going to ... um\nMentioned that that we knew that three weeks ago mhm that the left was motivated because I hate Trump right ah I don't know how much more motivated they could get I don't know right this royal debate the more or whether there'll be a\nA whether there'll be more of a sign of of despair and hopelessness we know that they are young people and I haven't seen a change in the ... young people that vote Democrats are are not enthusiastic about voting in this mid term ... and that could hurt the Democrats\nBut what I Know now know is that the Republican Party you mentioned Lindsey Graham you might look at look at Lindsey Graham and the fight to defend Trump and his pick yeah because if you are defending his peck your defending Trump right there is a unity there if you see that George W. Bush or read that called Collins numerous times\nAh to tell her how to a vote when you see the colon speech\n\nYeah and and except for yeah it's really a ... there were some things I disagreed with her on her speech or like when she gave a Dianne Feinstein the pass and the big pass which she shouldn't have done because I Dianne Feinstein was the reason that we got to this point to begin with\nAnd to say that I Know that she would never leak anything like that is forgetting about everything else that she did wrong and\nAh but the fact is Collins speech was very very thorough walked through every single a point and came across as very very common sense and this is Susan Collins defending the great Trump pick", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "city": "San Antonio", "day": "08"}
