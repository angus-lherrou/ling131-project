well now now now that the same excitement\nWell because ... and we warned in fact if you look at what happened in two thousand eight a than the four year that was there after that ah the inauguration and two thousand nine and then you saw what\nThe Tea Party the birth of the the modern day Tea Party or or the game I guess in terms of the the momentum of that Tea Party and ... and early ah two thousand nine and ... and it kind of carried over but ultimately the rock star thing was over and we warned between election day two thousand eight and a ... day two thousand nine\nFor Obama we said okay for people that wanted the rock star keep in mind he's going to have to do things that are presidential\nAnd those things are not going to work for you by the way that was so [laughter] so and years ago [laughter] because [laughter] come ... lead off the charts now\nAh to the fact that you know to the point that in fact a veto does not need the former presidents of campaigning in Texas um but but\nThe that that didn't carry over the ...\nThe Trump momentum is built on a number of things and real things\nIt's not rock stardom but if you want to talk about a political rockstar and that would be somebody in my opinion that that that performs gets things done on his agenda not not that Obama didn't get things done on his agenda they got Obama carried through you know they had to lie about it but they got it through\nA this president got affect them things done on the economy this president got in and created\nMore jobs is president got in and work with Republicans to bring taxes down and I don't think we've had this conversation we don't think he could have that anyone else could have done that Republicans are alone could have gotten the down on the corporate rate to Twenty one percent\nBut you look at those accomplishments\nThat's where the following that's where the ... it's that's where it's built\nAnd then as you mentioned the Kavanaugh saying something new to and wanted to do it woke up conservatives it woke up the maybe\nSome other rhinos who had a band and too many conservative principles\nAnd have them re look I guess we are examined the threat to democracy the constitution and everything our entire system and process in place during that Kavanaugh debacle that whole thing\nSo that threat became real this is not some kind of rock stardom oh we think it looks great or we think he's cool or we like the way he tweets\nIt's based on real things there's a big\nDifference between skateboarding throw water burger parking lot and getting the corporate tax rate down to Twenty one percent\nWhile you know you and I were talking about this said that if there is a\n... if they're ... and we had mentioned you know but they don't work here in uh in in Texas that that is viewed as the rock star mhm\nWell uh Bud Kennedy of the star telegram and waited out the other day and I just read the article that he wrote based on that tweet yeah there's a place called the originally theater mulch like three to five hundred people that's it couldn't fill it couldn't fill\nYep\nThat's what it was three quarters according to Bud Kennedy was three ... you know three quarters full and did an article is fatal burnout already here so when you talk about it ever existed or the life ever really right did did it ever really exist or was it hype just what was it was it heightened the rank and file or high death in the media right right right\nIs you know is it is the point so if you look at the excitement factor a and again I don't look at crowds just going to visit a candidate a you know she a candidate\nAs the the be all end all as as to whether people will go out and vote or not all I Know is this that on the issues right now on the economy\nIt's a plus for the Republicans\nOn on exposing what the Democrats really really want and and what they really believe when it comes to this country and\nThey do they even believe in the constitution do they believe in free speech they believe in\nSecond Amendment do they believe in due process under the law and we're finding out no they don't actually don't believe in the tenets of this country right right and those are pretty simple things to understand maybe the separation of powers you don't understand maybe exactly what the role of Supreme Court you don't understand but you do understand due process\nYeah they ... and you do understand the second amendment\nMost people do understand free speech and maybe not everything that's in the first amendment\nBut they do understand the free speech everything that the Democrats now do not believe in and are bragging that they don't believe in in those particular things and then you have a caravan of illegal immigrants\nThat are promoting it and the media is giving them as much publicity as possible they are going to show up Trump's they're coming to the border to crash the border has the mid term elections\nAre just Fifteen days away and it would take them I read one thing that to go what is it the eight hundred miles right I've heard you would take them five hundred and forty seven hours\nWhich means okay so should they should be closing in on the border come election day ... probably not something the Democrats want to be promoting as much as are promoting it right or the media is promoting as much as they are going to promote it\nBecause until I think Kavanaugh illegal immigration was still the number one issue of concern\nFor Americans and as you said\nIf there's a conspiracy out there and our pre show meeting from it in order to get to build the wall right Trump is fun to\nThis whole thing because if I got a lot of conspiracy theory that just because boom it worked for him if there's if there's anything that that could get get it back on track in terms of the funding for for the wall that he wants\nThe motivation right now go ahead keep promoting the care of and right up to election day do it and let's see what happens let's see what happens on election day because\nEven if the Republicans took the house\nWhat kind of solid victory is that I mean long lines ... I I mean Democrats took the house and you know by by just you know what ten Fifteen\nMargin right two or three margin best ability so even if they did that what kind of long lasting ... if if you think about the promise of what they've got to deliver\nWhat is it\nFree stuff well they'll the house panel to fund it while they were they would still have to be ...\nAgain you would you would you would still have to be the resistance how can you be the resistance and govern\nThere's ... there's no way you can't it's all about obstruction nothing else\nSo what do you do to that delivers numbers for people or the president's working and and getting results in unemployment\nIn taxes and real things that people seeing their bank accounts in in their lives every day what you're doing is working

yeah a roster right here Roger you really are no you really are a rock star I just uh yeah I Do not a senator and it won't be but\nYou're a rough [laughter]\nThat would have been a burn well thank you very much I mean you're not going to be a senator but you're a rock star\nOh my gosh we were just looking at the polls I'd I'd\nWe haven't seen one from last week\nA food which is interesting in that in that Senate race between Ted Cruz and a Robert Francis O'Rourke in Texas but in those latest a couple of polls are Ted Cruz is about fifty and has a pretty good lead so we're not ready to call it just\nYeah that was interesting because he said over the weekend [noise] apparently that is not going to run for the presidency and twenty twenty mhm yeah I was interesting about Wall Street journal wrote I loved her editor from last week we are all Native American ... a Yahoo or only American style but does said\nThat they believe that killed any chance she has a running for the presidency ... because she would just be she will be forever or Warren general ... she will be ... ever\nUh mocked for that so right when you hear the fact that people talking about by and I thought about this to some time over vacation\nBecause you know you're you know by by two old he still says he won't run but by and probably if you look at the polling still Democrats won by more than anybody\nMhm Mm well then Hillary naturally would think well why not me again\nRight and that thought from whatever age talking about the she's you know hasn't ruled it out yet I mean that just send the social media severe\nUh yeah it just exploded and white world thinking in the Trump at a time at least [laughter] please make that happen please happen again and it just I just would while she just won't disappear and now you know her and bill\n... weeks you know ... you know before the midterms going out and yeah you know they want to get their ... and ... you know they're going to be out there and and sharing the Democrats on me while the Democrats are going\nShot well I mean what did you have there just fresh out of a whole\nA cabinet thing right we're just a couple of weeks out of that and remember what you had you had some of the a hash tag me too movement a leaders\nAnd celebrities coming out saying no we should've repeating we should have called bill out then\nOf course they don't say that because she didn't win if she were president now they wouldn't say that Twenty years later than you know ... ... exactly Twenty years that we should we would get in a time machine and then go back and then remove him from office\nBut here's my question that go out on you know what the cause of what they're doing they're testing the waters right how much influence does she have well she can't go out with out bill\nSo what are you going to do and even if she did she can't go out without\nMillion questions about bill from her own party not from Republicans\nWe've been asking the questions for decades\nSo what do you do\nPlease jump in the water's fine Hillary twenty twenty let's see a rematch good luck because here's the first thing well she's not going to be the only one\nRight so\nNow we know the DNC will be working to make sure that of course she's ushered in you know make it seem like Bernie is really catching fire but not really\n[laughter] like we learned in what he's sixteen\nSo as she's in well don't count Bernie out well then Jones thinking the same thing in the opposite you know well wait a minute if she's in well maybe I Am in so then you've got your Kamala Harris you're got are probably not Elizabeth Warren [noise]\n... now but you've got you're going to have a field that is going to be greater than it was what did they have three three and a half candidates\nGoing against Trump no but if you in their primary or a [laughter] ... well build me a heck of a lot more I I well I don't know I I I'm not gonna\nYou know you you have to and you said this earlier it's going to be\nEither who hates Trump more than a combination of who hates Trump more and we're going to give you everything right and so right now the base level for the Democrats have been and Kamala Harris set it over the weekend or last week\nWhen she came up again with her guaranteed in a in a plan of six thousand dollars was one of the figures that was thrown out so now it's\nGet will on brain imaging come first is get rid of the the tax cuts right the taxes would have to go up there in order to pay for it even though they ... it wouldn't pay for the six thousand dollars and but six thousand dollars what any American the mix under a hundred thousand something to do what it was I\nI'm a but a ... six thousand they're free healthcare completely Medicare for all where you pay nothing there's no deductible there is\nNothing ... which uh by the way uh I thought the president had the best response for that before we went on vacation when he said oh good screw around people that that right because what's going to happen right you you you you think you're going to Medicare for all you're gonna just gonna under screen old people because\nThere's not enough money for the old people that have put in for Medicare that we can't pay when you had to pay for them right\nUh but uh you know so you have you have that and free college free college free health care free money mhm and we hate Trump and really if you want to look at it there was nowhere else for them to go\nThat route it we already know what twenty twenty is going to be yeah yep\nIt's because there has to be again the that battle on stage to you know who hates Trump more war or now will just kinda usher in this this thought and entertain this for a moment\nOkay maybe it is Hillary or maybe it is Joe just anyone that can beat Trump\nExcept there has to be more than that there really has to be more than that because what you're looking at at the end of the day or on election day is\nWhat's going on with the economy and and what are they really promising and and do I have Trump I Know a lot of people have trumpet I didn't vote for the guy I may not ever vote for the guy but I\nAm I'm motivated to go out and vote for this person what are they going to do for me you're talking about other sports were just talking about rank and file voters rank and file voters right because\nWhat did you see Wall
