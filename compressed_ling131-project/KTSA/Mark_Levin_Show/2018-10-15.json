them to share my views what went on and I'm here I'm getting into a while to get into it later when we're on a week or so ago is just outrageous but then it brings me to my bigger picture which I talked about the first hour\nThat we have a civil war the left believes that they have truth on their side and anything they do is justified so much so you can't speak on college campuses you can't even go to a restaurant in peace now right\nAnd they'll do anything and everything to get rid of President Trump and Hillary say this week something about we will not be civil again and we don't have to be civil as long as he's president of the United states whoa we we've gotten to that point of view I remember\nThat Ronald Reagan we'd have drinks with these days you can have drinks with Tip O'Neill at night\nAnd he said to him for the regular season and say you were battling me in the daytime and Tip O'Neill the Democrat the speaker of the house from Massachusetts will say well that was the daytime we fight there but here we're friendly that that's not the case anymore\nYou saw one Senator Graham said\nThat he wouldn't put up with with this nonsense and you want power so badly you'll do anything\nTo destroy people yeah that's where we've come now we've come to the point where it sounds like a second civil war to me and you see the anti for the protests in the street in Portland I mentioned that last hour what took place between the prayer group and they are a group and bloody and bare knuckles\nAnd the bear spray and all all kinds of stuff it's it's getting violent out there and of course we have the situation of Steve ...\nAh almost being murdered by a guy who you know shut up the congressmen and playing baseball that's always come to I I really worry about this country is really crucial and if you\nUm don't vote come the what is it about four weeks from now I don't even know what it is in early November and the Democrats take back the house and that's the protection of a lot of so called polls now and of course the polls wrong before us or hoping for a bigger turnout on our side\nYou will you won't believe what's going to take place they'll have hearings at the hearings they'll subpoena people it won't be safe to work for the Trump Administration anymore they'll catch on something and they'll get you on everything\nSo this can't pay this can't be what you want to happen in America even good liberals on the other side I Wish you'd call me an eight six six Ninety red eye that's eight six six nine o seven thirty three thirty nine\nYou can't want this because just like the reason we now only need fifty votes to elect the Supreme Court justice or fifty one and the vice president votes in case of the pie is because Harry Reid started that\nYou know the Democrats the left and liberals can't want this 'cause it's kind of come back to haunt them and the next time they win and in American history\nIt goes back and forth between Democrats and Republicans and on one side on the other side you you can't want that's the problem is you're you're not seeing you open up a new can of worms where you are guilty\nJust because of an accusation you open up a new can of worms if you will do anything to get rid of the press in the United states because you disagree their views on Trump's case even worse you know like who he is a your personally saw pose than\nYou and you can't believe this ... this bump came this full this guy is not in the lead us like the rest of you that he ever could have one and by the way\nHe's going to win again I really believe that the election was held today not two years long time he'd win re election\nSo as ... we're we're in for a battle and we've got to make sure that the the house has not taken over by the Democrats I'm pretty sure we're going to keep the Senate and we're probably when a few more seats in the Senate but in the house of representatives they a lot of people I I did a show\nA week or so ago and I had some experts on the third our including off the air they said to me it looks bath house represents\nThe guy that I Know well in orange county part of California data ... I think he's been at twenty or Thirty years he's in trouble they're spending millions and millions of dollars to defeat it\nDidn't and then they are so passionate about this the other side they are so angry about this election this past election that President Trump is in office to get what he's done\nAnd remember the courts were so significant because if they couldn't win elections the other side would make sure judges ruled right like the Muslim ban that President Trump because of what he said some federal judges decided it was a Muslim ban it doesn't matter from the president has a right to do that so they love the idea that the judges could make laws\nThat's partially what this battle was about also\nSo this is that's what the first hour was and I want you to react to it\nI think we're going to another civil war going on I'm just hoping that it doesn't get violent\nThat we can get through this thing and I'd already there is a lots of magic you can't go to a restaurant that would have been on ten twenty Thirty years ago going to a restaurant with your family and having people chant around you to make sure you can eat there or having waiters and waitresses not serving police or not serving people on the other side\nWhat what are we coming to does the other side I really want that\n... I I Want to know what you're thinking that\nYou know it's pretty sad what's gonna happen if you don't do something the next few weeks I mean get everybody can devote where we're going to lose this this was going to be a real battle worse than what you saw a with justice cow and all of a week or so ago\nEight six six Ninety red eye eight six six or seven three three three nine Marcus they're

let's go to the on in Kirkuk Iowa you're on with mark\nPerry uh I Do I just had a quick a little observation Marshall if I'm I'm pretty politically neutral um but you know\nI must have been in as young as I Am I watch a lot of uh you know media and and are getting in on the social media and just the way that they're portraying on the current president Mr Trump is just\nA little ... it seems a little unfair and the way that they're doing it it it seems like they're just uh they want to actually get into the political side they want to just ...\nYou know a lot of like the more scandalous things like this stuff but he says the stuff that the ...\nAnd the way that they're pushing the edge just purely for content it seems like it seems like a lot of these uh these cars that are\nUm showing this stuff or they just want to do it for the money and I think that's just kind of a dangerous thing to do because if you're\nUm you know pushing the fact that we need to get all these young people out there and and vote and then you want to only really show one side of the story it just seems like it's almost an agenda and ... and I just think that's kind of a dangerous thing like especially you know like I said if you're gonna have all these people\nExcited about voting and not really know exactly what they're voting for 'em I just seems that that could be dangerous situation\nYou're pretty perceptive how old are you a twenty five\nYeah you're pretty young and uh it seems to me that you you reflect what I think a lot of people are feeling after the hearings especially which is the way they treated the the judge pretty badly they're treating President Trump pretty badly not something that I'm honesty I support him big time but he does bring it on himself with some of the tweets and so on\nBut the personal vendetta the hatred they have for him is way out of bounds\nI I did not like personal mom I didn't like I'm not sure I agree with him more than one thing on his policies\nI certainly want to know harm to come to and I certainly didn't wasn't part of any resistance I I just knew you had to get rid of him the next term and I lost that one you didn't see people out in the streets you didn't he see people are threatening the press I guess they didn't want it to the ... like that\nBut but in general the anger towards this president I Know that you may not remember this you're pretty young towards George W. Bush was pretty angry but this this is even surpassed that\nThey we actually yeah cool in this country trying to get rid of him even though he won the electoral college any lose fairly elected president United States we have people in the FBI and the Justice Department working in collusion that was where the collusion was\nTo try to get rid of him to undo an election that it's not supposed to happen in the states of America I don't know the first hour\nThat's a banana republic where that happens a you're pretty good and how about your friend\nDo they agree with you or you're by yourself\nAlright yeah I Know a lot of the the people that you know I surround myself they they do think pretty much the same way again uh\nLike I said I'm pretty politically neutral myself and a lot of my friends are but they do understand what\nThe media is trying to get people to see and the way that they're presenting it and it it's definitely outright like I said I I don't really put myself in the middle of all that but I I definitely don't want to see people\nThat are expecting one thing and then they go vote and they don't ... bought they voted for kids you know growing up everybody's always like okay you're voters get account but it doesn't really count if you're not voting for something you don't really understand\nSo that's really all I wanted my own out just to make sure everybody's knowing that it be\nBefore you go in and sounds like you to go but I I'll say everybody else out there the fact is I'm not one of those people that wants to make it easier for people to vote\nI think if you don't know enough about what's going on and you don't care enough to go out of your way the vote I have a feeling you're not one of my voters that you're going to do it based on emotions and feelings which is what the other side is anyway to begin with\nAs opposed to as our caller just said a knowing the facts and knowing the issues and that's what can you don't have to agree with me\nBut at least go in there don't do based on emotion you you hate President Trump so much or he he's a man and you know we don't want to listen to ... and so you're the woman I remember that was years ago maybe it is again a vote for him because they don't share your philosophy or your principles of courses another issue\nWhich is as a teacher part time teacher I can tell you this most students don't know our point of view what I often use is the minimum wage laws they'll say of course I Want my re or want to get a raise or what do they call it also not just minimum wage livable wage I Love that one like it's a job of a business this may sound heartless\nA job of a business to give you a livable wage no it's not\nIt's a job I teach economics job for business to make a profit if they don't make a profit they won't you won't have any work or they won't hire you wanna do lay you off when they won't hire your friends\nOn the job of a business to give you a livable wage and it's not the job of governments to decide what wage to give you\nThat is what the Soviet Union did that with communism is that's what's socialism is and as most young people they've never heard the other side where does money come from I've said that for years people do not know including adults not just young people young adults that the government has\nNo money to tone it just takes in ... from some group of people in the form of taxes and give it gives it the others when students here the snake oh I never heard that I never heard that before\nSee conservatives couldn't win it's a harder thing to explain\nA than just big emotional and say you know whatever livable wage pro choice global warming of course it changed the climate change when it gets very cold just say these catchy things they left and the Democrats are much better at that than conservatives are takes a while to explain\nWhy they shouldn't be a minimum wage if there is you you just can't raise that arbitrarily that the government should do some bureaucrats should do it\nIt takes a long time to explain capitalism why that's the best system ever created so far\nThis is tough to be on on our side it it takes a while and if you have a meeting against or oh good luck it's a wonder we win any elections is one of the President Trump won with all the things stacked against him\nA and let's go to David in Greenwich ah let's see where that is in rented to New Jersey and sounds like\nHigh a David\nMorning thanks for taking my phone call um I I guess ... points on that you know President Trump is hated for what he says\nAnd and I get it it's not for what he does you know let's not forget in this country that when President Obama came in I didn't vote for him but I liked him as charismatic\nThe money in this country and you should know this uh from as you're teaching the money in this country dried up and it went back up on the shelf ironically it comes right back out again President Trump cannot force corporations to invest money or make things happen I mean he's a businessman he's a wheel NPR show he's hated for what he said\nNot what he's done second I think the people in this country should understand that both the Democratic and Republican Party are are are corporations just like if you want to I wanted to start our own right eye radio corporation political party we couldn't do it too so when they take us so personally", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "city": "San Antonio", "day": "15"}
