not going to actually put him and I'm sure they don't let it it wasn't going to put it in the law and it's going to put it in in in in the law and so we've talked about you know that we talked about the first amendment talked about free speech the left does not believe in free speech\nThey don't believe in freedom of religion we've talked about the different you know a Baker cases forests cases are out there and as most people in America bullied look don't you want to do behind closed doors\nBut don't care what you want to do with your life\nDon't force me to believe it now the left wants you wants to force you to do it remember when Obama became president oh no no no come on I mean Obama Care now this is going to be find no we're not going to force\nOr anybody who is religious to do anything against what they wish to what to do oh contraception contraceptives yeah we're going to force you to do this\n\nWe knew it all along so you look at freedom of the first amendment they don't believe in that anymore they don't believe in freedom of speech I don't believe in freedom of religion Second Amendment they want gone they believe is antiquated\nAnd as we as seen now and this comes from the identity politics ... created and nurtured by the Democrat Party\nAre there to the point now of as we saw during Cavanaugh a woman is always to be believed due process doesn't matter when a woman makes the allegation everybody knows that's total garbage\nEvery case is on the evidence if you came out and said you believe now there should be a presumption of innocence and we should have due process\nYou were called every name in the book you were called a gang rape enabler and\n\nThat's where the political divide is in this country then we'd go even further with the election of Trump and the ... and and what happened with cabinet that now the left is promoting and we're seeing the beginning of this\nAnd it's and it's spreading now go to social media and see how many people on the left are picking it up well you know yeah the electro college was wrong and now so is the Senate the Senate is wrong we shouldn't have it set it anymore and we shouldn't have the electro college\nWhich again to me there is no compromise on those issues why\nBecause I understand why they were created they were created to protect individual rights that the left used to care about we've often talked about the ignorance of the people in this country especially on the left when it comes to understanding the constitution which they don't even want to seemed\nTo understand whatsoever\nBut we live in a constitutional republic not a direct democracy and there was a reason for it\nIt was sold the majority could not rule over the minority it was so individual rights could be protected but the majority could not rural your constitutional rights invalid that's why we live in a constitutional republic\nThey don't care and so now the political divide is not how much a government should provide to everybody or how much the transfer of wealth should\nBe\nNow the left has moved into the political divide is Ben we don't believe in the United states we don't believe in individual rights we don't believe in the first amendment we don't believe in the second amendment we don't believe in due\nProcess under the law we only care about what we want and however we at tainted including tearing down the constitution of the United states if we had the power to do so\nWhere's the compromise if you sit in our seats where's the compromise on that well there isn't any there isn't any so there's going to be a political divide and it's going to be fierce and it's going to be passionate\nWell and that's always going to be the case and and right now the reason that it is a the the debate is so fears is because of the importance of those items\nThis is why you seen the Republican Party I think Joe especially since the Kavanaugh thing but I think the the Kavanaugh thing was was not just about the cabinet process or the lack of respect for the process\nI think it was an eye opener for a lot of those that were in the middle I think it was an eye opener for Lindsey Graham\nBecause\nYou and I had a one time during a pre show meeting during all of that after it happened we were like I said wow\nWho knew Lindsey Graham huh but you had Lindsey Graham actually say during that a passionate speech talking about the process during sort of my or an Atlanta Kagan's\nConfirmation\nWhat the discussion was about but I think for a lot of them they live inside the bubble\nThey don't see it as we see it every single day they follow the rhetoric but they don't follow it like we do certainly they they hear things and they see things but now they were people were getting in their face now it had come to their\nTable right there on the committee\nThat they start with the Senate majority leader basically being chased down in an airport they saw it with with Ted Cruz and it wasn't just\nProtester groups that kind of behavior had reached the Senate chambers\nAnd I think it was an eye opener for them to put it on perspective and say well yeah\nOf course it was bound to reach our table it was bound to get here ultimately and it has and that was the real threat because forget about the the the the protesters and and and all of those who were shouting of the faces of people\nYou've had the endorsement of that behavior since Maxine Waters and even before that of others saying it's okay uh Don Lemon saying oh it's it comes with the territory\nYou should expect this but then they go further\nNo we need more of this Michael Moore just the other day we need to wrap it up and she was talking in the context of the bombings or the attempted bombing the mail packages\nHe was saying we need to wrap it up well tell me how you wrap it up from where it was last week Mr Moore you mean actually bomb I don't know how you wrap it up\nWhat are you talking about\nYou're talking about violence what is it where do you wrap it up from chasing someone down in an airport\nWhere do you wrap it up from someone being shouted out of a restaurant where do you wrap it up from the type of behavior that we saw from the Senate Judiciary committee\nThe Democrats on that committee and their behavior how do you wrap it up from there I I I don't know where you go\n[noise] but on the political divide I I think I've actually describe the political divide that exist right now in this country that's how\nI see it that's the fears that I haven't I don't believe they're on they're not unwarranted they're not conspiracy theories they're actually based on the evidence of what Democrats have done and said they want to go to mhm\n\nWell I don't worry there's a ... where do you have the where do you have the policy agreements with somebody who wishes to get rid of the Senate wants to get rid of the electoral college wants to get rid of the first amendment doesn't believe in it doesn't believe in the second amendment doesn't believe in freedom of speech doesn't believe in freedom of religion\nWhere does it stop where's the compromise there's going to be passionate there's passion and there's going to be anger coming from the right when you say that the United States Constitution has to go but it's antiquated\nBecause it doesn't fit your day to day needs of being able to take somebody else's property for what you want now\nRight sorry there's gotta be backlash to that and that's what you believe when you don't believe in individual rights anymore when you don't understand even with a constitutional republic is about and say let's get rid of it\nThere's going to be back last year it's going to be people that are angry

[noise]\nThese are currently I'm Gary McNamara so just having a discussion on the political divide from our point of view and and why it exists today and and it's just it's a reality of what we what we live with a worn out the first ones\nTo live the political divide in this country and we won't be the last the only difference in the political divide now is it's not a political divide anymore as I can see it based on the fact that we as a nation need to provide more\nTo the people with a bigger federal government under the constitution but now it's a belief on the left that the laws and the constitution that we have to protect individual rights and the minority\nDon't matter anymore and so you know we we've talked about capping off the caravan also brings not just illegal immigration\nOr into the forefront but it brings in the concept of sanctuary cities mhm and I still believe that the Republicans have failed miserably to capitalize on this because yeah such right you'd think about sanctuary cities is the belief\nThat in a legal immigrant criminal and their freedom is more important than the rights\nAnd security of American citizens that's the point that isn't brought up enough\nWhat you hear is sanctuary cities well we need to protect these people ... what are you doing you're not protecting just illegal immigrant you're protecting the illegal immigrant criminal that's at by the way that's actually why it's news\nYeah\nYeah it's it is not you know this is the ... you I think the the situation in California where you had a city's come out and and go after the state for sanctuary state policy\nAnd\nThe the concerns that were issued at those all those events surrounding that and it's still going on there will be in it that will be an interesting legal battle by the way uh to watch in the coming years um\nBut that threat is is very real when you talk about your cities' leaders are your county or your state leaders saying we're not here to protect you\nI mean that goes beyond think about the empty political but the political process the promises over the years we're going to be tough on crime we're really going to work to improve things that some people actually were able to get it done\nBut those empty political promises people usually scoff at this is quite the opposite it's not just a political promise it's an in your face action by the government that says we\nAre not here to serve you and your safety interests were here to serve the safety and first of someone who doesn't belong here who was not a citizen\nAnd so I think it's important where the political debate\nHas because many people are falling into the political debate has become the back and forth on social media every tweet let's analyze it back and forth who had the worst insult\nWho made who who who made a the the social media statement that can be perceived as a little bit more violent than the other person even though it really wasn't violent and even if they were kidding around and we're like let's talk about what really the political divide in this country is really about\nWhat is the substance of the political\nDivide right and I believe from my point of view that's that's what I fear\nI fear a loss of liberty I fear last of the protection\nOf the uh minorities\nIn this and and and I mean across the board I'm Talking about constitutionally speaking ... the the reason we live in a constitutional Republican not a direct democracy and that's why the call to get rid of the Senate and the call to get rid of of of ah the electoral college\nEven if it's not going anywhere it shows the intent of where the left wishes to do when you see sanctuary cities when you see open borders when you see their leaders promoting lawlessness\n\nPromoting it yeah that's when you get to the point of people saying I don't know where I can compromise how do I how do I deal with you how do I talk to you\nRight\nHow do I how do I get I don't want to get across when when the cabinet thing goes on and\nYou have the main stream of the Democrat Party the mainstream Democrat senators\nPromoting that a certain demographic always has to be believed in this case a woman\nThe ... end up the presumption of innocence doesn't matter and that the person that the allegation is thrown against\nAutomatically is guilty\nWhen you had that exist when you have the belief of a major political proudly party the due process doesn't matter\n\nThat laws don't matter when it comes to sanctuary cities when the borders don't matter\n\nWhen the way of government that we have that protects the individual and protects the minority the constitutional republic not the direct democracy that we live in\n\nWhen the other side goes against basic tenants of what makes America\nAmerica not rhetorically speaking not who's got the bigger flag not not who proclaims their American more than you\n\nBut those who actually believe and wish to defend the constitution of the United states versus those that don't\nThat's a political divide that's very tough to solve\nWell it's not like a you know a social issue where you know eventually there might be I don't know I'm a resolution or a change of heart\nWe're talking about the very basic fundamentals of the country of the nation we're talking about the building blocks of the nation\nBecause what you have is where they build the numbers and people supporting all of this is people not knowing if the willfully ignorant but that don't know\nBecause they believe that they can have a big government but not an intrusive government well if you believe that then you also believe we can do away with parts of the constitution or do away with the constitution in general will just come up with
