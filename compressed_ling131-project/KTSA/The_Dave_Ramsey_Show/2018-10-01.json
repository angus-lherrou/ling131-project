basically a tribute to that whole you know a Jefferson Airplane grateful that kind of sound and and style um\nBut yeah a lot of great songs or that he sang on or a sang lead on and of course um\n\nWe all know I think if you know anything about Jefferson Airplane a difference in starship this is one of those behind the behind the music types of bans right tons and tons of drama breakups and make ups and this one having sex with that one and then breaking up and\nUh he was very sad to be very jealous of grace slick ... popularity and a notoriety\nUm but he also people that knew him said that he kind of had an inch reverted a personality so he was he was probably best suited to be the the kind of you know backstage leader of the band and put her out front\nUm but definitely a guy that had

the Senate vote but what we can be sure of is that this week and possibly beyond this week a greater quantity although I'm not a greater and not a greater quality but a greater quantity of\nUm accusations and not just act accusers but these assertions like the LA Times sort of fabricating this idea that Brett Kavanaugh is a a you know he's like Mussolini on the balconies this hot headed screaming maniac\nOr because he got emotional during his testimony that of course is refuted by the previous fifty three years of his life that's refuted by his demeanor in his previous hearings it's refuted by his demeanor on the DC circuit [noise] um I think you can predict that will be the case and then of course\nIf he is to get to the Supreme Court\nAnd he becomes the ninth justice and they are starting their ... their ah fall term with only eight\nOr should he get there\nYou can expect all kinds of snarky asterisk type well this opinion is a colored flavored a distorted um made illegitimate by\nI mean you can hear it now and that's the thing about\nThis tactic the left is using it isn't just to stop people from whatever the confirmation battle of the moment is or the election it's about damaging them past that point and if you don't believe me just take as an example Donald Trump\n\nDonald ... the the the the effort to discredit and stopped Donald Trump did not end on election night twenty sixteen\nAnd it hasn't ended now\nAnd people will say well jak it's because there's another election coming up and twenty twenty no it's because if you can't stop them at the ballot box or in the case of Brett Kavanaugh in the Senate vote then you can at least do as much damage in just crediting to them as possible\nSo this isn't about all sphere and love and war this is about an ending war the war that never ends\nThe fight it's never over the um nothing can confer legitimacy on somebody so it doesn't matter how people vote how the electoral college votes it doesn't matter what courts say and decision say if Brett Kavanaugh as part of a nine nothing decision\nOn the Supreme Court I guarantee somebody will say that decision is tainted\nBy the participation

welcome welcome where do you guys live\n... ... good to have you and how much data to paid off we have paid off about eighty thousand in thirty three not\nVery good and a range of income during that time\nI started at eighty thousand and we ended in and out a hundred and twenty thousand\nCool what I'll do for a living or a teacher in both public school teachers who watch what subject to shake I teach social studies in middle school mhm\nAnd I teach fourth grade raining and language arts no fun\nGood for you guys cool so what kind of debt was this eighty thousand box\nWell it was a mixed bag of a lot of different things you know we were super normal um ... most of it though was student loans where we actually had a going back and got her masters and just added on to our ah on on to our debt mhm\nMhm okay cool and how much of it was student lunch like fifty four thousand or so yeah and then what was the rest of it just credit cards cars a personal loan or a down payment loan that we took against a four oh three be you know just a lot of different things normal apps lately I love it cool\nHow long have you been married ... years okay so what happened two and a half years ago they got you started on this program thirty three months ago [noise] uh well I'm ...\nWhere he got her masters degree and we thought we are going to get a pay raise and I'm In after their student loans they'll kick the end it was like a sixty dollar pay raise so\nUm we I I kinda started feeling the the burden of the debt and started kind of meal mention it Sarah and saying we need to do stuff about the U.S and she wasn't fully ready to be on board yet so\nAnd that actually what happened like yes I didn't want to hear it [laughter] I didn't want to admit came my spending habits that\nI talked with a lady have did your plan that ... and that for a snowball vision the ... when I was like I said that's not came home and tell him about it and he's like I think at that time [laughter]\nSo at that point\nWhereabouts on board okay cool and what did you do exactly\nUh well we both took second job so I'm\nA second job or we both started ... teaching 'em ... are actually started teaching in a a maximum security prison as a second job and she was working for the same group but I'm On the outside world so we're both doing that\nSo you went to prison and then we didn't we actually teach your personal a finance class in the prison\nOh thank you yeah thank you thank you it's rewarding work they are doing that very good job good good very cool very cool so what do you tell people that key to getting out of debt if you paid off eighty thousand bucks I mean really\nUm I mean for for me I think it's a sacrifice um we\nI drove a Dave car I mean there was a bitter for a year but um no I see no radio it was a it was a rough year in that car in Georgia you know ... specifically I remember in that car one time I'm listening to your podcast I'm On my headphones and\nThe car when I was in a drive through and I looked down in the car with overeating\nAnd I had been working outside and at a third job and um [noise] had my shirt on button was sweating I ... I mean literally looked like the biggest redneck on the planet and a car over eat and I had to turn the heat on and I was thinking is is is this worth it\n[laughter] [laughter] I Know there's\nBeen there done that it's also very cool what do you tell people to key to getting out of that is so\nA lot of sacrifice you definitely have to communicate and then we sat down and ... and we did the cash only ... you know to this day even out or that frame we're still getting the caste system once that money has gone it's gone and we have an Eighteen month old at home even has a back at my parents' harmonies out it out\nYou know um but I think you just have to track thank God he has gotten a start everything there are the bumps in Iran along the way I'm lending last summer the thousands that in pain he has to work every day or three weeks as\nUm summer school mhm and he was going to have to get up so I'm not set that President today Bible school and and sadly his grandfather passed away and so all of these plans for this extra income coming in like shot sure I'm ... weeks later\nDied came three inches and they got an unexpected reimbursement check from the hospital from where we have our to our daughter oh my goodness and it raised about the same amount that weight right fighting to bring it not not in fact I'm not there he's going to get you through no matter what and I'm not to trust and hand\nAnd are how many bumps along the way you're going to head he's kind of pull three for you there on your side\nGood that's fun good for you guys very cool we've got a copy of Chris ... book for you retire inspired that's the next chapter in your story for you to be millionaires and outrageously generous or did you go along you're on your way without a doubt so who are your biggest cheerleaders I\nWould say uh most of our our parents were really supportive um\nA lot of people what's we actually would share we're doing this people people like they connect to it and we had more cheerleaders and we have people that were heckling them mhm\nAt colors that's for sure leaders are hecklers I'm a pretty good I I usually say people are just calling you're crazy but yeah but that's a heckler less good\nI think too like if somebody's out there that kind of in the middle of this and they're struggling with it um\nIf at the beginning it looked like just a mountain of debt that we were up under and we ignored it mhm and it was blocked in our future but we didn't ... and when we finally realize hey this things in the way we got to go over it\nYou know and here we are standing on top of it you know and it's a freedom like none other you know we're so excited for what the future holds because now we can see yeah\nWell and and the math is the math I mean you you chip away your trip or a trip away doesn't seem like you're getting progress and all of a sudden there's break loose it breaks loose and there's this flooded and you're in you're there you spend and you're done and then you know how I can control this stuff called money and now it's going to be a tool in my hands I'm going to make it behave\nLosing it showed it does change the hope factor where there is a light

it of credit card and then I had person alone so for one credit card company is Thirteen thousand they just sent me a letter and if I paid on twenty five thousand and they would you know I'm just calling and calling them all and the time I'm having a hardship to have lower how much I don't\nKnow what I'm doing good for them lower you don't have any money\nWhile my husband is a income I was thinking but it's still not enough [noise]\nOh well that's part of the picture when what does he make\nAbout twenty eight thousand in that much because he lost his job when I first got hurt mhm um and I've heard\nI heard or ... things are not receiving disability\nNote I'm applying I'm a short time we had an ... to ... percent on permanent disability to state\nBut I've been out of work so much that now it's going to be really really low is not even when the when I cook it because you know go about our credit meant in and out in and out of where\nI'm at this point\nI went to a different military lawyers and so I'm trying to find out he said he can't really tell me not to actually go in and see if I should do it that you know if I could deal with that and what every team and then if I did it Thirteen he didn't know how much they were going to pay that they want to give you a thing I doubt it at out\nAnd then I might have to wind up paying I mean you know they'll only now I don't understand\nYou gave him Eighteen hundred dollars to file bankruptcy or give them anything all Adam get anything so you're not paying on these credit cards or these loans today right\nNow not right now and I'm not for this and we're\n... we're already going to be look let's pretend you're just didn't pay those loans for a year and they just sit there the worst cases in which you're right yeah and what are they going to get you don't have anything\nYou don't have an income and you don't have the assets they can do you own something as valuable\nWhile I have yeah I own came home I live in I have two homes and I looked at the equity and I have um I have about fifty thousand in that house I can't sell the house though because if I tried to ... what does that algae either go\nMarket yourself and then it gets it because they found out and get like sixty seven eight out of the knowledge among you know I'm an area that how are you all for like one of a like a hundred and fifty thousand\nMhm but why can't you sell your home it's a lot of them in the area that are in it again why can't you know your house and the one with the other house that I don't live in one I'm thinking of it has about fifty thousand and why why can't you sell it\nBecause then you have a lot of foreclosures and then people are telling them for sixty and you know what\nI'm old Ninety eight\nOkay so Charlotte and get out much you can out of it and pay some bills\nTo pay off my dad with that\nYeah definitely for you go bankrupt you when you get right filed bankruptcy they don't let you keep investment property with equity and then not pay your bills smell how bankruptcy law works so the Trump bankruptcy trustee will force the sale of that property and it'll be forced to be paid against your bills\nAnd I think you can get enough out of that to go to each one of these and you can probably shuttle fifty thousand in your situation for around thirty five if you negotiate with them but you need the money in your hand to do that and you know what I mean money\nSo this is a way to get those all cleared up and then in the process of course we've got to figure out how to get your income back up and get your household income working again 'cause that's the root cause of all of this\nBeen so long term where are you going to be in two years where are you going to be in a year where are you going to be in three years which are long term game plan and what are you doing about getting there\nThat's got to be your next step because you got to get either disability income coming in um you know if you do workers comp if it if you were hurt you said on the job or you or I can tell from the way you're saying that which way it was but you know any money that is do you or any money you can create you used to create your future ghetto\nAnd that's what we want you to do we want you to have a future\nAnd and so you start looking out there in the into the future and saying how am I going to take the next step is to get there but as far as filing bankruptcy I don't think that's going to be advantageous to you when you got this much older when you've got this much equity in a property and I think you can clear up the debt by selling it\nSelling it taking the equity using that money that thirty thirty five thousand dollars it's they're forty thousand whenever you get out of it\nAnd subtle at fifty one thousand deaths by negotiating with get that in writing before you send them any money but I think you can work your way through this to file bankruptcy if you want to sell the house or your wife and\nI suppose this hour of the day Ramsey showing the bugs our thanks to James Charles our producer and kill it in our social producer and screenwriter and this is known as

part of it gives you guys are heroes man what a great story you're absolutely right well what do you tell people to key to getting out of debt is\nSay there's a few things are obviously one hundred percent if you're not a team with your spouse there's no way you're going to get out of that I don't see how there was enough troubles in trial the life that if you guys I'm working together at Thursday's when I was struggling that she wasn't and vice versa\nUm and then obviously the plan that you guys set forth um and then you have to be real with yourself and I think not not live the entitled lifestyle that you're going to borrow other people's money to live I mean\nYou know we talked about this and if you make thirty thousand dollars in this country are more blessed in probably Ninety nine percent of people in the world and and I think you just kind of have to wear your shoulders and say hey this is what I Want and it wasn't fun you know she was she was working three literally three job she had three different jobs really I got credentialed at another university and I would go in because I have a lot of time off with my job and I\nI didn't want to I didn't want to drive three hours and stay the night on my days off in ... at a University in in work extra but\nYou know seeing them in the rearview mirror made me want to do with that much more and just get it done and it's you know I I mean what did you make it that game for my average income was probably you know without working extras probably one Seventy five I'm Jeff how much on that extra\nProbably another ten or Fifteen just in a short period of time and then and then I started getting more opportunities at my at my interpretation 'em and you know I got the only least that I think he would approve
