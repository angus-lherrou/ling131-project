{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KTSA", "content": "If we can call it that that will be the name of my new album by the way that sort of thing um you know we don't hear it so that's when they had to pull over it let's just remind you this is on national live TV ad up pull over\nAnd fix the tarp and that was when we got a really good look at just how access arise this dude van was my goodness um I mean he had\nEvery square inch of those ah windows and there was there were those big a conversion van picture windows right it's kind of part of the kind of vehicle you drive to work I Would think I Would think you know if the van comes to knock and Ivanka vans or rock and don't come knocking\nKind of thing right you know you have one of those your history somewhere right but he does write rent the rainbow motif on the side or the bubble window you know him\nBut yeah that van is I don't know I don't mean to jump to conclusions but I guess I have so I'll stay with it\nJust doesn't look like the the that doesn't look like something that would belong to a person who's wrapped too tight or at least it looks like somebody who is a little too into or carried away with a their political affiliation I was thinking looking at it\nWe've had the discussion here on the show right people have called in and talked about how all I don't put a yard sign up because I like to keep my opinions private or I don't have a I don't wear the T shirt I don't have a sticker on my car for my candidates or whoever they are because I don't want to have an argument with strangers or I don't want somebody to keep my car\nUh if it's part did HEB or whatever and now here's this guy taking totally a different approach he wants everybody to to know everywhere he goes uh where his political a love\nA lies and so we'll see what that all means um and then in the meantime\nAh once we learn more about him and if there are other people involved you know what this weekend is going to be right this weekend is gonna be the political a spin Follies where everybody's got to figure out how this occurs to their advantage right before the midterms\nAnd I'll just throw this out there I'm certainly no expert but\n[noise] I I realize the political people people that work on campaigns people that work in the Republican Party the Democratic party people that work on the on the political operations of the cable news channels\nI realized that to them everything is a factor right everything is a is a is a potential uh voting or or opinion shaping factor\nIsn't it likely you tell me if I'm wrong isn't it likely that at this late date October twenty six or whatever it is today\nMost people have already formed opinions about Trump about the leading Democrats um about the economy\nUm now there may be people who are going to go to the polls and haven't decided uh you know on some of their local races or you may be having an ... about proposition\n... a B and C um I and I get that by the way but I I think we forget that a whole lot of people no matter what happened with the story of the last week\nThey already you know their their their vote is baked their opinions their their take on the Republican Party the Democratic party control of the Senate their local Senate race you know here in Texas Ted Cruz or Beto O'Rourke\nThat I think they've already made that my their mind up I\nI don't think that the electorate is so fluid and malleable that oh now that we have the the bomber and now that we see is van and now that we learned this that and the other but it's just I got to reconsider all my political points of view I just don't think that's a real people do it and I'm not again suggesting that there is no one left who's undivided a undecided\nBut I just don't think there are that many and so um it may just be for all the spinning and there's going to be a ton of it I mean it's already starting\nBut it may just be that for all the spinning and and analyzing and you know and I include myself in this because we do it on this show and you know\nWe do it because we figured that people will tune in for a show like this probably that's probably what they want to hear but I I never forget the fact that you know what you're doing you know your values you know how you feel you don't need any one to tell you what to think and that by the way is why I don't endorse candidates or or anything because I\nI I wouldn't presume to know better than you what you should do with your vote so I\nI think we can make some popcorn and sit back and watch but I think most people already know how they're going to vote if they haven't already voted and that by the way it was the question we're asking on the ... today\nOr have you been able to get in an early vote this week I was finally able to get in yesterday I was so relieved and then when I got into that Tobin library on\nA very worst box it was it looked like a really long line but two things one they had\nWay more voting machines operating than I'd ever seen before and number two people were moving through pretty quickly [noise]\nThat's kinda my point even though it's a long ballot\nPeople pretty much knew what they were doing and got it done pretty quickly so you get to early vote if you haven't yet when we asked today in the poll question powered by Stevens roofing fifty four percent say

in what we would call her retirement\nFund and then about six thousand at a checking account and that retirement fund has been a rental house that my brother used to pay off a rental house maybe basically been given her all the rent money even though he covers all the maintenance just kind of extra gift from him\nBut that become a bit of a problem because he doesn't he owns a small business and that's really not his focus so it go it often goes without attending\nThe mom doesn't get that money coming in\nSouthern wondering you know if you have a recommendation on and maybe a better um consistent investment or maybe a dip it in pain dogs are just a mutual fund or going to get your thoughts on that her\nAnd her financial um situation as our net monthly is about two fifty and the whole once you get the Social Security I'm after she either Iran which includes an independent living with meals so that three hundred two or three hundred a month that we've been chipping away at or checking account\nOver the past two years and that's why it's bound only six thousand that's about to start hitting the fix the\nOkay the sixty is in cash and it's from rental income over the years\nYeah for about the past eight years okay\nI Know you've got that track and that's invested in want bin\nLaden or others one of my brothers rental property oh shield yawning mom's money it's not in ...\nAnd you could liquidate it he can he can give her the cash if if we made it if we decided to go that route but he basically just took the money and paid off his rental house and started giving our all the rental income\nOh I see okay and so her\nInvestment that she has made and this rental property is not doing well because there's not being mammoth issue well\nCorrect okay um and where is the property\n[noise] um it then it around Jackson, Tennessee so she lives in Memphis was laying down which is near my brother it's in his home town but I was still a burden on him and I think it kind of even though he says it's not a problem I think they ban and thought\nIt would be better off I'll sell the house and use the money to invest in something that doesn't require\nEffort correct okay\nYeah I mean if you just did that and you put the money in a mutual fund um throws off six thousand dollars a year that's five hundred bucks a month that's ten percent\nRight and that covers or shortfall\nWhat are your thoughts on living in pain thought you think that's\nThan a or a labor no I don't think it's more secure safer\nBecause you're not well diversified you're stuck in one or two stocks on the grill and I wouldn't get into that\nUm I Would like to take a growth in income mutual fund and a balanced mutual funds for about thirty K in each and try to find something that's got a track record of paying up around ten percent a year eight to ten percent a year a again gross and destroying the growth off of it\nShould run in perpetuation in to the tune of about five hundred bucks

income\nThan have to generate lodges a couple of hundred bucks shorter months\nMhm and if that's sixty just generates six thousand dollars a year that's five hundred bucks a month made a does half that you're still okay\nSo what we're saying is is that you know that there's this houses really poorly managed\nDon't hardly anything [laughter]\nIt it comes and goes there's been a couple of years where it was about seven hundred a month but the last year I think it ...\nIf she's getting seven hundred a month off this house why isn't that covering her three hundred dollar shortfall\nIt was and

the fullest extent of the law and now director ride a who've done an incredible job leading this effort over the last few days he will give us the details of today's important arrest Chris\n\nAs the attorney general has confirmed we have arrested sees are say Iraq\nIn connection with this investigation\nAs our investigation is still ongoing I may not be able to answer questions about his background or or about his motive what I can say is that this was a nationwide investigation of enormous scope of the greatest imports our investigation ranged from New York\nTo Delaware to Maryland to the district of Columbia to Florida to California\nAnd as it always does the FBI responded with every resource we've got including our joint terrorism task forces are counterterrorism division in our world renowned experts at the FBI lab in Quantico\nBut by then I I really can't underscored this enough we did not act alone as you can see from the agencies and departments represented up here today\nA threat of this scope of this magnitude requires all of us working shoulder to shoulder and today's arrest is a testament\nTo the strength of our partnerships and what we can do when we all work together\nI Want to acknowledge the many partners who helped in recovering and transporting these IDs to our lab in Quantico this is dangerous and highly skilled specialized work\nRequires great care and were incredibly grateful to all those who helped us in that effort and getting those devices to our lab from around the country we can confirm\nThat Thirteen IDs were sent to various individuals across the country each device consisted of roughly six inches of PVC pipe\nA small clock a battery some wiring and what is known as energetic material which is essentially potential explosives and material they give off sheet an energy through a reaction to heat shock or friction\nThough we're still analyzing the devices in our laboratory these are not hoax devices\nI Want to focus for a moment on the amazing work of our folks at the FBI lab based on their initial analysis they uncovered relating fingerprints from one of the envelopes containing an ID that had been sent to Congress will and Maxine Waters\nWe have confirmed this fingerprint is that for ... or say\nThere is also a possible DNA connection between samples collected from pieces of two different IDs mailed in separate envelopes and a sample previously collected from say Iraq in connection with an earlier arrest down in Florida\nThis is phenomenal work with the greatest pressure\nUnder an incredibly tight timeframe\nWe see unbelievable work like this on TV and in Hollywood but to see it up close in reality is something to behold and we are so proud of our team at the lab for their work and keeping people safe and helping us to find the individual responsible\nLate last night we also turns to our partners in the Florida department of law enforcement for confirmation of this DNA connection and we want to thank them in particular for they're very quick work\nAlso want to thank the men and women of the FBI's counterterrorism division who remain on high alert every\nTo try to keep the American people safe from harm and who moved quickly and efficiently into action every single time today's arrest doesn't mean we're all out of the woods there may be other packages in transit now an other packages on\nSo we need the help of everyone out there every citizen everyone in law enforcement everyone we've got to help with this investigation in the days to come if you got any information please\nCall us on our tip line that one eight hundred call FBI or our email line tips dot FBI dot Gov\nNo piece of information is too small every tip could be the one that leads to something very important and of course if you see something suspicious suspicious activity please call your local authorities we need all hands on deck we need to stay vigilant\nFinally I Want to thank our partners too many to name from across the country because we cannot do this work alone everyone up here today understands that and we take that to heart every single day as we do the hard work together\nAbout protecting three hundred and twenty five million Americans now I'd like to turn the podium over the commissioner O'Neill from there and why [noise]\n\n[noise] like Chris ... every one\nOf the men and women are the NYPD quite frankly all the people in New York City I Want to command and thank all of our local state and federal law enforcement\nPartners in this effort including the attorney general's office and us attorney's office for the southern district of New York\nOr in YPG detectives along with FBI and ATF agents postal inspectors New York state police and many others they are one team on our joint terrorism task force\nAnd J. T. T. F. in New York was the first of its kind in the nation it's been in business since Nineteen eighty today there are three hundred investigators from fifty six agencies hundred and Thirteen of them are in New York City cops\nWhen it comes to terrorism in New York City you might be doesn't do anything without the FBI and the FBI doesn't do anything without the NYPD that's a partnership that was forged in fire in my thirty six years in policing relationship has never been stronger\nThis case told that story again New York city cops for a side by side with FBI agents many other agencies in Florida this morning together they brought to justice as they always do\nThe wide experience of our agencies coupled with the individual expertise the members of the NYPD bomb squad or highly trained emergency service unit for intel bureau a counterterrorism bureau\nOr patrol cops were the first to respond to CNN all help lead to today's arrest I couldn't be more proud of the work each of them did in this case and the work they do every day we said from the outset and we would identify and arrest that person or people responsible for these acts\nWe can make that promise because of the confidence we have our ability to investigate it deliberate precise manner\nToday's arrest means that New Yorkers in the day people across our nation are safe but his director ... said that might be more packages out there so I went still needs to take caution and if you see something out there called nine one one and in New York City we have a number also won eight eight eight NYC safe\nI Want to thank them as the public who contacted authorities with information during this investigation New Yorkers don't back down they step up every single time\nWe've been through things like this before and much worse I'm never surprised by the unmatched resiliency our city always displays thank you also to the media for broadcasting the photos the NYPD released\nBecause it's certainly help workers around our city identify additional packages and helped move forward with this investigation thank you [noise]\n\nCould afternoon I'm Jeff from in the United states attorney for the southern district

years in prison [noise]\nThis is an ongoing an active investigation we will not rest until these crimes are fully investigated and the defendant or defendants are brought to justice\nOkay so you got a

hey good to have your man how can I help do my wife and I we have zero debt but\nWe um we have that on our house and we plan on how in the house next spring mhm should we pay our house so soon as soon as the weather breaks you're putting us on the R\nWell yeah like like four months\nProbably like may or June\nOkay right so like six months plus or minus All right um okay\nIt doesn't matter much um the thing I Would do though is if you put the money into a savings account instead of paying an extra on the house\nAnd you have to like write yourself a note that says like male yourself a letter that comes June first says if the house is not up for sale put this money on the house\nOkay so in other words if you waffle on this decision and the money gets spent on a bass boat it wasn't a good plan\n[laughter]\nOkay 'cause that's what happens to loose change it tends to find its way towards an impulse purchase if we change our direction on the sale of the house and I want it thrown at the house if um if you're going to keep the house but for six months it doesn't matter\nTo the other part of my question would be ... sixty nine thousand currently so say we don't so much that America is he from what you do it's long\nMerchants refined she'll be three to six months of expenses I doubt that your expenses are that high sick you know okay so what would it take if you lost both your jobs or what would it take for you ought to pay your bills for a month\nFor a long mhm um\nEat keep aligned get on that though it\nThe lights on that kinda stuff I'd say three or four thousand\nOh a three to six times times four thousand six times for thousands twenty four thousand so twenty five thousand of the sixty nine is the most you should do\nOkay which leaves you about forty clear okay for a forty five clear um and to throw at the house and what's the balance on the mortgage\nTwo hundred and eighty thousand okay yeah\nSo hold that an an ad to separate those two accounts by the way I'd have a twenty five thousand dollar count in a money market and not have a forty five thousand dollar account in the future house paid off house bond or paid off vows spawn okay you know if you don't put a sign in the yard by the first of June take that money on that account and put it on the house\nOkay if you're waffle in change directions in your decisions which are allowed to do you're an adult by the way a white man that is a winner who who's up okay Monica is up well who's up just just make up your mind I don't care [laughter]\nI'm getting signals from the booth that um we can't repeat okay boy [laughter] San Antonio [laughter] hey why even what's up [noise] how's it going to have better [laughter] I deserve this that's for sure how can I help [noise]\nUm no I was just calling in today 'cause I I've been listening to for about a year I'm On and off and I'm right now we're in we have about a hundred and five thousand dollars in debt and fifty thousand in cars twenty two thousand and other debt like credit cards and all that\nSo one oh finally includes cars\nYes it is because the cars\nFifty on cars and what's the other fifty five on\nA thirty three thousand on student loans a little bit of the majority of my wife's ah about eight thousand on line and a twenty two thousand is on other like credit cards and stuff like that\nGot it and what's your household income\n[noise] um well I got fired from my previous job that was there about five\nAnd a half years and um we're making about one one oh five one twenty ... a year\nWhere did you used to the old job\nYeah that that's what I was making before a yes before okay um what do you make now why\nNow I'm In real estate I'm actually I got my license in March in June ... June was my first day in real estate mhm I've got to choose a house is sold takes listings and expanding clothing bought into uh the second week of November So\nWhat is your projected income for the uh the that six month period of time\nI'm I'm thinking maybe like twenty five thousand\nBy the end of the year and now\nWhat is your why didn't make of them want to\nFind makes it a she made a fifty one thousand\nOkay so basically it sounds like in real estate you're going to make as much as you used to make\nYes okay good good news right\nI guess right now what she's worried about is that she is bringing in most of the income because of course it's slow when he first started out I'm only selling to houses that between that long the span 'em and her thing if she wants to keep her car because she's saying she's making money to pay her car [laughter]\n'cause that's not how it works when we're married that's how it works when your roommates\nYou get to do whatever you want when your roommates but when you're married it's for richer for four and sickness and health and onto the all my worldly goods I pledge is what the old marriage vows said\nAnd so it's you know if you want to be divorced you get to keep whatever you want to Cape if you want to be married\nWe are doing this together in other words if she gets cancer you don't look at her and go oh you just you can handle that cancer thing there by yourself and those trips that came out you get to do that by yourself you're not going to do that to her right no no you would take care of her because we are now one\nOne were married in ... in the Senate health and right now the house is sick and so we don't get to be a print system be selfish that's not an option sorry\nYes and and um that's what I was trying to explain to her that we need it my my truck if for sale already I have it on the market good home as soon as I as soon as I Do some of these closing the courts will have\nIf I can get what I was asking for what you what it what I oh I'm going to pay the difference to get rid of it completely good um what these qualities and and that's what I was trying to tell her to as I'll get a car cash and then she tells her car and then what have at least one car right now\nMm well I don't know I don't ... I don't agree with that I Would get her a car and I'm not sure we're going to move down and out of her car if you can make fifty five thousand\nIf you can get these closings and everything you've gotten the pipeline it sounds like you're pipelines pretty good it's just it's been tough from the lay offs and other firing until now but here's the money that you've got ... the the business that you have coming\nShould create the income they used to have if I heard you correctly\nYes and and like I told her like she's she's worried that it's not coming in fast enough and I told her there are pending or clothing by then the second week of November everything should be closed do stay close\nTo three weeks from now yeah I mean so three weeks from now all this goes away so here's what I Would I Would not sell her car today I Would sell your trial today and I but I Would I Would say I would tear this this this ridiculous philosophy that she has all the senator\nLuxury\nThat's Barry very very emotional and very very important ... and that's a reasonable statement but but I I think if I'm In your shoes I might declare forty thousand my emergency fund\n\nAnd then I'm okay because the catch most of what would come your way what kind of an emergency would come your way that would be more than forty thousand and extended unemployment will be the only one that would\nRight\nI mean or ... ... ...\nI mean I assume you've got good healthcare coverage\nI Do but they won't cover it\nBecause I don't know like talking about that I'm saying if you had a major health issue\nYou know that that would that would eat up forty grand but it wouldn't be really wouldn't I mean you to get to forty grand if you got you know the ... co pay it and that's a lot that's that'd be a million dollar expense you know so I'd be very ... I think you're okay at forty grand\n\nAnd if you declare that then we don't have to declare there's an emergency I'm I'm just process in this with you because I'm trying to figure out a way to do it\nOkay um\nAnd if you want a soup your emergency fund backup later you can do that but you don't have to feel like you've violated a ... a principled process to do this then\nOkay that makes me feel better is logical to you I think so yeah I think though\nHave you got a good friends or family or past or something like counseling you and walk in with you on the just the whole process on this and the decision making and everything\nYou know not doing this and allow them by yourself to the ... [laughter] I've been told they don't have to worry about it but I Am [laughter] Bye bye good counsel was that what you're saying not necessarily good counsel but friends and family say oh you know\nThe only time I don't worry about it have been crap I'm Talking about somebody that loves you enough to look in your eyes and go really seriously what are you doing here I mean our our yes you should do this you know but it's not just a I mean if somebody really thinking this through with you not just casually over coffee going\nGood accountability good counsel in the multitude of council

I wanted to get your thoughts on that [laughter] well um\nThat's an absolutely ludicrous way to solve the objection okay there are in our financial ratings for life insurance companies if they do not meet a certain level of financial criteria the state that you're operating in will not allow them to sell insurance\nThere so if they're almost broke the state will let them sell in your state\nAnd I have to make minimum criteria to just financial solvency to do that number one number two if you have term in life insurance and your term life insurance company goes broke\nOn less you're sick and can't get insurance you just go buy more insurance it's kind of like if your car is your check their financial stability of your car insurance company lord no [laughter] right now I go broke you just go get another one\nYou know if you've got a recipe and progressive goes broke you'd just get a different one you don't think about it\nProgressive I have the money to pay my claim\nYou know but you can look at the AM best ratings of some on the sand or insurance his website and they are small financially solvent as much as this group or the ... on the other stuff that's a that's a complete line

an emergency fund if you're following our steps in Europe the baby step three to do that and you won't need to do that\nWhen you're switching you're so I'm cancel the whole lack policies on kids they're sold to you as a college benefit but your child will never see the front door of a college using a whole lot of policy\nWhich is there's I mean you just that they're going to be four dollars or something and that thing I mean it's ridiculous the little kid policies are just a complete rip off and for whatever you do don't buy financial stuff from a baby food company\nThose will be buying those Gerber policies I don't know who buys stuff I mean is that it just strikes me as funny than anybody would even consider buying a financial investment for my baby food company\nJust backwards\nBut we're going to use them to feed our kids more ways than one [laughter]\nIs that what you're thinking so ... got to jump on ... or insurance is website get you some quotes on you and your wife and just drop the kids whole life policies completely\nAnd drop your whole life policies one Sanders issues your term policy once you're the term policy in place you can get the best prices anywhere as under insurance dot com because they're a broker they shop among a zillion companies\nAnd get you the best brushed Michael is with us in Lexington a Michael how are you\n[noise] hey they've already done better than I deserve what's up\nI'm just got a quick question I'm Twenty years old I Am not married I've completed babysit sworn into\nAnd I'm In the national guard right now I'm I'm looking for the call and a few months for the greater part next year and I'm Wondering I'm living at home for free now and I'm Wondering if I should go and open up a retirement account and start contributing to that or if I should have a little bit more to fully caught an emergency fund\nNeeded emergency fund everybody needs an emergency for the good news in your case as most of your emergency will be covered by the fact that you know you're in what's known as a stable job\n[laughter] you're not going to like I mean you could lose that job it's possible but you'd have to really work at it\nAnd um it's not like they're not going to make payroll writes show 'em that part's okay but I mean other types of emergencies or the job loss can occur so yeah you need some money set aside as an emergency fund and then yeah you'd be a baby step forward and you start putting Fifteen Percent of your income away\nAnd um that would be baby step for and I do that first and a Roth IRA and then I Do it in Iraq the T S P after that if they're matching I don't think they do but if they're matching you on the ... going to start their with Iraq with the match\nThat'd be the plan Michael thank you for serving your country but I appreciate is good to talk to you\nMartin is with us in Los Angeles I Martin welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHi Dave hey well\nI was a one of your opinion on regards to um to whether it's just fell my rental property to pay off my primary rap for them or and pay off any other debt also that I have\nA much other data got\nJust two cars I'm a credit card debt but I paid pretty much about Fifteen thousand in the last I Would say three or four months\nYou got your your debt free but two cars in two houses right okay how much do you own your cars\nI'm fifty thousand on bald\nOr total on both total\nOkay wow and what's your household income [noise] ah one thirty okay you gotta lotta car and um\nSo what do you own your primary and what are you oh on the rental\nMy primary goal to fix the and it's worth about five fifty\nMhm\nAnd the rental and now my my rental Ohio one takes the and it's worth about I Would say or thirty a fellow at work they beep but I if I'm at a little bit less okay\nSo I mean the two ways to do it is usually income to clear up the mess or use the rental to clean up the mess right\n[noise] right and so on you know if we take take\nUm you know I'm going to start paying I'm going to live on beans and rice and till I get these cars paid off and so they're going to be paid off and well under a year\nAnd then once they're paid off a then I'm going to decide I'm going to pay all the the little house or the rental for probably go ahead and pay off the rental\nOr might pay off the house first I don't know either one's fine but um you know you start throwing ... forty fifty grand a year at that stuff let's see here we got three\nFour uh four twenty so you got about five to ten you got about seven to ten years to clean up those two things after the Europe paying off your car um or you can show the rental now and be done right\nI mean that's what I really had a question whether to to do that and and pay off most of the party much ... pretty much all my dad on it but I also have in mind for that but I have a son who was about to well I Would say in in two years she's going to go to college\nI don't have a house primary and cash for that right okay good no doubt now the only way this makes sense is if you don't borrow money anymore\nRight now my credit card check pat up there and they get right by a car you pay cash for it I'm All right you never grow money again on anything if you do that because otherwise it doesn't make sense\nRight that that's the plan is to get on track\nYeah you can't sort or ride this out of debt horse it doesn't work you can't shorter routed me got to ride him or not\nAnd so if you're gonna ride him it makes a lot of sense and I think it makes sense I Would sell the rental\nAnd pay off everything I cash flow college than outside ... rentals with cash or go along out there into the future and I think ten years from today you'll be in a better place by having done that if you stay on budget and you don't keep you know you don't spend money that you don't have and go back out there and borrow money and all that kind of stuff\nBut you got to stop it you got to break the cycle and if you've broken the cycle then yeah I don't the rental and pay off the cars would pay off the house on them", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "year": "2018", "city": "San
