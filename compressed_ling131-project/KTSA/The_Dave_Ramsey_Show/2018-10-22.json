a\nGood case or argument\nThat this is that millennial youth vote that we've been hearing about for decades and it's really happening this time or you could equally say this is the cabin a caravan that cetera et cetera backlash a vote and and I don't know [noise]\nJust turned up in my news feed 'em and I I've seen this kind of thing many times before it's very common a person holds up a piece of paper\nAnd this this woman is holding up a piece of paper and it says I'm twenty five with a fine arts degree no job no insurance on food stamps twenty thousand in college debt I Am the Ninety nine percent\n\nAnd I'm looking at it trying to figure out if she mad sad is she chuckling at her place because when I see people who are complaining about how they have a college degree and things haven't worked out the way they thought they would\nUm I have to be honest I I think if you choose a degree\nWithout knowing the employer ability\nOr the demand\nIn the marketplace for those skills or that background or that degree\nThat's on you I don't mean\nTo sound unsympathetic I'm not trying to be mean I'm not trying to sound like some old guy that has his and he doesn't care if anybody else gets any but\nThat isn't that is not victimhood that's a self inflicted wound I'm all for higher education but if you got a fine arts degree um you better get hired at the college that's giving it to you because that's where the only place they're going to want it\nThat's just the fact I suppose we could argue that\nThis young person didn't get good counseling from their high school or work wasn't given good advice but that we do know that right we don't know that maybe people did try to say hey get something else major in something else because you\nYou you want to have a job and they're not hiring people with fine arts degrees\n[noise] I don't know I don't know if somebody gave her good advice bad advice she got good advice and didn't take it but it ... look at it it's it's no one else's fault and the whole I Am the Ninety nine percent thing is it is a is a cop\nOut cop out\nSo what if you're not want it in the one percent of richest people you've got screwed\n... life cheated you if you're not a ... a millionaire a billionaire what what kind of attitude is that I mean who wants to hire somebody who's already thinks\nBecause I'm not a millionaire I've been screwed boy that's a that's a great attitude to start out with no job no insurance on food stamps\nAnd twenty thousand in college that by the way that's a generational thing too because the people over a certain age if they were on food stamps had never tell you\nThey wouldn't want you to know\nBut what does that mean when you see that what what what what is that little kind of post meanwhile who are they angry at\nAnd again I'm not trying to pick on somebody who's now but didn't you pick a degree that or follow a path that was unlikely\nTo lead to a lot of job offers me not to say that if you picked another degree you could get you could get a degree that sounds and scenes very practical and you might still be unemployed [noise]\nJust because it's the luck of the draw 'em or the economy but I don't know [noise] you're majoring in fine arts and it never occurred to you during that time hey this might not be\nA money maker I posted on Facebook and a lot of comments on it just different people with observations about it but again I I've never really understood to whom the anger was directed society rich people the one person how is this the one percent fault\nYou know what what did they do that\nCaused her not to be able to get a job at age twenty five and by the way if you're twenty five and you don't have a job it's not over\nYou know I mean you're starting out I wouldn't give up

of you agree to\nOkay but please don't I don't want him paying your dad's okay it gets weird okay I I absolutely I didn't see it like that yeah it's just possible\nDownside is all there and the upside is very little if\nYou get to the point that he has extra money the weddings covered and he's debt free and he wants to pay on me that's just ... big pile of cash in on September the thirtieth write

life\nAnd your money Dale is with us in Kansas City Hi Dale how are you\nPoint it's like it's going to work all day sure what's up [noise] [noise] well I'm Wondering if I Need more life insurance that I have okay\nHow much do you have\nA have a two hundred and fifty thousand okay what's your household income sorry what's your household income a hundred and eighty what do you make a hundred and fifty\nOkay and you have two hundred and fifty in life insurance and how much in your nest egg do you have in wealth um and investments\nAre more debt free of the home and land mhm and that's worth about one point eight mhm and then I have about four hundred thousand and four ones and Ross\nOkay good and uh what do you owe on the land and home\nUm that's what I that's what I have done for you know Thirty years\n\nWould there be a tax implications on the money are we pulled out\nVery doubtful and the reason is is that your basis in a cash value policy for tax purposes\nThe the in other words what you paid into it is everything you paid into it throughout the entire time the policy has been open so if you add up all the premiums that you've ever paid you don't even get that much out and so you really end up with a law she can't ride the loss off but you end up with having put more into it\nThen you get out so there's no gain now\nYes um and it happens about five percent of the time with an old with a very very old whole life policy\nThere it is possible that the cash value is greater than was paid in which you would only pay taxes on the difference and so you know you used the figure eleven thousand so if you if you found out that the all the premiums added up to only ten thousand than you'd pay taxes on the one thousand dollar difference will be still do it\nRight\nThere in Ninety five percent of the time Ninety eight percent of the time they lose money 'cause they suck you don't make money you know and so you end up losing money on the transaction and of course that's not a taxable event when you lose money no question about that Catherine is with us in Danbury, Connecticut Hi Katherine our you\nHi Dave I'm doing good how are you\nBetter than I deserve what's up\nUh my husband and I just got married in August and we're combining our finances and everything else [noise]\nUm and I can pay off all I think that we get paid off his car like three days ago hey yeah yeah mine should be paid off by the end of this year which is great\nUm and then next thing we're going to tackle something um I write for property on 'em and then after that was good I tell the\nMarkets that we live and so why planning on saving up for three to six months I found that I can say fine\nBut we're not sure how much we can save ...\nWhere two income family obviously we have no kids on but if they thought that my tenants me and my rental property fat out require like really different amount that if I have to sell we're trying to figure out how much safer may\nWell given that you have two properties that can have stuff breakdown on them um you could set up in your rental accounts some savings just to cover the rental issues a vacancy or repair I assume you keep a separate account free rentals do you know\nI can match oh is that\nOkay I Would I Would open up a separate checking account just for the rentals and but pay all the bills associate with rentals out of that account only and then um and of course by the payments out of there put the rents in there and then you can tell if you're making money on the rentals 'cause what's left in the account as your profit right\nRight that's a taxable a that's a portion is going to be taxable each year\nBecause everything else is going to be deductible all the expenses associated with it and you can keep some money in that account\nTo cover vacancies a or to cover repairs and I might keep that to do it that way and separate from my emergency fund and then 'cause that's like a business over on the side it's like a small business right off okay and then I'll but then at home I Would have three to six months of expenses there not counting the rentals\nUm because I got the rentals covered in the rental account than you're okay over there um and you know if you've got two incomes and you're pretty stable it sounds like you're doing really well and you're paying attention you might be okay with the three months out of the three to six months of household expenses as your\nYou know as your game plan and and and so forth some good question thanks for joining us Joe's in Austin, Texas Hi
