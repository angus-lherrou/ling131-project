if you talk to a stockbroker they're going to tell you if you see a fixed indexed annuity run from it run from it run from it\n[laughter]\nThey're going to tell you the fees are too high they're going to tell you the commissions are too high they're going to tell you that the contracts are too difficult to understand and so now I'm going to break it down a fixed indexed annuity\nSome have fees some don't but I was sure use the fees though to even begin to measure\nIn the cost that you're going to be paying through most of your mutual funds your stock funds your different growth plans I was sure you that that's not going to ... your fees would be that much\nOkay but we're all talk about the fees later on in this program a fixed indexed annuity by definition is a financial insurance instrument\nOr an insurance financial instrument you're buying insurance to ensure your money\nTo ensure that your money will never be lost that you can't lose your money you can't lose your principal and you can't lose any of the interest that it earns\nThat it's right in the contracts\nYou see and it's done that way because the law states that an insurance company with a fixed indexed annuity they have to match your money dollar for dollar when you put your money into a brokerage firm and the stocks bonds mutual funds while you know what happens\nYou're you're at a hundred percent risk a hundred percent risk while you're at a hundred percent risk that means everything you have can be a last\nWe're going to hold right there because we're going to take a brief break and we're going to be right back in just a few moments and when we come right back I'm going to continue on about that\nGod Bless you this is pastor for the senior pastor over for women's Bible church right here in San Antonio\nMy dear friend last hospice and I started a new video podcast\nThat I Want to encourage all of you to come and pay attention to [noise]\nAnd there's a severe difference\nAnd I'm grateful and

in the eyes to see\nYeah I'm Lance hospice I tell you I'm a cigar smoker I've been smoking cigars for the last twenty six years and\nIf you're a cigar person and you really enjoy am I gotta tell you about a place here in San Antonio is the rebels cigar company the largest cigar lounge in all of a south\nTexas has a boutique gourmet cigars humid or at the front of it and this one eight eight for seven redlin road just north of sixteen oh four one eight eight for seven redlin rode the largest cigar lounge in all of south Texas boutique gourmet cigars humid oriented this place has giant\nSmoke heaters throughout is filled with leather furniture gaming tables shuffle board and the beauty about those smoke eaters is that you can enjoy your favorite stick and not be in a big cloud of smoke one eight eight for seven Redmond rode the red line cigar company\n[noise]\n\nBack I'm Lance office this is the radio show and as really slowed the show down for you because we now\nIf two hours and the information that we're going to be really relating to you is so vitally important that you can understand it so the fixed indexed annuity you can never lose any money in it is a financial instrument that protects your money against loss it also gives you a guarantee\nThat you're going to have an income that you cannot outlive for the rest of your life\nBut we're going to get into that part in just a little bit so the word fixed legally means\nThat the ... has to be a guarantee where you can never lose any of your money and you have to receive a minimum yield bond your money it can't be a zero\nCan't be a loss that is what fixed means indexed this is where it gets really interesting and it's a part that makes this stuff really fun indexed so\nMany financial advisers in the stock and mutual fund and treasuries world out there they're going to tell you if you go into the fixed indexed annuity you're you're not going to be able to take advantage of the market\nNot true\nBecause index demands that your money will work for you with the S. and P. five hundred the Dow Jones the Russell report\nUm the essence of the the uh the NASDAQ the foot sea the Barclays the pimco it's going to work with all those indexes so I'm going to back up going to go through that again\nAll of the five hundred not just a few all of the thirty in the Dow Jones all the five hundred to the U.S in the all of the thirty and the Dow Jones all of the NASDAQ all of the Barclays all of the Russell all\nOf anything that you're going to end the extra money and so if you have a hundred dollars you say\nI Want to have my money divided up so it's going to be a percentage will work with this index a percentage will work with that index of percentage work with this index a B C D E F G I Want a certain percentage allocated in these areas\nAnd some of your writing are saying oh my goodness I could never figure that out\nWe know that\nWe we get it that's what we're here for example to tell you something we can't figure it out either\nAnd I'll tell you something else those guys on Wall street they can't figure it out either it is a crap shoot it's going to Las Vegas and throwing the dice across that table and hoping that you come up all winter\nSo the beauty of it is is you spread the indexes across the board one's going to win who's going to win three is going to when you're going to be a winner if there's a loser in there doesn't make any difference you're not going to suffer the loss is just going to be an area where you won't make as much on it\nBut you're never going to have a loss never going to have a loss never going to have a loss ... that's the index is how the indexes work fixed never lose any money indexed\nMeans your money is going to work with the indices of the markets across the board according to how you want to spread it out with our help and being able to help you figure out which way you want to go with that when we talk to the home offices of the companies that provide these products see what's been working best for him\nWe do all that for ya annuity\nFixed index annuity what does that mean well and annuity is very simple it's a stipend\nIt's a stipend an annual or something that's going to pay you in income for lifetime and by the way these products are over two thousand years old not as you see 'em today\nOn the radio show on K TSA five fifty on your radio dial so\nLots of money lots of money is a terrible thing by the way I Want you to think about some when you're walking around and you have some money in your pocket and you reached down your hand and you pull it back out again in a few bills slip out on the ground\nUm is that money last well the only way of lost his if it goes down a sewer drain a roast curl squirrel comes it grabs it and he runs often eats it or something like that then that money's lost any other time when somebody runs by it picks up that money\nIs not lost his just reposition and\nSo when you lose money on the market place you have not lost money you've lost your possession of that money and somebody else has now taken possession of your money because you're gamble on those stocks bonds or mutual funds are treasuries that you put your money into it was a loser\nAnd you're lost it and now somebody else has it how does that feel I'm being sarcastic about it right now the tone of voice because it doesn't feel good I've been there done it been there done\nIt did it once didn't do it twice didn't do it third time didn't need to I found out that's not the way for me to go\nI don't want to own a bunch of real estate because I don't want to have to work in my retirement my retirement is for me to do something that I Want to do not run round fixing toilets loose faucets and tried to repair a roof so that I I can keep\nSome profits outta that real estate no no no no no that's not me that's just not me I Want to know that my money in my fixed indexed annuities\nAre going to provide an income from my wife my precious Robin after I'm gone from the earth after the lord has taken me home\nIf we she and I are ruptured out of this world and I just up and die\nOr I Want to know that she's taking care of the rest of her life and the only way as long as I've been in the money business the only way I can ensure that is if I could leave her Fifteen to twenty million dollars set up in a trust fund that would allocate that money to come out to her\nSo much a year so it couldn't be outspent and she's not a spendthrift but it's hard to budget money like that and it would take that much if I were to die and now I'm Seventy one my wife is young I won't say her age\nShe's not a kid I ain't married teeny bopper you know she's younger than me\nOkay and if she was to live to be eighty five Ninety years old or need help at the house to take care of her if I'm not here takes a lot of money to be able to do that so I have my money and fixed indexed annuities and the fixed indexed annuities will provide an income for Robin for the rest of her life\nMy precious little Robin for the rest of her life for as long as she lives and uh she passes away before she's used all the

doing this show my son and I for over a decade coming on Thirteen Years been in business right here in San Antonio for\nComing up on twenty eight years hard to believe but then it's hard to believe that I'm also Seventy one years old I stayed at the beginning of our last hour when we started out on this last hour I talked about what our core beliefs are not among go back and I'm going to re regroup on that do it again\nBecause it's important to as you're listening to the show that you understand\nWho I Am\nAnd who my son is who we are as a family my wife my children my granddaughter we all have a deep profound love for God and for our savior Jesus Christ and that's because we believe that everything we own everything we have\nEverything that we take advantage of as a gift from God\nWe believe it and we know it okay\nI Believe and I understand that I Know to the depths of\nMe with all my fiber of me all those little particles that have come together to make up me\nThat I Am a creation of God I started out on this earth is his creation I was born is his creation I was not born as his child\nNobody is nobody is born a child of God yeah I Do some preaching on here I Do some teaching on this financial radio show I'm not a preacher I'm a financial planner financial advisor whatever you want to call me that's what ... been doing it well coming up I'm twenty eight years\nBut\nI Believe that there's only one God there's only one God created the whole universe\nPut the stars up there the sun up there the moon up their\nCreated the earth\nCreated everything that's on this earth that walks crawl swims flies\nCreative mankind\nHe stayed at a couple of times in genesis that he was sorry he even invented that he\nThat he ever created mankind\nHe was so sorry that he destroyed all of mankind except for\nNOAA and those select family\nBut God does love us he loves us so much he loves his 'cause he has the desire to be loved and he loves it so much that he gave up his only be gotten son to die on the cross for us so that is we believe in him\nWe become his select chosen and\nWe can have everlasting life and now we become the adopted children of God now we're God's Children no longer his creation and all of\nOur sins all of our transgressions will be buried in the deepest sees deeper than the deepest sees and deeper than the deepest sense of the deepest sees never again to be raised and remembered that's a gift\nThat's the most precious gift mankind has ever received well that's my core belief now\nDown to what this radio show is all about this radio show is all about\nYour money and retiring\nIs your money in the marketplace jumping up and down all over everywhere just bounce in every where have you been getting concerned have you been getting scared about what's going to happen\nHuh\nYou know what's gonna happen if if Trump loses this next election coming up Trump's not going to lose the election but it's going to be a big loss for him if the Republicans don't win this November sixth election yeah it's going to be a big loss for the president\nHe's my president he's my president\nCan you think of anybody who's ever accomplished as much in that presidential seat has\nHe has no nobody ever has he is amazing what he has done\nHere is not saying look at him he's not even an aging through this most presidents that would have done what he's done in this past year and a half plus they had been warned of frazzled their haired be falling out they built rankled up\nThey all prone defied haired be all turning gray on them well we know why the Donald Sarah doesn't turn gray you know he has it taken care of\n[laughter] that's okay he is eccentric he is a billionaire and he's a self made billionaire that I ask you a question how dumb can a man be or a woman be that as a self made billionaire I don't care if they had little financial boost to get started\nQuestion is how they finish them he's finishing with all his money and more than ever started out with billions now I got another question for you how many presidents have ever stepped into that seat\nAnd done all things this man is accomplished and not taking anything but a dollar while they were in the presidential office there's been one or two one or two I don't think Kennedy took a pay check I don't think he did [noise]\nUm there's been one or two others that didn't when I was going to tell you right now the Clinton's did they took all they get and then so they're still taking but anyway that's another story\nI digress away from my financial radio show I Know it so [laughter] that's that's because I have to um just because I Can't stand it if it don't\nSo now let's talk about\nTop of your money like that is because they're giving you guaranteed the interest in advance of your contract\nGuaranteed interest rate in the vast of your contract they're not telling you you're going to get a guarantee of twenty two percent no but if you break that down over a ten year contract you're getting a little bit over around two percent per year on your money guaranteed right off the bat but the thing is if they're accumulating that money into one spot for you\nUp front that's why they can afford to do it\nBecause your money's guarantee you're ... you're you're putting your money to stay in there for a ten year period oh I don't want my money tied up for ten years hello listened to yourself\nYou don't\nI Know some people don't take offense to I'm Talking to you on the radio but it is what it is are you listening\nYou don't want to ... you don't want to\nTie your money up to know that you're going to have an income for the rest of your life\nRest of your life take care of yourselves\nDo you have insurance on your health insurance on your life insurance on your cars\nInsurance on your guns insurance on your jewelry\nThis is literally\nThrough insurance companies insurance on your money guarantee you that you cannot lose your money and giving you a guaranteed income for the rest of your life for as long as you live\nWow that's a winter\nNow\nWhat kind of money can you put into that kind of a plan you can put in four one\nK. money IRA money Roth diarrhea money cash money T. S. P. money\nOr you know set up money oh ... first money uh what do you have\nYou want to you got just stocks bonds mutual funds floating around out there\nWe can move that over for you know that's not a problem we can move all that for you get you out of that floating up and down horrible roller coaster I got to tell you I don't even like to ride up and I sure don't like to ride down so I don't go on roller coasters\nI don't like to write up because I'm always anticipating what is going to happen when I get to the top ...\n\nStock market is no different than roller coaster\nWhen you get to the top how many of your fast enough to jump out for that thing starts heading down again\n\nMany times it's not even a jump out spot because all of us are busy working why doesn't that broke or give you a call or manage your money to the point where he gets you out of that last possession of all it's the answer is as plain as the nose on our faces\nBecause they have too many people to notify and to manage and to take out of those positions as they go into a lost there's too many and the next reason is is because if they did take everybody out and closer buys accounts out or move their monies to another plan\nThey still may lose but as they take it out completely those guys don't get paid any more\nThey get paid while the monies in there even if it's losing\nTheir five hundred thousand dollars you lose a hundred thousand dollars you're down to four hundred\nThousand does that mean that your guy this manager money doesn't get paid any more no he still gets paid he just gets paid on a little less\nWhen your money goes into a fixed indexed annuity do I get paid absolutely I get paid but in my commission against your money no I'm not I get paid directly from the companies that we send the business end too\nSo we're literally red ink to the insurance companies me as an independent broker out here in independent agents I Am reading to the insurance companies do I sell security stocks bonds mutual phones funds treasuries you know all that kind of stuff you know\nI have a securities license no I don't want it could have had years\nAgo I've been doing this for twenty well come

money those guys that are selling that\nStuff they've made buckets of money on that stuff buckets they've made so much money that a lot of them don't even pay attention anymore there's a lot of good people out there doing that\nNot saying they aren't I'm just asking you do you have the tolerance\nApe dealing with the potential of your money being lost I Know it's a nice man or a nice woman has been helping you over there well I'm a nice guy to\nMaybe\nSome people think I'm I some people think I'm I'm a mean old man\n[laughter] yeah [laughter] they have way well\nI'm Seventy one years old

keep your money and preserve it\nFor the rest of your life I wanted to give you some things that you might want to be able to think about Ken I preserve my money for the rest of my life do I have sufficient income coming in right now in my out of debt\n\nDo I have enough income that ... that I said it's sufficient that will provide me an income so I'm never going to have to touch that this money\nAnd if\nWe give you a good situation you're retired military you're retired civil service and you have all these pension plans and all these different these different retirement plans coming into it and you have Social Security coming and we're a military community so I have a lot of folks like this you have income coming into your right\nBut your wife has never work or your wife has worked in a position where um\nShe has a limited amount of income make your wife teacher your wife has a teacher she doesn't get Social Security\nWhen you die what's gonna happen to the deficit of income and your wife's money when you die because all the years have gone away when she when you die she can't even get the Social Security\nShe may be able to get a portion of your military retirement and she may be able to get a small portion of your civil service retirement but not\nAll of it\nWe're going to discuss that soon as we come back going to take a short little break right

[noise]\nMy name's Lance Lance tapas give me a call two one zero five for five zero seven to seven two one zero five four or five zero seven\nTo seven this has hospice and associates my name's Lance Lance hops on tape TSA here in San Antonio Texas doing business boots on the ground like Ricky where he used to say boots on the ground right here in San Antonio Texas\nFor twenty eight years talking on this radio station for\nOver a decade over a decade\nGive me a call let's make it a point let's make an appointment now\nOkay let's make an appointment for you to come in sit down and see what we can do for you I'm challenging you call me now\nOr as soon as you get off the street soon as you get off the road called me two one zero five for five zero seven to seven let's make an appointment host your money's out there in the market you know it's going to come down\nYou just saw what happened\nThis year how many times has it gone down this year one time and there it was over eight hundred over eight hundred points at one spot eight hundred and thirty two eight earn thirty five a week before that it was down over five hundred points was that the first time this year no\nHow many other times to go down there are all ... the whole year's been up it's been a tough year\nBeen a tough year\nHowever seen this before yes again and again and again you remember two thousand date do you think that the world financial system has moved away from those severe questions have problems of two thousand they do really think that\nI don't I don't\nWhen I listen to the IMF and the IMF the international money fund says that there has to be and there will be a massive financial adjustment in the world because of the global debt of all the nations\nWhen I hear that kind of talk\nThat says to me Lance Lance you better not be keeping your money on the banks boy\nBetter not be having any money invested in these funds out there that are at risk\nI Need to be put more money into my fixed indexed annuities\nBecause in the history of the United states that I can remember and as far back as I can research in history with money annuities are the only things that's ever protected money not even a hole in the ground would protect your money\nNo because it's going to get moldy in rock go put it onto your mattress the mice and get it\n[laughter] [laughter]\nHave a fire to burn down [laughter] oh that's terrible thing I don't even want to think about that but you know no way you going to have you might protected historically\nIs in annuities that's what you need to do you want to know how you can get away from paying from paying taxes at the end of every year the Jim ... money called capital gains taxes you need to have a fixed indexed annuity\nDo you have to pay taxes on your money if it's in a fixed indexed annuity only when you use it\nOnly when you use it because it's tax deferred no capital gains taxes it earns tax deferred although some tax advantages for you I think so is a fixed indexed annuity magic no is it\nProbably one of the best financial instruments out there in the world for retirement\nAbsolutely it is absolutely well a fixed indexed annuity work with a trust yes will will trust work with a fixed indexed annuity yes it will\nDo you have a fixed indexed annuity in your portfolio probably not if you do and it isn't doing as well as you think it should be doing give us a call will review it will examine that we'll see if we can do better for you if we can't\nWe want that simple what do we charge you are in our offices of the nothing what do we charge you in our office for a commission nothing we get paid directly from the companies that we do business with\nSo this comes down to something is very very very very basic do you want to know that you can have your money guaranteed to not lose you can get a guaranteed interest rate on it in one plan\nYou can get a guaranteed bonus on it in another plan and then another plan you can get a guaranteed interest rate and a bonus\nAnd in another plan I can get you as much as ... percent plus a bonus ten percent a year every year on your money and guarantee you that you can't lose any money\nI Would think right now the only thing stopping you from doing that would be that you don't have my phone number yet and that phone number to get an appointment to come into\nOur office which these appointments they run out fast but the phone number for that is two one zero five for five zero seven to seven now\n\nThis isn't something you can rush head on into we understand that you need

him I Know where you're going it's a great idea Holly if\nThey so yeah that that's for forgetting about selling anything uh should should I combine this step into one tax accountant early to lunch the next set texture can't\nIf I were doing this myself\nAnd they told me that my lots were grandfather them I Would not under any circumstance change it because then you lose the grandfather and if you put it under your one tax definitely but\nIf you are not planning on selling knows you know but it doesn't matter there his heirs may sell it at some point and it's worth a lot more money having to individual lots to sell because those are extremely\nWorth of tremendous they're very expensive lots worth a lot of money so under no circumstances unless there\nWas no way to get around it then I Would combine of one but I Would not\nDo that because I think those both lots are grandfathered and you'll be able to sell them and have somebody put lots in their career airs will be able to do that down the road\nA lot on the house and take cash for on the couch next door\nI think that'd be absolute possibility\nOh and it gave me sitting and so that the last three quarter acre building not here
