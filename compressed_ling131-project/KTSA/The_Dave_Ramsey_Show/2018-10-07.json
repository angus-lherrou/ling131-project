him work I Would have gone to the for the Texas financial advisor we're talking about some building blocks for a rock solid retirement\nPencil Brooklyn let's talk about if we're not quite in return of you will do to close up there you know how well you know what cost will be two years down the road going typically are more expensive I Would imagine\nWell you're guaranteed to have certain expenses and retirement for things like your basic necessities that your shelter food clothing medical expenses transportation\nThen we have discretionary spending and that's to maintain your lifestyle that you want to lead during retirement now we found that expenses do tend to drop a bit more in retirement compared to before retirement but that's\nTypically what we say so let me kind of slow down here and and tell you what I've I've observed I found that people right after retirement have these what we called the go go years where there they've got the freedom they have the\nAbility to take the trip go to China we had a client that went around the world on a cruise ship so those are ... years obviously that spending a lot more money but once you've done it it's kind of that bucket list you're you're done and then you have the slow go years\nAnd then of course there's the no go years so what we found is that we need to plan for as much if not more income at the beginning of retirement\nAnd then we can probably taper down but still be aware of what inflation could do to um our clients budget because if if our incomes not keeping up with inflation than we can get into a bind there so now keep in mind that while we all have good intentions habits are really hard to change\nSo have you been enjoying a certain lifestyle for decades\nMaking a dramatic switch come your retirement is hard for a lot of people so we need to be honest unrealistic with your spending expectations in retirement we want to make sure that you can live within that retirement budget and that your lifestyle expectations for your retirement are aligned\nWe've talked about this before on the show that we've seen kind of a wave of what we call the gray divorce and these are where people are getting to retirement\nAnd they're getting divorced because they can't agree on how their life is going to be and they don't have say work or kids to take care of to distract from that and so I don't want to see that happen I don't want to see people you know work their whole lives and work on their marriage and then they get to this point and\nThey have false expectations of what it's going to be like in retirement and so that's something that's another part of our to you if a financial free roadmap is just setting the expectations\nOf what retirement spending is going to look like now remember the first stage of retirement as we brought up can be costly\nAnd you typically have your health an addition to this newfound freedom\nSo the desire to spend your money early on on your hobbies your travel you say remodeling your\nHome it can run high and so we have to kind of again rein in those expectations and figure out how much can they actually spend on that so that you don't five years ten years down the road regret that you spent that money at the beginning of your retirement\nThere are financial professionals out there that Dr upon helping people put their retirement

building blocks for a rock solid retirement\nAnd Brooklyn and the last time you were talking about the estimated cost retirement what are they really don't know much of the things with the cost down the road and all of that how does somebody then begin to take the steps and solidifying this retirement strategies\nWell you know for most people it's just getting organized right and it's\n... how you're saving how you're investing money now there are no quick fixes to this they've got to keep in mind that you're doing this to prepare for the next twenty or Thirty years I've been talking to a lot of our clients lately they've been taking breaks Silver Spring break with their their kids of their grandkids\nAnd the amount of detail and attention that they get to planning these trips it's amazing to me but I find that people don't even give a tenth of that type of attention and worry I guess into planning how they're going to spend twenty to Thirty years and retirement so\nThat's kind of the first step and again you may be totally on track\nI'm not saying that you're not that I find that there's always areas for improvement is just if you have the desire to do that now there are people out there that are total hot messes and we we have to really digging deep to get up on track and but there are other people that were just slightly tweaking things\nAnd it just having a a second pair of eyes on they're what they're doing whether it's their tax planning their estate planning other investment planning\nThat we're able to steer them in a different direction or give them a different idea are putting money back in their pockets that their unnecessarily paying you there for fees\nOr even you know there are unnecessarily taking risk just last week and that was a couple that they're doing everything was supposed to do they're saving exactly what they're supposed to savor the max that they can save within their budget but after the fees on their account they're only netting like a five percent return\nThat they're taking a lot of risk you know I mean they could lose as much as twenty percent if we go through another market correction like we did in two thousand and two thousand nine\nSo we just really want to have that checked there to figure out what is going on and you have all these good intentions but what if you're not adequately\nProtected and I know what you're thinking I understand I Know it's kind of almost like drinking from a fire hose it just seems very overwhelming and sometimes it just feels like it's too much information\nI asked why I called Brooklyn trimmer willing\nWe've got big plans and she knows it's not my job a lot of the whole universe is my job to wind up the little corner of the universe that belongs to me\nDo you have big things to do let's talk in Texas line angel advisory made for for need three two Seventy four sixty nine and a four four three two Seventy four sixty nine more taxes financial advisor young I'm\nAn angel in life\nMagazine touches financial advisor showing more going with the return of news network and I'm here with the president and CEO of Texas financial advisor in Brooklyn generally Brooklyn shorter company in two thousand or do you have questions about anything you've heard\nThe number eight four four three two Seventy four sixty nine no costs no obligation of Saddam in Brooklyn on the team aid for for a three to Seventy four sixty nine\nYear old Brooklyn they're certainly things that are out of our control one we're planning for retirement one of those would certainly be market volatility we can't\nControl the markets we can't predict the market's going to be at their lowest wonder they're going to be at their highest\nYou know one day we're talking about it being in a new old time harder next week we're about or maybe it's an expert corruption which just right around the corner we don't really know where do you know there are some signs of you know positive and negative I suppose but what can we do Brooklyn to protect our strategy from the whims of the market as\nAs we discuss it it's important to know how your assets are allocated then I'll look at the entire portfolio your retirement accounts the investments that aren't on paper things like property homes any sort of second home or our investment real estate that you have your other holdings\nWe want to see if they're diversified too whether the periods of high volatility because it's gonna happen it always has the market's going to do one of three things at the guarantee it's going to go up is going to go down or it's going to go sideways we want to make sure their portfolio\nIncludes the ... the kinds of investments\nThat will that your circumstances whether it is putting your money in the market are putting it into something safe and and guaranteed are looking at diversifying with insurance products are real estate so these are all things that we consider when we're helping our clients put together their retirement strategy\nNow while diversification doesn't guarantee a profit\nOr that you're not going to lose money it can help you safeguard your ... from the effects of a dramatic market volatility swing and in my opinion it really reduces your chance that you're going to panic and sell off your investments after a big stock market decline now\nHardest thing diversified is keeping inappropriate asset mix and and rebalancing that\nBeing proactive as far as your investments go and these are tactics that we utilize for clients that can be must help the most helpful especially\nWhen we have a volatile market now yes there there's always that scare factor that the market's going across like it's done in the past right I mean I've been doing this well over a decade and I have seen\nMore bad than I've seen good years when it comes to the stock market but we've got to think long term and and not necessarily a year to year or even months and months we wanted we want to look at it in a holistic fashion because again if you're gonna be retired for twenty or Thirty years\nYou don't necessarily want your immediate and Tom fluctuating let the market but it's okay to have money\nThat is earmarked for income five years from now ten years from now that can fluctuate with the market swings now there's a variety of factors that's going to influence the market right it can be anything from the from politics to elections to the price of oil the health of foreign economies around the globe\nWe have interest rate hikes um and then we have interest rate cuts are the potential essay corporate news\nSo this list goes on and on and those things those world happenings either locally or across the globe affects your money a lot of the reactions that we that we see have to do with the uncertainty\nAnd what a what may be a head when one week and has every chance of becoming a Taliban attack\nNow most of these news items and sets of that market bonds are not fully understood or played out all at once instead it's a process and not a very straightforward one at that\nYou know there's so much to consider about determining what the market can do and what could happen to our money if it doesn't go the way we wanted to how do you help Brooklyn your clients are addressed those types of concerns\nWell it it's pretty much an imperfect task to try to determine what the market's going to do that's why it's so prudent to lay a building block\nOr a foundation for a sturdy retirement strategy and having the strategy in writing that you can refer to that you can revisit and discuss with your financial professional on an ongoing basis especially when the going gets tough out there in the stock market\nYou want to have diversification in their assets and make up your retirement nest egg so that they\nAren't exposed to wild swings in the market that's what helps gives you confidence and the discipline to just tune out the noise\nIf you want to be absolutely sure that you have enough income coming in every single month to cover your expenses\nLive the kind of lifestyle that you have a map and and work so hard to do and so long to save towards now is your opportunity to come in and get your personal life and customize TEFA financial freedom road that now this is not something that's generic are cookie cutter\nIs customize your unique needs and goes now we do limit the opportunities and\nNext week so the first and colors on our show today so if you've saved at least two hundred fifty thousand dollars for a time it give us a call it a poor for T F a show to get your personal life TSA\nFinancial freedom roadmap again that number is eight for for a three to Seventy four sixty nine oh us right now a for for a three to Seventy four sixty nine\nShorter some of the different types of a nude is out there I Know you like a few of them but you don't watch almost well er nurse bottle how many thousands of different annuities author\nWell it's not about you know I Want to say pretty neutral here mark 'cause it's not that I don't like them because it's more about there's better fit for people have always said this before that there is no bad investment is this may be a bad fit\nAnd now some they give the annuity worlds a bad name are those high feed ones like the variable annuity and the reason that so prevalent is because\nOf the institutions that are license to sell them um that something that you can get through pretty much any sort of financial planner our our bank that his license to sell securities and in that we see clients paying three four five percent every single year and fees\nAnd their money is still fluctuating with the market so that's that's where I kind of have a beef I don't want our clients paying too much for their investment vehicle\nThe other one that doesn't sit well with me is whenever the client puts their money into it a program and essentially commits a new aside where and that they they die and they have not taken all their money back out the company keeps their money\nAnd so those are the two one two types of of annuities that\nThat again don't sit well with me and I see 'em all the time\nBecause marketing is very prevalent with those type of products and so it's something that you see when you open up the A R P magazine\nWhen you're watching Fox News when you're you know just watching ABC I mean it doesn't matter that I see these commercials for those products and people don't understand what the overall experience is going to be and what they're giving up\nNow there are some that are new and he's out there and there are some that operate just like a CD would and that their fix they give you a fix return for six six period of time with no fees\nAnd then there's some that that are we call your hybrid or your index annuities and with those\nYou don't have any market risk um you have protection of principle\nAnd for some of them you have guarantees on that that you're going to earn a set amount every single year but you also have the opportunity to link your money to the market and make money if the market goes up and I've I've experienced this was my immunities with my parents and ... my clients annuities [noise]\nUm you know we're doing client reviews right now that are looking in their gains for two thousand Seventeen thousand you know early doesn't Eighteen and we're seeing really nice returns on those products and some of them actually outperform the market because they gave them\nI'm an extra bump as far as the crediting strategy and I know that sounds really complicated and it it's mumbo jumbo really if you're not if you're not invested in it but that's something that we consider and were able to show you your different options that are available so if you have an annuity right now and you\nDon't really know what to do with it now is a good time to come in for a second opinion if you've been considering it or you just heard a lot of buzz around it good or bad again we're great for him to talk to in order to look at it from an unbiased circumstance because where we as by law we have to do with your best interests\nAnd there's many times I tell clients you know I mean\nThey they asked me like they tell me I Want to buy this annuity because they've done their own research and I tell them that sounds great but for your current circumstances it's not the best move for you maybe in five years from now or ten years from now but again it it it's just contingent upon the clients\nAnd you know I've seen this firsthand with my own family and my my grandmother\nShe she had cancer but um again and she ended up passing away from it but you know she was sick for a long time and ... and my family went through all of our assets to pay for care and at the end\nOf the family members are having to chip in to pay for her care because there was nothing left um and so you know that the odds are as you get older you're gonna need more help and so how are we going to pay for that and you know depending on your circumstance\nMaybe just a standalone long term care policy makes sense maybe it doesn't because it just may be too expensive our um the premiums will go up um over time\nSo what we found and this is what's exciting about the investment world is that in order to attract retirement dollars\nThese insurance companies have become more competitive and they've created products that are um almost like a bogus so I buy one get one free and that you could use utilize the income stream\nFor home health care or long term care so let's pretend you had bought an annuity and it was going to pay you a guarantee three thousand dollars a month well if it has a long term care writer home healthcare writer on it you could possibly increase at three thousand dollars up to six thousand dollars a month\nBut if you didn't need it you weren't paying for something that you didn't use\nOn the other side we've seen life insurance policies that that provide a home health care a long term care benefit and then a lot of people think well gee why am I buy life insurance I'm sixty five sixty six I'm Seventy five\nBut if you're able to leverage your money and let's say the death benefit is a million dollars and the insurance company allows you to use that million dollars while you're alive as living benefit for home health care long term care\nThat they make a really you know a lot of good sense because of course if you don't use it you've now passed off a million dollars of tax free money to your\nState so these are all you know a different type of perspective to utilizing insurance products for a long term care home health care and these are types of products that provides flexibility with your invested funds you haven't lost control\nIt's not turned in and turned into use it or lose that scenario and and with these long term care benefits it can help ah with the costs associated with long term care\nNow of course they can't guarantee is going to cover everything because as we know the costs of long term care it's going up about five percent every single year but we can at least help subsidize and\nNot totally deplete you or your retirement nest egg or your your life savings in order to cover your care now when it comes to your financial future coming up short with your monthly income during that time it is not an acceptable outcome\nYou deserve the assurance um that these sources from what you intend to draw your income such as your ... your Social Security and the like will provide you the means to live the lifestyle that you desire throughout your retirement years\nNow so you have a vision for your retirement if you want to dictate how

not want you to know called eight six six seven for nine seats that's eight six six seven for nine seven two three three\nSo like I said there are two purposes for money spending the money while you're alive or leaving the money to those left behind by far the most significant purpose of money is income is one thing to not leave your beneficial\nSandy money when you're gone but it's a disaster to outlive your money in fact studies show outliving retirement income is feared more than that now the purpose of your money is life there are only two plans for that purpose one is called a plan for debt that is called a plan for life\nIf you have a broker financial planner that isn't an expert and plans for life I Am certain you are in a plan for debt\nWhat is the plan for death when it comes to your retirement income\nHere it is you save up your money and invest in something that promote provides a hypothetical non guaranteed rate of return or short term guaranteed rate of return\nIn other words you have no guarantees for long term gross you might hope for a seven percent compounded growth but after fees market downturns rate expiration and so forth you have no idea what kind of return you're actually going to get\nIn fact you don't even know if you're going to get a return because the next two thousand they might be right around the corner\nYou save up your money hoping that grows in some point you decided to retire you start drawing from those accounts [noise] how much should you drought for present three percent or do you just drop them out you need and hope for the best\nThe problem with that plan is your hypothetical growth is combined with an arbitrary spend down for your retirement accounts you have no idea of this plan is going to work and you don't know how long you're going to live\nIf you die sooner than you thought you spent you little if you live longer than you thought you were probably run out of money before you die in order for this plan to have any chance of success you need to plan on dying by a certain age that is why we call it a plan for death\nDo you want to plan for a living or plan for dying\nIn a second I tell you about a plan for life and if you want to find out specifically how no market risk plan for life would apply to retirement call me now and I can show you a better way to live\nAway towards lifetime income account that doesn't wasted away by fees that comes with up front bonuses of up to seven percent or more which will never shown any market losses no matter how far the market falls and provides

people want a retirement plan that requires them to die early but that is what most retired people have why is that the same reason why there was a Great Depression\nWhile I was there a Black Friday why was there a tech and housing collapse is because everything in Wall Street and their brokers cell is designed to crash including your retirement plan\nThat is why do things differently I don't use income plans for death with my clients I use what are called plans for life in other words you get a guaranteed rate of return a guaranteed payout on your money for the lifetime of income and you can live as long as you want because your income never stops for the rest of your life\nYou can never outlive your income even if you choose a joint option which guaranteed to pay for you and your spouse's life\nNo market risk plans typically outperformed the hypothetical expeditions up plans for death the guaranteed reader returned can be much higher than the ... returns of stocks bonds or a fixed interest account and more importantly guaranteed lifetime payout is higher\nWhy wouldn't you choose the planet typically pays out more on a guaranteed basis than what you would hope for a

actually show any type of lakes in your system I mean it is pretty thorough but what we're looking for it or really shows us of those are the open spots or at any water coming in so you know we we really relied ON Technology to make the uh the appointment time efficient yes we understand that everybody's busy\nAnd uh you know your your time is important and so you know usually the point that like there's sort of a uh inspection can take what thirty forty\nFive minute and it depends on the the complexity of the roof I'm like I said you know going back to the the two of you know I'm Talking tuna tuna tuna um once we do a point now says the roof would you uh addicts inspection then at that time we're going to give you a recommendation so yes we we do sell repairs\nBut we also want to combine that with that you know why is because you may not be to the point where you need a full roof replacement but you know what we I you know Tim and I we we got there we we talk to you and say you know what I think we can buy a little bit more life into that route\nSo would we do is we fixed that lead you may have called the ... you know initially we'll fix that leak and on top of that\nWe're going to see all your pipe that a pipe jacks will do all your Vance we'll we'll seal your ... flashing will replace any damage missing shingles rage caps we're going to look at your roof or going to add life too that route and I'm\nYeah and no yeah not everybody needs to get you know we we Tim and I go to customers and there's nothing wrong with the roof we're in we're not there to say hey there's something wrong you know we're there to give you an expert opinion because this is what we do for a living will look at roost you know and and um it's so crazy because a\n... or I drive now look at just look at roofs right ... neighborhood a look at that route\nAnd that we see that here we can't tell you what do we need to get a monitor of this repaired it either yeah I get a little you know revered as out of your uh\nOut of out of your truck for that right yeah so oh you know we do we take roofing Syria said a yard that we really worked hard to be a good at it and uh you know I'm very blessed with the a staff that we have we have to project managers with years of experience and\nThey had been doing this stuff for I Believe what one is Seventeen years yeah uh and and the all the way from metal fabrication\nAh he was actually on the field actually doing roofs and now he's a project manager that oversees the job so that's that's something to be said when you actually have a project manager actually has done the roofing jobs industry and is knows what to look for\nYou know we really got to bring one on hairdo for the ... those real real technical questions because whenever you I'll stop us or give us a question or we get a lot of emails uh\nThere's a lot of times we have to go to want to have an answer but er yeah and that we have Eric has a new team member and a really a just a bit I ... ... tons of experience\nAnd he is reading or a tune up team that goes out there and not getting their doctor about four to five of these refer to that ... days icon times it just depends\nOn how much needs to be done on the roof sometimes it's you know can I can take all day it just depends on the complexity of the job how Steve the job is you know if you have a steep route takes a little bit more time\nRight right and they were when they pull up though I've been there for their safety vest oh yeah harnesses and fifty that went down to the real professional and they talk about also uh the uh the cleanup process that's really amazing that's the upkeep\nYou know that's the beauty of of our company too is that\nYou know when we when we go and tell you how it's you know we paint a beautiful picture of how it's gonna how it's going to go but you know it it actually does happen so during the ... process we do have a dumpster that actually we dump all the debris and we do a magnetic sweep around the commitment or to catch me now is because of the last thing we want to do\nIs have children or your pet step on males so we do a full ... sweep around the perimeter\nAnd then the next day when we when we do this the the install will do a complete ... a dream pick up again we'll look at the neighbor's yard make sure that there's no Bree Bree in their yard will do a fool inspection metal detectors yeah your worst metal\nDetectors of their head we're in a caller id ah William about bloodshed I thank you for a call into the show at what well how can we help ya\nYeah I was ... I ... in the road you in the new ... who will look what they'll do like our life I Want you to ... when the thirty year\nA ruthless with who\nYou get your life when you weren't you Thirty years\nNow the their lifetime warranty is through the manufacturer what so what do we became a mass Charlie\nWe also we buy assault policy protection such a true weren't the labor material and it's actually fifty years\nSo that I mentioned all side yes and that's going to be for your dimensional shingles and then we do have metal roof ... their lifetime has consider a forty year\nBut there is a they they all do have a hard number of them are a three ... the ... like the builder structured grade shingles they're they're getting about twenty five year warranty\nBut because we're applying six nails are the components of the underlying Mets were able to give them a twenty five year on the labor and material portion of that\nOne and uh when I'm just a just a kind of elaborate a little bit uh the reason why we're able to offer a great warranty is because we're a G. F. master elite so less than two percent think about this less than two percent of the roofing companies are naturally but we are\nAnd then he's on the whole entire country I mean ... ... and that and that and the reason why we are is because we're trying to set ourselves apart from everybody else you want to make sure that if you select roof decks to do your job you're getting what we promise and that's what that's that's a fifty year labor and material warranty that\nAir and also if you got to root for a bus at and you've got this warranty\nOr if you you still need that peace of mind let's say it was a few years ago\nOr you could call us anytime is scheduled set up a free inspection\nAnd we we like to inspect our customers ... and you're late but we do get a customer that might want to call says hey the flash wind or a hero whistling in the attic or any concerns\nYour call us up and uh\nYou know our office staff as designed to you know all they need to do do your address and your name bears do paperwork that you've got to dig up there is no way you lose the warranty if I if we make it real simple and I've I mean if you ever have an issue\nWhere real quick to respond to it but it's a great solid ... and you know there is somebody I've had somebody warranties out there\nYeah and and and uh and William before before you go I Want to make sure you know that with that golden pledge warranty that we offer the G. A. S.\nIt protects you it it it's more manufactured just do a ... because ultimately you know we're here to his roof excess here to stay we're not going anywhere but let's just say you know hypothetically you know we're out of business in two years whatever the case may be\nThat golden pledge warranty is for fifty years so let's just say we got a business you still have that warranty through G. A. S. so what they would do is they would actually find another mass release contractor to do the repairs so I buy at\nThe same level of experience read al ... and so that's that's a that's a good piece of mind to have you know I tell you the jail yet they're real strict about their program and here they read into it and uh so it was a it was a lot of hard work and just there\nJust to get just to make sure we're here to stay you know roof excess hair is correct and I just want to let you know it's more of a peace of mind for you for the customer you\nKnow William did you you had worked out by us is that correct\nNo law and you're on your just came off the bent on you know [noise]\nOkay gotcha gotcha gas several women\nOn ... ... when we go to other ... okay you're not alone you know but what I ... or ... or the life of orange\nMetal ... correct you on your cell or\nThat's that that's that what you just said right there is the key and the no other roof or ... no other roofing company can give you what we can that is now is the line right there\nAnd and and you know ... even if you go out of business ... ...\nAnd and I can't stress what we talked about earlier in the show about terms and conditions\nTake their beds and they gave you had read those terms and conditions because\nYou know again to those trucks were they pull on your driveway you know we we document the driveway before we pull on it and we're looking for driveways that have water issues like water crevices underneath because the trucks 'cause sometimes they too heavy\nBut it's also the stuff we always tried to get the shade goes up on the roof to save the hard work it takes and the and the safety issues\nWe use we use a little louder elevators a we have to but you know we don't want our guys carrying does big heavy bundles up to the top\nOf the roof so we do everybody's going to try to stay jump up on the roof of just got to be careful of the liabilities but another thing is\nWhen you are lucky got roofing you know a lot of rivers are at the same price but\nYou know its components that go with that risk that make that roof work if the underlying lets the\nWater barrier and water shield now your retribution middle daughter strip that prevents the it gives you a hundred and thirty mile per hour wouldn't guarantee to underline it six Dell's Pershing do we know that there's a lot more that goes without roof that people really understand that and I and I like to hear that you said we're right in the middle because\nYou know that's one thing that we really try to strive for and bring our cost and and be affordable because there are other great roofing companies out there yet but there are kind of charging like they're great roofing companies you know what I mean their prices are really really expensive\nAnd William we're homeowners to we get it you know I Want to I Would always say is you know I'm pretty frugal a child my son is here today wherever he can tell you I'm pretty frugal NFL\nHey yeah yeah but uh anyways uh you know because I Want my best value enough you know I just had to put a seat at my house and yeah I had to search find the right company and\nUh but uh I I Do buy quality though and when you're with us we're going to deliver your quality package a real warm tea\nAnd you know that was thirty five hundred consumer complaints we were doing a a we're reading this over through the for the BBC be\nThe better Business Bureau put out a magazine article showed thirty five thousand consumer complaints here in San Antonio from roofers alone I mean it's just staggering number\nOf there is that not every referred does everything the same\nAnd they're real good ones seem to be real proud and really expensive and so we wanted to make it affordable so I'm Glad to hear that were selling all those components the package the warranty or take it all of that liability if we break something we're going to fix it yeah it's not going to come out of your pocket", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "city": "San Antonio", "day": "07"}
