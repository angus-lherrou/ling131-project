S. A. with the same exact mutual fund company if you want to and you can control every bit of that and control where the money's going how it's going how things work the whole deal so that's exactly what I Would that\nAnd um\nWell it turns out that hospital bill has fallen off of our credit report and because of that my husband than a trying with the idea of just not adding that to the debt now off\nAnd just continuing that men on payments or even not paying it at all and that scares me to death but I wanted to know from you what are the implications of doing something like that\nWhere there's two problems whether one is you actually owed them money so you should pay it\nYeah that's one problem the second problem is is that it's going to come back to haunt you just 'cause they're not recording it today doesn't mean they're not gonna take an active outstanding account and reported that any time and so right what happened what's happened is is\nThe collection agency that you're dealing with the collections company that you're dealing with I was just not downloaded their files to a credit bureau\nBut they could do that at any time and then you've got a bad mark not just a mark but a bad mark 'cause this is a defaulted\nThis is a bad bill it's not a current bill because they didn't offer you payments at the start they only offered your payments because you couldn't pay them right and you owe them the money and so ah how much is the bill\nI it's less than a thousand at that point\nOkay what I Would do is continue to pay them I Would continue to pay them the minimum wage and I would build up a you know a lump\nSum up three or four thousand and offer them that a settlement and let's get it settled in full and get it in writing\nOkay\nBut in writing settled in the fall and I I Would do that because it's already a bad mark on your credit and there's no telling how much they've added to it in collections fees and late fees anyway\nAnd so I you know I I Want to I Want to discount it a little for those reasons in those situations but just to ignore it because it's currently not showing up on your credit bureau is on was because it will end up showing up again\nAnd on top of that you owe the bill so clear the bail move on with your life it's worth it it's worth the trouble to address a good question thanks for calling in Tanya is in Lexington Hi Tania welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHello thank you for taking my phone call sure what time I have I have a question I Am Seventy years old and I'm getting ready to think about taking the payment option for tax shelter anybody [noise]\nUh and I wanted to know what would be something like the best option and I went I took her a annuity out my thinking was take a lifetime monthly benefit [noise] mhm [noise] and so then when I went to uh Africa about it they gave me a several other options [noise]\nI'm from the other options for to take a fixed\nAnd they were the monthly income which should be lower but it would include a long term care policy no\nA neither one way to take another fixed and the lady with a nursing care on policy no or another option but to take a tenure certain with which would be lower premiums are non you're alive and then it went right to be a higher premium\nNo okay let's go with a F none of the above um and\nSo uh [laughter] the anytime you started weaving in these other policies with it that's going to entail extra fees and garages\nNotice I didn't even ask but I'm not didn't even ask what the numbers are when that's on the insurance world what we call those bundling and there's only one time it was only one time bundling works to the consumers advantage and that's when you put your car insurance or homeowners Richards together\nThat often works to your benefit but the rest of this stuff is gimmicky gotcha garbage and so that I ... and you have a good you have a good nose on your kiddo [noise]\nSo what I Would tell you there's I Would tell you the check with an investment advisor like one of the smart vest her prose and talk about just rolling this into some a very low risk low volatility mutual funds and then just pulling an income off of that\nI think you'll end up with more money alive and dead doing that then you will\nMessing with this new witty because the other thing that you can be sure of with an insurance company or an investment firm\nAnytime they give you a guarantee that means they're giving you less than you could have made if you didn't have a guarantee okay oh ... and so I you know it's like with your home you didn't get a guarantee when you bought your home\nNo guarantee it's going to go up in value or down in value either one no no insurance on backing your home no no FDIC insurance on the value of your home and yet you felt really comfortable taking that quote unquote risk why because well we can look at the track record of homes and be very comfortable with them\nAnd if I could find a mutual fund that I was comfortable with\nIts track record it's volatility as I was one of your home at Seventy years old or something like a growth in income ponder balanced fund that kind of a thing that's probably where I'm putting my money\nIf I'm you at Seventy um and it wouldn't be anywhere near an insurance company and I so I'll be rolling this whole thing over into something else\nChecked smart

C. A. at the Supreme Court\nFurthermore judge cabinet posts approach towards the doctrine of separate belote is narrow\nWind up part of a statute is challenged on constitutional grounds he has argued for severing be invalid laws as surgically as possible while allowing the overall law to remain intact\nFence was his approach in his to send in a case that involved a challenge\nTo the structure of the consumer financial Protection Bureau in his dissent judge cabinet I argued for quote severing any problematic portions wells and leaving the remainder intact\nAnd quote given the current challenge is to be a ca proponents including myself up protections for people with pre existing conditions should want to justice who would take just this kind of approach\nAnother research and that I heard often is that judge Kavanaugh cannot be trusted if a case involving alleged wrongdoing by the president were to come before the court\nThe basis for defense arguments seems to be two fold\nFirst judge Kavanaugh has written that he believes said Congress should enact legislation to protect presidents from criminal prosecution or civil liability while in office\nMr President I Believe opponents miss the mark on this issue the fact that judge cabinet offered this legislative proposal suggests that the print he believes that the president does not have such protection currently\nSecond there are some who argued that given the current special counsel investigation\nPresident Trump should not even be allowed to nominate adjust to that argument ignores our recent history President Clinton in Nineteen Ninety three\nNominated Justice Ginsburg after the whitewater investigation was already underway and she was come first served Ninety six to three\nThe next year just three months after independent counsel Robert Fisk was named to lead the whitewater investigation President Clinton nominated justice briar\nHe was confirmed eighty seven to nine\nSupreme Court justices have not hesitated to rule against the presidents who have nominated them\nPerhaps most notably in the United states versus Nixon three next send up point keys who heard the case joining the ... opinion

are three of the four greatest Supreme\nCourt cases and the history\nWhy do they have in common each of them\nIs a case where Congress served as a check on presidential power and I would note that the fourth case the judge Kavanaugh has pointed to as some the greatest in history was brown versus the board of education\nOne cabinet dissension illustrates the point about the check on the president's

availability of contraceptive services for women\nWhile minimizing the involvement of employers with religious objections\nAlthough his critics frequently over and look at this point judge Kavanaugh's dissent\nRejected arguments that the government did not have a compelling interest and facilitating access to contraception\nIn fact he wrote that the Supreme Court precedent strongly suggested that there was a compelling interest in ... access\nTo birth control\nThere is also been considerable focus on the future of abortion rights based on the concern that judge Kavanaugh would seek to overturn roe v way protecting this race is important to me\nTo my knowledge judge Kavanaugh is the first Supreme Court nominee to\nExpressed the view that precedent is not merely a practice and tradition\nBut rooted in article ... three\nOf our constitution itself he believes set precedent is not just the judicial policy is constitutionally dictated to pay attention and pay the two roles of precedent\nIn other words precedent isn't a goal or an aspiration it is constitutional tenets that has to be followed except in the most extraordinary circumstances\nThe judge further explain that precedence provide stability predictability reliance and fairness\nThere are of course rare and extraordinary times where the Supreme Court which rightly overturned a precedent the most famous example was when the Supreme Court in brown versus the board of education\nThe presumption of innocence it's relevant to the advice and consent function ... accusations depart from it nominees otherwise exemplary record\nI worry that departing from this presumption could lead to a lack of public faith and the judiciary and with these huge damaging to the confirmation process moving forward\nSome of the allegations levied against judge cabinet illustrates why the presumption of innocence is so important\n\nI Am thinking in particular not of the allegations raised by professor for but if the allegations that when he was a teenager judge Kavanaugh\nDrug multiple girls and use their we can stay to facilitate gang re\nFist out last ditch alec cage she wants to put forth without any credible supporting evidence and simply pairs if public statements subscribers that's such an allegation\nCan find his way into the Supreme Court confirmation process it's a stark reminder about why the presumption of innocence is so ingrained in our American consciousness\nMr President I listen carefully\nTo Christine ... for testimony before the Judiciary Committee I found her testimony to be sincere painful and compelling\nI Believe that she is a survivor of a sexual assault and that this trauma has up and did her life [noise]\nNever left the for when it said she named could not

facts have raised more questions for instance since these allegations have become public professor poured\nTestified that not a single person has contacted her to say I was that the party that not\nFurthermore the PR faster testified that although she does not remember how she got home that evening she knew that because of the distance she would have needed or right\nYet not a single person

allegations fails to me the more likely than not standard\nThere for I Do not believe that these charges can barely per bad judge Kavanaugh from serving on the court\nLet me emphasize that my approach to this question should not be misconstrued as suggesting that I Want to sexual contact of any nature is not a serious problem in this country\nTo the contrary if any good at all\nHas come from this

one woman who had confided to me years ago I had no idea that they had been the victims of sexual attack\nI Am grateful for their courage and their willingness to come forward\nAnd I hope that in

days thanks for taking my call and I listen to you for a while\nI I have a problem that I'm hoping you can help me with my daughter who is bipolar just had a baby two weeks ago and she was living with a man\nWho had a family or his wife had died and he had three small boys to make it short she\nFind a way a lot of things that she shouldn't have one is taken out a couple of title loans on her car a road rubber check has credit card debt so to make a long story short she's got quite a few collection agencies after her\nShe can't be clear with me right now about how much she really does I don't know I Believe the acting it's over four thousand and less than eight I'm not I'm not sure but she's racked up a lot of that since last year\nShe ah [noise] is almost thirty four she will be next month like my question to you is she has no money I Do not want to pay her debts um what does she said a nice collection agencies I mean literally she has nothing\nTo lions ... she's still living with this guy you know he's in a halfway house he was on drugs were not as kids\nHis kids are now with one of his sisters and his mother\nSo she now as a single mom with a new baby on her own\nRight the the S. and Arizona gave myself and my husband uh the responsibility of taking care of the baby now and go wherever she wants but baby stays with me\nOkay now moved in with you yes she is living with me as a baby the baby on the mother correct okay good\nGood that's good news okay good so here here's the thing that um ... what you tell the collection agencies is is that she has nothing and so for now they will get nothing and that she's dealing with bipolar and you know you know she is what we in the business called judgment proof\nOh absolutely can sue your pants off but they can't if you don't have any pants and that's what it amounts to okay\nWell that's what I was thinking that she wasn't you know her boyfriend has said to me well I didn't make really find anything that she wasn't aware of but she can't make those decisions is what I've told them\nWell she she you know we've got to come back to that and the second book let's assume that debt is valid for us it's not that much and it'll probably be good for her work her way through it when she gets back on her feet\nWell she might even got a job right now I Know yeah I Know\nRussia when she gets back on her feet mentally emotionally is working\nYeah we're going to let her let her uh probably reap the rewards of her stupid ... in the middle of bipolar okay now having said that I work with we worked with bipolar for years people who have bipolar always end up in financial counseling goes manger\nScene with off from it for the past year and I realized she probably had her biological clock ticking going well mom and dad have always told me I shouldn't get pregnant on him he's mad because she's on two different men's every day so she's been off it from the bottom\nLine is ringing I'm line is is that with good counseling and with the proper balance of medication not over medication but not under medication um that that she can live a very normal life and make good decisions about everything child rearing financially and everything in a\nBi ever had you know but it can happen it can I address on what happens\nIs is that she's got to stay plugged into a properly balanced medication regime and plugged into counseling she has to want to be well\nYeah and if she does that then she can\nForm a very good life and we have folks do that but to the extent that I bipolar person doesn't do those two things you are never going to have a financial situation is solid yeah because when they go manic they just go bananas\nOh I Know I Know that I was in control of her checking account for most of her life and because of that I was able to gather enough money when she was working and she was able to buy a car a couple of years ago but\nThat never allows her to be anything except dependent upon you\nWrite I actually last January took myself off you know of of her checking out because\nHeart when I got ... got involved more friends obviously not a bright boy so um\nHe was doing drugs you know and and so he wasn't in his right mind the\nRest my case you got so [laughter] so bottom line is what I Would do if I'm her mom is I Want to\nParticipate in her healing financially emotionally getting back on track so that she can be a good mom to this baby and have a good life\nAnd make good decisions independence from drug addicts and independent for mom of eventually but if you can get her back I I don't want you to set up a checking account and you manage everything and not be perpetual but to do now that was yeah I mean but to do that to get her back\nUp and running again with the idea that you know we're going to hold the back of the seat until you learn to ride the bike and then we're going to let go to the seat again but you like go to the seat last time not because she was healthy
