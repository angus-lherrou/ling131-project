mind how we have some people that come into our office\nAnd they really want to understand the risks everything which is fine it's understandable but then they started going through this process of it's too hard to believe it's too good to be true and they have all these doubts and concerns about losing their money but yet then they'll turn around or they currently have their money\nIn positions of risk with our money isn't fluctuation in is being lost at that time and there's no questions asked and the problem is is that people out there in general in the world of investment had been so conditions\nAnd so I guess you'd say had homework I can use those conditions to be used a loss that if they don't have any losses there must be something wrong with that if my money is going to be at risk there must be something wrong with that because my money has to be at risk we're so used to having some kind of\nFault line that we're going to lose money somewhere that if we're not going to

to seven that's two one zero five four or five zero seven to seven you know folks\nYou've heard us talking about safety first in profit second you know how that's our basic philosophy you know we've been doing this a long time over twenty seven years in this business in this industry over twelve years on the radio with Katie essay and five fifty where you're listening to us right now\nBut we've basically determined that there's three basic steps to success three steps to successfully planning your retirement the first thing is we have to find a way to protect our money\nIf our money is constantly at risk\nIf our values are constantly fluctuate and when you're you're looking at Seventy five thousand next in your ear you're looking at fifty thousand in your portfolio\nIt's hard to plan for retirement like that so we have to find a way to protect those assets to make sure that those values stay the same or they go up and they don't go down okay that's the first step the second step is it has to grow\nOkay if we don't have any growth it's not going to do any good that money has to work for itself you've worked hard for your money we need to get your money working hard for you but what we're\nAnd that we have to keep it safe and secure you know when we utilize these fixed equity indexed annuities one of the biggest arguments that the marketplace as in the mutual fund guys the financial planners as they like to call them because they put your money into stocks and bonds and mutual funds all these different portfolios\nThey like to sit there and say that and they like to brag and boast about how yeah but when you put your money into those annuities you're going to be missing out on all the games the marketplace you know they're going to really ruin your portfolio because you're not going to be getting all those extra games of and the when the market swings up than another that well\nYou know it's interesting folks they always stress and they always strain about how you're going to be missing out on all the the larger gains right\nBut they never tell you the flip side of that coin do they\nThey never tell you about how well yeah if you move your money over there you're going to miss out on all the losses of the market place you're going to remove yourself from all the risk they never talked about that\nAnd that's exactly what effects equity indexed annuity does it allows you to participate in the game to the market\nWithout participating in the losses of the market\nAnd that's one of the reasons why the companies do set in caps and spreads and they limit your growth you participate in those games because your money is just linked to those marketplaces those indexes it's not actually invested like it is with the mutual fund guys and with those other financial planners out there\nSo instead of if if you want to ride with all the highs and lows that's your choice it's your pac take it but if you're out there and you're looking for a place where you can participate in some of the growth of that market place\nAnd never have to worry about the losses at the market place this is the place to be\nAnd we're going to show you some numbers on a second we're not going to be able to do it because it's not TV but we're going to walk through the numbers we don't have to do that on the radio because it gets a little confusing but we are going to walk through some numbers on some statements of ours from clients\nSo you can hear historical numbers and how to use it performed and how these have acted okay and you can go back into your own homework on those years and see how your portfolio performed and mashed up to it two one zero five four or five zero seven to seven as that number that's two one zero\nFive four or five zero seven to seven once again folks in San Antonio Texas that number is two one zero\nFive four or five zero seven to seven now when I started talking about that I said there were three steps to success for retirement plan incorrect three steps\nI went over the first one which was protect\nI went over the second which one is to build your wealth but we haven't touched on that third one and the third one is the most important step folks that's what we're all working towards do you want to work for the rest of your life\nDo you want to have to get up every morning and clock in flock out ... clock out just that we can keep your electricity trusted the on your water flowing a roof over your head and food on the table no eventually you want to be able to stop\nWell do you feel like Social Security is going to be enough for you to be able to live on just Social Security mostly out there saying no and you are correct you need something to fill those income gaps\nYou need income and that's\nThe most important step that third step is providing income\nThese fixed equity indexed annuities we're annuities and general folks to be honest with you very well into his fix dinner is fixed equity indexed annuities they're all designed to do one thing produce and income strength for you down the road\nNow fixed annuities going to get you there but it's just going to get to their slow because it just gives you that guaranteed low rate of interest a variable annuity will get you there but you just don't know where you're going to be at at the end of the road because you're going to be running with a marketplace in the fluctuation the ups and downs of the marketplace the fixed equity indexed annuities what fits in both of those fields\nAnd how his parents looked around Daniels

and the good\nNews is you're heading back to work on Monday and an economy that seems to be still somewhat white hot joining us now from ... dot com is more cameras into September numbers and you look at the the you know where it was it Nineteen sixty nine the last time we were here market this kind of level this is insane right\nThe Beatles were together when we saw that last and so yeah it's quite remarkable the unemployment rate down to three point seven percent now some point people are pointing out which is not\nA a philosophical a plane but rather a factual one out there that was the time of the Vietnam War and a lot of prime working age males were not in the workforce them so that probably is a different picture but nevertheless so the stats are the stats and so yeah it's worth celebrating the job market remains is robust at this point\nWhich is which is crazy so let's talk about the jobs are now you know\nSo we're at what three point seven percent and I always look at this like what's the ... what do you think the real job numbers are because you know when they say they're at five I usually say they're probably it's more like seven or eight percent because we have that wacky thing where if you're not looking for a job and you're no longer getting unemployment you don't count what do you think the real numbers are\nWell real is you know various from different people's point of view I mean they're all real and the sense that they have definitions on the definitions apply to you know metrics\nOr are there is another number or the or the Labor Department captures which basically takes into effect some of that what you're referring to and and that number actually rose a bit here to seven and a half percent but\nWherever those numbers are and we know there are a lot of people who have given up looking for work and there are people who basically don't qualify for either because of their\nHealth situation or some of that is opioid addiction but also the fact that they've been out of the labor force for a long time and their skills aren't as\nRelevant as they used to be we still have to measure the other part too and and uh you know I'm the first one to say well you know there's probably other people raising their hands too but you know I grew up in the mid west\nAnd uh the town where I hail from in Kansas has the highest unemployment rate in the state in the highest rate of opioid mortality my mom and dad a war from West Virginia we know what the story is there and my wife is from upstate New York Niagara Falls New York\nWhich looks like you know a bomb hit it so there are plenty areas the country that are are not faring well\nBut still a there are there other areas like where I sit here in the middle of Washington DC and other large cities across the country particularly those on either coast that are doing remarkably well so all these things fit together but they aren't elegantly fitting together that's for sure\nTalking to my camera bag dot com let's look at these numbers uh who did well and a ... and where do you see these job numbers heading as we head into the fourth quarter and spending and all of this stuff because\nThis is going to be vitally important as as we had there because a lot of people look at this fourth quarter as maybe the most important because we have Christmas shopping and spending\nWe think well in the year at a on a high note to the extent that are now it looks like growth for all twenty eight taint will be three percent much breaking above the long term trend which has been more along the lines at one point eight too so uh that's one thing though whether we can get past twenty twenty or when the benefit to the tax cut\nBasically go away and still have a higher growth rate that is something well all I Know that\nBut in terms of ending the year I think there's every reason to believe that we're gonna continue on this same fashion uh the job market continues to add about two hundred thousand jobs a month we only need to add one hundred thousand\nTo absorb the growth and the population and so every time we get a centrally twice that we are continuing to winnow away a thorough meaning so called slack on the workforce so I think there's every reason to be optimistic about basically the short end an intermediate terms\n... look at this and and I look at all of this across the board and I say to myself this looks this looks good this looks strong and then we get to the political side of things and I want you to listen to to what Don Lemon said the other night\nTeam from to tread very carefully here because when it comes to the economy Trump got a lot of inherited a growing economy a growing economy inherited it from his predecessor jobs are being created at roughly the same the average rate as under President\nObama wages are growing at about the same rate they did\nUnder President Obama\nThe left is never going to get Trump credit and when I was listening to this the first thing that came to my mind is\nMichael Jordan had other coaches before Phil Jackson as did Kobe and Shaq but they never want any championships till he showed up\nA Trump you know the left is never going to give them credit but the reality is is you know when is it going to be is economy and\nAnd it has he help the economy 'cause I think he absolutely has to help the economy not only from a point of how I think he's taken from the shackles off and let it grow but I've also think he's not the economy and the confidence level which rarely gets talked about\n[noise] well uh the obviously a lot they're a very complicated a ... and I'm generally hesitant to tried to get involved with a playing a well with either side when it comes to tribal politics 'cause I have very little patience for it\nBut having said that to try to answer the question\nUh you know the buck stops here at a you know on Pennsylvania Avenue and so it is Trump's economy now and it will be for as long as he's an office in the same holds true for when President Obama was an office shore a you know the president the current president certainly had a gift but he did not come into office\nWhen Iraq Obama came into office when you were losing seven hundred thousand jobs a month or you know we were all working then and and a new the horror of that [noise]\nAh and the fact that we were able to piece all that together at least as well as was the case in some ways it was a miracle because the economy nearly completely fell off a cliff back then um but the president did one thing I think which has been key to energizing growth and that was to advocate for the tax cut\nOr some people think that the personal income tax cut was number one um [noise] not equitable with respect to benefiting all aspects of the population or in other words have favorite the wealthy\nAnd people like Jamie diamond the C. E. O. J. P. Morgan Chase for these past fourteen years among others uh would say that he did not himself need a tax cut\nBut I think there's broad agreement that the piece that has to do with empowering business to do better on the world stage did need work and uh so I think the president and his Republican counterparts on Capitol Hill deserve\nUm the credit to the extent that they did advocate for abroad a bit of tax relief a which is helping the economy probably for the next couple of years so there's I don't think there's any getting away from that\nTalking to mark ... dot com as we discuss the economy and because we all see that's the one thing I started telling me we all share and the economy I care what you say you're right laughs he's not my president he's my president tribal politics all the stuff we all share and the economy we buy things we sell things we work we have homes and got things have got to take care of\nRight now the market itself is the job market is good you're seeing more and more people to feel confident enough to quit their jobs and wait and I always like when people say well you know the growth rate for for jobs as far as money is it what it was\n[noise] yeah I I look\nStupid things as we know kids do dumb things right kids do stupid things I don't know if we need to throw the book out or could it be a family of course it could be chicken was about my ability to look ah got the brownies there was somebody making ... how do you know I made him I just brought him to school\nI didn't know who made them I got him from a friend of this that and the other apes\nDo this is just me right this is my commonsense thinking here and I know it's completely stupid and how dare I Do anything like this at all so we just say\nLook okay it's kind of laugh a little bit when all that goes to all of those who say look dumb thing to do we're going to suspend you for a week on top of that boom you're off\nThe cheerleading team and dumping it it again and we'll go from there right it's always going to be the harshest thing in the world and I've been telling everybody thank God she didn't bring gluten 'cause she would've brought gluten to school that have been at\nWhat I mean what else would you been forced to do you have to get rid of her I mean it's [noise] [noise]\n[noise] do you know the dangers that is for people three two three five three twenty four twenty three that\nYou had been to show is your Twitter you can tweet at us by the way a speech speaking of gluten what a week for Ireland so they open up their\nFirst right there first\nCrispy cream and then this weekend oh lordy in Las Vegas it's McGregor it's could be what what what\nI did not plan this I Try to get here you know like I said I'm only a couple of men have almost a slave shade stomach backwards\nBecause you're just stay poor or whatever and I just saw him he doesn't want to be around me they don't want to be around these days\nHey you know what it is [laughter]\nOr your user and those\nThose things you hear where they fade out it's because well as we know he's a colorful character I had a friend in Vegas and\nUh it is it the the the fight may be the prelude to the fight because the Irish and the Russians have taken over Las Vegas who will win the fight could be is one of the big favorites you know who this is this guy is a beast one of\nMaybe the as far as just ... him going to the ground and fighting is like it's otherworldly he is a he takes world champions and tears the most part I think he's twenty six or twenty seven and now he's telling everybody wants to win this knock out the golden boy finish off the golden boy and then he wants to retire\nNow I don't think about him you know I have ...

may have you seen in your life to the Senate floor Senator Chuck Schumer speaking\nI understand I share the deep anguish said millions of Americans are experiencing today but I said to you my fellow Americans there is a\nVote high yield uh for\n\n\nThe majority leader the constitution\nOf the United states was made not merely for the generation that that existed but for posterity\nThose are the words of Henry Clay is the president Kentucky is all\nThey all just score that their decision you're not in say center as well\nMake today well echo in the history of our nation the very survival of our constitutional form of government requires an expert an independent judiciary\nWithout fair and impartial court of justice is Alexander Hamilton put it in the federalist papers\nAll the reservations of the ticket or rights or privileges\nThe not\nThe courts guard our rights and the set of guards are records\nThat Mr President is why today is such an important day that is why the vote we take this afternoon a vote to confirm a new associate justice of the Supreme Court\nOf the United states represents one of the most consequential decisions a senator ever about the members of this body\nOr duty bound to ensure we confirmed justices of the Supreme Court or men and women\nOf the highest character and the most productive qualifications so fortunately that is just a sort of nominate a standard before us today ... weeks ago\nThe president nominated the jurors it's been described by legal pairs of all political stripes\nAs a superstar serious scholar and who is the legendary forest preparation that possesses the qualifications of temperament and the judicial philosophy to be an excellent associate justice\nThe president nominated a brass student of all those who taught and knew the nominated yeah I'll say quote it is hard to name any wild with traditional credentials as strong\nA judge Kavanaugh they describe a true intellectual well leading cycle and a wonderful mentor and teacher\nAnd those used matter mentor a diverse group of bright young lawyers who for for judge Kavanaugh talk about his work ethic is ... on us to dry and it's gone to battle humility\nOr twelve way the Senate as saying that this is not empty prayers were saying the legendary preparation of a tireless drugs were saying the patience of a committed mentor and future we've said in the military but\nIntellectual who led his record speaks for itself each of us are saying this for ourselves every senator who came into this process with an open mind has saying that very same Brett Kavanaugh first trial\nWe've had his brilliance is paying second thorough and it's all just fly into three hundred plus opinions he issued on the DC circuit\nFor twelve years yards cabin all excelled on the bench that many experts say is the second most important in court and our notion\nWe're saying is there any holiday and kindness firsthand and our private meetings with a nominate precisely that college all approach that are so necessary on the court we've finished professional excellence is revered more pages of documents pertaining to judge Kavanaugh's career\nFor any other Supreme Court nomination in our history pages\nTo pick the meticulous and dedicated public servants and yes we have now started the results of seven seven FBI background investigations\nInquiries that are produced no evidence whatsoever to corroborate any prior misconduct\nBut rather are consistent with all we know about this nominees starling character\nThis historically tall mountain of evidence adds up to one clear message judge Brett Kavanaugh was among the very best our nation has to offer\nThe will make the Senate and the country proud he will serve with distinction on our high scores he unquestionably deserves confirmation and the country deserves such a Supreme Court justice\nNow Mr President as I'm explained the stakes are always high always ah whereas Supreme Court confirmation is concerned\n\n[noise]\nRespond [noise]\nThe main allegations he received theories anger in half announced it is time for the final vote confirmed Brent Kavanaugh to the un Supreme Court but if you're very soon have and I will go from ... to justice climbing to the highest court in the land before that ... vote majority leader Mitch McConnell you're speaking\nRight now given some final words before the vote gets underway let's listen in to what he's saying right now\nWhen passions are most in flames is when fairness is most in jeopardy we all know the events of recent weeks have staying\nStrain the country's comedy and fanned the flames of partisan discord but even more critically Arbor a commitment to the basic principles of fairness and justice is also being tested basic principles of fairness and justice being tested right here\n\nA vote to confirm judge Kavanaugh today is also a vote to send a clear message\nAbout what the Senate is\nThis is an institution where the evidence and the facts matter this is an institution where the evidence and facts matter\n\nThis is a chamber in which the politics of intimidation and personal destruction do not when the day\nThat this is the body whose members themselves uphold the same commitment to American Justice that we see\nAnd the judge as we examine\nA vote to confirm judge Kavanaugh today is a vote to end is brave dark chapter in the center of history and turn the page shorter brighter come all\n\nThe chamber where planet privileged to occupy is often called the world's greatest deliberative body\nFor good reason\nRecall the world's greatest deliberative body for good reason when the rubber meets the road when they hours critical\nWhen a historic president needs to be that\nThe United States Senate most often finds its way\nThey're doing what is right the day we got to honor that history\nWe can vote to turn away from the darkness we can vote to set a precedent about fairness and judgment\nWe await the final tally now as the bikes are immunity in the Senate chambers were getting toward the end of\nSenator Dane and walking his\nDaughter down the island this afternoon if he were president and voting he would have voted I\nI had voted no the parent will not change the outcome of developed I guess for withdrawn they thought the senator has that right\n\nSenators voting in the affirmative\nAlexander ... so the

Smith Stabenow\nChester Udall Van Hollen warn us Warren White House white\nMr Murphy Mr Murphy no\n\nAwaiting the final tally now expected to be fifty to forty eight after Senator Murkowski initially voted no but then withdrew her vote\nAs a what's called a parrot Senate pair because Steve Gaines is not there he would have voted yes he said he is walking his daughter down the aisle at a wedding soda to offset he's vote she withdrew her vote at that point\nThe microphones in the Senate chamber muted at this point as we wait for the final votes to come in the votes are in the ... for them it's not official yet but he has enough votes Brett Kavanaugh to be confirmed out to the U.S Supreme Court we wait for the official tally\nTo be announced here right any moment inside the chamber the president of the Senate being vice president Pence ideas are in charge of what's going on right now it's moving at his pace as we've been hearing his voice over and over again\nWe wake now for the Mike said to be an you didn't want to go to Stephanie Ramos at the Capitol and and Stephanie we're hearing from our producers insiders say they've never seen anything like this the atmosphere inside the chamber\nAds and I believe that I mean we've heard that from senators has well this week Senator Dianne Feinstein\nShe she says she's been on she's been through ten Supreme Court nominations and she has never seen a process like this before this is a first but ah yeah ... what what we're seeing in in that Senate gallery what we're seeing here on Capitol Hill I is is like\nYeah something we've never seen before there's so much\nI intensity and so many demonstrators out there it's at ... we saw this happening we saw judge Brett Kavanaugh at getting the votes that he would eventually need we saw this yesterday I'm really going into today unless there was some sort of last minute developments judge Kavanaugh's confirmation\nTo the Supreme Court was going to happen it will likely happen\nOr what we've also heard from from senators like Senator McConnell Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell and other Senate Republicans\nAre we with the exception of Senator Lisa Murkowski they've all been ready to cook turn the page to move on and get this process going and couldn't sperm\nJudge Kavanaugh as quickly as possible but of course are they took that pause for the FBI investigation the in that investigation into the sexual assault allegations against judge Kavanaugh many Senate Republicans saying that investigation showed\nNo cooperation to the allegations made by against US Cabinet by Christine Blasey Ford Senate Democrats saying it was extremely limited investigation possibly limited by the White House\nI so there's been this back and forth for so long now and and here we are we're seeing it happen are witnessing history but right now we can only imagine what the White House is your what staff what what ah what age or do we know the president is watching he said he would be watching the vote on TV so he is currently watching\nAnd you'd think that they are celebrating right now this is a huge victory for President Trump he promised during the campaign trail that he would turn the high court more conservative and he will likely do that today\nThe vote count we know is fifty to forty eight it's not official yet members of the Senate are walking around there talking to each other like you often see them do they are chatting at our with their colleagues\nNow let's listen back in the bikes around muted or they were very momentarily waiting for that car final you know\nLike so often in the Senate it happens very very slowly what's gonna happen now for Brett Kavanaugh details are still being worked out but a White House official telling us today that the president will first have to sign a commission Kevin can then be officially sworn in by another judge\nOr not the the vice president in this case this could all happened\nBy the end of today there is likely going to be a ceremony I involving\nA the the the actual swearing in some time down the road probably next week but uh he will likely in a non ceremonial fashion at least to a lower degree lesser degree likely be sworn in maybe later today are by and\nNow there is a reminder joined us from the galleries the finals on Russia's approval or disapproval are not permitted in the Senate gallery are there any senators and the chamber who wish to vote or change your vote\n\nIf not on this vote the eyes or fifty the Naser forty eight the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh\nOf Maryland to be an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United states is confirmed\n\nAfter I'd throw George Carlin week Vatican center motion reconsidered consider mode later on the table and the ... the father to son soccer [noise]\n... just a horrible [noise]\nSergeant an arms will restore order in the gallery\nThe clerk will call the roll shrugs and\n\nAfter Thirteen weeks the battle back and forth between both sides it is now well over a very much seen as a victory for President Trump for Republicans who pushed for Brett Kavanaugh for Democrats\n... somewhat of a defeat but at the same time I was very much of an uphill battle or some could argue an impossible battle for them and then the place that they were in a but it is now official fifty to forty eight the confirmation done we can assume that right now Brett Kavanaugh\nHas the news has been listening to it he's been watching it I and it's probably a celebrating at this moment want to go now to ABC News political analysts they Robertson Steve not AJ here but you've been around for a long time you ever seen anything like this here today\n[noise] no I'm this is the closest to vote on a Supreme Court nominees since the Eighteen eighties uh and I was not around that I'm and I'm\nA it's not just the closeness of the vote that is so striking um the two leaders Chuck Schumer and Mitch McConnell agreed on one thing\nA Schumer said this was a low moment for the Senate\nMcConnell said it was a dark chapter for the Senate they agreed on that except they blamed each other for that darkness and for that and that ... of ah ah that the Senate has sunk to the the anger the partisanship the lack of civility lack of respect across the aisle\nOr Israeli reached a new low I've covered the Senate off and on for forty years and I have never seen a this level of\n[noise] great question oh you want to start\n[noise] yes so we have a very unique market in San Antonio um depending on the price point that your home is in um we have a very very high demand for homes in San Antonio and a lot of times there are multiple offers going in on homes\nUm now that isn't to say that every home sells quickly or without issues but there is a housing shortage now when you start going up into the higher prices San Antonio\nIs unlike other cities where you know a million dollars is generally the lowest to be considered a luxury home and say Austin\nBut in San Antonio we have a different market and here it's considered eight hundred thousand enough generally ... oh\nOkay well mine is in the one fifty five to one sixty thousand a hundred thousand ranges I'm Sorry when uh I actually have it for ... fifty nine hundred and fifty nine thousand and it's a three bedroom two bath it's in the uh seven eight to four nine areas\nOkay would have for your subdivisions\nOf those [noise] you know I'm not sure um it's it's a house on the ever lived in\nOkay what are the ...\nAh it's a hickory hickory trail and close to hunt lane and look up against and that area's\nOkay All right um let me see if I can find out for your real quick\nAnyway um [noise] new units not fold real quick\n[noise] well it's only been on to the ...\nYeah well that's that's usually um\nLet me ask you this how many showings have happened on the home\nAbout twelve okay so\nWe generally have about twelve showing have you had any offers and on your home no\nOkay I Would maybe think about doing a price reduction because when you have your home on the market and it's being shown that\nMuch you might start to consider lowering the price or and you know all the obviously you always need to check and make sure that maybe that just wasn't the right home for all of those twelve fires\nBut most of the time price can fix that\nAnd if you've had twelve showings and you haven't had any offers yet I Would think that the next step would be lowering the price\nOh ... in a as opposed to selling in the summer or does it matter I hear it's better to do your own this summer when people are losing\nTheir is I I Am of the mindset that there is no wrong time to sell your home and they're always going to be buyers that are looking for a home and yes typically families will move and look for homes and you know may in September in August and\nThat's all fine I can tell you that personally from our office are busiest months are actually in the winter\nAnd oh different houses move at different times of the year so I think if you are thinking about selling I wouldn't hold off until the summer waiting you know a ... just because that is typically what people will tell you\nI'm but they're always going to be buyers\nThat's an adult what over what part of the condition is um is your house\nActually it's in good condition and it was just updated every models painted and you know has ended up putting in is Laurie the carpet fixtures so how's fries and how they are in that area the other homes are pretty comparable\nWelcome to the west or show\nEither what can you help yesterday John\nAh yes I was on the if you get started but it would be a good investment in your experience have you seen that installing or exploring that my house is only about six years old or looking at maybe sell the next one or two years I'm\nOK or if you were in Stillwater ranch\nCorrect okay\nAnd you have about twenty six hundred square feet\nCorrect okay\nSo why Mike is pulling up that information you ... you said you have not installed the would force yet\nNo I haven't I've just thought about maybe\nDoing that to to make it a little more lucrative I'm In the house is a very good condition but it I just didn't know if it's a good investment you spend six or seven thousand dollars or even more to install what's Lauren certain parts of the house can you can raise or you'll experience have you seen people raise it up and twelve thousand dollars of the property of ...\nWell I wouldn't even recommended unless you got at least that much unless you wanted to do that to live there now tell me a little bit of slip up the rest of your house because that's going to come into the um that's going to come into play yes\nI mean to give you an example right now you know ... you have a range of a hundred dollars for two hundred and sixty one I'm asking in Stillwater ranch\nDepending range from Ninety three to one forty eight\nAnd the cells in the past six months range from a Ninety dollars two hundred and Seventy two dollars but it's easy to dollars maybe three dollars a foot difference right now what type of um kitchen flooring and counter tops and appliances do have\nSo now we have the ability to have you been able to to sort through all the stuff that's out there on the Internet and all the people that ... billion or an expert\nBottom line we look at them less right now what is currents as it happens and we can tell you what your property is worth if you're honest with us and given the description\nAnd so maybe you were thinking about remodeling a few things in your home that you're not sure if it's going to bring you value\nOr that's what my can help you with that I can help you that too I I was about to say this is a team thing here\nAnd I my daughter on his wife and together we are the army's team and we both celebrating stay for a living but we do this show to give you information and I'm telling you there's a ton out there\nAnd\nSan Antonio is very very unique\nWe don't have a market like the rest of the country we don't have\nWinters that generally a tribute to this idea of winter is not in a good time to sell your home because that is true in certain parts of the country if you left your home in the winter when there's going to be a blizzard\nChicago or someplace cold they're going to be less likely to go and look at Holmes during that time\nIn San Antonio we don't have that issue\nSo\nGive us a call to went outside and then I'm fifty five fifty five\nYou know and one thing I wanted to talk about was um well we have a break from a Monday morning\nThere is going to be a golf tournament BA this coming Monday at San Tara benefiting the Fisher house and if anybody knows what the the Fisher houses it's an amazing you know situation where um\nYou know you have our our military heroes that are in the hospital\nAnd their families military families can actually stay at um you know the Fisher house while the ... you know hanging heroes are being taken care of at the Fisher house if you'd like to donate any money\nOr if you'd like to donate any last minute the auction items you can talk to the ... and our phone number is four into two to six seven to nine seven and that's for you to to to six seven to nine seven how old are you going to be playing\nWe'll

about on the second half of the show\nIf you watch now how much your house is worth it you have a question about buying or selling she went out five nine nine fifty five fifty five real life and were local when you're ready for your calls and it's that simple you can make up the name that is totally find this because we don't see any of the numbers\nWhen you call in if you want to get in touch
