take that back I Want [laughter]\nI mean either way you are going on here no I mean you've gotta you've gotta think about an hour a day Ramsey thanks but you need to think about what how do you want to live your life here's why you lost your motivation\nAnd is your inconsistent you need to say in your mind and in your heart of hearts\nAnd you need to grasp intellectually and spiritually that the shortest path to wealth and generosity and stability in your finances sustainability is to get out of debt and stay out of debt and at that point you're saying I'll never borrow again as part of that\nRegardless of what I Need to have happen now you had a car accident they do not get an insurance settlement so that\nNow they're saying that there was no no no and a damage to our vehicle and there than they don't believe that it um the crash injured me but I I'm actually paying before the crash occurred\nSo I'm I'm paying for myself with my um a shark\nOK but I'm Talking about the car wreck that uh so you did not get any insurance for the damage to your car\nOh yes I did I got five hundred dollar that kind of like\nOh OK\nInstead of putting it on the auto body repair which now you want to do yeah so this repair is very very minor an eight hundred dollar a bump it's not our okay\nSo the eight hundred dollar repair the reef I Want to do it now because of a great deal because it's not it's managed that I've\nBeen driving around with for a long time look other damage yeah 'cause I don't mind me stop you for that stock a few thousand dollar let me stop you for\nA number one I'm not going to tell you to borrow money you knew that for you call me right number two and there's just not an emergency\nSmelled emergence right there it's not an emergency\nI don't care if it's a great deal it's not an emergency and you don't have any money except what's in your emergency fund now and you've got the IRS breathing down your neck which is a lot bigger deal than a bump on your car\nAnd so now you didn't clear up the Irish and you need to save up the money to fix the car if the guy won't do it in a year from now for eight hundred dollars then when you actually have the money then you just want to be able to do it with him you just missed that deal but so uh\nUm you know one thing I have learned is that when I Am impulsive\nAnd when I make quick decisions on something based on something I feel like I'm being emotionally drug into it's almost always a bad financial decision and a lot of the things circling around this conversation and have had that field with them\nAnd so you need to slow down get yourself on a very strict plan and live that plan all the way out regardless of what opportunities or crisis has come into your life\nAnytime there's a problem you just get back on track back on track back on track and when you stabilized that you're going to stabilize not only are money but a whole bunch of other areas of your life that are also felt like a

that would be ... that'd be three months or six months\nThat will be fifth month\nOkay All right so you can be within the range of three to six months of expenses at Fifteen thousand\nAnd um if you want to use some of that money that's fine and if you want to build it back up to six months later that's fine but it doesn't sound like you need more than twenty five thousand ever in your emergency

the ongoing case with me and my ... and the FBI were so many of those devices in New York have been found the update coming from Manhattan\nNone of those devices ten of them have detonated let's listen in now\nGood afternoon everyone before you started sweat acknowledge are a law enforcement partners joined us here today bill Swain\nAssistant director in charge of the New York FBI office and Sean Benedict special agent in charge of ATF source of New York field division and a Phillip Bartlett inspector in charge of the u._s. postal inspection services New York division in a moment we'll hear from mayor de Blasio than going to hear from bill and then uh from John Miller\nAnd trial provide you with an update on a suspicious package investigations are conducting here in New York City first and foremost my message today is that New Yorkers are safe\nThere are no current credible threats twenty individuals organizations or locations here in New York City New Yorkers are safe\nBut everyone all eight point six million residents in the millions of visitors who come here every year should always remain vigilant\nAnd aware of their surroundings as always I urge people to alert us to anything that might seem strange or out of place or anything that makes them feel uncomfortable making flag down a cop call nine one one or call our toll free counterterrorism number which is one eight eight eight New York city safe\nAnd as for anything new or someone as information about any of the incidents this week in New York\nWe don't underestimate the difference even one person can make towards our collective safety and neither should the people of New York city and want to reiterate as I did yesterday and as I Do anytime we talk about far reaching investigations of this nature of any other kind that nothing we do in law enforcement we do alone\nFor a joint terrorists taskforce comprised of professionals from the agencies you see here today and others we are investigating all of this with great precision that can say with certainty\nThat we will identifying arrest a person or people responsible for these acts make no mistake\n[noise] New York city's intelligence and counterterrorism counterterrorism capabilities are second and on every day they are not just this week or detectives and analysts are constantly poring over that stretch dream as we proactively deploy or resources around the city has made it\nAnd you're saying that today too out of an abundance of caution I'll tell you that when we look at the events have yesterday and today I have a match pride in incredible work the men and women are the NYPD to each and every day especially when it involves partnering with the organizations represented here today\nAll concluded by reminding everyone that law enforcement professionals do not care about the politics behind these acts but we do care about is keeping the publicly serves safe\nThat's it that's the job fighting crime and keeping people safe and through the fall and willing partnership of everyone who lives and works and and visit New York city who make the safest large city in the United states even safer Mr ... thank you very much\nCommissioner I Want to express my appreciation to all the men and women and YPG who have done an outstanding job yesterday and today addressing this situation and to all of our partners federal and state partners everyone has been working together\nTo address this forthrightly now look one of the things that we emphasize the moment like this is that you're going to see a lot of police presence it's important that we proactively take steps to protect those who have come under attack\nClearly what we've seen in the last few days is an attack on media outlets an attack on the prominence of public figures\nAnd we're going to make sure there's expanded the presence as long as we needed to show very vividly or that New York city takes these issues seriously that we are defending\nPeople who are coming under attack that part of how we protect the Democratic process is to show the threats like this not taken lightly so that they expect that presidents and I know that for those who have gone through this or in the last few days that some presidents that they appreciate greatly\nWant to say that uh everyday New Yorkers have responded to the situation with the kind of strength and the kind of resiliency that this city is famous for that makes me very very proud of all eight point six million New Yorkers they have handled the situation\nOr with a real sense of resolve or they're not going to let an act of terror\nThem and that's a really important in this moment to say whatever the motives of the individuals involved ah the people in this city are not being thrown off the game or not having their values undermined or the way of life undermined New Yorkers are standing strong right now\nIn the last thing I Want to say is you know it in a moment like this there's a lot of concern there's a lot of fear\nA clearly it's upsetting time it's a time when there's been too much hatred in too much division in the air\nAnd in that context people can feel powerless I Want to remind people that everyone has an opportunity to play a positive and constructive role here uh first of all\nHelping law enforcement this is something that everyone can do if you have any information at all that you think could help law enforcement to address the situation share it with law enforcement immediately\nOr let them be the judges of the value of the information don't hold back\nAre so many times and I agree with the commissioner law enforcement that ultimately has proven that they will find the perpetrators but so many times it's because\nUh an individual citizen step forward with information that really led to the key breakthrough you have information\nSharing if you're concerned about uh packages that could arrive at your home or your workplace you see something that worries you reach out to the police get their involvement to address the situation people\nThe heart of solving this immediate challenge but finally we all can be a part of solving the bigger situation that we're facing as a society as a nation of telling his civility a tone of mutual respect as something we all can create\nWe shouldn't just ask what are the most prominent voices doing we also have to ask question are all of us\nTreating each other with respect for young men and women the law enforced will respect people in the media report the news treating them with respect this is something that we all have to do as a way of addressing a crisis like this and we can and I have great confidence that we will thank you\n\nMr marathon teach me right now the FBI joint terrorism task forces around the nation or fully engaged on this investigation\nWe're working quickly to process and analyze relevant information from the suspicious packages recovered over the last few days we will continue to do so for as long as it takes and until there is a resolution\nWhich is a nationwide investigation involving multiple jurisdictions coast to coast to give you a sense of scope just here on the New York to ATF agencies ranging from an ATF\nThe u._s. postal inspection service the secret service the NYPD the New York state police and dozens of other federal state and local agencies are working shoulder to shoulder\nI Want to thank those partners for their efforts to collaboration and hard work much of their leadership is in the room with us today I also want to personally thank the hundreds of men and women that are up the street working on this together\nThe FBI will continue to focus all of the resources at our disposal to identify and apprehend the individual or individuals responsible for these acts\nThe investigation is still in its early stages I have said this each time that we face similar situations but it bears repeating today it is vitally important that we do not inadvertently disclose information that could adversely impacted our investigation or a future prosecution\nThe public understands the need for this level of operational security and for that reason I Will not be able to answer specific questions on what we know\nWhat I can say is that at various times over the last few days Ken suspicious packages were located at multiple locations in New York Maryland Florida Delaware and Los Angeles\nAnd don't let these things ah throw us off or a game and I think that's important to inhibiting a terrorism going forward to consistently show or those who would attack us that their efforts are invading\nA so New Yorkers have been exemplary or they do a heed the warning if you see something say something but I Want to remind people because we see this a lot a people should not hesitate some time someone's you know looking at something there are concerned they think oh maybe I should call maybe I shouldn't\nIf it's on the cost to make the call if you think maybe you should call you should definitely call let the experts\nAre resolve something let they've there's anything that's suspicious let alone\nUnfortunately the wants to make sense at all [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise] I was just\nA part of that was found yesterday with the with the packaging yesterday so it's not biological it's still being a subjected to further testing right if\nThe officer retired officer who found\nPackage and you're just\nA I'll say that uh would like to thank him for doing his job correctly so he saw on the

devices this looks like they're constructed by somebody who actually knows his leg or just some cameras they asked\nMe the same question that he asked me I'm not going to go into that affects them right here in the front row\nIs there a time frame is when the announcers from wanna go maybe ... for the FBI and it's\nAn ongoing thing uh we are discovering things by the hour\n... on the second thing\nOut or there's a lot\nOf pressure on a cell phone and talk about that\n\nSo in terms of tracking we have a over six hundred thousand plus employees out there right now so we have the eyes and ears looking for these packages I Will say in the fall so network we found nothing in the last eight hours so um what we have so far as what we have ... and ...\nYou know\nHow it is is\nNot really

forward on the\nPath to fulfilling your purpose through your work and courageously staying there that's what clarity does clarity gives us confidence to step out\nAnd didn't clarity allows us to have

eight eight to five five two to five triple eight eight to five five two to five let's go to Nelson who's on the line in Fall River Massachusetts Nelson how can out\nHey Ken thanks for taking my call German not gonna\nI'm All right so um I Know what they're going to show for a while and ah I figure it out my sweet ...\nWhich is\n... apparently it um creating an editing helm our town are you there\nOkay and uh I Want to talk committee a principal okay um [noise] if I can research I found a video marketing firm real close game ... and uh I kicked him out on Lincoln\nAnd you know they're ... they're linked to a buddy of mine a high school\nAnd I'm from here to get through coach Janna where screwed up because it's a very universe ... heard my call and it gave you a great opportunity\nAwesome well have you talk to your buddy that are that is at least connected to this company on linked in\nA I I haven't spoken about uh uh you know work quote by\nOkay well that's the first the first step is calling up saying hey uh I'm interested in learning more about this company I see that you're connected them on linked in what is your connection how strong is it that's the first thing\nBecause he could have a strong connection or maybe it's just a random connection or it's an old ... true you see what I'm saying so you are in um urine staged too and that is full on research and so you found and identified one company that does what you want to do\nYou mentioned the proximity principle to the Dave Ramsey show letters you haven't heard that it's important to clarify what that is proximity of the proximity principal says in order to do what I Want to do in this case\nNelson wants to do a film an audio editing production work so in order to do that he's got to be around people that are doing that and in places that it is happening so here you're next steps after you talk to your body and see how strong connection is\nThe next thing you want to do is I'd like to see you come up with a a bigger list even if it's three or four local production companies or or companies that are in this space okay 'cause you know where to look in your area so look and ideally I'd like to see a list of three or four companies that you eat circle and say I need to learn more about those companies\nI Need to get in proximity now the other thing I Want you to do is I Want you to start talking to your buddy other people acquaintances uh who dabble or work full time in this space and I think you could probably come up with a list of those people as well\nAnd so you need to take 'em out to lunch or take 'em to coffee and you say hey listen this is the ... this is the place I Want to be in\nAnd so I'm here to pick your brain into areas number one what was your past\nWhat are some areas that I could get better and where can I grow uh what do I need to learn who else do I need to ... do you have any relationships you know of any open jobs this is a very simple conversation it's going to yield something positive\nAnd so this is proximity and didn't even if there's not a fulltime job available 'cause Nelson this is the this is the part that I Want people to get that are in your similar situation\nLet's say you do all of that and there's not a position that is right for you at the time it doesn't mean you throw your hands in the air and take your ball and go home what it means is you say All right I'm going to practice proximity in a in a non paid situation so I'm going to go volunteer a or I'm going to say can I just shadow you for a day\nI'm gonna get in places where some type of audio video production is happening and when you get in those places you will continue to meet new people\nAnd those new people will help you get in the right places are going to open up doors for you so you're on the right track the first step is just talking to your body that's just the first step and that's how you ... practice proximity is people and places\nSo again folks if you're in a similar situation let's apply Nelson situation to you he needs to simply asked today and then start to ride it out\nAnd the answers when he goes and looks on line or wherever and he makes a list who are the people that are doing audio video production in my area\nWhere the places what companies are doing this and that's what he's looking to connect to it's not difficult it's going to take some intention alley and some hustle that's all it takes\nTriple eight eight to five five two to five let's go to Joe who's on the line and Charlotte North Carolina Joe how can I help\nBut he's in a big fan big fan of the hallway organization appreciate all you do thank you\nSo I'm looking at a kind of continues you know I'm Wondering I'm Wondering if if what I got as a hobby or district career so just a little bit of a back story yeah we have to get a job that extra benefits to pursue at that with my actually I think about it give her some pay cut to switch\nAnd and as I went to the fair profession you know I'm I'm quickly right in that I don't know why are they from that I think I might have jumped the gun ... I just want to get inside from your\nWell tell me what the profession is that you just jumped to\nFinancial diving\nWhat is it a financial diving\nOkay so you jumped into financial advising specifically what are you doing day to day give me the quick rundown\nOr they are basically just knock out bookstores who I Am what I Do and you know try to get into a ... so that I can help them with a retirement plan and education\nSo are you working for a local firmer do you open up your own shop\nNo it's it's a it's a national um\nOkay so they're not providing any leads it's all on you to go out and knock on doors like you're doing\nExactly they provide zero lead okay\nWhy did you jumped into that I mean I I think there's a question you may have jumped too soon 'cause you didn't plan financially but your question was is this hobby level you know is this the right thing for me and and and the ... there's a little bit more to it than that I think I have a hunch on it but quickly why did you jump for this why financial", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "city": "San Antonio", "day": "25"}
