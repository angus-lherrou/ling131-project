the baby and it drains every drop of emotion and love and concentration and focus out of your family your body and your life and it's all directed at this baby\nAnd that was that's what's happened to you which just means you're a good dad and a good husband you guys are not paid attention to the money at all and all that means is your human but\nHis screwing up your life now and you're going to have to deal with it right yeah\nSound as tough as it is I'm your daughter is not going to get one hundred percent of your attention anymore\nI'm your money's going to have to get some percentage until you get this thing back under control so let's put the student loans or if they're not already on hardship to furrow um if you scrape together five to seven hundred dollars and offer it to the attorney on this Fifteen hundred dollars is a lump sum settlement they'll take it mhm\nOkay because we called today are very feminine federally called today at least that you know we ... what can we do and they just said um you either pay the full amount in court cheese and attorney fees or hire a lawyer well for you in court\nTo you're going to come back and say I've got five hundred bucks I can use that for a lawyer or I can give it to you to settle this debt which one do you want to\nBe okay and what if they don't take that and then you\nKnow you keep messing with the national weather and

script\nOkay this is not like you owe me money and I called them we would actually talk about it yeah you're dealing with a robot in a factory and if you get that stuck in your head when you're talking on the person on the other line it's emotional to you it is not to them\nIt's a robot in a factory\nLike a movie okay and just keep that in mind and just keep going well I don't have that so does that compute for you you know can you compute that I don't have Fifteen hundred dollars and that may go into court or you take a make or it doesn't make me have Fifteen hundred dollars I simply do not have it I Do have five hundred and sixty two and you're going to have every bit of that\nTime and if you have every bit of that you have to get a settlement in Seoul no I Will not give it to
