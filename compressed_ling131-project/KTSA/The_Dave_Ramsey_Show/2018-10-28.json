come out of the language is yeah\nSo I just figured you I've been up to me I think it's it's it's kind of neat that the\nYou know because I grew up in a small town and I'm very thankful that I did grow up in a small town up to to play all the sports you really have a great time\nThroughout high school and go on to college and that's what you do and it's really interesting I think starting your own company like you did back in January of two thousand and age that is a leap of faith and having confidence yourself and having a husband like Michael this very supportive to give you an opportunity right reasons like pure Brooklyn wherever you want a Dodger right\nBut that's a great story that we saying now that that's not really how [laughter]\nAt all would you like to clarify them well really\nI mean hindsight God it was actually probably I Would I it was probably a stupid decision at the time because I didn't have the resources I just had this desire to help people and so really that's how this business started\nAnd I walked right in to the crash of two thousand eight two thousand nine\nWith totally green eyes and you know very un season\nBut again my desire to help people and find options for them so they weren't\nJust you know having to lose twenty thirty forty percent of their hard earned portfolio that's what's so me through and it created this foundation that now hindsight looking back at doing this for eleven years that I'm so thankful for but\nYou know mark I mean if if I had a twenty some odd kid sitting in front of me and go you know what I've got nothing to my name but school debt and I've got a few thousand dollars saved up\nJust started an investment firm I Would say absolutely not [laughter] but I\nAnd here we are today and so I'm thankful for goodness gracious on paper that was a huge risk but I had no idea a new nothing different I just I you know that that desire to help\nPeople overshadowed whole sort of logic\nAnd that's a big earlier today you know it's a good thing I mean if you were if you knew everything you know you might not have started out that are not right absolutely not ... yeah yeah\nAnd I'm so thankful that where we are today and thankful for that how I got here but I mean talk about there's something bigger out there that is and much worth as much as we try and control our own lives ... the the joke is we're not in control at all [laughter]\nAbsolutely oh and you know let's go back to when you started the company back in January two thousand or you're coming from the legal world as an attorney and now you've got to make some decisions about how you're going to set up\nTexas financial advisories are going to be independent maybe the easier road we'd go captain where you've got one of those well known company so you're kind of you know one of their offices kind of thing she got more help maybe but you don't have the leeway to do what you think is in the best interest of the clients maybe she decided to go independent why did you make that decision\nI think it also came from the decision that whenever I was in law school and working for different law firms and\nAfter law school just seeing what is out there is right there's lots of different types of law firms but\nI knew for my own personality that I just couldn't be captive I didn't want to work my way up some sort of corporate ladder of spin the two three years in the library at some big firms to to move up and I just didn't like any of that stuff and so and you don't want it to be independent\nAnd in that industry so that didn't change but ... and you know mark\nI said this time and time again after my first semester of law school I was like I don't really like this industry but I'm thankful that that's where I started this business from that that that I guess that\nMindset and educational foundation because many of my clients love the fact that our firm is is holistic and comprehensive that we're looking at things from all angles and we don't have\nThe hand tests of we can't give you that type of advice or we can't consults with your other professionals you know we work as a team whether you're working with one of the professionals on our team\nAnd or you know with your existing and\nIt's interesting mark you know share an eleven years down the road and voting this from and I'm not doing the tax work I'm not doing any of the legal work I mean I Am really doing what I Love best and that's being a liaison representing my clients and\nYou know building that thread and then we have the best professionals under our ... our Ruth in order to help implement those strategies so it's it's just so interesting how everything is taken out and um and it continues to change it continues to evolve ten years from now\nI Can't I Can't wait to see what we're going to look like and and how things have evolved and and improved\nAnd Brooklyn certainly one of the areas that are really important to your clients is that you could work on the wall street world and you can work in the insurance for all of your what it's called duly license to the world of risk but the world with growth Wall Street's role of safety and protection there's some growth in there maybe not the liquidity side and the insurance world and if you sit down with just an insurance agent you're only options are going to be\nAn insurance product to help you\nFulfill your retirement dream so that's kinda tough when your pigeonholed and only one side\nOf the the money world if you will and investment brokers Wall Street brokers they're all about investments or Texas financial advisor you're about income planning investment certainly a part of what you do for your clients where's their money where's it going to be where does that make the most sense for them tax planning health planning legacy estate planning when and how to take Social Security\nThat is the holistic approach right that's where you're looking at the big picture of things not just one minute area\nRight and we like to say that our our role here it takes ... to make work optional for you if you want to keep working great if you want to walk away and

one of the most misunderstood tools out there for your retirement but it's a guaranteed income you need to make the right decision for you and your family on when and how to take it there's a lot of areas to consider we're going to discuss Social Security when we\nCome back with us this is such a financial advisor show was Brooklyn journalism roses and she touches on your body\nI woke up one day and things were different it had been building up for a while I realized all the work I was doing all the money I was sitting all the decisions I was making was part of something bigger than just me

whole universe\nSmart jobs in light of the little corner of the universe that belongs to me\nDo you have big things to do let's talk Texas financial advisory aid for for need three two Seventy four sixty nine and a four four and a three to Seventy four sixty nine or ... financial advisor young I'm\nTexas financial advisory show with Brooklyn Chandler Willie Brooklyn the president and CEO of Texas financial advisor offices in San Antonio New Braunfels and\nVictoria you wanna find out more encouraged to check out Brooklyn's website Texas financial advisor ... a lot of great information their taxes financial advisor ... dot com I'm Mark Kelly and we're talking about here's your balance sheet healthy enough for you to live the retirements you've always dreamed of and\nOne of the first areas that I mean if if Social Security Brooklyn is going to replace thirty thirty five maybe even up to forty percent of our working income that means is is a big part of our retirement we need to get this decision right\nAnd most of us get this decision wrong and it doesn't mean you have to wait till Seventy to fully maximize it doesn't mean you should wait till forward Terminator sixty six and that doesn't mean you can't take it at sixty to the challenge is what makes the most sense for you and your situation\nHow do you walk people through this because this is a big big decision when it comes to the success or retirement isn't when and how to take Social Security\nWell yes but the good news is we do this\nEvery day and so we can help you navigate when and how to draw Social Security see them maximize that in some string just like we would do if you were trying to consider whether or not to sell your business or\nTo take the lump sum versus the annuity in your pension program or if you were to sell a piece of property I mean these are all questions that we've navigated\nWith each and every client so there's really it's rare to come across something that I haven't already gone down that path\nBut I'm not saying what we did for that one client is what we do for you\nWe still start from ground zero and work our way up and help you\nMake the best decision for you and your family so\nFor some folks that makes sense to start at sixty if they're a widow are sixty two other folks that makes\nSense to wait till they're Seventy there still some strategies available and the old plan that that\nPrior to the changes and Fifteen or sixteen that apply and here's here's what happens and I think this is where the frustration lies is that Social Security as far as a department at division I'm an office they can't give\nYou that financial advisors strategy you can ask them yes or no questions and they can answer those but they're not going to say hey you might want to wait three more months to do this because then you'll get this much more and um have you thought about doing the balance to spend and taking you know fifty percent of your spouse or ... and\nSo you know all those things that's what we help navigate and create the best plan for you and your family\nSo that you can maximize that programs but the key here is we do that with every program not just Social Security\nYou know in a ... as you mentioned if if you're a widow or widower you're eligible for Social Security in most situations at the age of sixty but for most of us who are not a widow or widower socially really run from sixty two to Seventy in the laundry way the more money you good\nAnd so if you took so surely as by itself Brooklyn if you just started by itself well then you might go you know what I'm a retired sixty two I might as well increase my income a little bit by taking it now well you know I'm going to be okay I've got some other forms of you know income coming in so I think I'll just wait and maximize it at Seventy and they're looking at a just as a Social Security question\nWhen you get into Social Security it's not just a Social Security decision isn't it it goes with that holistic approach you have to retirement where you're looking at and complaining investment planning health planning touch wanting legacy planning it's all of that right it's not just a Social Security question\nRight so a lot of times people ask me they want that black or white answer you know we we offer a tendency to people send in questions to the show\nI get emails after the show and I probably frustrate them more because I Can't give them an answer till I explore all of these other you know outlying issues and because\nReally it all depends on what you're going to tell me when I ask you about you know are you going to work part time job are you going to come into money you know through an inheritance or you're going to be able to sell that business that you've been building\nIf so how much valuation ... going to get for it I mean these are all questions that I Want to map through in order to get you to the right place and give you the best possible plan\nSo it's not like oh yeah for sure you need to wait for sixty sixty six and eight months that's exactly when you should take it I don't know that yet until we really go through all these other things um I Can't give you that that answer\nThe key here mark is when it comes to your financial future coming up short on a month to month basis with your income in retirement is not an acceptable outcome\nThere's no such thing as working really hard and retirement to get a bonus whenever you are financially independent and paying yourself\nSo you do deserve assurance that the sources that you have dedicated to draw income will be there for you so whether that's converting part of your ... to an income stream\nUsing Social Security and the like these are all means to provide a lifestyle that you desire throughout your retirement years so if you have a vision for what\nLife will look like when that paycheck is optional if you want to dictate how your future unfolds rather than having these financial limitations and constraints dictated to you\nYou need a strategy for retirement so when you sit down with myself or one of my advisers here at Texas ... are going to give you a few things you're going to walk away with an honest evaluation of how\nMuch you've saved if you have a shortage you need to save more or if you've reached you know that that peak in life that critical piece that you saved enough to create the income stream that will meet all of your financial desires\nYou'll have a clear understanding just how much risk you you pose what's the valuation of risk versus reward\nWealthy put together some strategies that designed to reach your retirement goals and give me an idea of how much income you actually need to maintain those goals and never run out of money before you run out of life\nDoesn't know that this analysis is completely based upon your circumstances and because of that we want to have that that one on one meeting with you and your spouse if you're married so give us a call we've limit this to ten appointments that thing come through a radio show\nThere is no costs no obligation if you choose to make that call today is if you save more than two hundred fifty thousand dollars for a time it give us a call\nA for for T s a show that's a for for a three to Seventy four sixty nine as always you can visit our website Texas financial advisory dot com and of course focus on social media to a lot of great videos out there for you to watch just try to give you a little nuggets to stay educated\nSo that you understand what options you have available and if it's an option that makes sense for you we can help you implement that again that number is a floor for a three to Seventy four sixty nine\nSo that number is eight for for a three to Seventy four sixty not if you'd like to do in Brooklyn and the team of Texas financial advisor to get a little advice and the Social Security area because it's a big decision and we're talking a lot of money over a lifetime\nWhat if my spouse passes when he's sixty eight and what happens to me what if one of us get sick and we need long term care home health care how are we going to pay for that\nBut if we want to put our grand kids through college or you know by each grandkid a car I don't know we haven't seen it all but we can help you build the plan to be able to achieve those goals or be able to tell you you can't do that right unless you've saved more do this\nBut we're a partner in this and and I think that's what people really likes if you want to see what that looks like again\nThis is not something where we just crunch numbers and email your report it's a discussion it's navigating where you've been and where you want to go and that starts with a phone call so give us a call here at a four four T F a show that's eight for for a three to Seventy four sixty nine\nFor him and will use the president and CEO of Texas financial advisor offices in San Antonio the Broncos and Victoria and mark Elliott Carter with us today in\nBrooklyn we got about two minutes left in the program you know we talked earlier about you're starting your company in January of two thousand and eight and it was never a time that you were worried about starting a business you are so confident that things were going to be perfect but we talked about the torture debate between being an independent which you are rather than captive working for some other company a chore company\nThere's no board of directors in San Antonio Dallas New York wherever it is your company\nAnd it's all about the clients so one of the other choices you had to make was are you going to be like a play a broker for example that maybe will operates under the suit ability standard oh you're sixty\nAnd you have this much money and you want to do this okay that makes sense it just has to make sense under the suit ability standard produced Sherry standard\nWhich you operate under is you've got to be the best for your clients you morally legally ethically obligated to do your best\nThe best interest over clients could you talk about that in the final minutes of the show\nRight and again it makes sense to work with some of those financial firms when you're getting started um you know I see people all the time that come here they've worked with Edward Jones for Twenty years are\nThey put money in Wells Fargo and they again is it come comfort level and so they're coming in here going wait a minute I I like my my Edward Jones I like my Smith Barney whatever you know wherever they're coming from\nAnd we're not saying that you need to make the switch we don't know that and so what I'm able to do is take where you are\nAnd and project that out in the future and as as much as we joke about having that magic ball magic eight ball there's there's ways that we can you know show you in with a good\nGood amount of probability of what your investment vehicles are going to do for you at that time the ball's in your court you can decide to keep doing what you're doing or do you look at other opportunities outside of that\nThat little mold that you've been pushed into and so the independent world that's typically a better place for most investors as they get to a ... a certain point in their life because then they have all these opportunities they can operate on the institutional world\nThey can get investment vehicles that truly fit their situation not just the ... cookie cutter you are forty two you need to be\nInvested like this so if you'd like that

probably haven't just don't know about it\nWhen you go and see your financial planner that is the business of risking your money they might use a computer suffered the runs examples of what could happen to your money sometimes these those samples are based off of historical data and sometimes they are flat out hysterical\nI had a client that that they show me an illustration other broker demonstrate a what would happen to their money if it continued to grow at the next ten years at twelve percent compounded growth\nWorried and financial planners get the nerve to even print out on paper what does even crazier is that I have never seen in illustration from these brokers\nThat shows what happens to their clients' money if they wake up one day in fifty percent of its gone why not couldn't that happen\nYou bet and in fact some of you today might be in that very situation\nIt's so easy for financial sales people to show you the best possible result and then just to be fair show you some moderate losses on these illustrations I think every financial professionals should be required to show their perspective clients what the worst result from their clients they manage\nLet me ask you if you were thinking about working with a financial planner and you found out they had lost fifty percent of the clients retirement funds when you went to work with them\nNow that I brought that up you're probably thinking the very same question about me have I ever lost any of my clients money the answer is a hundred percent positive no\nNot only does not a single penny of my

illustration results from your broker why do they call a hypothetical illustration because it's not real\nThe one thing all hypothetical illustrations have in common is that none of 'em are true yeah for some reason I guess it's human nature people want to believe them you want to believe that the twelve percent growth has some financial professionals illustrate for you will happen like I said before here's what I think you should do\nAsk your broker to make her report at every client he has and show you how much money he has made or lost for the his clients\nIf you take all of his clients and he average at least five percent growth after deducting all fees for the last ten years then he's a keeper chances are that after all the fees commissions and market law says he will not even print out that report for you\nIs it your brokers fault that he can't provide retirement money the gross he illustrates for you in some ways not really the types of products T cells take fees and commissions directly out of your money\nHe is also not allowed in most cases even offer products that I work for him because they provide too many benefits and guarantees and do not provide ongoing year after year commissions even if you lose your money\nMost importantly and the biggest reason it is not their fault for failing to provide you with the results you want to because he is trying to make your retirement plan that is invested in risky investments do something that he has no control over\nBurnout kill a Princeton University professor of economics an author of a random walk down Wall Street wrote\nThe sad truth is that there are only three types of financial planners those who don't know those who don't know they don't know those who know they don't know they get paid the big bucks to pretend to know\nLike I said before I worked with millions of dollars of my clients money and not one of them has ever lost a single penny how is that true it is simple I Know that I don't

you all we want to\nThat opens doors my friend and nice smile and makes a really good first impression and if you're one of the many who don't actually enjoy living they patented new ...\nIt's time to meet the new guy called see why now three for wind twenty five sixty nine\nMake an appointment with the San Antonio a dentist who guinea something smile about\nHe went out three four and one twenty five sixty nine or San Antonio dentist that [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] you're listening to the roof is now to to show with your host swing sharpening fears going\nBack to show here with\nThe wind chopping and Tim Carmichael I thought you were going to say with dom della Rees I was like I said I thought how am I was like what options that will catch my breath forget that the stereo you have one minute before got an even to go get on that stair climber and all I Need a lawyer\nAnd that train was a mile long and I've been out there was just so you're talking about stress you wish that we should have had a blood pressure machine in here to to put it on your arm to check 'cause I mean he was a he is that when you hit the door he was where he was rocketed did ya\nI might add we're giving our our producer probably as just a small heart attack you know they can whereas notion that feeds as just a little so\nBut uh we are so glad we're here again the shows about y'all and where to answer any questions about insurance or you know any roof questions or were you were talking about a roof tuna as to what you don't have time to get your roof inspectors absolutely now I Want\nReiterate some of the things we talked about earlier on the show we have our first responders police officers and military for going to extend an additional five percent on the on going Fifteen Percent discount that we have for the public so that's twenty percent off for those guys and that's a huge amount of savings write\nDown that's a huge amount so they think about this folks every ten thousand dollars spent you're going to get two thousand dollars in credit um for for a new roof and then you can put this on financing terms if you want to we have zero percent options that people love\nA zero percent for twenty four months I think we even had a I think I saw it pop up for zero percent for thirty six months but um for sure you can get an Eighteen month no payment no answers that puts your first payment out into twenty twenty bugs me twenty that's a long time from now\nAnd you know you can see what makes for a fix you take if you want to go to our website I Believe gene has got to have it up but we just got featured and you know there's a book called Kelley Blue book for automobiles won the contract industry there's a Blue Book called Blue Book\nWhose whose magazine it's basically for architects and everybody that's a construction it's like a guide for contractors but of course we made the front page and says disrupting and industry and I really tells a unique dynamics\nAnd me and Tim Story of how this company is plus created and what we've done and one of the things we've done is for commercials at residential\nHis word of the home of the tune that we actually go out I let him explain that because he does it every single day you know when you go out there I mean you're basically looking at risk that people they need to be replaced and you're able to do while they're on the fence\nSometimes some some folks will definitely no yes Tim I'm ready to replace the roof and that's great well apply the discounts and get the financing set up or they're paying that with a credit card or with a with a check we just handle it that way but then some folks are looking at it a different way saying is this something that I Need to possibly\nA you know think about maybe I Want to maybe I Want to prolong this but I have a small lead in a in one bedroom or it's in a porch or in a valley or it's somewhere in the house\nUm or they're just noticing shingles that are missing on their homes that ... and maybe leak has not started\nYet and some of these things are able to be tuned up like we call it um we go out to the property we identify all the discrepancies all the problems with the roof we we take take pictures of everything up there and then we come back and we show you exactly what\nIs damaged on your house this is your home that we just got finished find a drone over and we've got pictures of everything that we can show\nAnd I mean if it never had an inspection this is a huge peace of mind I mean if you have a\nTwo story house and you don't have binoculars and you can get across the street at your neighbor's home to stand in their front yard and look at your roof there's no way you can tell if you got shingles missing because I've got an eye for it I can look at different roofs and I've done a lot of estimation from the ground when I could not get on a roof\nAnd even at even with ... you know my years of experience I still can't catch everything from the ground and so when I put that drone over the house and I'll find\nNew for K. camera that day and then can count the brain nails left on the shingle handling our software does automatically the drone measures the risk to Ninety nine percent accuracy so I mean there's a\nTon of technology that we're using to keep everybody safe identify the problems but here's the big thing if you were raised as ... if you take advantage of the to not get thirty six months of peace of mind\nUh you know we're going to want to your roof for thirty six months but let's say\nDown the road you ever need a risk that money is spent on that tune up invest that will apply one hundred percent to a new roof exactly so I mean really come on if you're not even paying for the tune up 'cause everybody one day is going to need a new one way or another\nYou know so it's really free because it's crazy concept but it made sense to us to do it because every time there's a hailstorm or there's a need\nYou know these are our customers come back to us and then the other hand\nAnd the other thing is Duane if you're ... you know we have we have homeowners who are thinking about selling their houses are ... who is put their house on the market\nAnd there's a huge problem every time that the inspectors come out they're always right out there reporting their report always has\nThe same items that are listed that um that are ... that covered and there aren't that point to a halt the buyer was a whole new yeah that that point the violence a whole new roof well if you address it ahead of time and we come out and our tuna package\nDoes all those things we see all all the pipe vents we make sure that um all all the chimney flashing are sealed we make sure that the chin the cap and the rest is treated on the property we fix any damage they're broken shingles\nAnd that we just we take care of everything we see all all the nails all the exposed fasteners these are things that are going to show up on a reports have you ever sold your house or put your house on the market and you've had an inspector come out and they always have that that in their reports\nThat tune up takes care of all of it and we will allow that tuna package to extend the ward warranty to the next homeowner correct ... absolutely\nYou know and that is the owner you don't understand you know the best time to get into the services the bio roof as\nYou know they were going into November ... daylight savings time here and a fair word you know things people getting the holiday mood and and so what happens is you know we pour on the savings to keep the business going and make sure that you know we don't slow down in the industry says is absolutely the best time\nAnd if you're worried about coming out of pocket money during the holidays we have you covered zero percent interest deferred payments all the way till\nTwo thousand twenty two thousand twenty you don't have to pay a penny so you'll have to worry about coming out of pocket before the holidays or not this holiday or the next one right [laughter] so I mean you do you take the savings that discounts and it's a free no obligation\nAnd have you ever ever pressured anybody into buying anything never did no never had to look at our surveys I mean you were rated number one here in San Antonio our surveys are just amazing video listen what they say about him and ... and how professional done I mean\nGuys are you add up all our professional was about how many years we've been in the business I mean really you know with our whole entire team you got over two hundred years of experience life yet you know I mean wanna leave though oh my God that guys are production manager and I mean what a job and we brought a new addition on Eric he's been with us for about a month but he's\nGot tons of experience we just get nothing but super positive feedback on these guys\nI mean we only recruit the best that's it that's it we we we recruit gives we're not worried about getting fired right exactly [laughter]\nWe've had a joke earlier about working with a big box stores of every time we hire somebody better that as we always worried about are we going to still have our job I have a nice thing here you can do\nGood but you can't do that get ... right I just keep it under wraps [laughter]\nBy here if you do that you're not going nowhere you know I mean we just uh yeah we had a great team and yeah we're\nWe're very innovative I mean we we don't we don't sit there and say well you know what that sounds like a good idea but let's let's put it on the board will talk about it over the next six months and then try to figure out if it looks like a good idea we move forward with it and we we present it and we make sure that it's getting done\nAt our whole service departments aligned employees we are all employees at our service department that comes out there and takes care of you\nAs a awesome everybody's background check we know who's coming out of your home you get out of the peace of mind that you know we we we know the roofing industry has its moments you know the b._b._c. is reported the number one complaint industry in San Antonio ... roofing\nYeah insurance for thirty five thousand consumer complaints last year in San Antonio\nCheckout ours though we got an a plus rating on a Bebe\n... and Jews is a super service award winner two years in a row going on our third year uh and uh we're really a proud of that and uh you know what I mean we just stay being the best to stay in
