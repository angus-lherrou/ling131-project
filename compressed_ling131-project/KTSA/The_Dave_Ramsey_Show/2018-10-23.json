to five Chelsea is in Los Angeles high Chelsea how are you\nI'm doing good how are you doing better than I deserve what's up in your world\nI had a question for you in regards to um\nOur the papers the salary ... my husband is transitioning it tricked position I'm aware it they're going to be giving him a pay raise the debt that the rave there I'm saying that he also has that they're going to be transitioning him into salary pay if\nShe usually works between five and twenty hours of overtime each week so I wanted to make sure that when he they haven't given him an art form I forget that when they do want it to make sure that\nHow would you how would you recommend\nTo calculate whether\nThat the salary rate is comparable with for example the hours because she was working before and the pay that he would get what overtime\nWhich sounds like it would be simple you've been working Fifteen to twenty hours a week last year extra and you've been paid for that in overtime correct\nCorrect and so what was his income last year including the overtime\nWith about forty thousand and how will that compared to the salary\nBut that's the part that we don't know yet or\nCars or any of the salary of the ... if the salary is fifty that's raised if the salary is forty five and the same number of hours or expect to be work it's effectively a pay cut\nRight\nYes that that makes sense it's like yeah like as we were I was kind of weird because it's just more if it were in the ... member cheer mhm um I I Know that he has the potential to work more hours so because of that I was kind of\nVery yeah but but the question the question and it's not just more hours the question is is this a good deal for him apples to apples not a ... and ... and has he got the chance to move up in the company because he moved to salary\nYes he's going to be moving to management condition\nNo but I mean further up later oh okay but let's say let's say they offer him fifty five as a salary or sixty is a salary\nWhere we'd be dancing wouldn't we\nYeah okay yeah 'cause that's what that's like getting paid a lot more and I'm working the same number of hours you know it's like ... it's almost like he picked up more hours but didn't have to work on you see what I'm saying but it but again if they want to give him a salary and act like they did him a favor and it's a and and he gets paid forty\nBut he's worked in the same number of hours where he's working when he's making forty eight then that's not a blessing\nYeah it was just making sense to you yeah that makes sense\nIf it's even if it's forty eight forty eight we still like the salary because of the upward potential\nOkay\nLong term to long term good career movies moving into leadership and the management and that's where he wants to head tour as long term\nBut I'm ... you know\nYes but but again you just compare it to last year's income so the whole thing comes down to how does it compare to forty eight thousand what's this hour because that's what he was making working the hours that he's going to continue to be working apparently\nChris is with us in Tulsa, Oklahoma Hi Chris how are you\n[laughter] ... there's a new guy in

for your world on what do y'all do for a living I'm I'm a data analyst or first Siemens\n... and I'm an event planner for crew very cool good for you guys welcome very good so tell me the story what happened thirty nine months ago they put you on this journey\nWell about four years ago we were getting ready to get married yeah eight and that so we had the financial talk and we realize that we thought had about the same amount of that\nI'm going into our marriage and so we and we knew that that would limit our options and in life you know whether we wanted to move somewhere or you know such jobs things like that and so we knew we wanted to be that phrase but we didn't know how ... and that was only knew at that point and\nAnd leave at that without no that that's really normal and it's just part of being an adult ... so we didn't know it was even possible and ah\nA few months later when we got married and we had a few people mention\nDave Ramsey and financial these University in passing and we can really put a lot of weight on it like okay let's call and the stump sounds complicated no thanks [laughter] um and then I was out at lunch out with my friend Tasha and I she had her wallet with her and I made fun of her and I was like how your wallet is huge what do you have in here\nAnd she said oh you know my envelopes are in there and so I finally you know how to ask like okay fine explain what this envelope deal is to me because I've been hearing at I don't know what it's about\nAnd so she told me about your podcast and I listened on my way home and I you know it just kept listening and I finally talked about about it and they said you know\nThere's a either stay Ramsey guys than mentioned to me a few times and it looks like he has\nA financial plan and part of that is getting out of debt and maybe that's just something that we need to look into ... and that was about a month after we got married and ... a month after that we started our first ... ... ...\nInventor XP and so I didn't know he was supposed to participate in that kind of how I did the budget on my own and I presented it to him and I said you know if you're willing to do that the wife and I was like if you're willing to this I Need you to find the fact\nThat made me stop you already did it say hey Manny\nSigned a contract yeah yeah she knew you know I I was cautiously optimistic yeah um because\nAgain I had kind of lost that hope of I Would ever be out of debt I remember thinking praying like man it'd be nice to just be zero again you know starting a zero\nBut she made me sign it and I was like are just going to be like a a diet fat you know the next fad for a diet you get on it for two or three weeks and next thing and you know you get back to eat and um so\nShe made me sign it and you know I stuck to it you know if I put my name on something that deal yeah big deal that's that's my name that's my word is my bond you know she made me sign it\nAnd she knew that I it's very good I like that yeah wow that's fun yeah and so there's ... there's zero base budget was born at your house while and it's game on there in\nThe months later we take the are actually quite Nader team and the first\nOne oh yeah and we found in about five times and for all yeah thank you how may\nCourse Dave and I I just take a few moments you know to the to the listeners and those are you watching them you to coordinate in a few class you don't have to have the answers Dave and his team on the video will have the answers you know it's nine classes over nine weeks just take two hours a week that's\nEighteen hours you know instead of binge watching TV and keeping up with the car dash ins how 'bout you\nTeach people how to keep up with the Joneses so there were no sign you are have come up with that doing it infomercial regularly scheduled programing [laughter]\nOh thank you very nice well it is fun because not only in hold you accountable but you get to watch people you really get a front row seat to watch people change their lives\nAnd those nine weeks you know we've had stories folks come up to us and and and and one of the older gentleman our class with tears in his eyes just saying you know I've never stuck to anything in my life and\nAnd I'm doing this and it's working I'm seeing I'm going to follow this why is it blesses you and your name and now it's more than the facts the figures and the math that it's really changing lives I I Wish we could put our Congress directly you know they need it\nMan wow you guys are fun this is great so uh what kind of ... was the Ninety eight thousand\nOr dumb that it was a credit cards cars and the student loans loans are the most\nIn our one death that you hated and when you got rid of that you went to people\nMy student loan thought Atlanta yeah I had it so long it would have been in middle school was twelve years old I had this woman\nShe filmed me when I finally click to pay this off but and I was just like I Can't believe that it\nJust gone just gone yet yeah wow so when somebody's near the clash and they're like I don't know this ... stuff what kind of like you were kind of feels weird or this budget stuff feels weird or what do you tell them the main thing they have to do if they want to get out of that they got to do these two things are these three things what do you tell them\nThat I I Would say if I check it really sets you up for success for the rest nearly even just the one I think that's the key\nAnd everything is ... married and just knowing that you're on the include one person doing it alone it's just it's an awesome broadening the half again in teeming going for the single\nYeah and I and that and then I Would say the other thing that you know God was great to us throughout the process and one of the things that we were constantly communicate about is\nWhat does it looked like when we're debt free like that go what's that dream was something we want to do small goals ... along the way and then the long term goal you know one of our small goes again we discover you right when we got married so we do like to remind me throughout the process them should get a little frustrated she's like they ruined our honeymoon we tend to\nTake a hunting mountain come running and now I'm just a couple of weeks ago cash load our honeymoon to London for a job that's in there\nAnd uh so that will sell oh wait yeah and we enjoyed our time there and there was cast and we were still\nYou know like say we're bowling on a budget like we we cash floating in there when we ate we didn't spend a lot of money thing and\nYou know just keeping those little short term goals in our long term goal we always talked about is we want to get to that baby step seven where we can just given our goal is to live off the ties and give Ninety and so that's our long term goal is to just get for\nThe first time they arrive and just look at you sell them on your generosity that can be awesome oh very cool where I feel very proud of you all white people sharing your own as you went along I teach at many classes you gotta lotta cheerleaders not going to\nLay off ... friends family coworkers watching you know I Would uh you know I've worked folks find out what I'm doing and that share it with them and they're like oh I don't think we can do that I'm like you could do it you know yeah anybody anybody can now got decided to\nSo many American ... got a brain in an area that's yeah I hear that\nA brain injury a lot of memory as you I mean I'm an ... committee and so I'm not really sure how cute you know my dad asked me to do some research and I was like well I'm gonna call Dave and she like he would say about ... um is legal stuff as far as hot as secure as a future for Danielle and he'll be taking care of ...\nAnd so on a sad situation I assume they have an attorney right they do yeah mhm and they've assessed the ability to ah that that the person that hit them had insurance and or assets that make it worth chasing them around right\n[noise] yeah it's been a long process over four years just kind of thing what would happen with Daniel or this time frame that you know that the effects of this accident some\nWell there's a I mean there's there's not a magic thing but a a a good attorney in this situation should be able to help you run the numbers out that basically has a\nYou know the ... this accident has taken away his earning ability for the next sixty years mhm that's a very expensive\nThing that he is lost that they need to pay him for\nMillions and millions of dollars mhm it is what he would have learned in his working lifetime has now gone\nYeah and so to offset that due to the accident is the liability of the person that caused the accident and you don't have to be an attorney to know that okay so the calculation of that I'm ... and ... you know could we get a big enough lump sum that it that a lump sum invested\nCauses a you know Daniels income to never be a problem again mhm and so if you take a million dollars and invest it and then you know as an eighty thousand two hundred thousand dollar income the rest of his life\nMhm as an example you see what I'm saying and um and that's probably not enough but I mean that's that's a ... that's an example of a calculation to offset what he would have potentially earned in his working lifetime because that was stolen from him because of this accident and I'm not being\nAngry towards the person that I have no idea of the conditions of the accident but that's just the liability that that person and their insurance company has as ... as a result of law okay and your attorney David I'm already told you all all of that that's a basic thing is like business law one on one okay the very first movie learns that kinda stuff so um\nYou know once you do that then you're saying we were replacing his lost income and certainly then medical bills in addition to that\nAnd uh and medical bills would include any kind of job training we can do to help him have a quality life skill or you know anything we do increases quality of life going forward right\nMhm but there's not a magic number to figure this out is just a there there's a calculation you can do to estimate these things and you know all of those things added to gather makes the\nUh you know the the settlement negotiation with the insurance company go on now they may be in there probably is um limits to the insurance coverage\nAnd there are limits not till the liability but to the assets that the person has let's say this person had basically no money\nAnd the insurance companies on the hook for half million dollars you negotiate the rest of your life and you're not getting more and a half million dollars 'cause guys broke\nAnd you can't get blood out of Iraq okay and so you sue him into oblivion and it won't do any good suing people to make up my money it just takes money they do have if you win and\nI'm obviously you'd wind here but um but I take a long time so the settlement may be that the insurance that is the\nPerson carried maxed out and max is out of there alive at their assets now if that person is worth two million dollars in the insurance company has a million dollars then your maximum you're going to get out of this three million dollars take everything that person had\nYou wanted to do that and get the million dollars other insurance company to Megan from that person they solve everything they've got and give it to you or or give it to Daniel in this case and so that that's how the calculation works\nBut what most folks don't realize because this is so emotional so tragic is that the math is limited by the insurance companies match pay in their policy and the assets of the person that hit them\nThose two things out of the gathers most you're going to get that 'cause there's no magic money doesn't just appear because something tragic and this is definitely\nTragic or a situation I'm so sorry y'all are facing it but that's that's how you're mouthful shake out so what I'm going to be doing is investigating what the ... probably on the insurance policy is and the asset based on the person who hit them that's the thing to piece of information I Want to real quick\nBecause then it doesn't matter if I calculate ten million dollars is the case I don't want to offer if there's nobody gonna pay yet\nOr can pay [noise] this is Dave Ramsey show [noise]\n\nThe\nHey guys this is James child's producer of the day Ramsey show I'm excited to announce

pretty amazing cool okay so ah does when I I hate to our house but why are you not a chicken or [laughter]\nYou know my wife probably tell this story about your shoulders northern border with turkey\nBut actually I caught in a show about a situation that we wasn't agreeing on them and we sat with everyday says that's what we're going to do ... and so we agree to that [laughter] and so when I called in you caught him a chicken and said that he wasn't going to have the conversation he needed to have\nThe boundaries discussion or be able to tell somebody who didn't want to tell no that's right and also if he doesn't do that he's a chicken ... so you have the conversation so that's why you're not a chicken eggs that arise definitely well I was very proud of\nThat might be scarier than
