originally from Kansas though don't cook will welcome lake in your ear to do that for ... yes I Am love it I'm not sure we trade off I paid off sixty thousand good and how long does it starts it took me about three years okay and your range of income during that time\nI started out at fifty thousand and then on in the mid seventies I picked up a second job towards the end of my baby step to sell gathered leader for a living I'm an accountant I'm a CPA go watch the second job so I kind of just at a part time thing at the YMCA didn't earn a lot but it kept me out of trouble it kept me out of the store and\nYou'll do rubble targeting trouble yeah target gets me trouble back I Would draw the wrong or what kind of that was the sixty thousand it was all student loans or what's your degree in\nSo all accounting I got my undergrad and master's degree in accounting\nDegree which obviously shut your reshape yeah yes ... excellent excellent so whatever three years ago is that when you go to school\nYet so I graduated and and you know when you graduate they require that you do exit counseling with your financial aid and as terrible as it sounds I didn't really know what that signed on number was going to be so I was kind of just doing my exit counseling\nHoping for the best and I saw how much I owed and it was terrifying\nBecause I knew what my starting salary was going to be and I owed more than my one year's salary and so I saw that and I told my monthly payments and then I saw all these different payment plans and you know I'm an accounting\nSo I knew the interest was going to add up quickly and yeah it was just it was very scary but I knew about the baby steps so I just decided that's the route I was going to take broker show ... registered for him\nSo I actually listen to the ... when I was like in junior high and high school age\nAnd\nI Know well kind of um so my dad is a farmer in Kansas and in the summertime I Would drive tractor and combine and\nAll you have out in the field is the radio I didn't even have a cell phone back then too and so um you know I Would listen to ask him radio and you learn quickly that they play the same songs over and over again\nSo then I learned about a man and I could switch to a and listen to talk radio and so on you know I listen to us and in the morning and then I switched to the day Ramsey show from one to for a nice little three hour break and listening to talk radio and then switched back to that and so it was just a nice nice little break in the day\nI have a strange new version though combine the two of them are how your tuning in the radios you're out here ah getting getting some ah we got picture of it I don't know what was that we yes\nMy dad's a wheat farmer although yeah we would drive combine and cut the wheat and you know after that we'd have to work the feel younger drawback combined by yourself I Would probably say like twelve or Thirteen marry something like that yeah I have two older sisters and they did the same thing so yeah\nYou learn a lot of work do you have to grow up on a formula or NATO or yes are you are not a driver yeah very cruel or I'd say this was drilled in your head come over counting you get the degree look I'll go Oh yes oh maybe step so I got her ... from the radio then what happened\nAnd uh well I just jumped right into I so I went to Kansas State university I moved to Kansas City so it took me a couple of months to get established but then I jumped right in and I started paying off my debt and then I kind of hit a little bit of a bump in the road about a year into the process I was in a motor\nPickle accident and so I had to hit pause on the baby steps for about six to eight months and I just paid the minimum wage then and then I picked it back up and was able to pay everything off but\nYou know I'm so thankful that I was working your plan because I mean I probably wouldn't have had an emergency funding place and not was\nSo important that I had that it was so helpful to me and made this terrible situation that I was in um so much more manageable so I'm just so grateful that I follow the plan and had that set aside you know it's very important\nTo many vehicles in the store called article I had no much likely good for you yeah so how does it feel now that you did this\nIt feels amazing it's it's the best feeling in the world how old are you I'm twenty eight\nTwenty eight another one of these rockstar millennials are all the time very well done very cool so um you talk to your dad and your mom you were doing all this stuff\nYes I did I talked about the plan constantly I was probably annoying throughout the process just talking about Dave Ramsey [laughter] but yes I've everyone kind of been in on the loop John who is your biggest cheerleader I'm\nProbably my sisters I have two older sisters and they are also working the plan and they're working on paying off their student loans right now so now I'm like they see me pay them off and you know there'll be next so you know we kind of true to each other on throughout the process\nPerfect yes well done very good what do you tell people the key to getting out of ...\nUm I Would say you know obviously the budget you have to tell your money where to go but I also think I'm just being content with what you had that was such a big thing throughout this process is just learning to be content with what I had and not focusing on what's on social media and what everyone else is doing and that was\nJust so beneficial to me [laughter] um yeah you just have to focus on yourself\nAnd I love your life not there yes exactly yeah well where to go\nWell you are a sharp young woman I'm honored to have you on her I'm proud of you I'm sure your parents were proud of you and your sister's way to go yeah thank you Don you did it you get your data your data [laughter]\nWe got a copy of Chris ... book for you retire inspired that's the next chapter in your

motorcycle\nRod and combine Robin woman writer I'm telling you counted outlets Sarah dirt British three two one\n\nWay to go [noise] absolutely amazing very well done\nYeah get any better our eye\nMadison is with us in Atlanta Hi Madison welcome to the Ramsey show\nI ... thanks for taking my call sure what's up\nI'm twenty five years old and since I graduated college I've been working fulltime and pursue my master's degree while living at home though I've been able to finish my education that free\nUm but now that I'm finishing school in December and look at it out a darn away on my own and so I'm just curious if need recommended renting for awhile and getting the wet being on the on again or a or buying a house with the money that they're able to say from\nMore than a little bit unless it was a very unusual situation I'm not not a long time necessarily but six months or year anyway I'm assuming you're completely debt free\nCompletely that free and you have your money to fund mhm and beyond that how much do you have saved torture house\nI've got about thirty thousand in the bank right now way to go awesome what do you do for a living so I work in a federal HR consulting what are you doing now that are really dark and felt they were gonna yeah\nUm\nAnd I don't think he owes forty five thousand dollars on the ... I think that's what he owed on the car at the time they report it you know I'll look\nOut and he outlined a paradigm Seventy thousand yeah what was he driving and like I think it absolutely outraged [laughter]\nUh yeah any Roald some negative equity into that to get there and so the the forty five thousand is the difference okay they'll settle that for pennies on the dollar probably sell about for ten grand but the rest of the stuff I don't know I mean the ex wife thing I don't know what you're going to do that how in the world ends up on her and these two attorneys\nUm [laughter] wow a\nYou may be able to settle those would lump sum ... I mean you might walk up to her and say here's a check for thirty if you go away\nUm and uh she might take it you know but you'd have to have the thirty thousand dollars is what I'm doing better not thirty dollars and so you know you're going to put some money together here and that means both of you are going to get your income up and you both have to have like I desire to get out of money\nOr to get out of debt and and to make more money to do that you have to both have this thing and it's still going to take you a few years I mean if you guys just go bananas it's going to take you a few years\nSo um\nThat that's what you're facing and um but the the thing is folks I hear those will be dating out there it is not a deal breaker as far as I'm concerned it can be for you you decide what you want to do with your life but I don't tell people to not to get married over that\nI Do tell them to not get married over the decision to stay in that when you don't want to stay in that because that's going to be when you can't be an agreement on money before you get married when money is the number one cause of divorce we can highly predict that your marriage is not gonna last\nIt's it's ... it's okay if the number one cause a divorce you don't agree on\nGuess what you're going to get divorced I mean that's a fairly simple equation here and so you have to be in agreement so I don't the two fifty doesn't scare me scares me but it doesn't terrify me to say this guy's not keeper I don't know if he's a keeper not I can't tell he sure has a bad taste and lawyers\nAnd all that but as he got his way up\nBut um anyway man he ends up paying her lawyer his lawyer owes her Seventy grand and half of his income\n[laughter] it's not a bar that's good gosh so oh wow\nYeah somebody so anyway yeah ... this was not\nAn equitable outcome I have no idea what the situation was but wow what a mess\nAnyway so the all of that's behind us now the question is are we committed to cleaning it up if we are then ready to go game on and that's fine thanks for the call open holds a triple eight eight to five five two to five Alex is in Pittsburgh hey Alex our you\nHey Dave how're you doing better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] very good hey we are newly married and looking to create a plan forward good so the newly a newly came onto your videos on YouTube so I'm as I'm going through it looks like we are on step six word that free we of six months of a savings\nBoth put about Fifteen to Seventeen percent into four O. one K. wow no you're\nNot going out or ... or plan that you've already done all of it [laughter]\nAh yeah it doesn't happen all the time or a really good for you okay so what's your question\nUm yeah no kidding oh college fund so it's kind of like we're on step six out of about fifty yeah mortgages are only to okay [laughter]\nI Know and with that we have about Fifteen thousand extra on savings on top of our six month emergency fund answer the question is a story about forty eight on the house is worth about a hundred mhm um and it's an a good rental area so our goal is to move in about two to four years\nAnd with that fourteen or Fifteen extra grand do we use that to start paying off the mortgage more uh right now I Do double payments so we're already actively trying to pay that off quicker but do we [noise]\nWe commit to paying off house early or do we split it and keep keep doing the uh the paying down the the mortgage and poking up for a um a down payment knowing we want to\nI Love real estate and if you have a desire to home run real is that I really want you to get there I Do not personally buy real estate was that for investment and I don't tell people to ... stay with that ever [noise]\nAnd so you borrowing money to buy your next house meanwhile keeping a paid for rental is the same thing is borrowing money to buy a rental effectively so you're not going to take my answer but I Would tell you to sell the rental and by your next house when you're excesses paid off and save up your money in cash\nThat would be maybe step seven issue\nFor the call so this is the day Ramsey\nChef [noise]\nShe put it on you know the name

fund\nWhat can we do when we are so behind that we can not even catch up for about two months behind on all bills is causing a lot of stress on our marriage or kids were tired of living this way but we feel like we're in so much debt in so deep that we can't get out\nYeah just seeing it gets really really scary when you're in a situation like that and I'm part of what's scary is the sense that you're stuck part of what's scary is you're overwhelmed\nAnd um\n[noise] let's stop and pull one segment out of this thing and talk about that for a second\nOr two months behind on our bills and it's causing us so much stress on our marriage and kids being behind on your bills should not affect your kids\nThey should know about it you don't need to tell your five year old or behind on the lights that's not their problem that's your problem\nAnd you can tell the kids know but you don't have to give them a big long reason why knows a complete sentence [noise] no but don't pass off the uh you know don't pass off the stress of the kids\nNow let's look at the rest of this what do you do when you're completely\nOverwhelmed and terrified and feel stuck I've been there some of the I don't know what I'm Talking about you been there too right here it is no fun OK here's how you fix it\nYou have to begin to take control of what you can take control of you have an income let's make sure that that first is being controlled and that's called the budget\nYou do not have to be able to pay everything to do a budget all a budget is as you're telling the money that you do\nI have where it is going to go and so when you can't pay everything which catching everything up in one month would be paying everything right\nWhen you can't pay everything then you've got to say well the money that we have we're going to do the most we can do with that and for this month that's all we can do\nSo you prioritize you make enough to buy food you do not make enough to eat out so we're not going to restaurants but we are going to the grocery store and we're going to feed our family and we're going to cook from scratch 'cause it's healthier and it costs less\nSo there we go Boop you make enough to do that check\nWhat that one down for the food budget downright that number down and you can do that\nYou make enough to pay your lights and water and if you're behind on them you catch them all up this month\nBefore you do anything else after you ate get current on your lights get current on your water now if you have a six hundred dollar a month cable bill because you have NFL super duper pooper scooper or whatever then cancel all that crap but I'm Talking about water and the lights\nAnd gas to eat okay\nNow I don't really give a rip whether you can see Downton Abbey or not but I Am more concerned about you having lots of water on\nAnd gas to heat if it's gas sheet okay so you pay your basic necessities food and utilities you make enough to do that and get current on them right now\nNumber three is shelter now you pay your rent\nIt doesn't matter if you pay your rent and you can't sleep there because there is no heat so you've got to put heat in the place okay so you\nPay your rent if you're behind on your rent before you move on to number if I were you catch up on your rent\nNumber for transportation\nYour current on the car and you keep gash in the car now if that takes all your money and you can pay nothing else this month oh well\n\nNo I mean but think about is if you got a place to live this current you're not going to get affected your utilities are all current and they're not going to get cut off\nAnd you have food and a lot in the car is not going to get ... and it's got gas in it so you can go to work you live to fight another month that's very essential that you get through the ... and you do make enough to get through that\nBut you've been feeding the other monsters and the other monsters of the people that call and scream at you and in order for them to scream at you or you pay them\nDon't pay them\nMasterCard is not in front of your children eating metric ark and jumping the creek discover bondage can sit over there and suck its thumb we're not giving them any money American Express can definitely by my ankle seriously right\nThey can sit over on the sidelines right down to you get your food shelter clothing and utilities transportation and taking care of calls stood alone people tell Sallie Mae she has her own hardship for oh so you're not getting the ban\n\nThen you begin to continue to work down the list and you get to who you can get to in order of importance\nYou\nJust work the list of them were the list and we're the list now if you got a big pile of debt and you don't see any hope past those things then it's time to start talking about what we can sell and what we can do to create an income I mean you may have to amputate the taco\nOr you might have a big stinking car payment this killing you you may have to take like six extra jobs and dry for over or deliver pizzas or clean somebody's toilets on the weekends I don't know what you're going to do but my grandmother used to say there's a great place to go when you're broke to work\nIncrease the income make the money they have to take\nCare of your necessities first we call that the four walls of your house when\nYou have the four walls of your house protected the people inside are safe and they're dry\nThen you live to fight another day the powders dried I go to battle as they say you got to have a gun powder dry or it won't work right shall we ought to have a plan we get all those things laid out in his step by step by step by step see I'm feeling better about your situation already\nBecause I don't even know your numbers but I've done this for Thirty years and I almost I'd say Ninety nine point nine percent of the time I sit down with someone that has a job they can take care of food shelter clothing transportation ... by what you don't need clothing you got clothing just wear what you got\nThat's by locking in current rage 'cause I don't think you're going to see rates come back down dramatically um you know in in in the foreseeable future in the next say six to twelve months they're probably going to go up\nAnd so given that environment um you don't have to be an economist to figure this out it's fairly easy to look at the trends um then then I'm going to lock everything as fast as I can get in touch with Churchill mortgage the bank and get this done Barbara is weather's barbers in Salt Lake City Hi Barbara how are you\nHey babe during gray how're you doing\nBetter than I deserve what's up\nSo we are a month and a half away from me and gotten to that too good and um yeah he said in fact I don't want to live that momentum that we've had kept\nGoing toward that mhm and and going into baby step three there's like a few curve balls they pay 'em that are happening so we want to get the three ... my husband is also wanting to go back into school to get a bachelor's they get a better paying job\nThat would be our maybe step three\nOkay but I put my question and you know and we also want to start a family but we have some type of like baby kind 'cause we want to cash flow that\nWhen you have a baby on the way you will build up a baby fun no need to do it but when it\nOkay to build up the emergency fund first\nEmergency furnished first for you do anything and then you start doing other life goals I wouldn't worry about saving for a baby you don't really need to save a bunch of money for a baby um if you got insurance health insurance you know and you\nShould have health insurance and um you know you've got your emergency found in place and you know you'll be able to budget the diapers and believe me you'll work it out um but yeah you don't really need an extra baby savings account unless you just want to save up enough to cover whatever normal labor and delivery is out of pocket\nYeah that would be it would be around a I think we pay like Fifteen hundred dollars toward yeah labor and delivery\nNo matter how that's easy enough to do during this easy enough to do during the non much\nOkay yeah\nSo you can just do that whenever that happens and whenever babies on the way you can just say well we're now we're saving for that and\nAnd then you know anything you want to do that's an upgrade them move on whatever comes after the emergency fund 'cause it's not an emergency him going back to school not emergency this Fifteen hundred for the baby's not even an emergency or you can cover it it's a luxury to have that as an extra savings or maybe came on the way writes it maybe got here before you had to say you'll be All right\nOkay yeah you know and they're not curve balls are

nasty bad no I never went to a USDA long I have had more problems with that loan working with people that are in trouble than any other loan I've dealt with\nWow so wow\nNo stay wavelength as far as

thirty nine forty four forty nine thirty juice from Enrique custom vision you all today [noise]\n[noise]\nLab your hair Brad is in Nashville eyebrows welcome to the Dave Ramsey show [noise]\nHello thanks for taking my call sure was up yeah I had a ... ... mortgage pay off the question for you um are are currently have a mortgage\nMortgage I'm back on many balance of three hundred and fifty thousand [laughter] and I am wondering if I should use money and my after ... ... a savings account um ... my emergency account to pay their soft or Chuck Chuck's on either\nAtacama how have the money I guess we're just having trouble ...\nAlready coming up with ... with the whole you know time value of money just you know put you know what what I can make and they\nWeren't sure what your house actually we're\nProbably about six hundred thousand\nOr based on your concern about turn value of money ... six hundred thousand on it\nI'm chunk Dexter on it why yeah\nThat's right that's actually that's contrary to your ... your money problem\nYou're yeah you're right\nIt's inconsistent okay so here's what's going on right you you have um some good information but it's incomplete\n'em and show that ... that cause you to be left with a a a primitive analysis and let me walk you through that right because I used to think exactly the same way Sean where your brain is [laughter] yeah okay so because you obviously have a good intellect\nOn especially on the natural things so your your concern is if I can borrow money at three four or five percent and I can reinvest isn't a good mutual fund at ten ten eleven twelve percent am I not making that spread why would I ever\nYou know miss out on that spread and um you know I've got the money invested now it's making me ten and twelve whatever it's making me not the day but it's making me that overall and why would I lose that spread and uh I had to really wrestle that down because that's how I was trained in the financial world obviously with a finance degree\nAnd then I had to start looking at dinner when I started looking at stuff through the lens of the borrower is slave to the lender and there's no good mentions of debt and the scripture and I'm going okay either God's stupid or and I've got something figured out he doesn't know about or there's something I don't understand\nAnd so um what I figured out was was that that formula that we just used\nTen percent over four percent ... percent spread\nLeaves out risk\nAnd in a sophisticated uh investment analysis you adjust for risk\nMeaning I Would never compare a growth in income mutual fund apples to apples\nWith an aggressive growth stock mutual fund the rest will grow stock mutual fund might have an average annual return of twenty twenty percent the other one might have an average and overturn of twelve percent but the risk ratio is completely different risk profile and those two phones is completely different agreed\nAgreed okay so what you would do is you would adjust and in in that world you can actually use a thing called a beta with an inverse formula and we'll get an all that crap but basically you can say because one is more risky than the other way mathematically adjusted for risk to be able to compare them apples to apples\nAnd that's the proper way to do an analysis between those two funds but no one applies that concept that that level of sophistication to this debt analysis\nThat says Tom value of money and I could use this money to make more than I'm making now so ah but what I have found is is when I Do pay off my house I I've done a numbers risk neutralizes a lot of those the difference between the foreign the ten percent\nIt takes away most of that spread when you when you you know when you factor interests because we're there is risk when your mortgage now it's not a lot of risk 'cause you got the money in the bank today to pay it off by or an investment by it off but there is rich\nAnd so are you have to admit that you know one hundred percent of the foreclosures are girl home with a mortgage there is rich and so I'm getting rid of that\nWhat I found this it's not completely quantifiable I'm In a simple mathematical formula\nBecause when you don't have a mortgage you start making different decisions with your career you start making different purchase decisions you start having different levels of enjoyment with your money\nYour relationship with your spouse talks to have a different depths because there's a a level of security in your overall life that there wasn't before and those things are really hard to put on paper so what I have figured out is I'm going to live a hundred percent debt free\nAnd I'm going to invest like crazy the rest of the money that I have in cash that comes in and I ended up with a ton of money doing that because I don't have any risk and I'm just investing real money not borrowed money shut all of that to say if I woke up in your shoes I pay off your mortgage today\nAnd if you ... if this discussion good sour on you and you think they ram she's crazy a year from now just get you another mortgage\nNo I I I I completely agree I mean I for one thing that ... is just a lot of money after a while you know I just go back and just paid off but my mind sort of just wrestle back and forth\nAnd I what I'm trying to point out is is your the your gut is not intellectually\nThe wrong your mind is your minds using an incomplete permit formula\nGot it that's what I'm pointing out is that makes sense completely yeah after you got this thanks for the call open phones at triple eight eight to five five two to five to your heart stories like real you got your heart your heart's where you measure rushed march telling me pay off my house\nMy hands telling me I could make more money on these what do you need money\nBut your heads missions from stop its mission rich\nAnd um it's kind of a fun thing to I was doing this for the clash of MBAs speaking to them and a cause MBAs or all talk you know masters in business they're all taught strategic thought and they're all taught to borrow money\nAnd uh I guess last year a oh stop to borrow money my broke finance professor used to teachers to borrow money and so um you know it it's butter broke finance professor at like a shop teacher would missing fingers right people so I think about this right so I got it you just can't think that way and you have a different way of looking at things show\n'em but there's you can really do a very\nSophisticated mathematical application of this it would just take a lot of 'em too much time really on the radio to walk through the whole thing but\nWhat happens is is think about this how many of you if you had zero debt and you looked over in your four one K. and there's three hundred thousand dollars and you had forty thousand bucks in the bank for your emergency fund would make different career decisions\nWay too many readers said yes meaning I Would leave this jerk that I work for it and I would go do dot dot dot\nUnless I go in business for yourself necessarily might just have a different career you might go on a completely different direction that thing you've always wanted to do while you're waiting\nYou know and here's the weird thing is that thing you've always wanted to do is probably where you make the most money you've ever made in your life if you're wise about how you do it this idea that if you're going to liberate ... on your mark half the money you make twice the money", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "year": "2018",
