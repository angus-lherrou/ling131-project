constant uphill battle and on and I had this crazy burden because it was all mine yeah it's a little bit of a guilt trip yeah lately and so that class honestly made me feel a little more support it

story\nThat had everybody in the audience crying knock rod commercials are many many as you get right but uh I'm a ... a crowd everything but and you and me ball on out there it was ... ... a powerful story about your talk was about overcoming fear yeah a great talker\nThank you yeah it's a it's a really important topic and I've I've really taught on this topic for years of business to teach because it's the number one barrier to why women don't go for it why they don't chase their dream or use their talents or start that business or a or you know try something new it's really fear that hold them back and see if I could help them\nGet to the fear and through the fear that I can give them all the help and business that they need but when we started dreaming up smart conference title my balance for years\nAbout okay let's keep it fresh let's do something new and I generally Jeremy ... you know my leader and myself we're talking how can we apply this content that audience and really realize that it's so easy because everyone deals with fear whether it's in your marriage or or in your relationships your career and so I worked hard to take that talk and adapted for this audience them and I was really happy without\nA doubt yeah it was really really strong ring of stuff so much of it I mean I I've been uh I just was editing a blogger for commercial where Ike a couple of commercials where it goes by the content people on a blog article I'd written them a few weeks ago before I even heard her talk and who have that element of overcoming fear because I think there are so much\nWe talk about transforming around here a lot of transformation transfer forming and\nGetting yourself out of debt transforming your marriage outlets parrot talks about that rich on less with marriage and money a van or a you know Anthony with transforming what your teenagers you ladies in business and every time there's transformation as a possibility failure as a possibility and fear kicked accent\nAnd doesn't that voice in your head gets really loud\nAnd it starts even sound rational and you start to make it make excuses that really make you make a lot of sense and you stay stuck but if you have someone that can speak into your life whether it's a mentor a friend a spouse that says you can do this and here's how when you lay out the path which we've been talking about that even just today that's what\nA you know ran the solutions are so great at getting people to plan whether it's with their money or their business and so on um the it's I Love that\nQuote from the triathlete said don't listen to your self talk to your so yeah it it started listening to yourself to start telling yourself the way it's going to be but I didn't even know how he described and he's just so funny what you're talking to us\nYeah when I listen all self all I hear spirit out and worried but when I talked to myself I can tell myself anything I Want to and it that simple and you can

talk about putting this together and what\nAnd the scope planner well when I introduced it to our team a few weeks ago really the best way that I can explain that\nThere are different things that I use my own personal life to grow and to improve and reach my goals I read books to grow I Will use work books if I'm doing a devotional or Bible study I have to do list and I use a journal to write down goal Santa calendar and a calendar\nHow can we pull all of these pieces together into a planner that connect those dots so for example in January we set goals and then we talk about with and we actually put those on the calendar then we put them on the task lists and you begin to see\nHow those goals you set in January really can carry through the entire year and and the way that bill today was like I Would have coaching session so I have questions in there for reflection and activities to work through so if I was sitting down with your coffee these the questions I Would ask you to help you get to where you want to be so it's really fun and then every single month\nHas a different topic in teaching to help you grow and this is kind of like a complement to the business boutique book it's almost like a workbook that helps you\nPut it it'll last a month of August is taking care of you know and then you've got questions in there when do you feel your best what activates would activities give you energy and bringing joy and what things make you like yourself the mode\nRight and then you've got worksheets and then you got\nYeah places to put that on the counter so we cover a variety of topics from social media we help you plan out your social media calendar uh selling how to write out a sales scrapped time management how to keep track of where your time goes so all of it is super tactical and it holds your hand and hold you accountable even on a weekly spread and did a Facebook Live earlier\nAnd I showed the the audience the weekly spread we're at the top\nIt says things I'm doing this week for myself my business and my family and it helps you remember to make sure you're spending some time and some energy and in those most important areas there's a place to write down what you're grateful for there's a place to write down your to do list\nA and all those things point back to the goals that you said at the beginning we revisit those throughout the year as we go so it's just an amazing tool\nTo help you actually stick with their goal to share\nYou know the scope planner is um has got some of the elements that you see out there in these really nice\nUm journals or a devotional plans or whatever and you you combine some of those and it's got extra things in it that some of them don't have and um I didn't realize there is a real space that a lot of people pay like a hundred bucks for\nThe ... that's right normally there anywhere between sixty and eighty dollars some of them are a hundred dollars things nights we spent\nSome books on the the just the design but the actual the actual product to sell the costs to go to ... ... ...\nWhen we got that sample a few weeks ago I promise you I have not put it down I take it with me everywhere I go just because it's so beautiful I just want to hold it\nBut yeah it's a really high quality it's really adorable and it's something that's beautiful you want to hold you want to keep ... sits nicely with the business to take book and\nAnd how we're dealing it for what what was going on and I'm forty nine and it's also it is it on ... ships November first little time to get your order and November ... exactly and if you get it on pre stay on the next couple of weeks\nYou get a bonus free lesson on meat teaching goal setting so it helps you even kick start this and put it into practice\nOkay so if you get it before the actual street date of ... and their bones video it's probably a hundred dollar item okay\nVery cool the gold plan or the business boutique do planner for twenty nine teen it's more than ... upon us it's upon us that's a deal I Love it I Love it I Love it congratulations very well done now the business boutique event\nComing up also November the first oddly enough the district for the Goldwater yes you'll have them there for say oh that's right it would be the first place we've ever sold them physically that's right at one of the evidence and uh that are sold out\nIt is it is they've opened up a few seats but it is already at capacity and ah and we're really excited this is an event that has so much energy around it and so now everyone's just counting down the days till it's here we can't wait\nEnded up actually being my brand differentiate her\nBecause I Know how people feel I've been there done that I got the T shirt you've got a brand advantages you've got the female touch on this furniture\nUm and you're going to put a different kind of\nLook different kind of feel to it\nAnd uh and it makes you different you're not just another group making furniture it's really cool you know it makes you stand out I just love it I think you need to get some really cool pictures\nWith you with your power tools and yeah do you have some you know get in there and what the big ... or whatever and safety glasses on and that's your business card\nI I think it's an advantage I think it's a ... opposite of a disadvantage but when I started\nMy insecurity I thought was a brand disadvantage has turned into one of my biggest brand advantages because it might be different and you need to identify that when you're doing a business right\nIt's interesting we just had entree leadership master series last week and I was on a panel with Suzanne stand in the ... and ... and a very common theme we heard a in the audience asking questions is\nHow ... women leaders Lenin leader handle yeah how do I succeed as a woman in a man's industry\nAnd there are certainly some industries where you need to be aware of what you're going into but the reality is so often\nIt is bigger in our head than it is in reality it to your point if the thing we think is holding us back when that's the thing that's going to set apart and make people want to buy from us and so I I Love the whole perspective Amelia ah that that you already see yourself as an entrepreneur now you just need to see yourself as a successful business owner and start to take that step\nWell I mean I think about somebody like um you know we're Condi Rice be cuddly entree summit and spend time with her obviously female obviously African American obviously super brilliant oh you've got smarter to ... oh yeah with a woman it's unbelievably smart [noise] but um I mean I\n... successful I mean ... ... the United states of America I mean you know this is no small job here yeah and\nBut what ended up happening with her what what we we were asking her about the same thing the barriers you know the racial barrier the sexism racism all this kind of stuff and she used the line from her neighborhood\nShould growing up in a segregated neighborhood in Birmingham, Alabama that her mom I told her it doesn't matter where you're coming from it matters where you're going Mm that's good ... and she said I don't let other people with their prejudice beside\nMy fate yep I decide my feet high and\nLow it was like coming out it was just very calm but yeah I heard it out loud and clear right off it ends on there but again it comes back to that that um you know you're going to I'm going on the space and I'm going to turn what you think is a disadvantage race sex whatever it is yeah into an advantage because it's a brand that for a traitor\nI Love how you've been talked about you and sharing buying furniture if you look at most American household the women make the purchasing designing decorating decisions or what I think of a a woman that makes plans she's known in space is at creating furniture and plants and white and I buy her plant like bunk bed plans or a fork in the backyard plans\nAnd I love hers more because she has that female touch via email designed so far at least you think she does not only in my mind I got you got you connected we're best friends you know to me so uh other area will will draw those people based on that she didn't even realize it\nYeah that's that's very very important I think this is a good information the book is business boutique it as a number one buzz shower and you can see why Christie ride is with us the founder of that and you hear her speak all over America and teach and you'll see around media\nYou'll see her at ... dot com and those of you that are members of the uh business boutique academy regularly get coaching from her uh and of course now the crusty right business podcast yeah very well right\nIt is it is taken off and

commute they may be going for a run or they may be cooking or cleaning or something around the house\nThat you're able to encourage them and give them a the steps and plans and tools that they need to win so it's been really fun to to see the stories coming out of someone that their life has changed from the podcast\nWell the information is important because their promotions what changes your life

so I can talk to him and I cut my brother Charlie and he kind of ripped me is what he\nDid Dave Ramsey on me because\nI'm just said\nThat you know we make too much money can be that's broke and he told me that we could you know if we could solve this or that and you start talking about selling the car and selling the tractor and selling the truck getting\nThe van and I kind of came up with excuses for everyone and you know it wasn't really listening very well and hung up like in tears just crying and\nTried to go to sleep that Clinton and ended up getting up out of bed a went into my office got on the computer and it started making a spreadsheet and I sat down and the first thing I Love that was the car um it was the only vehicle you other than the tractor that we owe\nMoney on still mhm um we had my mini van was paid off um had its power over two hundred thousand miles um but wasn't worth a lot so I didn't see that being helpful but we had a unique opportunity with the car because we I think on one of the vote so I can be false\nWas he handle yeah you know and\nYeah and they were offering us you know we can do the five after that and we were planning to keep it but I looked at the options and started looking at if we get the buy back and got the cash settlement got rid of the payment and the position that would put a than I did actually had us at that point to where we would pay off in thirty six months\nAnd about two or three o'clock in the morning I called my brother back from what I've been doing and he said he would buy us F EEO\n'em for Christmas and allow us to the program at home we kind of within the middle of nowhere and then I told him that I Would text tap the next day and I talked to him and I was a little nervous because the car with kind of hats and I didn't think he\nGot you got any man up that's driving the tractor\n[laughter]\nHe's like I'm not driving the maybe then but yeah but he I texted him and surprisingly hit like most and I told them about my spreadsheet that I made this nice color coded spreadsheet and I sent it to him and surprisingly he came back with what to do that\nUm and\nI I think that you are you are ready to you are sick of this\nOh absolutely yeah\nYeah and then you come home and you guys go to financial position or city\nBut we didn't end up going into what we did it um through the program at home home study on it\nI Gotcha yeah our church an hour and a half away and write write letters or\nNot now nowadays you can just watch it all on line but it's different than yeah very good you guys so what is the key to getting into that you paid already one thousand Eighteen months what are the Volkswagen sell for\nAll the like and that they paid off the amount of hours and hours and then we also got about an eight thousand dollar cash settlement on top of that\nOkay so you got twenty five of the eighty one was that one ... yes yeah All right and then what what is the key to getting out of debt than you did it in Eighteen months\n[noise] um I Would have to say for for me it was communication close communication to where both of us know exactly what's going on with everything all the time rather than\nIn the past where I had largely let her kind of control everything\nMhm which she she did a good a job as I could possibly expect\nExactly why but she was by herself\nBut she was by herself I didn't have a full understanding of what was going on right how it was being done exactly where we were our new small numbers I did not have\nThe big picture and you know guys being visual creatures the disparate she gave me the big picture in color coded Claritin [laughter]\nSo it's definitely a huge last summer the control one path not involved but you've gained um someone else's shoulders to help carry the load right\nYeah yeah it became amazing actually what happened with that would be on fiber got angry because\nHe got so on board that what that and got all that we had a huge enacted because he thought there'd be no more extension and that was back like a few months before we started and then I'm about", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "year": "2018", "city":
