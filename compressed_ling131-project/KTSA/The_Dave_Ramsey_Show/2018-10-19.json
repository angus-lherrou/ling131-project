started doing stand up and there was kind of you know you're out there you're trying to get exposure and stuff and and that was but it was more than that it was more of a treat for me because in one way you're you're you're\nVolunteering but you're also making a difference at the same time because those people were laughing before they even got in there you go here they had no idea I was trying out new material\nAnd uh but at the same time I use the same joke\nBecause they kept moving like okay I'll use this one again you know how many volunteers that are\nGood and I could not believe how

TSA if at one of seven one way or the animal out and we're conducting we're having we're celebrating our radio sonnets supportive the Raul Herman is Thanksgiving\nDinner tradition thirty ninth year that it will be served this year at the convention\nCenter downtown we're joined now on the telephone by Jessica Jimenez who is the granddaughter one of the grand daughters of Raul has been is Jessica\nIt's always been what have you ever on her own is coming out about Ford cancellation reinforces and so a lot of excitement about ... in um as high as these numbers\nAre we're we're we're at a a sixty one plus thousand dollars um as as big as that sounds we still have a long way to go we still need those phones to ring at two ten six five four fifty one fifty one but sometimes I think that\nUh to get people interested in this or or to help them understand it you really have to go back to how it all started and it kind of tell that story a that we were just referring to of what your grandfather had in mind what inspired him to start this in the first place\n\nDid we did we lose her are you still with us Jessica yes okay what like the second oh okay I'm Sorry I Know I was going to say it might it might be great if we could kinda tell the story of what inspired him to get to start this event\nYeah absolutely and my grandfather was a man as ethnic or beginning that you know once he had some successes lifetime she wanted to get back to others that he had and afford it and so I'm really he was wanting to you on that you let your community in the mascot that he could and he thought what better way to\nPeople and to think and you know everyone got his blessings and who wanted to get the others and he started Thanksgiving dinner at a ... I'm probably not as restaurant and you really want it on our seniors on a holiday that is very important for him\nYou know I think it's it's interesting that he chose Thanksgiving because when you think about there are so many charities that are aimed at Christmas\nAnd and that's usually a holiday about are supplying people's a material needs but Thanksgiving is is about um being with people and more than being hungry in this world of ours today you have people that are just lonely right to do is cut off\n... exactly and I think that's what he saw as people would come into restaurants especially the senior she felt lonely and just really wanted to be you know the kids had moved away or they were by themselves without um he felt like Thanksgiving was a perfect opportunity to thank them for all they had gone to the community and also um nearly honor them on such a special holiday\n[noise] I was asking um earlier I'm a about earliest memory and different people who have been involved and people in your family what does the earliest memory Patricia told us hers and what is your earliest memory of the of the dinner\nOne thirty three friday afternoon and the Radio's on the Alamo\nLance jak regarding here Sean ... coming up at two o'clock let's do it for the update right now and see where we are asking\n[noise] argue updated [noise] ...

TSA dot com some people felt they just wanted to get it done get it taken care of not wait until friday maybe new they'd be busy today so thanks to everybody\nThe donated early and you can still give it that website if you go to Kay TSA dot com it's on our home page\nBut you know when you donate it's kind of like you're joining something I Know a lot of places a lot of ... um\nCharities and organizations will give you a a little card for your wallet but who needs another card in their wallet right or they'll give you a sticker but who wants to another sticker what year joining here isn't so much as a card or a sticker but what you are joining when you give that money is a great San Antonio tradition\nAnd no matter how long you've lived here or how recently you moved here you instantly become a part of it\nThat donation and what you're part of is as you heard Patricia say something that is\nA completely volunteer driven\nCompletely from the heart it's all about the food and the fellowship on Thanksgiving Day and of course many people come out to the convention center and donate their time but other people you may not be able to do that you may be\nA out of town on Thanksgiving maybe you're traveling the weakest Thanksgiving you're going to be celebrating in another city or in other states\nYou'll be far from San Antonio you'd like to be there but you're not able to maybe you have to work on Thanksgiving Day and that's okay too but by making this donation right now no matter where you are and what you're doing\nYou're a part of that dinner the thirty ninth annual or if that's a good point because you're saying you can also make a donation in memory of\nSomeone who's maybe passed this year\nOr somebody in your life somebody in your family we were thinking earlier I'm about to our good friend\nA Alberto ... do a leg re on the radio he worked with us here at alpha media at on our ten year station for years and years and um I Know many of you loved him\nAnd hurt him on the radio but what you may not have known was that on this day every year he was all over this building a encouraging our volunteers encouraging our phone operators he had a a good word for everyone to smile forever want a joke\nHe took pictures with people when people figured out who he was suddenly they all wanted this to have a you know pictures with them and so forth but he would push this event I'm On the north and your station and on on line and I'm coming here again and be a part of it and uh I Know he is watching us\nFrom the best seat in the house today so we're thinking of him we appreciate him and if there's somebody in your life like him that you want to make the donation in memory of will note that uh and will include that ah when we acknowledge your donation so to ten six five four fifty one fifty one\nAnd ... when I think about I'm going down and seeing the dinner and volunteering to serve um it was always interesting to me when you go down there [noise]\nUm let's say it's your first time\nThey have a great system for a you know directing you and showing you where to go and what to do and typically if you're serving you'll carry a tray with four or five plates on it and they'll tell you where your table is and where to bring the food but what's cool is there are people that have been doing this\nFor years and years and so they're kind of like the mentors for the new volunteers they kind of come and help you and if they see the you look a little bit last\nUh they make sure you know where you're going it's just incredible that this many people could be managed just one day a year and it all comes together and it all works very efficiently and and so I Want you to know that your money really goes to something that not only\nA is a great cause but really works like a well oiled machine it's incredible if you've never had a chance to see it take my word for it it has something to see and that'll be the convention center on Thanksgiving Day\nJohn round is joining us now here in the Alamo allows let's hear it for Katie essays four to seven afternoon host Sean ride it out there they are high [laughter]\nGreat debate here it's a and you're gonna be taking over at two o'clock two o'clock but um I think you you can probably speak to this ah because you you know when you came here when you moved here and do you ah tell me what you first thought when you first heard about or more introduced\nTo this this event you know this was really one of the first things I did hear a you know on site because I'd been setting\nYou know for you as a high you know filling in Somalia via satellite yeah yeah and uh So Greg was like hey what is being Thanksgiving radio San you need to be here at like seven and will record and the reason I was like older\nDidn't really know what was going on and uh did some research and was really kind of\nJust amazed by this kind of an event and I really didn't know the town very well at that point a book beyond the Alamo and sort of the basic history of it\nAnd it was ... by the time but I think by the time that first radio than was over I felt like I was home like these are these are the people this room in the bay and I look at some of these folks I've seen you know every year for seven years\nAnd ah it's just wonderful to be a part of it it really is yeah it is I mean I think the dinner and I you know several people have said this already I think the dinner itself is such a almost a microcosm of what Santa set us up San Antonio is in general\nYou know between the diversity and then the people caring for each other you know it's what attracted me to San Antonio yeah because it's it you know maybe a bigger city wouldn't be able to center it on one place or I wouldn't be one\nAnd a smaller city wouldn't have the resources and the businesses to\nSo it somehow just fits here it just works here with people's you know giving added to it really does and and I've said it every year and and it's very true it's and we've heard this again all day it's a big small town right right and people really do watch out for each other and you see that the dinner and that's a ... you're right and a lot of cities you would not\nPeople you know you could fall over the street people just walk right over a right or you know move out of the way but here it's just not like that there really is a connection amongst people and it really is ... you know goes beyond economic status and various communities were all San Antonio as\nWell and you know I think too I think we there are more people in this city I think who know what it's like\nTo live paycheck to paycheck or have been are are not that far removed from a place in their life where they could not put this meal on the table at their own house right so when they get to the place where they can breathe a sigh of relief and finally maybe have a little money in the bank\nYou were a member you feel close to what this is about it's not like something you can't wrap your mind\nAround right right and I I think what gets me every year of the stories of the people who were in a bad situation\nIsolated cut off from family or a bad economic place and they went to the dinner 'cause they had no other place to go and the experience move them so that later when they kinda got back on their feet they come back as volunteers and then they're there every year you know to help\nDo the same for somebody else in the run amazing right\nAnd you know life's not like the movies it's not like a Thanksgiving rolls around on the calendar and all of a sudden bam your house is full of lawyer who wants to there's a lot of people in this world who are estranged\nFrom family for various reasons a river we had a story one year but a a guy who um\nWasn't ... he had been through some addiction issues and he just wasn't ready to go back ... they they were ready to have him but he wasn't ready to go back to the whole scene\nWith relatives and so forth and he went to this dinner and it was the best of both worlds he was able to be with people but not necessarily with the whole family and the bag of that and this affords a lot of people who are alone just a chance\nTo be with other people just to be with other people you know something as simple as that you know I think we've all had that one holiday where you're not around anybody for whatever reasons and it's a very isolating feeling and so here in San Antonio everybody's family\nIs how I see it and when we\nDo this a dinner when when they do this dinner at the convention center is done in a very personal way people are served at the\nBy ROTC kid so you don't feel like you're being shuffled along like cattle All right you're going to be in the ... gene line very personal very welcoming all the way through from the beginning of the meal to the end\nAnd you know what I also like is that and I I've noticed this over the years too is that people bring their kids to help out a deal yeah and then their kids begin that trend you know pick up that uh that tradition of working at the dinner it's good to see that oh you ... yeah\nThey get to see hey it's not not everybody has it easy not everybody has what we have at home and and take for granted which are you were just going to say something about all of the ways people volunteer right\nYes absolutely and then we also have a home down meal delivery so volunteers that may not be able to give a lot of time on Thanksgiving Day but they want to go and make a few thousand every uh we set aside about three thousand meals that cannot make it they can't leave their home\nAnd I have actually gone to visit and it's real humbling experience because they don't have much at all\nAnd they are also very lonely however that very well and just to have somebody come and things in the hot meal it's like you know it's not something that it every day\nThat can be the best day of the whole year for\nThat message Jeffrey nowadays you know ... that little speck of life to them when they feel like you know they have nothing to look forward to\nI think you know that you can talk about\nIn the food sense but I think we have more hunger for human contact yeah than anything these days I mean granted if you don't eat you'll die right but people are shrivel laying\nA from a lack of just human contact that even though we have social media and in theory we're more connected than we ever have been and there's more ... I think there's more loneliness yeah maybe and and it's not all you know some of it as we move around more and more mobile society you can choose to live and\nWork anywhere you don't have to stay in your village people did a hundred years ago but the flipside of that is is just a lot of people out there who come this time of year suddenly realize they really don't know anybody you know they don't have anywhere to go\nYes or their entire social life is looking at the phone or it's right on line so we do we\nAre hurting creatures we need each other [laughter] you know really really do\nAnd um you know no one asks why are you here when you show up at the convention center there just glad to have you You're welcome then and um [noise]\nI don't know it is it's a it's a unique thing Patricia I don't think if you ever stopped doing it I don't think anyone could today start up something like this that would be this big you know it's just it's the momentum you have going from thirty nine years of of your father started giving you all continuing well\nI Want to say thank you to San Antonio community because this October twenty six will be Twenty years since my father's passing and when he first passed nobody really knew if it didn't it would continue and everybody wondered what it's going to happen and of course our family naturally said\nYou know the dinner had you know was celebrating its nineteenth a year and it was because of the community that my father was able to have this event for so many years the least we can do is to continue to partner alongside the community to make it happen and I'm\nI'm very grateful because the community continues this wonderful legacy and my father's name but I'm even more attached and how much it's grown\nAnd the amount of people that are being helped every year\nAnd a it's a great gift to our family it means so much to us because like you mentioned sometimes when the founder you know passes on you know sometimes it doesn't the legacy doesn't continue\nSo what you're doing now in you know giving you a five dollar ten dollar donation you continuing this wonderful tradition for so many people who would otherwise not have a place to be\n[noise] so if you are fortunate enough to know where you're going to be on Thanksgiving Day you've got your plane tickets or you've already invited the people you're going to have at your house or whatever it is um that is great\nUm make the call right now for that person who at this moment doesn't know if they will be with anybody doesn't know if they're doorbell will ring doesn't know if they will be sitting alone of abetting a TV dinner\nYou could make such a change and that change on that day could be a turning point for somewhat it could be the beginning of coming out of their shell of getting over a hurting feeling or a feud and the family or whatever it might be this dinner begins a lot of of next chapters for a lot of people\nAbsolutely we've even had volunteers

TSA right eleven years\nWe've been doing it and you guys are coming up uh what's that list is like giving me knows what's that like ... and this will be the thirty nights dinner or to him and his family has put on a as I'll give it up for them as family Ronald ... is wonderful people make some noise [noise]\nJoining us right now is ten yet Sam is and uh you handle these social media aspect and as we were just talking social media is such a part of our lives now or that it would tell me what you do in regards to that\nWith ... and her head as I'm social media as how we communicate and pretty much every capacity and so\nUm we've been working alongside Patricia hadn't at dinner for about seven years and we managed to all of that social media accounts and making sure that we're disseminating all that information about ... ...\nAnd of course the radio I find in ways that people can donate but also the stories of ah the people who are attending a dinner and making sure that people understand the impact\nThat they can have when they donate because it's such a significant one um and being able to volunteer you know I I\nHad been through a number of them now and just watching the entire process from start to finish from when we start raising funds at going into the kitchen and watching thousands of volunteers come together to give up their time to prepare these meals for strangers that I don't know and then watching actually be served on Thanksgiving Day\nUh-huh which is my favorite day of the year because it's the most bang for one of the year or so really having such an attitude\nOf gratitude um and and watching these people so graciously give and then for that food and the celebration to be so graciously received um people just light up they light up when they're able to participate in it\nSo that it's also part of what you do that like you just said you are there on that day also doing video I imagine until you've taken stores you then after the dinners over can show people\nThis like you just said this is what you're five dollars brought right or this is what's your your two hundred dollars but you know the the smile on this person's fresh\nYeah so we communicate that through um their Facebook and Twitter and Instagram and then um the likes of all of the wonderful media who have to share that story as well\nAlthough we were just discussing the you know it is a well established fact at this point 'cause I pretty much only do Facebook and that and that's what what the old people\nRight isn't that we are now like you said that's the old fires for a social media and that's all I knew Simon\nAnyway uh so tell me but we're also talking about the three thousand dinners go out to folks who can't\nMake it yes on the homebound me also as anyone as unable we hope that everyone who need that as I was able to come to the convention center on Thanksgiving Day but if anyone is unable they can also call to\nUm have the dinners received and um had the privilege and honor of of ah delivering some of those meals a couple of years ago and it was\nI don't think I quite\nUnderstood the emotional impact of the dinner um until I did that uh I I\nIt was later on in the evening when I was delivering and um [noise]\nWe gave some I I remember I brought in extra piece of pie to one of the gals who I delivered to 'em and she burst into tears and gave me probably the biggest bear hug I've ever received and\nIt really just made me think um if she has this excited\nI'm an enthusiastic about receiving extra piece of pie like how much more do I have I and sometimes I don't I don't see that and I don't appreciate the things that I have every day and it made me realize that I Need to and it made me realize how important this dinner as\nA piece of pie and change some of these whole year perhaps you know my mom I might actually be one of those people at this point who is going to be living on her own at some point eighty six years of age and I'm hoping to get her out here so that uh you know she can be a part of this because that's when you were at that stage in life you know for a lot of folks your\nYou know you feel like you're cut off from people right you're just not around any one of those showing up with a full meal and an extra piece of pie is the most wonderful thing in the world and ...\nYou know and whether delivering or are being there in person you know it's that apple to have that human contact in that conversation and I'm just being able to celebrate with others I think that something that's really important to so maybe\nMaybe that five dollars or ten or a hundred however much you have the giver um maybe that's bringing the food on the plate but it's also bringing not experience ah that they're able to remember for the entire year\nUm with entertainment and dancing and it's really fun to watch um strangers and family and friends just get together on the dance floor and enjoy that music and celebrate together and um it really is it's a full experience and it's not just\nWhile they're turkey delicious it's not just a few slices of turkey it's the entirety of the experience that really makes a difference\nAnd there really aren't any strangers in San Antonio and that's what it's one thing that amount as family has shown us there are no strangers in seventh\nHeaven and true that's true and it's something that I I think our culture ... stay in San Antonio stays true to and it's um it's ... it's a wonderful sentiment I'm In a wonderful feeling to be able to experience at starting now from the whole from the data Thanksgiving or so\nThat you guys pretty much in your own way work on this all year round I mean one way or the other is it's not something that just wants Thanksgiving is over that's it you know you're starting to think ahead about the next year or so\nOf course I'm we're on we\nContinue to communicate through social media because I'm ceasing communication usually doesn't end well so we're we're I'm Talking with people throughout the year about what they can do how they can participate and you know\nPeople are so giving and gracious and the volunteering aspect as well we started getting [noise] probably in like\nLate spring early summer start getting requests about volunteering when can I volunteer I Want to sign up and ready to sign
