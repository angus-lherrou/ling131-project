I got to say I I worked in the media for thirty four years I'm\n... and it would be very unsettling to get a suspicious package and we've had them here and we you know I've seen this kind of thing happened in other places I've worked it's unsettling it's not unexpected because um even before the so called age of Trump there were always\nCranks and there were always disgruntled individuals and

shots rang out when the news bulletins were delivered everybody immediately presumed that it was that right wing hatred that right wing John birth society animosity toward John Kennedy\nUndoubtedly this gunman would be a member or would claim a you know inspiration from and yet it was the\nTotal absolute polar opposite of that that that the shooter was ... it's almost laughable how opposite how wrong that was and how many times in\nRecent years have we jumped to the conclusion that we know who did it we know why they did it once we know who did it we know why they did it we just have to look

this is an act of terror and an act of terrorism I'm only sorry that it took some people so long to figure that out for years they lectured us that we couldn't say that we couldn't speak of it that

benefit I think that's the question you gotta keep asking yourself\nThere is a ceremony are getting underway at the White House and this was a pre arranged a vent\nBut I'm thinking and I guess

quick\nQuestion um I I have a plan I'm from I'm I'm a\nRetirement from a job that I had ten years ago and I left the money in their arm is about twenty seven thousand dollars and it's growing at an interest rate of five percent annual and\nI was going to leave it there until I retire if I can retire\nAt sixty two which is I can I'm Seventeen years\nBut I did the math and it's only going to be sixty three thousand dollars by the time I turn takes he\nDid I take that money out and um I just purchased a house two Seventy five when an ... loan so Mali note on that if I Eighteen hundred should I take that money out and refinance so I can get a lower mortgage and then\nSay them different from the mortgage when now I'm no\nNo I Would roll it to an IRA and pick out some good growth stocks mutual funds that have long track records of ten years or more you should be able to make twice what you're making all this money okay\nNorth of ten percent most of my mutual funds of averaged over twelve percent\nAnd you can pick mutual funds that have done that by getting with a good investment advisor that the teachers you you have to get someone with a hard of a teacher you don't just do something because they said do it or because somebody must shoot said do it\nBut you sit down with them you to learn how that works and you put it in good mutual funds and do what I already roll over from the money the way to find somebody to help you do that I'm not in that business but we have a group of people we recommend you can click on smart investor\nAt Dave Ramsey dot com and you put in your information that drops down a list of the smart investor produce the people that we recommend in your area and then you can select from among them and um shut down with one of them and they'll talk to you and teach you and take your time learn about this\nGet comfortable with the idea but I think you can make a lot more on this money than you are making all that now and if you just pull it out you're going to get hammered on taxes\nAnd penalties for that matter Emily is with us in Detroit Hi Emily welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHanged day thanks so much for taking my call sure how can I help so I have a question\nNot as much for myself but for my parents my husband and I were introduced to S P U and\nAbsolutely love it and we are just because al intense to and we have a longer plan with a whole bunch of student loans that were just trying to Waylon and it's probably going to take a few years and I did see my parents thinking in that horrible head of this fair\nOn being completely broken overwhelmed and just war thing are habits and so I was just calling for advice on how how I can influence them because they really getting like advice from their kid and even though I in my thirties now it doesn't matter it's like I'm Still a little kid\nAnd it's called the powder bud syndrome once someone has powdered your but they don't really want your opinion\nAbout rank about money or sex okay and so the only time that reverses when they get really really really old and as I pointed out old yeah yeah ... but um that you generally doesn't happen and so you know it's like a friend that's being obstinate\nBecause you're both grown people you're grown your parents are grown and they're being obstinate about something and you just have to walk\nIf somebody that you love do self destructive stupid things like I've got a friend that's an alcoholic and he's going to kill himself if he doesn't go drink and\nI mean ... and I've talked to him people to talk to him people dumped on him we love him all that but I Can't make him want to stop drinking he has to decide that right\nAnd it's really painful to watch people you love do stupid stuff that kills themselves you know I mean money wise or anything else so the only thing that I've had any success doing\nIs to possible approaches one is ask yourself if there's anyone that they look up to\nOn the subject of business or money it does he have a brother that he thinks is brilliant or is do they have a friend or a pastor that they think is they trust their judgment and then try to get that person who does have credibility with them to speak into their life\nThat's a possibility the other possibility to probably will be more likely is for you not to say a word about their habits or their financial situation but every time you're around them tell your story\nMhm mom we were short haired mom we were freaked out ... we were fighting about money all the time we were so overwhelmed I couldn't breathe\nManchester is getting tight and you know what we did was we got on this budget and we cut up our credit cards and we're not there yet and man I feel so much better and I'm On my way and no one can argue with you about your story and your feelings\nRight but don't Wagner finger at her and say now you need to do this to instead of just just keep talking about what's happened in your life what's what happened with you ... what's your deal and eventually they're going to say something like well I Wish I could do that\nWell you know it'd be nice it'd be nice to get control when they got to do that Debbie Downer rider party thing right the martyr thing now and people do that all the time and as soon as I Do that that's your opening jump in and go I think you can\nReally because I felt the same way I didn't think I could do it but I think you really can I think you can get\nWhen they when they were here\nOn out there already you're already jumped on the front lawn you got slammed down is you start saying that and that conversation is she gonna shut you down ghetto they are and all you got to do just talk about whatever you did for you are or not for her just get about\nEnabling like with your alcoholics ... obviously you wouldn't you know allow for and drink while ... John Barr knowing what I Would like\nMoney to drink\nYour rights and my parents they're basically eating out ... times a day\nFor ... and my dad got ... tired and they only have one income that are living on cue and kind of you know\nAnd and so when we met that they don't live in our in our state and so we don't let them and my dad he wants to take us out to the fancy dinner to show that he loved that we live here so much but I just want to scream absolutely not not only that I don't want to strain our relationship\nWell it just said that you know what we're learning in our story as we're learning that we can't do that and so it makes us very uncomfortable to do that with you so let's find another way to celebrate our time at home because\nWe don't want to go out to eat it won't be fun for us\nBut don't go bad you only take us out danger to broke that stupid\nIf you want to say that that's what you're thinking\nAnd I'm thinking yeah right I agree with you but if you say that cost up so you've got to direct it all back to you back to you back to you back to you talk about how you feel about this not about how you feel about them or their behaviors\nBut you're just back and talk about you used to feel the way and you turn it loose you used to feel\nAnd now I feel good I used to be freaked out now I'm not in you know of course that only to be the truth by the way and you know tell the truth and you know but I used to I I felt that way too personally I mean I went broke Shannon our we've got killed each other I Know have bills to fight about money\nThank you and you just tell your story yes 'cause this what we did I mean you do what you want it but there is what we did right and it look what happened you know I lost three hundred pounds of if you do the set ups and donate the food is what happened you know\nAnd it's applied the principals and as I say thank you so much for teaching a class no thank you so cool that you're doing that yeah I'm an ... and you know what's what you'll find is interesting is\nThat people don't look down on age when there are results mhm okay it's when you have no proof\nIn your life you know that that you you know that they look down and they go look I got socks older than you\nYou know and they you know they they won't but but that's but you got us or you're they wish they had been when they were thirty right you know and and so they can still be that when they're sixty of them go do it very question man thanks for joining us thanks for coming by and thanks for teaching the class Haley is with us in Seattle, Washington Hi Hailey how are you\nToday I'm ... I have um a question concerning a pension plan mhm [noise]\nSo um I have I'm twenty five thousand from a previous player and a retirement plan and I know you talk about pulling it out and putting it or not pulling it out but\nTransferring from your through our friend good guy went trick guy in our church he worked for private financial and hip our favorite holiday sales and and so I and\nI said I Need the ... and we talked about you but the fact that report put money into variable annuity rather than mutual mhm and I wasn't sure why or if outlet to okay our topic you're following\nYou provided us not following you know what is not following what I teach um I I didn't think how to answer that part of the question variable Newt mutual fund or variable annuities are mutual funds inside of an annuity if you pretend like the mutual fund as an investment and the annuity is a coat that\nGoes around the investment to keep it warm from taxes\nOkay okay and you pay extra\nFor the annuity portion of this discussion nor did you could buy those exact same mutual funds with less fees without the annuity coat wrapping around them okay\nSo what is the annuity coke do for you the coat wrapping around it to keep it warm it does the same thing the fact that it's been an IRA already does show you're buying to coach for the same kid\nOkay okay you see what I'm saying you got it's already going to be kept out of the cold of taxes by the fact that you're rolling it into an IRA okay and then you move it into an annuity inside of an IRA it's redundant\nBecause you've already got the protection now the only thing the annuity we'll give you is they'll give you some guarantees a along the lines of you know if it goes down in value you know they protect you on principle and it will give you at least a four percent or five percent of income but if you're invested in good mutual funds when you're young you don't need those guarantees\nSo I'm okay and truthfully not not trashing thrive in I mean driving her friends of ours are good people um but I Would not use that product there and the thing you need to remember about variable annuities versus a direct mutual funds sale\nIs there's two things going on usually usually if someone's trying to show you that because they don't have a securities license they only have a life insurance license\nOh okay and that it's a way they can make and that way and insurance person can get you into mutual funds is through the variable annuity they cannot sell mutual funds directly unless they have a securities license\nThe second thing that you run into that region you run into this and it's less often for this and I don't think that would be the case with thriving is that they're actually doing this because the commissions on a variable annuity are about four times what they are are on a regular mutual fund\nOkay so some people ... just because they make more on them\nAnd I would not accused the secular guy of that and the situation I mean knowing his from knowing the setting that you did this my guess is he's probably not security ... that's my guess okay and and if he is he is he still giving you a bad recommendation\nNow he did say that I can do that and you're trying to find exactly as you recommend them has new thing ham secrets are really pushing the variable annuity and asked\nMe to go home like all the numbers have my husband review and think about that Mm well I wanted to call you immediately I knew what you like and they already\nYou know so now we've got another problem OK okay if this piece of advice was bad and you knew it what about the next ... by ... that you don't know is bad\nI hereby that I'm ... I ... I I said a referendum\nI got right away I just felt bad 'cause he goes through our church that you know network\nYeah fan that's okay I mean it's that you don't have to do business with people at

Ramsay\nThe site is blondes of dot com\nJason is in Florida My son will receive sixty thousand dollars from accident settlement when he turns Eighteen\nHe is very responsible and he's the one that got us listening to you but I figured that giving that amount to an Eighteen year old is a recipe for disaster or do you have any advice on how we can help him steward this well um\nWell I Would begin talking about what we're going to do with it and I would already have it planned out or we're going to spend it on what are we going to save and invest it in Asia for college by a car where they're going to give some of it what are we going to do\nAnd I suggest you try to do more than one thing with it um I Would allocate some of it just for fun\nI Would allocate um if you need to pay for college out of it on you know allocate the bulk of it for that if the purchase of a small inexpensive car needs to be in there that would be good or whatever you're going to do go ahead and planet now\nSo it's not like when it comes it's like a yawn when the money comes like Mm okay now we just do what we'd already planned so that's part of what doing a budget does it keeps you from spending\nMoney impulsively and that's what you're doing here you're just going to give the sixty thousand dollar tried it on there and go where we spend on what are we gonna do with it when we invest it how much are we going to give and going to start talking about that and get his agreement on it and you know I Would even contract with him and that's what he's going to do in other words after we ride this out I could shouldn't be a simple\nYou know a couple of lines on a yellow path toward the money's going to go and he's agreeing to it and I would have him sign it and data\nI'm most pastors if they're going to make an error it would be on the side of being too soft not too hard\nAnd so I might if I were you ask your pastor to turn up the heat is just a little bit more\nAnd just spending time with your dad and push on your data on this subject and not mentioned that you are involved because you're not involved\nYeah you can't fix it and you keep your mouth shut down you're not going to anything but make things worse\nVery true yeah 'cause he's gonna he's gonna do whatever he wants to do and then uh you know at the end of having done everything you can do I mean you know if you wanted to give him a total money make over book or something you can do that but you have to be really\nI was thinking about doing that probably Christmas there's I don't think so and to say now this is something I read\nThat I liked I thought you might enjoy it 'cause you like business\nOr something like that not like a hey you're really fat here's a book on how to not be fat [laughter] that doesn't work right that's insulting yeah fall on me\nAnd yes so you know instead you would just say I'm just kind of blow it off and make it not might not make it a big deal that it would change my life I Would feel so good if you would read there's no don't do any of that crap\nJust yes kind of keep it nonchalant and just go hey I read this I thought you might like it 'cause you like business stuff or something like ...\nAnd and just see if he picks it up he may throw it away he may put it on the coffee table as a coaster for the next two years and then open it we don't know how this was going to work but at least on a minute outside expert your pastor is an outside influence\nThat does have or could potentially have the credibility for him to listen to\nSome people aren't listening anybody and so you have to be willing to go I Love my dad in spite of his um\nIncompetence and this one area of his life and I'm just gonna love him where he is it's all I can do\nAnd are you made that you may do that your whole life you know he may go to his grave doing this and ... and so your love is not conditional upon you know whether he handles money well or not your respect for him is not even conditional on that\nBut you're not going to take financial advice from somebody that's misbehaving with money so he's not going to speak into your life on money issues but that's all that's all you know I don't speak into people's lives on growing here because I Can't seem to do it on top of my head so I don't tell people how to grow here\nSo if you can't do something you shouldn't tell people how to do it right or you shouldn't have even have an opinion this loud about it but people try all the time so just kind of keep that in the back of your mind there Joey hey thanks for calling

I'm Sorry for your life I'm twenty eight years old I've been working in bank run back which are there are several years and I've been able to narrow down my passion or just a Miller financial coach helping people to build wealth\nBut in my current role my comfortable on the line with uh the one guy at work I'm with or without destroying heavy on health care and I don't think that the right thing\nFor everybody so I I like talking to people with heart of what they let him out of future ... and my question is how can I crochet I should have the financial coach without a huge cricket\nWell what do you make right now and he got what\nOK so first of all I think you need to to a deal with the guilt\nI absolutely love where you're coming from and your values and I understand you're having to sell something that you don't believe in\nBut in in the temporary a you know don't take on this massive guilt what you want to put your interview on right now is\nHow quickly can replace that eighty thousand dollars so that I can step over into the uh financial coaching space or or like one of our smart investor pros your day Ramsey fan you're part of the tribe you know about are smart best prose and I think one of the first pieces advice I Would give\nIs to go sit down with one of those folks locally in uh Miami area of all those folks were listed on the website I'd find two or three of them tell them you're Dave Ramsey fan tell them your situation just the way you laid it out to us and and say can I take it a lunch or take you to coffee and learn the best path\nTo get where you're at to do something similar they're going to give you some very very practical or knowledge and some next steps then you do your own homework how much training how much qualification certification whatever that is that you need to be able to do that that's something you can do\nAnd then once you know that you say OK how much is that going to cost me from a financial standpoint and then from a time standpoint these are basic\nResearch questions\nAnd so once you get the answer to that you've got the formulation of a plan and so you take that wisdom and knowledge from somebody who's actually doing what you want to do\nAnd then go do your own homework on what is going to take and you've got yourself a timeline an action plan and and then to to the extent that you can go work for one of those people\nAre and go work in a space like that and get in proximity and learned the process and get good at it uh and when maybe you're doing your own thing one day is that something you'd ultimately like to do is have your own business\n\nThen I read in twenty eight I Would do it for somebody else for a while and work your way up\nRight now you wanting to be a financial planner or a financial coach\nA graduate coach\nCoach okay 'cause a financial planner you'll have to go get your CSP and like there's a lot of that staff\nDown the ... said that started doing it I totally agree but the financial coach it's more almost like a counseling you know the type of situation\nBecause you'll have to get referrals and all of that though I Would definitely say we have a lot of those that have gone through our financial training our financial um master coach training here ... I Would say that's a great first step to to come here because of that training Chris how can teach is a lot on that and it's phenomenal\nAnd they'll go through that and and try to figure out people in your area that are doing that and then even get connected like even some churches some places that will have\nPeople and families that need this account that that they can give you the referral a cause that would be huge as well so that that takes a little bit of time to kind of build up your book a fitness yeah I'd I'd say that financial coached by it's totally doable and to make that money for sure and salad I definitely would go through our training on that route\nAnd I think you bring up a good point racial Chris at twenty eight I think you do need to look at the differences even if they're somewhat nuanced somewhat specific between the coach\nAnd the plant or because I think you can be a financial planner and make that money a lot faster and it's still a coach me Dave says all the time\nWe go sit down with Jeff do bonds and his team that's that's our one of our local guys if I sit down with Jeff and I we want to know these got the heart of a teacher well that's ... ... well I Do think you've got to do some specific research there Chris to be able to determine what does it look like day to day what do I want to be doing day to day that fulfills me\nAnd at twenty eight you have plenty of time to get there a but in the meantime while you're pursuing the plan I Can't say this enough\nYou're not being dishonest you're not being a shy stir in the current job so let go of some of that guilt um and and I think you're going to be fine I just would not let that way on you\nTriple eight eight to five five two to five is the number Ken Coleman Rachel crew sitting in for Dave Ramsey this hour let's go to Kimberly who's on the line and nodding home Pennsylvania Kimberley how can we do\n[noise] I I Am fifty five years old I had been teaching in public school and the health care for 'em Thirty years on and I found in our last few years that on time\nI Know for something else about the last year really then I'm drawn to real estate I looked into it um yeah I can collect my retirement um if I retire with a little bit of a penalty or as opposed to going up all thirty five years of my only on\nA challenge or block is convincing my husband that's a good idea\nOn the ... would be a bit of a difference and they are there's about twenty five thousand dollars in salary but I Know that I can make that um I I really get excited thinking and on and how can people find Hong Kong thirty and and I find that really interesting\nOkay not what I Love my teaching but it's just time for it\nI get I get good news I got good news for you and your husband okay\nSo for you to become a realtor a successful realtor it's going to take you a little bit of time\nAnd I think the fact that you just reveal to us and our audience that you still enjoy teaching there is no big hurry you're not calling in a completely burned out and so I Would not take the penalty either I how many more years just for fun real quick how many more years would you have to stay in the role\nOf teacher before you retire without penalty for five years\nOkay I just want to throw scenario what is over the next five years you build your real estate business showing homes at night and on the weekends\nI think that's extremely doable anybody who's ever been successful in real real estate knows you got to build a pipeline your husband's only real concern sounds to me Rachel is that he doesn't want you to lose that twenty five thousand dollars that's a that's a scary thing certainly your age\nWhat if you kept the teacher salary for maybe three years still take a little bit of penalty but I'd like to see you go all the way build that real estate business\nOver five year period is going to be here before you know it you step into retirement full benefits and by that time you should have easily replaced if not\nMaybe another extra you know twenty five thirty percent above and beyond what you make you I think you can just absolutely double your income while still being a teacher I think that's the thing that I'd want you to consider Rachel", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "year": "2018", "city": "San Antonio", "day": "24"}
