House press pool they were like it was like it was like feeding a animals at the zoo you know they were just throwing stuff out there to see if he would bite on it\n[noise] it was something else anyway um so I Would not over analyze it I think there's two famous people that liked each other and wanted to wanted to meet up you know\nAnd I think they've met before because I mean kind of us went to the Trump Tower a during the transition did he not I think he did so they met before they like each other\nUm no it's not going to mean anything to the African American vote in the midterms I don't think African American people wait to see\nWhat kind of West is going to do and I think Trump does that I'm sure he does so I\nThought it was interesting today we had a lot of votes in the J our poll and making sure those results you're in a minute but I also put up a picture of the um 'cause this was the first time I had seen really good pictures of it very clear pictures from different angles of the two thousand Nineteen Ford Ranger Ford is bringing back\nThe ranger named played on a pickup truck that I don't think you could anymore call a compact pickup truck that is what it was but this new pickup truck that's going on sale for the twenty Nineteen model year\nIt would be more accurate I think to say that it's smaller than an F. one fifty but it's not small\nAnd I'm a lotta people commenting on Facebook that they like the look of it was a ton of people out there who used to have Ford rangers maybe still do I don't know if your car guy or not or gal\nBut the Ford rangers one of those brands one of those name plates\nThat is greatly missed fondly remember people who have them or had them\nOr just go on and on about oh the perfect size and uh it was reliable and I can remember not that long ago doing remote broadcast it for dealerships were they were selling brand new Ford rangers for under ten thousand dollars\nSomething tells me based on the pictures that this is not going to be anywhere near ten thousand dollars is looks like it's going to be pretty pricey and it also looks like it's going to be pretty close in size\nTo full size pickups and I wonder about that I Wonder if it's too close to an F. one fifty in size and price if that just means people will go ahead and just by an F. one fifty or\nComparable a full size truck but it's coming back long awaited [noise]\nAnd uh we'll see about the price and about what people think a pickup truck segment is red hot right now is reading in USA Today are no this was the Detroit Free press last month an F. one fifty rolls off the Ford assembly lines\nEvery fifty three seconds a new F. one fifty\nAnd full size pick up truck sales are the fastest growing segments um of among vehicles\nSo for Ford for GM or for the at Chrysler which owns the ram brand these are big sellers and the most profitable per unit\nThings that they buy so the combination of high value um high profit per unit just very hot\nI'm average a sticker prices are now around fifty grand and um\nEven if you price like late model pre owned full size pickups they're still really really high a there are already um some smaller pick ups on the market and I look at um I don't know how you feel about it I look at him and I think they're just\nThey're not smaller enough that I Would get one of those you know or if you're going to make it just a little bit smaller than a full size pick up I Would just as soon have the full size\nPick up so unless there's a big differential in price or size I personally I don't know that it would work for me but again we'll see they seem to know what they're doing\nUm everybody out there is a pouring money into these trucks I don't know if you've noticed but if you're a truck buyer every year one of the Detroit big three has completely redone their trucks so every year either the F. one fifty Silverado or or the ram is all new\n[noise] so they change them even faster than cars are redesigned and read modeled and\nThat used to be a used to be the opposite used to be cars that were more frequently treated to updates and trucks kind of stayed the same year after year after year with just minor changes but boy right now it's a hot segment and force going to jump in with this new Ford Ranger ignore my Facebook page\nTake a look see what you think let me know and you can always

O. seven one on Facebook Twitter and online that have the S. A. dot com\n[noise]\nThanks for being with us America there's the Dave Ramsey show slab of your hair\nYou know it's interesting [noise] um and informative to all of us to stop and think about some\nHope\nCauses you to be able to\nMove the needle causes you to be able to move forward when you think the light at the end of the ... at the end of the tunnel is an oncoming train your paralyzed your stop your overwhelm your frozen you get paralysis or the analysis\nThat's hopelessness when you think the light and the tunnel is the way out of your trap then you run to the light\nBut if the train is coming at you and run to that obviously right\nAnd what's the difference in those two events it both light both a tunnel most of the situation one is you believe that if you run to the lot you're going to get out one of you believe you run to the like you're going to get killed right I mean so that's hope and hopelessness\nAnd all of a U.S me included face that or have faced that at times in our lives\nAnd it's amazing to me the power of our brain and our spirit that God gives us to do things that are way beyond what we thought we could do once we believe that there are possible\nThat's called hope\nAnd so when I show you look you know you make a hundred thousand dollars a year you got thirty thousand dollars in debt you feel stuck but gosh if we did that at a thousand dollars a month you're going to be out of that and my gosh and I thought I was always a month out of a hundred thousand is nothing I swam thousand dollars a year you're going to be out of debt and a little over two years\nAnd you suddenly go oh I see it ... it's the same situation you were in but now you can see it\nYou see what I'm Talking about and once you can see it that's called hope I can see my way out one of the things is steals your hope is when you have lost your perspective perspective is of course your point of view the way you're seeing things\nIt's happened to me it's happened to you I remember one time one of my daughters when she was in high school certain boy did not call it a certain time but he was supposed to call and she was very upset\nAbout the world is coming to an\nEnd her mom and I are trying to quit laughing so we can walk in and comfort her\n[laughter]\nNow why are we standing in the hall outside her bedroom laughing and why is she in their\nHopeless well\nWe've got perspective we see things that she doesn't see because we've been pleasure she hasn't been on and have experiences that she doesn't have right so in other words we've been to our twenty year class reunion we know she'll\nBe glad he didn't call [laughter] that's what we're giggling about standing and All right so we have perspective\nAnd so we you know when you don't have ... when you cannot see the other side you're standing in poop up to your knees but you can't see the other side of it\nThen you know it's not fertilizer at that point it's just poop but when you can see the other side of it then it's fertilizer and it it's going to grow some things in your future\nYou know when you're walking through garbage in other words you're going to you ... there's some good is going to come out of the garbage that you're in but but when it gets right down on you and your vision is just the end of your nose and not the end of your life\nMight as Dan Patrick's proud to be your ten a governor today I Want to talk about fake news when exactly what it means\nHonest accurate reporting is important you may not know that before I began my public service my main career was in radio and television and the TV anchor radio talk show host and reporter\nThe facts matter to me and my colleagues we worked hard to earn the trust of the I'm not too often today reporters and anchors ignore the truth and the facts and instead push their own biased to create negative stories about conservatives often based on nothing more than ... outlined\nThe press has always been biased against conservative but what we're seeing today is total disregard for the truth it's fake news\nReporting the news accurately regardless of politics is critical to our democracy and it's the right thing to do it in ...\nOregon stay tuned for more conservative conversations about Texas political and pay for like Texas or Dan Patrick\n\nSo we're talking with John Kerry are that are from the ... and of course we know San Antonio in our entire region is growing like gang busters cars everywhere on the roads and so you know I hear it's a new day it'd be a bit uh used to be top down thinking and a lot of solutions that were forced out from the top down\nYou're doing it differently now though where you have actually gone out and asked the public what do you need and what do you want in terms of transportation talk to us about\nThat that is absolutely true we have a number of public meetings and a number of mechanisms that we ask our customers whether it's on line whether it's through a survey whether it's even just through a public meeting we ask for their feet back\nAnd we want to understand what is it that they are looking for him they are trained to assist the what's the best way we can get you from that point a to point B and to really move people be very efficient about it you can find a lot of options to stay informed by logging on\nTo via info dot net\nDebts via info dot net\n\nCamille are where the guys I wore yeah right welcome welcome what are you guys live Cedar Rapids Iowa\nWell that's a bit of a hall yesterday while welcome to Nashville and all the way here to do your debt free scream very cool how much of it paid off\nThose fifty eight thousand and two years\nGood for you and your range of income during that time a Ninety to one fifty cool big jumping income and two years what I didn't of your income well he went to work [laughter]\nSo yeah I picked up another job and had worked overtime lots\nOvertime lots of O T we all do

how long you been out of school for eight years uh-huh\nAnd so what happened to all of sudden goes like two years ago something happen when I\nStarted looking at my kids and I was like well maybe we should start saving for that main stop paying for it [laughter]\nHow old is yours lawyers well it was both of our okay there are really started in about a hundred and forty eight years ago and we are witnessing it down but we're just sick and tired of it and\nWanted to follow your plan we followed it kind of half way more than ... plan a leading up to that but the two years we're refinance the have a Fifteen year followed it step by step and uh\nWe got nowhere yeah what happened\nWhat was the conversation or the thing that happened that movie from age to really doing it\nI started to see the light at the end of the tunnel I felt like it was new above our says that's something that we could never accomplish ... new jobs\nWhich that'll KPMG and so I mean you can run a half marathon or marathon and then still sprint to the finish went that last hundred yards you still got a little gas in your tank and so seeing the finished can cause you to get intense right at only yes okay and that that's kind of what happened and so\nWhat is the secret to getting out of that what do you tell people when they show you paid off all your debt when you say pay off your debts and they say how did you do that well\nI think we first started to start to budget together and really get both parties involved all in I was a little bit more passive early on and then I started to really look at the numbers and then we got really focused just tell me is that right dollar\nWe're just ... yeah\nYeah when she went and got her second job started work on that and then I was like well I Can't let her\nKnow do that on her own and so then I started working as much overtime as possible is oh okay All right and she got involved in the budgeting huh yeah so I'm the spender and uh it definitely if the the nerve gets involved heavily it it definitely uh goes a lot further\nOut of ... if the saver get involved as well and both of your work on it they're just accountability\nAbsolutely that was the other thing as you say is keeping their accountability accountable yeah\nAh we also um made like a vision board um and so we had like chains they really got that the kid I was involved in the ... we I take link soccer teams that have have them involved and they loved that okay ooh ooh so how'd you guys get connected us\n[noise] my dad and I got an absolutely he's the bank and you\nKnow so when you kicked it into gear two years ago he was your cheerleader\nAbsolutely yeah and the mom and we had bugs get rain here you're on fire\nIn our church did financial peace we went there once or twice

[laughter]\n[laughter] okay well they can call anytime I Am I I'm not as fun I Love\nGoing to say when it had the dream was to get a dog and I was ... and we got a dog and we just happened to name him

your life reset things yeah their family tree just change it already change but they market today\nVery well done Edward is in New York City Hi Edward how are you\nHiring how's it going better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] so um I just want to try to summarize it um [noise] I just had a big change in my life um I found out my girlfriend was pregnant which was pretty exciting and then a couple of months after that I found out that it's twin [laughter]\nOkay\nOh it went from pretty exciting to now I'm kind of scared\nTerrified yeah\nYeah I have a car loan that got me worried um I have a two years left on the financing clan mhm I just wanted to figure out if I should get rid of the car or if I could go down and watch it a bit better\nReally I should have babies that number two down in about six months\nAnd I think you're right I I think you're stretching the few dollars that you have really well so I think you're I think you're very responsible people I don't think you're overspending I don't think you're crazy I don't think you're spoiled brats um and I think he's a hard worker\nYeah\nWell I think you've got all that stuff going for you and that's why I Want you to win better than your winning and so I really think you guys put the kids to bed and I turn off TV light a candle or two and just sit on back porch and talk and say\nWell we got to make some more money um and it's not 'cause money's everything is because when you are or you know doing the best you can do with the dollar is you have and they're not stretch and then we've got to look at something well what are we going to do to create some additional income short term short term and long term\nWell actually we did last night and I actually got a job in the local library but after I pay for childcare I only bring home about thirty to forty dollars a day [laughter]\n[noise] so that's that's not that's not the answer then right after we got to have better a better income coming in to afford childcare if you're going to be working and he's got to have a game plan\nAnd I don't know whether he opens his own butcher shop or whether he becomes the most famous butcher in the world doing it on TV I don't care what he does [laughter] I'm not saying you cannot be butchers but uh you can't be a butcher their ten years from now and be anywhere but where you are right now\nThere's a sense yeah\nAnd so I I you know what are we going to do with the scale or this thing or did he just fall into this because your parents were doing it or you know that's kind of exactly what happens\nNow and so but I mean what if let's just kind of take the white board out and start over eraser life on the white border second and say gosh if we can do anything we wanted to do what would we do\nYeah and then let's go about doing that\nYou don't do it today and walk in and throw you know throw your knife down and walk out that's not what I'm saying but I Am saying we need a plan that takes us somewhere where we say okay this month I got a hundred bucks left over but it's not always going to be this way but it is always going to be that way if you don't change something agreed\nAgreed okay I think you can do it you're good people this is not a it's not a character issue and it's not a a lack of a effort issue and it's not an immaturity thing you guys just simply mathematically it's income minus outgoing there's not much income\nYeah sovereignty outage\nWhat how do we go about bringing back with my parents that it you know like it would really be when he's gone to drill here they

month and it feels really good\nCool what do you teach a law oh good okay so a law professor and empty ... who's not a bad way to go it was\nOn a lot of work to get to where we are bad and ah I think you know coming out of medical school it's Sam\nYou you have this big lump of money that you owe and I remember getting statements in the mail from the loan company and I would just kind of open them and put them and put them to the side because it's so overwhelming you know and um I I was nervous about having\nTo make an Eighteen hundred to two thousand dollar payment every month for ten years and end up paying almost double what I'd have borrowed ... and it's basically like paying off a mortgage so um we were\nWe actually had a great I'm attending physician that during my fourth year med school actually sat us down and said\nYou know we're we're going to talk about money and we were thinking oh easy and it teaches top billing or how to run a practice and he's like no Sunday you're going to make a lot of money and you need to know what to do with it so you don't end up like me and my sixties and I can't retire because I\nBecause I have that still while um and so he's he's the one that I heard uh your name from and got the total money make or a book and read that and\nI'm probably was another year or two before I really started the program 'cause\nBeing in med school and not having any income living off loans it's kinda hard to figure out how you're going to pay out that while you're taking out then they sent 'em and then Alan and I met and we were engaged and\nWe want it to start or mirrors off rights or we want to sort of gotten the same page ... or ... or what have you with a sort of what our future was\n... so out Allen actually had a when we met he had already paid off all his school loans and had a lot of savings and I'm like hey you want to get married I've got a hundred and fifty five thousand now that\nI'm into I don't think I felt really guilty doing that a ... year old yeah yeah\nAnd our church I'm at the time was offering it for you and so I'd like to go to this class because I'm terrified and I don't know what to do and\nI'm so we did that in that was in two thousand twelve where she did that while we were engaged\nAnd so we got married August twenty twelve and so\nTo this day you know before we got married we had our budget ready to go on the spreadsheet ... from the nerd and uh [laughter] to this day we could tell you every penny we've spent since the day we got married so that's been that's been an interesting journey but definitely blessed\nSeventy one month later ... things done yet so what do you tell people were key to getting out of ...\nOh gosh it starts with communication or whether it's whether you're married or engaged for years by yourself you need someone to talk to you about it um and then it's sending the budget and being just went on it there's no problem changing the budget but it's just it's actually spending ... just going to do it\nYeah we've gotten very good at 'em cash flowing things there's been a lot of ... of course over six years a lot of unexpected expenses and we always say that if it weren't for the budget than we would know\nWhere to get money from ... um we've actually catch loads three cars in the span of time um and then about two years ago we um\nWe we were having some trouble I'm getting pregnant which you never think that that's going to happen and um\nYou know fertility stuff isn't really yeah it's not like getting cancer it's not like a medical emergency or anything but it's definitely a very stressful um and so we we were very glad to be able to have the\nFunds and know where to pull money from and we actually ended up doing two rounds of IDF which was very expensive um and so we're happy to finally be pregnant\nAnd we're not going to call her Dave so good [laughter]\nBut we just you know going through the stress of that and I see I've seen plenty of friends go through that or want to adopt and not be able to because they don't have the money or they have to fundraise for years and years and so we were just left to not not have to put that on hold because of money you know I'm so that was definitely a blessing with that but maybe\nI don't know yet but that may be on guard yeah that would be bad\nAbout that but people all the time for you guys yeah weld on we're very proud of you who ... who is your biggest cheerleader each other out on the other than to each other I think that's where we are going crazy ... rolling their eyes on yeah\nHonestly I'm recording it for a couple of years now so I'm Talking to all the families and talking to other people in the closet that's a really big inspiration for us you know a just a little of the moral victors of our series this amount of money or I got this sort of recent are free market are sold this leave this\nLike those little victories are really rewarding or so when we pay off the house earlier ... chip one most most of the the mortgage if we can tell those stories and and for sharing that actually\nNot a big deal although I give record night in the class to how we love it and it's super fun we got a copy of course all this book for you return responded that some mixture upper new stores for sure to be millionaires mhm well on your way congratulations and thank you and I were very very proud for you guys are proud of you\nBetter than I did in our day how are you better than I deserve how can I help\n[noise] okay so far I found you at the beginning of this year I impulse to and purchased a ridiculous car [laughter] and and as soon as I found you I was like crap\n[laughter] oh well did you buy\nUm we bought a two thousand fans came out the fix with all the bells and whistles\nSo we eat\nYeah well not for free 'cause my pocket hurts\nYeah well I guess but I mean the cars great now okay\nAll right yeah so what what do you do on the ... whale thirty five thousand mhm okay and what's your how phantom\nThis year will be making sixty sixty five maybe touching Seventy depending on my overtime oh yeah there's five just argued on you know\nSo and I'm next year or beginning of the fifty percent right plus another ... percent right down the road yeah I'm so here's my age I'm calling to see if you if you're OK with is a memo I finally agreed to let it go\nGood and sell it it it's worth Twenty one thousand oh God yeah she ... down into it or die that bad\nYeah and I thought that it only took like three months\nGood lord so Twenty one guy on trade in\nYes well I mean you know twenty three on private sale\nSomething that's not enough to spread on ... so you're saying this car went from thirty five thousand uh twenty three thousand in one year\nActually technically over forty thousand and two thirty five dollars an hour\nSo cancelled the warranty on it 'cause we had an accent of warranty yeah and and we found out that it's funny how when you pay off a vehicle or you reach their mouths all of a sudden a it starts to fail on you and ... ... you know 'cause you or did it\nThe cars one on our old\nAnd I almost a year old yeah\nAll right oh yeah when you get rid of this thing for so many reasons so so what's your plan\nUpon as a name a lot of people looking around and we saw some four thousand five thousand dollar cars I'm I could save up that money\nAnd I already have in my neck thank um refund\nBut what I was thinking is because our monthly payment for the hub throughout the whole month and it's like eight hundred dollars so because I also have a student loan and assuming famous I won't succeed but almost done with that we have like six thousand dollars left over\nSo what it what it might just go ahead and sell this car mhm bottled up their friends and then go to the guy who are on the car that showing for like four or five thousand dollars and just make payments off on them for like a hundred bucks and the monthly payment will go down to four hundred dollars to making a mess\nMhm yeah I mean we okay with that yeah sure but I I I'm not sure I understood how your financing the is your second car the ... ah the five thousand dollar car that you're buying how are you financing it\nThey'll just go ahead just like\nYou know just like you're going to go buy a car for a little down payment on it oh okay I Know where the you know what I mean\nYou know that's fine if you can just get a regular car loan on it that's fine let's do that because we're still reducing your debt by half right\nAnd um by doing this and then you can concentrate on getting the carpet off and then getting the whole that you've dug with this other car which is absolutely horrendous to great car I'm surprised that thing just drop the foreign value\nI'm sure you got your numbers right on that because I I mean I [noise] the cars are horrible as far as going down in value I get it on my car guy but they and they go down in value rapidly but that one is like a black hole for money on or something like that is incredible\nWhat a horrible horrible\nCar on holding his values so check out and make sure your number your numbers are a little high\nOn terms of lost money I think you may be over the last as much I'm hoping you have a lot of so much as you think you've lost so let's dig into that a little bit further and you do not want to sell it to a dealer at wholesale you want to so it probably would say it should be in this situation about a five thousand dollar difference\nIn other words you should be able get five or more out of showing it probably show than you would for a dealer on something bad expensive um so I really check those numbers I'm not sure you've got correct stuff there but wow what a dad gummed kicking the teeth man you got hammered amazing\nGood luck with it but yes I Would get out of it for sure it's too much car it's a mess it's going down in value it's breaking I mean there's nothing that is good and the story thanks for the call [noise]\nSo that was this hour of the day Ramsey show in the books thanks for hanging out with this American Dreams childs is our producer and
