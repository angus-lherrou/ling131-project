C. V. system that's making that back in the intake valve dirty okay and nothing to clean it off at all so even this Chevron with tech crawling all these cleaning agents that they say are great for the back in the intake valves\nIt's not possible for fuel to touch it because fuel does not go back there okay so you do these be G G D eyes system cleaning and that will clean the intake manifold and the intake system but more important it'll hit the back that intake valve because there's no clean and going on\nSo on your truck you are at ten thousand right now if you get to about a hundred thousand miles and you start to see this far closer do\nThe theory is you could start to replace the spark plugs and still have a very heavy miss fire that's not fixed by spark plugs\nAnd if it's somebody will finally tell you a hundred thousand you should have been doing this service this whole time you should have had about five services now we need to do at least two or three just to catch you up and try and get that carbon off the back of it does that make sense\nYeah he said about twenty to thirty\nThousand every twenty to thirty thousand yes and you want to go to a shop that has that tool because we did have to buy a special adapter for the tool and we do carry special product for that cleaning in particular euro ten thousand you have time don't worry about it right now but at twenty to thirty I really want you to start thinking about that and get it done\nAll right\nWell thank you so much for the call whether it was perfect timing great\nAh okay so thank you so much for the call to those

become more consistent isn't it\nNow he's trying to get to the Aggies that Tibet championship culture that he always speak up\nAnd do things get you there according to jumbo Fisher and that's effort then execution well the Aggies at one of them down\nThey have been given tremendous effort all season long and I would say giving\nJumbo Fisher even more than he asked two of them may have been terrific with a by end and the way they go about their business on every Saturday that effort has been instrumental in close when the last two weeks over Arkansas and Kentucky but he execution you're right it has not always been there that's the next step\nIn the jumbo Fisher process go back to Arkansas He praised esteem for winning accomplish game\nBut not much else he ran through a litany of mistakes but they made and said we have to be better\nTake about Kentucky although it's a really good when over a previously undefeated team who was wearing third things in the country\nAre you never had an interception go out of a wide receivers hands and then later in the game a costly fumble Kentucky scooping scored it just tired execution\nIs in a hundred percent yet but the Aggies but with the effort there ...\nIf you throw in the execution with it if that matches the effort I think jumbo visual will be complete in building that championship culture here and then the average can really flourish sugar will\nBe interesting on the back end of this a schedule that coming into this game at four and two if you can get that effort and execution going into the by week with a victory would be terrific Aggies four and two\nTwo and wanting the FCC South Carolina at three and two and two and two in the SEC we want to remind you through life's ups and downs in for all the journeys ahead you

a row while losing the turnover battle including a loss bumble that Kentucky a return for a touchdown\nThey also lost an interception ... receivers hands so they're minus two for the night and ... as Kentucky had no turnovers at all so as those to the minus five coming into the Kentucky game and the eggs are now minus three an interception and minus ... that's a whopping minus seven for the year\nWhat about those game ... good news ...\nAnd South Carolina is mine is want an interception as they've thrown sticks and picked up by and they're minus two and ... or they've only last for but they fumble nine\nTimes in five games it's a good way for the Aggies to get their personal recovery so south South Carolina minus three in turn over for the see another number caught my eye and reviewing this diet that sport now conversions\nSouth Carolina has attempted Thirteen fourth down conversions and they've been successful on six that's forty six percent\nTheir opponents are fiber bait for sixty two percent but that's Twenty one Fort down attempt in five games by comparison the Aggies or two or three and their opponents or his ear on one\nSo that score tonal in six games so I mean a lot more than a tip so we shouldn't just say don't be surprised to South Carolina goes horde of poor town [laughter]\nCivilians are days to own a home loans dot com winning number so\nThings turns just something well that he talks about every week are you going to offer something new and are twelve on loans dot com winning numbers\nYou know how old coaches used to say dance with who brown you tell them I'm doing that today I've offered up a few different winning numbers throughout the season but for the year as a whole I'm always looking at red zone defense and I'm going right back to it today\nAnd what I mean by red zone defenses it deems have scoring chance when they get down there any way make that score a field goal or at least a field goal attempt don't let them get touchdowns when they get in the red zone looking at a and M. this year\nThirteen opponent trips into the red zone\nAnd those supposed hip scored a touchdown now that's better than I Am was a year ago right at sixty three percent but it's not as good as what Mike algal our defensive coordinators used to this past deep and who had been released out as far as keeping people out of the end zone once they get inside the twenty yard line for better than last year\nNot as good as the ... standard still need improvement and if you break it down guy [noise]\nAm has really gotten the head of the game against the northwestern states and the ... of the world in this category the demons on the Warhol for just want us for as far scoring\nTouchdowns with a red zone against the Aggies and then look at the higher end opponents Clinton's in Korea for ... three of three Arkansas one of one Kentucky only got into the red zone last week during overtime all you do is get five yards you get the red zone in that game but they never had a snap and regulation across the yard lines\nThat was incredible defense by the Aggies but I Am the well to keep Kentucky out of the end zone on that official red zone possession then overtime and then we know that these people go attempt to get across Mars helping the Iraqis win that game but ... got to be better about\nKeeping teams out of the end zone once they get inside the twenty yard line red zone defense that's what I'm looking at today you guys are nothing if not consistent I Will say that so [laughter]\nSo of course I'm going to break the mold right now I'm going to go with Alex what's that that is\nThat that's the definition of this team so the balance in water those ballots numbers you look at time of possession\nThis is one of the best teams and all of F. B. S. when it comes to a time of possession thirty five of the sixty minutes of football the all fences on the team twenty five minutes last week for Kentucky they ran just fifty plays forty seven when you talk about regulation they had the three plays in the field goal attempt in the overtime also\nThe balance of not just the number of runs and pass is also the yards can they have that balance the how are they picking up their yards is it going to be a pass happy game is going to be a run happy game\nJumbo Fisher talks about the balance so I Will keep my eye on the balance numbers throughout this game and those are today's winning numbers brought you by twelve home loans dot com\nFor twelve hundred dollars off your next home purchase or refinanced but Braxton Cheryl class of oh six and Eric our grade class of oh three give you the home team discount that twelve home loans dot com\nWe tackle or for the Aggies is our Tara lock a thirty five tackles this season leads the club he is the active leader as well for his career the senior from side falls out of Houston\nComes into this contest with two hundred thirty to tackle jumbo Fisher raved about not just high real Dobson but a jar lock last week of the game that they played in that victory over could jockey and a ... he stands by as he talks with will Johnson\nQatar let's start with Kentucky last week in Southeastern Conference football wasn't it\nYeah that's definitely you know and as you see a game right there [noise]\nUm physical you know our nose run the ball um so\nYou know we were preparing for it and we knew that is what are the game was going to be coming in so you know that's just what you gotta they expect to be ready to play where you store after definitely disorders through there\nOn Sunday um yeah but that's just kind of a week in week out thing that you that you got to deal with and uh you got to shake it off or through throughout the week and get ready by mixture\nYou play a physical grinding scheduled cleansing bam a Kentucky now Caroline I'm ... how do you ensure bounce back weekend and we go through it all\nOn me had to take care of your body and you can start now ... years both of you know so I'd say you're taking care of your body you know during the summer um you know you got to be smart on the weekends definitely\nBut you just gotta make sure your body's ride for practice 'cause you know we have people miss a practice either you know so I think that's the critical was to stay in a training room and get your body right for them next week\nYou've seen a lot of Carolina in your career though the permanent east opponent what's your take on them\nI'm In South Carolina there like most SEC teams other physical\nUh they got a good a pencil lines are drawn to ...
