look because he owns hotels where women had babies he shouldn't be talking about this now I I think I met her argument would be to say hey this is he really does he really mean this is really going to issue this executive order\nExactly what's something that's so you can be so passionate about I don't see how you could be on two sides of the coin is that how can you I'm sure he knew that he had

it but I I don't think that he I think he brings up birthright citizenship as a way to\nHave the larger discussion um we have a much bigger problem than birthright citizenship when it comes to

car after that I paid cash or ... and live with them I mean I'm\nWorking at the grocery store I used to see people that would come in and they looked like peanut butter and bail bread and that's what they would try to live on the and I did not want to see myself doing that so\nI never uh I've never I Do I Do carry a credit card and I know that's against your teaching but I pay off the balance every month and a never paid any credit card cheese at my entire life\nOkay so how do you end up at one point four or five million a mutual funds\nThat oh when I did work a grocery chain every time I got a raise I put it into retirement or might think before I was forced out I was twenty two percent of my checking my four oh one K. every every week\nDid you guys go on vacation and enjoy your lives

I was writing writing outlive are built on the dry erase board and all the squares were full will will say I've had enough so\nIt's like I was like hey Dave Ramsey so I got online I Googled you and I saw that everybody is ready to tell them I make over so it's like we've got to go right now by that but\nWe went to the ... Barnes and noble book store and they have one copy last\nThat was divine intervention there we go and then we just went from there I read that book that night and gave it to him\nWell there have been one night while I did you read reading down\nThere was on a couch is there we are used to ask me critic or ...\n[laughter]\n\nThat's classic love it very good so you said you're from South Carolina originally but you've moved to Texas now they're saying okay very cool good for you guys and so what did you learn and the total when he may go over there might be able to do this what's the key to getting out of debt\nKey is to not listening to other people have to say about what you're doing your own life so we actually kept at a thing\nIt's in our family they don't really know that we are trying to work hard to pay off debts that we got a lot of a life ... got a lot of credit card for an emergency or able to have a car payment or nickel and stuff we try to share a little bit of information people because they were like how did you get through this thing left and\nSo we just kept its ourselves I'd say that if the craziest Niger on\nTheir close your ears when the blinders on and go forward and you have to not care what other people think that is a big it's so hard to do to how they mean well they're stupid you know I mean like I've got family friends or that one you know\nThey you know what you're saying yeah Amy and Amy and Amy in here when their voice drops into that Charlie Brown teacher exactly why ... that's exactly yes why do you guys\nSo the key is not listen to other people one of the other case to getting out of that\nOr if I can be brief oh the first thing is getting over being yourself up over the mess you've made I mean you've made a mess now it's time to clean it up that's good a number to\nDo your research or find books articles watch videos um you know find their personal finance ... obviously there was this for you um after that sit down and plan and budget were very competitive people so he was always challenging ourselves ... oh my go along with it for any married couples teamwork\nYou know it works the same as compound answers you know it was a very powerful thing mhm I'm for it a single folks out there working on their debt snowball get an accountability partner hanging around people that I have no problem positive relationship and influence on you know I'm after that\nIt's focused mhm because now this day and age where social media audience distractions\nUm life happened to us during the pay off and I happen to us you know before the end we rent a dating phase any engagement you know for example um before we were married she dealt with depression for several years I've dealt with the strings with unemployment I had late written notice is on my door\nMy rent was only forty five at a time and I have a three straight much\nOf a late written notice is ... so it was tough times and then even once we got into the debt snowball\nMom or a little bit before that whenever I got my job offer I went through a grant program and it was tough we we do some things that were our fault for example when I got to use cars have pictures of them um we had a bunch of car repairs\nWe got those cars right before we moved from South Carolina the Houston Mm So you're talking about stupid on steroids is pretty

has to avoid bankruptcy or a foreclosure you're not facing either one of those are you would have\nMentioned that you just want your car paid off here's the problem you pull money out of a four one K.

Monday\nThey're looking out for word and they're thinking\nAnd there's two things that millionaires do they play all fence and they play defense\nAll fans is they do the right things to build the wealth they do the investing to build the wealth\nYou know investing in your mutual funds and your four one K. investing and paid for real estate they do these kinds of things the defense is avoiding stupid stuff that cause you to lose everything all the progress you made\nAnd so that stuff like the right kinds of insurance the wheels all that kind of stuff and so having a good solid financial plan is both off ants and defense and that is one thing we find one of the data points we find with all these millionaires they really good at defense and um it sounds tedious\n... it can be but we've

think I'd academically understood but I Do think that there's a sense of peace that you get that I mean you got it right on about financial these that\nSomething like that you didn't know whether there and all of a sudden we we don't feel like we're at the end ... at the beginning I didn't realize baby step seven is a real step for the end we get to actually build wealth and do all kinds of

of that you've done at your coaches your blood classes you've done everything\nI think the key is vision I think you have to see where you're going I think uh if I have any criticism of myself it's probably too long term oriented and\nI think that has been I Believe your strengths actually already weaknesses run for so long term sometimes I forget the little short term which she helps me
