don't know from where I'm sitting in my job that carries with it a lot of fun possibilities Republicans probably keep the Senate maybe probably and uh so you have divided government\nUm\nTwo things occur to me one is this is where Trump no longer really needs the Republicans\nWhich is how he got in there he went into\nPlaces like Wisconsin and Pennsylvania you didn't go looking for Republican voters you were looking for democratic voters we forget this now but his ticket to ride is\nHey however you've been voting has that been working out for you because if not vote for me remember he said that to an African American audience he said what did he get to lose\nTry may give me a shot so that's his thing he's not\nDining exclusively on a diet of Republican votes in Republican support right now he's a Republican with a capital ours campaigning for him I get that but just remember how he got to be president\nIn the first place number two divided government is government that can do a lot less and from my perspective that's a good thing when\nThe Republicans control all the leaders or the Democrats control all believers\nThey go crazy both of them do both parties\nThey spend and run up debt and create new things for government to do left right and center on although it's true that Trump has shrunk the regulatory regime the state itself has grown under him just as it's grown under every president of both parties and if the government didn't get smaller\nUnder Donald Trump it's not going to get smaller under any of these\nPotential next presidents so I I actually don't\nMind divided government or gridlocked or whatever you want to call it\nThe ... bipartisan it's I'm okay with that I'm actually less nervous about that than I Am on one party goes all out we're all in\nUm\nAnd I don't again I don't buy all\nThe um absolute confidence uh predictions that you're hearing\nEverything I've read everything I've seen tells me that there are a probably maybe at most two dozen congressional seats that will decide the makeup of the house of representatives or does it stay Republican\nBut with a much smaller narrow ... a majority does it go democratic but only by a few or by many\nIt's not going to be that many seats that will decide that\nBut the reason I'm not assuming\nLike so many other people are is that I look at the um the people that are doing the assuming\nAnd they assumed wrong they have always underestimated him and really always underestimated us\nI think there's bias in the polling organizations and I think there has to be because polls are NOW News one polling organizations were just for\nScientific nerdy purposes maybe they were politically neutral and unbiased but now that they make news now that the issuance of a poll is almost as good as putting out of campaign commercials I I think they are biased\nI don't think they've adjusted for the phenomenon of\nTrump voters that don't like to reveal their preferences that don't like to talk to pollsters that don't trust pollsters the don't trust anyone who telephones them at home and demands their opinion so I don't think they've adjusted from twenty sixteen and they were wrong about twenty sixteen\nAnd um [noise]\nWell we don't know is what those on measured voters are doing or if they're doing anything\nAnd we don't know what the effect of Trump's\nBarn storming tour is because it's pretty unusual and I don't think you could say I don't think any president could have worked any harder to help Republicans that he's working right now so we'll see and finally the people that are trying to predict this and trying to measure us encounters\nHave proven that they don't really respect who they're measuring and counting and studying they haven't taken the time to

school side you know\nWell the first thing you do is your budget obviously your time for your classes\nAnd then you budget your time for your study around your classes and in the new budget work I'm social comes after that I'm older than I Am most people if they throw a brick through their television they found about thirty hours a week\nAnd um and that's pretty amazing right there\nI mean people

you today sir\nSet in the past few weeks a I've been thinking about my personal lives my personal professional wise and I'm I'm also in the process of building a defense contractor and building up a business unit within that\nMy question is are those same personal professor professional wise I'm able to be forklift it over to business wise is that it is that a good way to make a foundation for business um mission statement\nYes um it directly or indirectly your your business your career mission statement as a subset of you\nRight back and so you've got a personal reasons for a living or why what is it um what's my no but what caused me to nobility right what what am I doing this for one\nUltimately and we know is not just pile up money okay the reason we found that money is what you know and what are we going to do with it what is that we're trying to accomplish that your personal thing and then a subset of that is your\nYour why in the different areas of your life the reason for your your mission statement so you'd have a a personal mission statement so to speak um that that attaches to who you are and then your career your marriage your parenting your\nPhysical activity uh your intellectual growth your spiritual grows there all subsets of that then\nUh and so you create a holistic look at things but no they're not compartmentalized department allies like you don't count at work saying you know no it definitely forklifts a over a ... in other words my personal\nDrive is underneath of this one this organization's mission statement and wise and reasons for doing things you know um and so\nYeah it's a neat question I don't know ... Noreen by asked that but that's that's my view on it um and of course my opinions are always worth what you pay for it but uh it just seems to me if you had a\nBusiness reason for being\nThat was different than your personal reason for being or was not somehow connected it would be income grew it really\nIs that makes sense absolutely I mean it would be at cross purposes with each other if they weren't somehow running can ruin or parallel or subset or something but in ... the way I visualize what the easiest for me a subset\nThat make sense it does thank you very much thanks for stopping by brother good to meet you open phones at AAA eight to five five two to five if you want to talk about career stuff and setting your passion and setting or why and that kind of like the best guy on the planet doing that right now is a guy named Kim Coleman he's one of our Ramsey personalities\nAs his own show and on serious XM every day and you can call that show talked to him tune in\nWhich part of the Ramsey solutions network on serious XM Radio it's also a pod cast too so look it up the Ken Coleman show\nAnd you learn a lot more about that kind of stuff open phones at triple eight eight to five five two to five Brian is with us in Pittsburgh hey Brian how are you\nI'm doing great Dave thanks so much for being there today because she had it\nOn or how can I help sir\n[noise] uh well uh two years ago my family was there you're lobby and we did a debt free screen and a and since then I feel like we've really been left a you know a career path that opened up for our income has doubled in size and a lot of really positive spiritual or you know directions that have opened up to\n'em and those are you know that those things that we really thought it was sort of a macabre is opening up because we are starting to do things right and really what I see now is that he was preparing to throw it was what was about to come which is that we have a we have three boys the youngest is ten months [noise]\nAnd uh our youngest has Down syndrome\nAnd so uh right now we're actually coordinating the legacy journey class at our church\nAnd or just getting to the part where we're working on whales and so because we have this special needs a issue we we get involved or attorney and getting our wheels together good and through that conversation we uh you know I'm\nA we've been discussing estimates trust or oil that has to play in planning for our baby's future yeah\nSure uh originally it kind of had that chopped up in my mind is that that special needs stress kind of function the same way that the other boys of a college fund in baby steps five\nUm the uh and that we would you know we'd be saving for all three of them but the one would have some some special conditions have special rules because of course\nUh you know his his features are boring it's too early to know what is your fully what if he'd been blessed that he's\nHealthy developing well you know there's this guy to limit for him just like anyone mhm um and we don't have to uh uh you know it's hard to really didn't know if he ever have any limitations\nBut uh but now as we're getting into it and we haven't find anything quite yet but as we're coming down to the wire why things are uncomfortable with is that you know if I start investigating money are fun to try I I lose control of that to the trustee that we've named and while while I trust the ... the inability to go with their wishes that makes me uncomfortable\nNo you don't you don't need a special needs trust unless both of you die right the special needs trust does not need to be funded proud of your death okay so that it it\nSounded from your wealth or your life insurance until you've got wealth\nOkay\nAnd it's not ... I wouldn't even have it formed accept upon both deaths both of you dying okay as long as I Want to he was alive as long as one of us alive to manage your ass that's one of the things you're going to do is care for this child\nThat flew out of those assets now they don't win the trust is needed is if both of you die it gives the trustee me the the the the direction on how to handle the assets and disperse them to take care of this child's needs\nAnd um and what that needs to be is a a big hairy term life insurance policy that ... that is the beneficiary of it is that special needs dress or a portion of the policy you know thirty percent or twenty percent of the policy in the beneficiary line goes to the special needs trust\nIn the event that both of you die kind of a thing where the primary beneficiary is your wife\nOkay but then past that the secondary beneficiary is some portion would go while you've got minor children into a family trust to take care of the minor children your oldest two until they get them through college the other portion would go into the special needs ... perpetually care for this other child throughout life\nNot just through college and so it's a larger amount needed to do that and then what happens is let's say we fast forward Twenty years\nAnd this child is Twenty years old and you've got a million and a half dollars in mutual funds\nOkay your other children are grown and gone or close Twenty years from now right that's the dream yeah that's the dream that law yeah we're\nKicking them out so they're going [laughter] that's the legacy by ...\nHousehold income my my wife makes about ... about fifty five\nTo six grand a month and I'm self employed so very that can go from one of my ... last year\nLast year we were I was somewhere in the two twenty area\nOkay what are you going to worry about for income you can afford a mortgage on a Fifteen year fixed when you're done but basically what you're going to be doing here is getting a construction\nLoan and then you're going to um reset the construction alone in a permanent mortgage it's almost like you're building a house correct\nAnd you can email you when you're done you need a fully you need a regular\nFifteen year fixed rate mortgage where the payment is no more than a force of your take home pay and if that's where you're going to end up and you've got a process to get there and then yes I Would do that um I don't see any problem with it it's just a massive project in your living next door to it um yeah that probably is going to take six months um\nMost of the time when I think of an addition I don't think about four thousand ... the fourth of his birth what addiction to in Nineteen hundred square foot house\nGender is one of those intact cannot Hi ginger how are you\nI'm doing All right good how can I ...\nI don't want to know is my husband and I we have work constantly for quite a while and we have finally paid off our market share all of our cars everything everything we own type are great I don't know if we have so much um\nWe're still working not we are we have been trying our thoughts on security ... are a ... year in me almost all year ... my ... and up until now we have then say well now last night we had been thing all of that\nAnd the ... the last\nThree months to get hit by we had been putting our income that we weren't at inciting living off of the security okay my question to you and when our retirement or hour winds are fighting\nA that we have mhm and what our total expenses would be fine how are you here with our income on security\nWhy when he got much retiring at the end of next year\nAnd how old are you how old are you I'm sixty thanks and he is sixty seven okay and how much do you have in your ...\nOkay in the four oh one we have a hundred and twenty thousand and our next eggs we have a lot at another hundred thousand\nOkay that's two hundred and twenty thousand and uh just round numbers I mean if you made 'em ten percent on there'll be twenty two thousand dollars a year okay okay I had never figured you know\nAnd so if you invest it and we did that if you invested in it did that and then you add your Social Security too\nThat um I mean you're not going to be living lavishly uh I mean you you have\nA few thousand dollars a month to live on but I mean you've got Fifteen hundred Eighteen hundred bucks a month coming up this money is what we're talking about here and um and plus your Social Security and if you can live on those numbers then you can retire if you want to\nBut I ... that's not going to be an easy amazed I got to be retiring and luxury uh but you should have fairly low expenses because everything's paid off so that's good\nUm I'd love for you to have another hundred in there anyway but if you can work a little bit more and knock it out that might be up not be a bad thing but if you guys are just you know you're done and you want to you want to live on that that's fine but I Would not set up a thing where I'm draining down\nThat two hundred and twenty systematically just to retire now because that's there's an end to that game called hunger and I don't want to get there\nYou don't want to destroy this do so you just live off the gold and eggs on like so whatever you know you sit down with your investment professional if you don't have one sit down with\nOne of our smart vest her prose and talk about investing there's two hundred and twenty thousand in a way that you do that creates an income that you can live off of that plus your Social Security\nAnd if you could do that then you're in a position to do it\nAnd um but again it's not going to be um a a a\nA luxurious retirement you're not traveling the world and uh you know and that kind of stuff on this income uh but but but I think you can do it it's just a matter are you willing to live that frugally and put your budget together\nAnd said these are the numbers and I'm going to live on less than this and that's the only way we can retire and then\nAgain sit down with us from our best are pro click smart best her day Ramsey dot com and listen to people in your area we recommend and one of

sucks okay you gotta way better than most people but I'm living on forty thousand dollars a year for the rest of your life for the next forty years is going to get old\n\nAnd you don't really have any income coming other than that because your investments aren't big enough to create it and so I\nWould you know how you can do it\nYou couldn't do it but I think you need to have in the back of your head you may be going back to work at some point\n[noise] I'm considered that I thought about it for the health insurance and um [noise] um and I've heard of these men to share programs do you\nTell her water there was not driving this for me for what's driving it for me is you don't have much money\nRight and you got the pension but I understand you know think about what what are you\nKnow forty thousand dollars is going to buy in forty years when you are Ninety\nNothing yeah nothing\nThat's the problem I got here so it doesn't have a good long term prognosis of you guys just being able to live and we can figure out how you could live in other words if you had a million dollars a mutual funds this becomes like a no brainer\nInstead you got like a hundred and fifty two hundred thousand maybe if we scrape everything together after the sale the rental properties and you know the farms got value but it's not producing any money so what might what I'm thinking is and and again you can do whatever you want to I'm just talking it through with you OK\nI'm not saying you're you're you're you're wrong or you're bad or something but that's my concern of what I'm hearing is and so I probably would think about what we always called an encore career and say what could you do that would be really\nFun that you could make fifty grand or a hundred grand doing for the next five or six seven years\nAnd you didn't enjoy doing it start a business you'd have fun doing it and make some bank and bank all of it and health insurance as part of the day I don't care if you're working for somebody else you start a business but just do something what you're doing out and make you smile anymore so you need to get out of there\n[laughter] you picked up on that\nYeah and so you know but I but I mean when you're you're young\nYou have a lot of uh a lot of\nService to humanity left inside of you that you could get paid for ideas concepts things you could do I don't know what it is but it's something that just I mean I I'm just a little bit older than you I'm fifty seven and do and I plan on work\nAnd it's not 'cause I Need money I don't need the money I got money coming in my ears but I'm working because I have a vast\nYou ought to find something like that and then you can work in hunt and fish and worked in hunt and fish and farm and you know but but\nKnow I'd like to see your bank another five or six hundred grand and the next eight years and have fun doing it that's what I'm saying that's a that's a the only challenge I've got is I think there's God's got something inside of you there is something you can do more than hunting and fishing that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "city": "San Antonio", "day": "30"}
