[noise] um well I work\nAs a truck driver and I'm never home so I'm trying to find out later in life like retirement and I'm Wondering what would be a good idea on how to invest that extra money I have to put my house payment on it now you know that's that is that\nA good question how old are you a fifty four fifty for you're single\nOkay and how many years do you think before you buy a house\n[noise] um I'm thinking oh at least sixteen\nOkay All right cool well as long as you've got more than five years I Would use a simple gross stock mutual fund\nOr a series of them for something like that I probably would your shoes and ask them be index fund\nBecause it will grow virtually without paying taxes on it until you pull it out I as a what's called a low turnover ratio which means the taxes aren't charge much on the growth until you cash it in\nAnd so I've started to a person is in the five hundred fund an index fund\nAnd use that to grow for the next five ten years or so until you buy a house as long as you leave it alone as long as you plan to leave it alone at least five years you can survive the gyrations of the stock market and you should be fine\nIn that and that that's exactly what I Would do I do a similar thing Scott in sometimes I've got some extra money and I'm just saving up for my next real estate purchase as an investment and um even if I don't have five years in that case I'll ride the market with it\nAnd ah 'cause I can afford for it to go down if I mess up a little bit but yeah that that's the direction I Would go good question Robby is with us in Pittsburgh hey Robbie welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHey Dave how are you better than I deserve once up\nA thank you so much for taking my call yeah I had a quick question uh so I Am a nurse or by profession and my wife is a a nurse and that that\nI Am wondering if I should go back to school again next year I'm so my question is if they work for me to go to a call now I'm thirty two years old my wife is\nUh twenty nine we make a combined income right now off a two hundred and a two hundred and twenty thousand a year and um so if I go to school it's going to cost me ... years up not working\nOn that tuition off around Ninety thousand dollars mhm uh but uh our gross income after I go to school and be successful uh together would be close to a three hundred thousand\nMhm so uh but it's a what do you make a year now uh right now around Seventy thousand\nOkay you're saying this is going to cost you a three hundred grand three years three years of Seventy thousand missing plus nine out of pocket yeah okay can you cash flow the Ninety out of pocket and can you live on her income or you're doing this\nI can live on her income for sure that's how we did it when she was in school [noise] um but I don't think I can catch anything right now because I and I also don't have a house or at the moment so I was you know planning on buying a house\nOr are putting it leads to putting a down payment for a house next year before I start school\nSo that then you need to wait until you can pay for school I Would have\nNever in Thirty years of doing the show recommended

P. three times over the past the air and she had to file for bankruptcy and now she doesn't know how to manage your money\nTo do that kind of name she doesn't know how to learn that she just won't do it\nExactly and I think that I have to have surgery on her ... and she's kind of intimate because she didn't have to file SNL a actually a kind of happened they cannot pay pay check and she's telling me that she can't maintain that said they have like she's\nGoing today it mhm\nWhat's the only thing I had to watch the surgery on the wrist\nHad I not something that's very painful and she's going to have to have it right and they know how long has it been there\nAnd probably for about a year ago\nMhm Mm well I think this is her wake up call\nOkay I think it's time for her to stay at work long enough to build up enough pay pay enough savings account to be able to survive the time the shoes off while she's on the mentally I pay me wondering what have you weren't running and they weren't there to bothers drunk a drink\n\nThey wouldn't be able to drink right if you weren't there I like to buy her her drinks she wouldn't be getting drunk right\nWhen you finance firm misbehavior you ensure it is going to continue okay does that make sense\nI don't want her to die or something I'm trying to you\nSo it's just things cancer isn't going to call her hand or something but uh it sounds like this woman loose from one crisis two and other than their own self\nCreated back you know back home\nAnd I thought I was reading that in the mail but I wasn't sure\nSo I'm Glad I understand and I'm not trying to be lacking compassion I Want to be compassionate but continuing to assist her in this behavior line that has been destructive to her is not compassionate\nOkay country like man I tell you what I don't know I mean you got to sit down and figure out how you're going to do this in layers but maybe you maybe you assist her partially in return for her engaging in behavior that she knows you're supposed to be doing\n\nYou doesn't change the mix that'd be a two of the cars one mechanic and do the guards with the other mechanic you've still got the same for cars and you still have to manage all four of them is that makes sense\nYeah I Do I don't I don't know that now like their current\nWhat kind of well it's not connecting man 'cause it's perfect but uh it added up all the ... the idea is this the investments that\nYou have are not owned and operated by your financial advisor you owned them your advisor is just telling you what to do with what things you own\nAnd so you could own mutual funds in three different mutual for different mutual funds\nAnd a half two of them was one advisor and two of them more than other advisor or you could have all four of them was one advisor in either case you're still own for mutual funds the exact same for by the way because\nYou're you should be making the decision about where your money goes the advisor teaches you and advisors you but you should be making the money the decision about what your money go you're not blindly turning over a block of money and go just doing whatever you want\nYou know no that's just dangerous just cried you need to know everything about where this money is going and understand everything about it and so if that's the case then the financial advisors simply the conduit and an information source\nAnd if you don't trust the information to shore so they shouldn't be your advisor\nThat's why you don't need to any one\nThat their information aligns with your value system in what you are planning to do with your investments and then they walk you through that\nI have one and there's twenty five accounts with this one guy in my case and and so but the twenty five accounts or mind they're not his and he\nJust advisors me on whether I Want to put more and more I'm more than one open another one whether I Want to um together we just talk through what these funds are doing what these investments are doing I understand what they're doing based on his advice and based on that than I make the decision of what's going to happen with my money and that's what I Want you're doing\nAnd if you do it that way then there's no benefit whatsoever to having to financial advisors\nAnd the only reason you would do that is if you didn't trust one of them which means you shouldn't even have them\nAnd so that that's the idea that's what the analogy\nTrying to get to but I guess I missed that sorry about that Sean is with us in Tucson, Arizona Hi Shaun how are you\nA better than I deserve their God how can I help ...\nOh I'm I'm going to give you some numbers here will quit I'm fifty five thousand dollars liquid cache of about forty monitor raw or\nAnd I make certainly to

teenagers want you to know whether there's something to think about\nThat he's author of the graduate survival God five mistakes you cannot afford to making college if you are a teen or you're a

step three and now I'm working on baby steps three ... saving for a house got your emergency fund good for ... yeah and I wanted to know how long is too long in baby step three being the flashing lives on two babies that far\nThere's not a magic answer the concept or the other critical thinking skills for the answer is simply this\nIf you stay there so long that you don't save for retirement you're screwed up your retirement Mm right yeah or if you don't stay there long enough then you don't have a good solid down payment and you'll end up with other problems on the mortgage so it's the it's the pull between those two things\nAnd with most people that means you know three years four years something like that um but if you're if you're a fifty nine and it might not be that long or you're not fifty nine now how old are you I'm twenty eight on friday okay cool and so I mean if you stayed out for four years and never started any retirement until thirty two\nBut you had a really juicy down payment on a house and got ... at you know how to plan to pay it off in a few years because of that\nYou're not you're you're still going to retire multi millionaire you know if you do that it it but if you stayed out for Twenty years ... been called that baby steps very abusive but I'm ... yeah that's kind of how you think through it from a critical thinking skills standpoint so how long were you thinking of\nWell I just started in June and I'm hoping to have it done in two years\nOkay and so the thirty years' old your your game own on retirement taking on a Fifteen year mortgage by forty five the mortgage is paid for if not sooner\nAnd uh you will have saved thirty five years at Fifteen Percent of your income which unless you just don't work\nIs going to make you a millionaire multimillionaire usually I'm doing this so you're in a safe zone there but that's how you make the decision more importantly than they Ramsey says never go more than three years that's not how it works it's just you're pulling those two things are pulling at each other or because you're not saving for retirement the longer you go yeah that's all it is I think for some of them I think

that\nEverything your teen needs to start making money the teen entrepreneur tool box and um I think you flew home from Kansas City and did the raven ... I'm\n... Yes sir you also before they beat the put a beat down on the titans so yeah we have now of flavor to do in during any more revenue traveled from prior to a ... game [laughter] unbelievable unbelievable monetarily motivator them\nA may ... we had a good time Dave and uh I didn't pray for them to beat us but er hey it was an amazing game is [laughter] I I Love the diet and but I Love the rabies Tuesday the best one way or [laughter]\nWell that day the best football team play on that but there yet and I don't think that our our guys would agree with that there was a bad day it was\nBut uh so you you've done that travels or whatever she does from other NFL work as well so some of the other teams of cold and you and Chris are going to both been available to them and the and helping them when you're meeting with those guys I'm ... and they're asking you money questions what's coming up\nYou know day this is the main thing that's coming up hey I'm young I'm twenty two years old I was only making maybe five thousand dollars a year my first check was Fifteen thousand and I'm gonna get another one next week it what do I do\n... how ... how do you keep from being overwhelmed overwhelmed money with the pressure with family how do I tell my mom no should I tell my parents\nKnow how do I tell my friends know um should I go by this car almost any names but there are some um you know rookies out there that have had the opportunity to to mentor\nAnd they're you know they they they're going out there and buy some big things and other rookies are seeing that are saying well wait should I Do that and I'm like no no no do not do that and save your money live on a plan live on a budget\nAnd with the coolest thing was with the ravens I can say this was all of them sign up for every dollar a couple of weeks ago um and all of them get every dollar plus and so there was like ... how do we do this and it was surprising to see that a lot of kids did not know how to budget\nEither twenty two year old Twenty one euros making nearly um on average stuck in the low end is about Fifteen thousand dollars a game so it's about sixty thousand dollars a month to about two hundred thousand dollars a month and they didn't know how to budget that so I'm just excited because I'm seeing them saying hey I Want to help\nYou know these guys are ... they're they're calling me Kate how do I do this how do I invest what is Dave say about this you know it's just real cool to see these young players want to be good on the field but they also want to make the right decisions off the field as well\n[noise] I was telling a leadership team this week that I was talking to the river pastures we're with yesterday that ... you can't attribute\nOur life skills both to someone just because we're successful in one area or answer if you got to twenty six year old music star yeah um well they're good at music but what happens is we see them being very successful there\nEven me I'm fifty eight I Know better I've worked for the NFL players for Twenty years off and on and um I Know this was a ... a world class\nOne half of one percent athlete um but they are twenty two guests there and the rest of their life skills are not developed at the level that they're football skills or develop they are\nThe size of a key yeah but that doesn't mean that their life skills have developed at the same level and you know so\nIt it it's it's kind of weird I told somebody during one of these rookie camps as like you're looking at this guy the size of a key but when you look in his eyes you see a Thirteen year old yes um because he still is football skills are are the best on the planet you I'm In his physical acumen his physical\nA cue the things you can do with this body and MIT error or just circus like it's amazing what those guys can do\nIt but what happens is when you watch that skill level especially if you're just watching on TV\nYou think of that guy as you know a forty year old who she is a mature developed a ... as you know strong marriage has all these other things and these guys are college kids are out they were in college last week yeah you know there's twenty minutes ago and I'm\nEven a player that's been in the league three years yeah they're still young and they're still and twenty five years old ... and so it's uh it's interesting in the same thing happens with music people when they get a success level earlier anything where your spotlight and you get a success level\nAnd your skill this world class in that thing does not mean you have everything else together yeah yeah and that is true with the you know teenagers in general is one of the things we do this entrepreneur tool box\nIs they can start to develop some of those skills you know running investments\nYeah they and that's absolutely right you know you say this all the time when in America knows you know gee for saying this but the NFL stands for not for long and these football players young football players know that like hey I Need to develop something now\nBecause in probably in three years I Would not be initially mhm um and the most money these kids were made\nWe'll be within their first three to five years other league if they make it past and\nAnd so I I told them like ... you have to get focus but when we look at these twenty two year oh this is why I'm so passionate about that Fifteen you wrote about that Thirteen year old getting you know the ... to about ... getting a graduate survival guide a book and also taking our financial foundations curriculum is out of a classroom\nBecause all of that teaches what the old they're professionals do not know mhm if they can get at Thirteen like these middle school kids day four out here now taking our middle school curriculum\nYou know they are I'm headed again like they were teaching me some stuff earlier today I'm like wow like what in the world and so just to see these young kids are getting it\nTaking our curriculum learning learning how to budget learning how what is a difference between the credit card in a debit card and these kids like me and I'm not financing anything like that just it just makes it\nYeah it's dolled in ... in a life skill yes life skills stuff and you need life skills whether you're Seventeen or fifty seven yeah you know and this this money thing\nYou know the basic stuff of being out of debt being on a budget having your emergency fund the stuff we talk about her every day on the air it it really does work for teenagers and the interesting thing is they're not um\nYou know that they're not like rushed into place right you know they're they're pretty they're pretty\nUh uh elastic in their spirits and that they can receive this stuff sometimes more than some of us are a little older and we get a little stiffer\nOn our spirit and we don't receive is quite as well they're like okay let's go let's do that right right and they're not like old docked in and go now to argue with you about stupidity right there it's a it's easier to get through most of the time you know what a big argument like they have to have a credit card you have to have during alone you know\n... ... yeah I Know yes job ...\nYeah ... you have to let her she made the decision should she has to live with the consequences of that decision understand you want to help her as a granddaughter but at the same time as young millennials they need to start building the weight of their decisions if they make a bad decision\nMom and ground pirate grandparents should not come to help them out all the time I made one bad decision Dave my dad kicked me out the house\nAnd he said hey you're going to learn from that consequences because he knew that's the only way that I could really become the young man that I was going to become so\nWe brought a ... I wouldn't help her as much I agree with ... she needs to get multiple jobs she left a good job I have friends in Denver I understand you're saying as expensive but it's not that expensive to where she had to move that far away or for a good solid career path that she had going on\nSo until these people come in with a fulltime you work through the things you ... you know liberate the choose your babysit your dog walk you do other stuff to backfill and and that'll get her where she can eat yeah and if you want to help her out what the wisdom teeth expense there's nothing wrong with that\nUm but I'm not going to go along with the idea that somewhere in this process she was forced right and she's a victim of or circumstance where she overreacted or circumstance gay and um when you told me that the people cannot live in Denver because the rent is shot or there's a whole lot of people living in Denver proving it wrong proving yeah and\nSo you know you've got that ... you know she just use that as an excuse and said I'm outta here I'm going to another city and did not have her feet solid under but worked three four jobs and another thing comes in its full time job and you can drop a couple of those and maybe you can help her with the wisdom to help her make to make the\n... the Turner financially Ted is with us from Kansas City hey Ted your question for Anthony\nAnthony um [noise] I have two daughters they're both doing very well eighth and ninth game four one K. question neither one want anything to do its debt and most fabulous favor of the universe\nI'm ... I'm the one who's making a ton of money she's a welder shoe on the road she saves money great and she's starting to do the four oh one cave my question is should I advised her to just go to a Edward Jones or someone or a or one of your piece or\nDo her work ones and keep transferring now\n[noise] um do you know for work was are matching matching her as well\nAs well and and that's the question is is you get the packets she'll she her to the welders just she'll run facts you can be there for three months you could be there for six months so but they do all we send to the retirement pay for country in a way to get into that so I guess that would be the question if they are matching it would be worth the\nRolling it over every time you change your job\nExactly yeah yeah that's that's exactly right absolutely and then in addition to that on the side that the two have stability peace in their letter distort Roth IRA ratio where the smart rushed her pro and then the route each time but you're saying she's working short stance and so she's going to end up with ten or Fifteen of these little for one maybe four one K. someday\nShe could write so should cheat each time she leaves were already in the state but one she has\nYes yep yes always take your four one K. with you and do direct transfer roll over when you leave always do that um but that that technically or won't each one will technically be a separate account number but you can still look at the whole\nYou know your whole portfolio in one place than from all the different rollovers stuff as you go alone so good question I Would question Eighteen years old that's amazing\nThat is amazing yeah best debt free welder she's making anywhere between eighty two hundred thousand dollars a year and already starting to invest in two or four one K. day that sounds like an everyday millionaire to me I think\nIt is like this is talk of the dad everyday and yes there and it's very good well he's taught him while I mean
