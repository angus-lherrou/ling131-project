Texas financial advisory dot com\nBubble generally is the president and CEO of Texas financial advisor Ed Markey glad you're with us today for the Texas financial advisor show and we're talking about a topic that is super important but nobody really wants to talk about it that is well your family be okay if something happens to the breadwinner\nSo let's let's talk about this because this this is something that's near and dear to your heart obviously having gone through this back when you're in college with your dad passed away but that is one of the reasons why you have a charity that you started\nAbout four years ago a little over four years ago now that is ... see how much I Love you that you started you and her sister started this and I suppose your mom was probably involved as well\nAnd you're you're trying to help kids that are in college at loser parent maybe touch on that just because I think that those kind of time with our topic a little bit\nShirt so we started smiley see how much I Love you is what it stands for a gift from above and and the founding date was that is actually my mom's birth date but of course we're doing this because we\nWant to help other students that are seeking a higher education and we're pretty liberal with that definition because I don't think that everybody has to go to college if you're seeking some sort of license or attacked his career are canary like that is a skill and so if you're just trying to better yourself\nYou don't necessarily have to be getting a bachelor of arts or something we want to help the students that if they lose apparent while they're thinking of ... higher education as well of course that is typically financial you know that we can help pay off some debt or\nOr help them as a you know bridge the gap while they're or they're surviving parent is is figuring things out or they can apply for more financial aid\nBut it's also the emotional and just you know health that I don't even know how you would describe it but it's something that we tell them look if you are in a bind\nAnd typically call your dad for it and you're sitting there on the side of the road with a\nFlat tire right and and you don't call will call us because we will pick up the pieces and get your tire chains\nUm so that's why I say it's not just financial it's been just little things like that\nAnd let's see if you need a bike to get across campus\nWe did that as well we had a a student that just needed a bike\n'cause he was going it was too late to class because he was a rushing to get there and then and didn't even have a car on campus but it wouldn't even made sense the way the campus was laid out if he had a car Ethan them still see neither bike so we were able to get a bike from our\nUm donations so we do have a fundraiser coming up it's not it it's October twenty eighth and those kind of far out um it's going to be at laws into here in a ... a San Antonio a off of gold came in road and so we'd love for you to kinda earmarked that and it just be a coming go at the heat up late\nParty out there ... so that's going to be October twenty eighth of two thousand Eighteen\nAnd you can certainly find out more about ... see how much I Love you to Brooklyn her sisters are set up\nA really an honor their dad but really to help kids that need that help right now the website is Texas financial advisory dot com Texas financial advisory dot com and you can find that information out on Brooklyn's a website and certainly call if you have questions about any of this aid for for a three to\nSeventy four sixty nine eight for for a three to Seventy four sixty nine we are talking about a very serious topic one that's really nobody wants to talk about but you really need to talk about you need to have a plan in place so we're talking about\nWill your family be okay if something happens to the bread winner will be a lot to get to order to fix the second time out we'll be right here\nOr listening to talk of financial advisor on retirement [noise]\nI woke up one day and things were different\nIt had been building up for a while I realized all the work I was doing all the money I was living all the decisions I was making was part of something bigger than just me and my wife\nShe thought her mom and dad and now I'm doing the same thing they did back then\nI'll be blunt for their kids their grandkids into our friend of mine I should my future family reunion\nGeneration upon generation God willing going forward the same way\nAnd that's why I called Brooklyn traveler willing\nWe've got to make plans\nShe knows it's not my job a lot of the whole universe\nIs my job to light up a little corner of the universe that belongs to me\nDo you have big things to do let Tom Hanks and financial advisory board for need three two Seventy four sixty nine and a four four three two Seventy four sixty nine more taxes financial advisor young I'm\nA\nFinancial advisor on your retirement we're\nSupposed to be in touch with financial advisor show was Brooklyn generally the president and CEO of Texas financial advisor in Brooklyn started company in January of two thousand eight I'm Mark Kelly and we're talking today will your face\nIt'd be OK if something happens to a bread winner the breadwinner and your family and it's a really important topic Brooklyn or team Brooklyn shorter company in June of two thousand Mitchell misses as part of life losing somebody because we age we gets a lot of things could happen\nBut it's really important to have a plan in place to make sure that the surviving spouse or the surviving family members but we do have things in place and we can find the the you know the material that we really need to find and there were on the right track so when you're looking at a typical portfolio Brooklyn\nHow does that make up but how you shut the portfolio up maybe help protect to the loved ones that are left behind and movement of a tragedy\nWell it does take some time and effort to put together a portfolio that not only meats are financial needs and the justice but also accounts for our loved ones\nIn the event of their mind so they'll keep in mind this does take a while it does take a lot of time and effort such financial strategies then they won't just be beneficial to those suffering the loss of income that can benefit really anyone wanting their money to grow more effectively and last longer\nIn that said ones that strategy I prefer my clients simple in is maintaining an investment portfolio that has mixture diversified in terms of the tax obligations the accounts carry not just having a cash fund which we've already talked about a and a pinch and if you're lucky to have one\nOr other retirement accounts since then maybe have an account or in a town that is tax deferred like four one K. or an IRA um where that money that is you've put it in there and you have it paid the tax is just quite yet\nOne of my favorite accounts or those tax exempt accounts um mainly here Ross IRAs are rough for one case where the money is tax on the land but it comes out tax free\nAnd then of course maybe taxable accounts um such as a portfolio of stocks bonds mutual funds et cetera you know pretty much any type of investment that isn't held in a qualified or a tax exempt accounts\nSo what does this mix do view or help you to do\nWell that makes gives us the flexibility to mix and match or withdrawal types or to your best tax advantage given that the current tax and market environments now for a lot of people it makes sense to take withdrawals from a combination of counts\nI'm not just draining one account that moving on to the next but managing the timing and the amounts of those withdraws which it could be tricky\nI'm given the complexity of tax laws and coordinating those with the market environment so I always suggests that people turn to inexperience professional for guidance um ideally a financial adviser and attacks professional\nThat's going to work well together I'm here at Texas fans are very very we provide that those professionals for all of our clients but again some clients\nHave already come to us with a tax adviser and that's fine we work with those advisors as well so that we're all in communication and looking out for the best interests of our clients\nBut you know the deal here as if we don't get your withdraws right from attacks for sex perspective you could waste thousands of dollars on unnecessary taxes so I Would on the other flip side like to save you thousands even tens of thousands of dollars over time\nSo also besides having diversification because of removing the ... with our couch correct we need different classes in there we talked about diversification before and the ... different than it was like Twenty years ago\nBecause then it was smoke a mixture of large gap international stocks basement was diversification today though which much deeper than that it's across us or clauses in your your diversify within those claws his right\nYeah and so we we want to have a mix of assets whose behavior doesn't always correlate a that is when the value of one asset classes down the value of the other asset is up\nAnd having non correlated assets health so level up the peaks and valleys in the overall performance of a person's full portfolio of assets now this mix help support folly of assets to to weather market volatility by providing protection to some extent from sharp downturn in the market while preserving upside potential\nNow there's a variety of options out there on both the equity and the ... investment portfolio sites and then in other classes such as alternative investments that more people are now turning to in the class for diversification and only say diversification and really it just means controlling volatility\nWe don't want to feel like your money's on a seesaw\nUm or roller coaster right we want to make sure we know really what our worst case scenario is and we can plan on how much you can take out before you\nSeventy four sixty nine do cost ... pressure for this costs will this for this visit because that's basically what you're gonna do that for many your visit\nOr you or do you guys a good fit for each other 'cause it's a two way street here the c._e._o. with your retirement your hopes and dreams Brooklyn is the CFO the chief financial officer to help you make the right decisions with your money and where your money is a ... taxes on health and legacy and all of that goes into this\nWhich is a lot obviously aid for for a three to Seventy four sixty nine we're talking about really the importance of\nHaving a plan in place if something happens to the bread winner\nIs gonna be a super emotional time there's no question about that for the family members that are left behind\nBut do you have a plan in place in case that happens does everybody is everybody on the same page I guess you could say in Brooklyn you brought up a insurance in the last segment ... certainly insurance is one of those things because you were talking before that even about taxes and if we can get some money that's coming to the you know remaining family members that his tax free\nI got to think we're a little bit ahead of the game they're so talk a little bit more about the life insurance because you said earlier you know young people that are thirty with young kids who are gonna have life insurance case something happens to me now they're getting into their sixties and seventies go well my kids are all grown and we're good\nThey don't maybe look at the big picture\nWell you know I come I come at this from a different angle and that whenever my dad did pass away when I was in college and he did not have any life\nInsurance and we sold it thank you [laughter] he did sell life insurance that was his job like not any other types of life is there any other insurance like he didn't tell car insurance intel sell houses like all he did without life insurance and he had nothing and\nSo that definitely was one shocking whenever we discovered that cause we didn't know nobody none of us knew my mom and sisters they didn't know\nAnd ... you know had I can still remember the day that I found out it was like you've got to be kidding me like this is a joke that and it didn't they have to have life insurance if he's held it isn't that a responsibility if you sell life insurance but no no you're not forced to have it\nAnd again he worked as a life insurance salesman so that's a commission based job so there's not like employee benefits where the employer what has life insurance for the employees so double whammy there but that's why I'm I'm really\nJust cognizant of life insurance in general because just because you don't have children that are minors doesn't mean that life insurance is necessary in your overall portfolio\nAnd I eat I get that I mean I'm In some sort of competition if you will with these financial talking heads like the ... and the Suzie Ormond and they're so passionate about the term life that don't go with whole lifestyle you know what\nI'm Sorry the point here is that cash that comes in when you die nobody's going to care that it came from a term life policy and that they got a good deal and they only paid so much for it or if it was from a whole life policy again they all have features and benefits that\nCan benefit you while you're alive and then when you pass away\nThe point here is to find what's the right fit for you and shut up with the talking heads out there and the fact that again that oh you're in your sixties you shouldn't have any life insurance well maybe you do need it because when you die your spouse is going to miss out on four or five thousand dollars of income every single month\nThen what you know we we see people that still have mortgages in retirement and I'm not anti mortgages and retirement\nBut if you are to pass away and your income is helping to pay that mortgage it's a little tough to have a mortgage so all of these things are what life insurance help fix\nIt's finding the right fit in the right company and um you know again how do we enter we've this I don't want you to unnecessarily paid too much for life insurance\nBut I also don't want to be the one sitting across the table from you're surviving spouse going you know look I'm really sorry let's say you have some of the house I mean talk about heartless right so a again\nThere's a lot of great information we can help us we can use the policies you've already got in place possibly upgrade them within the same carrier but also explore the possibility of getting life insurance right now so\nI I Know it was on a rant that that that's the point here is that you know we're in the weeds with all of our clients were sitting here helping them make the decision some are small summer big\nBut having life insurance that's a big decision not having insurance is even a bigger decision so before you just take it on yourself I Would I Would recommend getting at unbiased third opinion as far as what type of life insurance he should get in and\nHow much you should have in place and if something were to happen to you or your spouse\nSo if you'd like to call Brooklyn and find out more it's eight for for a three to Seventy four sixty nine eight four four\nThree two Seventy four sixty nine original crossers normalization for this visit with Brooklyn I'm a team of Texas financial advisor eight four four three two Seventy four sixty nine so Brooklyn was let's talk about some of it but you just brought up you brought up ... wife of germs just so you know Brooklyn I'm fifty years you know\nI did get a letter from my insurance companies are saying but I have two years left on my ... insurance is gonna be running out of the ... or so there is terms insurance but there's also the ... and ...\nMaybe you explain the difference between the two\nSo term life insurance is cheaper typically to own\nBut every dollar you pay every month you you don't get back unless you have a writer on there that to return a premium writer so again understanding how all of this works so that you know am I making the right decision is something that we help you explore so there's\nReally four categories that you could have your money or have life insurance he can have the term you can have on index universal life are bearable universal life and then you can have whole life and so\nMost people at least the people the baby boomers that we meet with they're just they think in terms of term insurance our whole life insurance but there's a ... if you will hybrid of of life insurance policies that have have slowly emerged and in my opinion again I'll have scientific research so that's my opinion\nThe baby boomers have helped with that because these life insurance companies if you really wanted to know where all the walls or wealth is in this world while it's with a life insurance companies they're smart cookies and so\nThey sat there and said okay the biggest\nGroup of wealth right now in our nation is and the baby boomers how do we attract those dollars how do we get them to move money from their savings from their retirement accounts and put it into life insurance and so these universal life like the\nBearable life index life those policies have become very attractive because now when you put their money and you don't lose it if you were to pass away there's obviously a death benefit but it also earns interest based upon a market index and so you are\nAble to grow your your deposits and you're not just throwing money out the window driving a hundred miles down the road so that's what we we tell people you you've got to know have an open mind going into this\nUm it's similar to the story that of how cell phones came about right I mean I still remember in fourth grade\nMart getting into a the the big suburban right the bench seat in the front ... and and in the middle of the ... seat in the front was the most prized possession our family owned and that was the suitcase that when you open it up was a cell phone\nBack then there was no seatbelt laws really but that we never my parents never didn't you know they had above all that that that phone [laughter]\nThe phone flew out the window in a car crash butts right so that that huge suitcase now fast forward two thousand Eighteen and we've got these little computers that we walk around and they do everything they're not even guess or a phone but\nIf you I just I don't want to talk on it I Want to look things up text you could even have the the robot Siri do it for you right I mean who would've ever thought that\nAnd it's really not been that long of a of a time period to change from the big suitcase phone away fifty pounds to this smartphone that we have in our hand and\nI mean how funny was that when the iPhone eight came out and then ten minutes later it was obsolete because then they introduced the iPhone ten so big changes have happened fast and the cell phone world that we all are aware of at the same type of changes have made\nHave been made and the life insurance world obviously doesn't make breaking news but it's still something that if you haven't looked into it if you haven't had an unbiased and reviewer opinion of it then maybe you should take a moment and looked at it to see what's available to you\nI'm In order to enhance your overall state\nSo you mentioned the ... you know how much do you need a much life insurance do need a different Fraser life I suppose there's different amounts you you're talking about you know if you have a mortgage and the bread winner passes away you better have enough insurance to cover the mortgage ... houses paid off Russia posed how much life insurance Brooklyn does ...\nWell it just really depends on what we're we're trying to cover now our even our high net worth folks like people that are worth more than twenty five million dollars need life insurance because they're going to have a big tax bill that's due nine months after they're passing\nKind of ironic it takes you nine months to be to be formed and your mom's womb and and then nine months after you die you got to pay a bill and so we utilize life insurance to help pay for that now the type of life insurance they use for that type of plant is a little different\nYeah because here's the deal a beneficiary trumps everything so\nI Am going to just throw some salt in the ... the odds are we we see people that are blended families right and so you have a four O. one K. that you're behind a at a employer and you have your first wife is a beneficiary on that account\nAgain outta sight outta mind you die just because she's your spouse doesn't mean she doesn't get that money so beneficiaries Trump everything you can have the most expensive will trust all that and this free beneficiary forum that the company gave you for your account\nTrump's out everything so you want to communicate also to to your loved ones again that's we call those family meetings where we say look here's what mom and dad have this is what we've done we don't want any fighting\nAnd this is pretty transparent and it is what it is right and so that that really helps also kind of make things smoother when the person passes away because many changes people and and we want to make sure there's not fighting are unnecessary quarreling when it comes to giving up the estate\nBut you know a beneficiary review is certainly crucial that's part of our process here at Texas face financial advisor he\nOftentimes we find there's no but if history on the account because this is very common um you started the account with A. G. Edwards and then it moved to ... and then now it's Wells Fargo well that original paper you sign when you first opened the account what happened to it where did the beneficiary form go\nAnd so if there is no beneficiary by the fall to just goes to your state well the state has its own processing rules when it comes to probate not necessarily the same as if you had had a beneficiary on there\nSo lots to think about 'em again these are simple mistakes that can cause a ... a lot of money costs a lot of money and a lot of grief if they're not dealt with before you pass away\nSo we got about two minutes left on the show while you touch on are there any other documents that we really should think about housing and ...\nWell not just your well again maybe you need something more advanced like a trust and there's various trucks out there but you also need to a power of attorney for financial matters for medical matters um a hip or release you want to have a direct it to physician which used to be called a living will\nThat would just simply says if I have a terminal illness and I would die within the next six months without being hooked up to this machine either keep me hooked up or pull the plug so these are all documents that you need while you're alive\nNot just when he passed away again the medical power of attorney and the durable power of attorney that's free why when you're alive like if you're in a a car wreck and you're in a coma\nAnd somebody needs to pay your bills and um by your tax return they can't do it without the power of attorney so that's the other documents that you really need in place um and updated because uh eats institutions different we there's a couple of banks in town that if the\nPower of attorney is older than six months\nThey won't accept it so if that's the case we either want to switch banks or we want to put you on on auto pilot that you're durable power of attorney is renewed every six months\nSo I feel like we've made a lot of attraction here today I really enjoy talking about this because I feel like it's it's really an integral part of why I Do what I Do why started this from back in January of two thousand eight\nUm and and we've helped hundreds of families in order to save money put money back in their pockets and then also we've been there when they passed away and then they're with their family in order to help wrap things up\nSo we've opened up this opportunity for the first two callers on our show today at a four four eight three two Seventy four sixty nine to gain access to one of

as\nI was watching a car auction on TV the other day one beautiful car after another went over the auction block some selling for more than one hundred thousand dollars\nThe commentators kept

I've used with my children when my kids come to me and want to help it always amazes me how their interest in learning sometimes it's not always equal to their motivation\nMaybe instead of wanting to learn something they just want me to do for them\nWhen I run into this behavior I always tell them get over here I Can't steer parked car in other words taking advantage of education requires action it requires you to do something with the information you have and find out new information that will help you get where you want to go\nSo many times I provide people with an opportunity to learn something new about how they can protect and more importantly use their retirement money in a way that provide safe returns and a lifetime of income but they're still happy to sit in a parked car unfortunately all parked cars have one thing in common eventually they're rest away\nInflation and missed opportunity can have the same effect on your retirement if this parked in the corner\nThere's

is a risk those of you that have had\nChildren know this to be a fact a lot of time and money not to mention blood sweat and tears goes into raising children and even if you're the perfect parent it doesn't always turn out the way you want it to\nAlmost everyone I talked to that has had a problem child have said that they still love their kids and wouldn't trade them for the world even in very sad situations where children permanently pass way parents are grateful for the time they had with them you can definitely say that children are worth taking the risk\nSummer is definitely are not worth taking I think jumping out of an airplane without a parachute would fall into that category I don't think any of my clients would argue with that or they wouldn't be my clients for very long\nHow about taking a risk you don't have to take you don't have to risk their retirement money but many people do it for no good reason at all [noise] wouldn't you rather a financial planning

save me\nI see my clients from a lot of things sometimes I saved them from having all of their money exposed to market risk\nSometimes I say in them from high fees that are eating up all the returns other times I'm saving them from having NO PLAN or a bad plan that brokers put together with no consideration for guaranteed income for life and protection of principle\nIt doesn't matter if my

so let's talk about that war to what makes a single different\nAh thanks rained yeah it does come with a forty year warranty on it as opposed to most three tab shingles having a twenty five year warranty so are alleging designers three tab shingle is coming with a forty year warranty with [noise] with installing it with the system a roofing system which would\nCompose of are all composed of all of our products or to use underneath the shingles so using our starter using our on our seven sixty under limits so these are essential products to get the the the the roof installed correctly and provide the best protection that it can for the home\nSo with all those you get the first ten years out of that forty years one hundred percent covered or the material labor tear off dumpster feed these are a couple of these things are things you don't really think about as a homeowner enter warrants years saying hey the materials covered\nWell at the labor is is it can be expensive than the dumpster if we can be expensive the tear off the we don't think about those things so as a homeowner so\nUh all those things are covered one hundred percent uh for the first ten years and then after

homeowners of the world on budget shutdown\nA you know we we only make so much money and I mean we all like to the architectural look at the design but unfortunately there's a price difference in the ... with with the cost of materials I mean there can be a three four thousand dollar price for home or does it have\nAnd uh this shingle keeps you have three tap price market\nAnd gives you all the

two one zero four or five for twenty four hundred any callers out there that have any questions call us here to studio at two one zero five nine nine\nFifty five fifty five [noise] and ah we we we want to\nWe want to be able to answer the questions but you know just\nThis product ... I'll throw you out some good questions there too with us so we could clearly see the different sort of products and\nYou know one of the big things though too is for manufacturers we know and most ... roofs that are being installed out there where we can say that are being installed in proper\nIs when they don't have the right ventilation race show I mean you know if you put ridge vets and most of all it proves they have hardly any ridge up there to be able to put a rich that aren't\nSo when these a lot of contractors are out there and not giving away rich that but you know if you're only putting on Fifteen feet of rage that on a four thousand square foot home you're starving that home ventilation\nThat's going to affect the shade going also affect the war is that correct\nBrat that's absolutely correct yes or so as a manufacturer it's important to have the proper ventilation for the square footage of the home as well as not just the ventilation out of the advocates the intake into the addict as well so\nUh it's it's very important that those things are met and having Ruth fix to inspect that and make sure that it is installed correctly per the size of your home is the central\nOr you know uh we did we checked to soften ventilation you know you don't hear a lot about yourself at ventilation but that's what Brad was referring to that as the him take a\nHot air rises like a hot air balloon and so you know it has a a force ... arrive empty their addict but without the intake those are the bottom ... vets code requires them every eight feet depending on\nThe type of addict you have we actually have to increase that so we get a good flow of air because that's a hot air rises and then we have to take the exit vets and that's most of like ridge vet systems turtle backs he got different systems out there\nBut what we're finding is we weren't going to also include this with our roofing system is we're going to use if you don't have enough courage when to use solar effect covers out ventilation than you know we use a it's called the green machine and we're going to also\nBe throwing that ventilation system in to assure that\nThe roof is being ventilated right and we just stopped [noise] we're we're going to put them in places that usually what one green machine can do up to four thousand square feet is that correct them\nDepends on the size of that we are that we select but yet most of them will will ventilate up to four thousand square feet and this would be ah in you know whether your house has some ridge and not enough um we can do both ventilation on the rich and then we can move as some of these green machine Vance into the ...\nSlopes of the property out of sight 'em to where we can ventilate that attic space so you definitely want to get that hot air out of your addict I mean if he wants to send them they're active addict even today is probably over a hundred and twenty degrees\nAnd there then we could drop temperatures by forty degrees in some cases\nUp in the attic and we have and uh this is energy savings that makes your home more energy efficient making sure\nThat this is working right and more importantly we're meeting all the specifications to the manufacturer has mentally ill bred is unfair that to the manufacturer that there's some rivers out there and solving it wrong and then when they do come to you guys get repaired", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "year": "2018", "city": "San Antonio", "day": "14"}
