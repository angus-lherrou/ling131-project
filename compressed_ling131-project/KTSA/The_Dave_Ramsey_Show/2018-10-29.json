Brookes welcome that I'd ...\nHi Dave how are you better than I deserve how can I help\nSir that's for taking my call uh my wife and I were moving out to a ... station out there or we have a four house here in Pensacola and um I Know you normally say not\nTo buy a house if you're in the military um but I've made good money last two times I've done it and uh I Am uncomfortable having my whole network\nAnd I'm In the stock market basically because we'd be looking at this house about three hundred fifty K. um you know we have three hundred and ten K. and retirement already in\nBut I Would have to take out two hundred twenty five K. and non retirement investments in order to be able to afford a house up there and also you know I don't want everything in the stock market us it on everything in one house ... I'm only going to live their short time and I wanted to know your body [noise]\nUm I don't have a problem with your not wanting everything in the stock market I Would not long distance landlord in order to accomplish my goal though so you're talking about keeping the homeless by foreign Pensacola when you moved to San Diego is that what you're telling me\nNo sir ah we have it on the market I I Want to cash out of this now is on really they're going to outlive their cell phones well about three fifty\nOkay and uh you're not going to be able to buy anything in San Diego for three fifty\nWell not unless I catch up on retirement investments are you know at two twenty five ... you know I can afford something out there\nHow much you're having on retirement is that all you've got a two point five K. retirement about a half million dollar house then yes or what's\nYour household income or about one eating okay\nThe reason we tell folks to not buy in the military in most cases is because you're not in the home long enough for it to appreciate enough to sell it and make a profit and also sometimes some military markets have an over ...\nWhy of homes on the market they're hard to resell so you've got stuck in it and you lose money on it in some markets in Pensacola would not be one of those markets usually and certainly San Diego would not be one of those market you're going to see incredible\nAppreciation and incredible market activity in both of those markets you should so so you should be able to get out of this and make a profit on the one you bought there and that's what it sounds like you're doing and you should be able to do the same in San Diego and I do agree real estate prices are up substantially um\nI'm not sure that you have to use all of that I Would probably if I were in your shoes what would I Do if I woke up in your shoes\nOr I Would either a rent or be I Would pay cash for whatever I bought in San Diego\nAnd that would mean one of two things that neither one of which are going to be comfortable one is I'm not gonna I'm not going to spend as much as you're talking about spending instead of been spending five hundred maybe four hundred and leave a hundred and non retirement um or I'm I'm just going to get comfortable in order to have a house like that\nUh with having no non retirement investing until I re sell this house now if you re sell this

you're under your debt free screenplay our love it how much of your butt off a hundred and eighty thousand wow look at you that's awesome how long does that take six and a half years six and a half years and your range of income during that time\nAs starting out at Seventy five thousand in ending around the hundred and sixty thousand\nGood for you you guys are killing it will do for a living I'm a licensed clinical social worker a construction project manager for a interstate retailer uh-huh okay very good well you guys are killing it way to go man like yourself what kind of that was this one hundred and eighty thousand dollars\nA eight thousand was my car and a hundred and Seventy thousand with our wonderful student loans from a private Christian university\n\nWe were expensive spouses to each other [laughter] oh\nOkay so this you drop some ... yeah All right and I'm In six and a half years that's a long time to pay off the student loans I was thinking maybe it was the house when you don't usually come out here so there has to be a good story tell me your story\nUm I got a really funny story actually um when we went through financial piece at our church at the time I'm One of the things that you mentioned in your video\nWas a take cash with you when you when we were we were newlyweds when we first went through and you still take cash would you when you go to a furniture store to buy a car and and and slashed the cash and and I haven't talked to them that way so we were at a furniture store and I'm a very not confrontational kind of guy kind of a free spirit and she told me hey let's do this let's put this to practice so\nWe took cash in and I'm Talking to the sales guy about a bad that we're trying to buy for our department at the time and\nI'm flashing the cash and saying hey I'm I'm going to walk if if we can't make this happen right now and he's like I'm I'm Sorry that that's just the price\nAnd uh so I just went out in the car and sit down because I couldn't swallow my pride and buy it but then my wife ended up by\nUs out of that that that is just to show that\nThere is a lot of negotiation from the beginning we were really um when we were dating and engaged at the time we were sitting out with their finances and we were actually writing out the numbers and it was just this\nPet feeling in her stomach those are where just indebted to these loan companies and we're going to be in our fifties before we pay 'em off and\nAnd so when we started the class the now down to budget and did the ... system and we were really on Christmas Day for the ... just really got serious about it and\nI think the big part and for us for as far as deciding to really try to work on maybe up to as we paint my car off I'm relatively quickly and then he had gotten his first\nPretty big ... from work and so we're like okay we haven't really gotten to travel before kids let's take a really great trip to Europe with this money we deserve it\nAnd we were sitting there one time where like where we just their budget you know a few months ago and said that was the first step we use that bonus money instead of a trip to Europe which who knows if we'll be able to take that ever and that's okay but we add why\nWouldn't they make a hundred and sixty thousand dollars of any debt ... years old are you in our first and now we have two kids so it doesn't make like ... [laughter]\nSome country [laughter] ...\nYeah that that was the big you know turning point for us and we put that big lump sum of money and our first student loan payment and that was an awful feeling and hurting but a good feeling\nTo show how much of the six years did you make closer to Seventy five an hour much closer to one sixty pretty much the whole six years the last year last year the income doubled down right Israel guy and so that's a relatively new figure correct then and so really you know basically you paid off for about thirty thousand bucks a year\nFor six years while making about Seventy five right yes are you really have been doing this ... learn okay and then last year a kicked in about the time you saw the light at the end the Donald income comes opera mhm yeah yeah what what was the hardest part of this for you all six and a half\nAnd a good ...\nAnd I think for me the hardest part was\nAnd starting it and just seeing the light at the end of the tunnel 'cause when you see that a hundred and Seventy thousand dollars on a piece of paper or either to undergraduate degrees and master's degree it's just like is this worth it and um\nSo I think when we paid off our first student loan and that was just such a victory feeling for us um says really hard at the beginning to go from letting our money kind of flow out wherever and to really nail down a budget and in the envelope system and that was hard for me to the you\nKnow I think for me it's just the the sacrifice um you know in the world we live in just the spirit of comparison and just seeing everyone around do you spend money and buying new the nice things and I'm just constantly you know telling ourselves that will be later and you know when we went through the class and I know it's kind of what you always say but it really\nIt's been embedded in me is just you know live like no one else so that you can look like no one else and I really clung to that because there were times where we wanted to give up or they would have been easy to just you know do by what we wanted but\nI'm to be here now to be able to talk to you and all these people and just say that we did it it's just an amazing feeling so\nFree now isn't or lose if they did it feel lucky lot lost three hundred pound jamming it really does for spending as much a lot of that yeah that's pretty incredible ... well I Know it's a long time and a lot of sacrifice was worth it Yes sir\nSo it was for you ever go back into\nNo no no no we've never had credit cards we went to cash flow I'm we're on baby step for well at the beginning step to babysit for but we're wanting to save up to cash flow for the event\nNow that say that but during the ...\nInch changes you're going ... good good for you guys like well congratulations to have more cheerleaders are more detractors as you went along I\nHad a lot of cheerleaders yeah we were and really you know supported by our family and our friends especially once we start getting the ball rolling and paying off dead it was kind of just people who are in disbelief that we were able to pay off so much and down\nAnd at the same time he wanted to make things for us with our journey was and being smart with our money especially all the extra income that was coming in and it was like that but we also wanted to still I'm available are in use our money for him and then sell\n'em a lot is you know for the first few years a lot of our money is going out not towards that end we thought okay with that and so that's just part of our journey for people to not be afraid to still be generous while you're on baby step kids even if it's a huge lump sound not cause the lord bless us and so many ways suddenly um\nI mean we've had both of our cars my cars like eleven years old and we don't want another car payment we're at the point to where we literally it was we were outgrowing our car like with the car seats he couldn't even put a seat back all the way like sitting out but we're getting a very high\nAnd that so part of our story as my parents they blasted us and gave us their pay it off as TV oh wow yeah so um you know that's just one of the main you know blessings that and you can um you know given\n'cause you don't use it you know for the same reasons you wouldn't buy another one you saw that one and that is true of investments that is true of rental properties true of a lot of stuff if\nHe wouldn't bite again then don't keep it a cause by keeping it tomorrow you bought it again in a sense so I think you take the offer or get a really sweet offer up the off or whatever but I don't I definitely do but not only is in Little Rock Arkansas Hi Natalie welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHi how are you better than I deserve what's up

car for a month while I saved up the money to buy a car I'll bet you could say five thousand dollars a month yeah probably so and then by a five thousand dollar car and drive it for six months or four months while you save up a bunch more money and get you a Fifteen or twenty thousand dollar car and pay cash for it\nOK so rent for one month by five thousand then\nThen drop it for four or five months and by your Fifteen or twenty thousand all with cash\nOkay because I don't borrow money anymore\nRight well we also we consider the armchair and talked about it or if they are thrilled about it but we we have a four O. one K.\nThat no no no no money anymore okay we don't borrow money well okay if you borrow money overall in case of that you borrow money is that borrowing it er\nYeah it's

anywhere from sixty five Seventy ... ... and lives rented [noise] when I bought it for a couple of years ago and it makes about Thirteen hundred dollars a month and Iran where I Am is only five hundred\nAnd this one's going to be available for the in the year and I've been wondering do I want to\nMove into it make it my own home now that if they can show you bought it and it's rented right okay and what's your income oh average about thirty five thousand a year commissions\nMhm okay well I the the way I answer questions was bought always ends up happening with me on stuff like you're describing is um what feels good in the short term might not be taking me to my long term goal\nAnd a show or when I'm always asking myself as warm where am I going to be in ten years in which these decisions takes me there okay now obviously you can live in a garage apartment how old are you\nI'm not fifty five okay then you could live in a garage apartment till you're sixty five and you could make the transactional spread here I'm making next door some extra money doing that is what we're saying and then you the question you ask yourself is is that worth it to you\nDoes that get you some place that you couldn't get otherwise um my tendency personally would be to do everything I can to increase my income during the next ten years and be living in that condo\nOr I mean you landed in the garage apartment as a a a place to heal and and get reset after a divorce right\nBut that really wasn't ... it's kind of camping ... when you're not a college student [laughter] I mean this was camping that's right you know and so this isn't like your destiny it's not where you want to be long term but ... and so my point is just because of the numbers work on something doesn't mean it's right\nSo if you feel and you've settled you got your found footing under your again which I'm guessing you do that you bought a condo um probably moving into that condo but the ...\nWhat am I going to be doing ten years from now like to be Seventy thousand instead of a thirty five and what track 'em on there what am I gotta do to get my support a healing as believing in yourself again at a way ... believe in yourself in a way maybe you never have to where you put yourself on a career track to get those in comes up long term\nBut a ... if that's where you are that's where your head as I think I'm going to move into the condo now if you're headed is saying you know I think I'm probably going to the solemn ever going to do I'm just going to route thirty five thousand into retirement\nYou might want to know the garage department or the other money in your pocket but I don't think that you\nI'm not really like to purchase a house yeah keep the ... rental income now well let's get it paid off is paid off oh good that'd be awesome them you will by if you got extra money to about beyond Tobias worth\nSaving not at the moment now okay than living in that condo with no payment at all you know you can do that and again getting your income up get you into that go faster\nSo um I I'm going to be working on the income side of the equation and I'm probably going to go and enjoy that paid for condo it's a it's kind of like saying uh I'm back\nYou know what I'm saying is that does that ring a bell with you yeah okay yeah you're back yeah they owe you is back and you got a future and it's right and it's going to be good and ah yeah moving in the condo but it's on my way to a house of them are paid cash for 'cause my incomes going to go up and goes back\nAnd uh yeah I'm ... I'm not going to camp anymore fifty five it was okay to do that for a little while no shame in that game but that but you you you know you got past that stage now your back is that okay yeah cool thanks for dropping by thanks\nOpen phones that triple eight eight to five five two to five Claire is with us in Atlanta Georgia Hi Claire how are you\nI'm good how are you know good how can I help\n[noise] um I have a question for you so we're all your data sets for a little less in the air now and I feel like we are on that it had on retirement we're behind on college savings for two kids\nHow old are your kids and they are twelve and ten okay and how old are you guys\nWe are forty six okay and how much is in retirement I'm a little over a million little your head congratulations ... so what's your household income if not only that way I like yeah we\nWe are I mean when you have more than a million dollars you're a millionaire yeah okay yeah you're right [laughter] yeah so ... what is your household income\nA little over two hundred\nOkay so why can you not say Fifteen Percent of two hundred and still catch up and get have plenty of money for college when you've got eight years before\nCollege well let's hang or private school right now as well what are you paying for bronco how much cash how much ... than a year per kid or total total okay you make two fifty when looking at you like it you don't make two hundred I mean one eighty okay\nAnd if you can cash flow twenty thousand a year for private school that's ... ... that cash flow can return towards casual in college too if they choose a college that's a reasonably expensive\nYeah OK okay that's a good point and yes nine\nSo I I you know Fifteen Percent of your household income going into retirement\nYou don't need it you're in good shape I agree with you if you want to stop it's not the end of the moral\nBut I don't think your house to stop if you'll just sit down and actually do a written budget on a two hundred thousand dollar your income twenty thousand out for kids to school today\nWe're going to offset some of that was cash flow in some college but some college on an international set aside and put Fifteen Percent of head shots so we're talking about thirty thousand dollars that's fifty thousand bucks going into these two things\nCollege in return I mean I'm Sorry a private school in retirement and then we got to say something to college you say\nTen grand a year per kid another twenty grand you can do that\nA front for from now until they go to school they'll have plenty of money\nI mean you just Jack up to five twenty nine and pick out good mutual funds that you control inside that five twenty nine get or the one of those smart vest her prose and they'll help you do that ... day Ramsey dot com for a list of them in your area\nThe people we recommend them sit down when you help people that five twenty nine together and pop ten grand a piece in those two I don't think you have to cut retirement back but if you're putting more than Fifteen Percent into retirement than you're not working our plan at this stage\nBecause you put Fifteen Percent into retirement until college and it was done and houses paid off only when those two things are done and you're a baby steps seven to increase return rugby on Fifteen Percent and Fifteen Percent or two hundred thousand started ground\nSo that that's what I'm doing the math here I think you can do it I think you just gotta sit down and not have this vague worry about it\nEat my watch this past year and so I'm trying to figure out what to do\nNow so I should not actually doing pharmacy are dealing with the customers a chew up it's the bureaucracy and show how is there another way we apply your existing education skills to the market that rather than just work in a CBS\nMhm correct um\nDon't know but I I Would think that there's got to be some kind of ... year up ... cherry\nIdea out there kind of old school ... high end delivery or something that is not all insurance based in driving me crazy\nRight you know like I've seen the doctors got some of the doctor docs go to the ... model right mhm correct where they lower the number of patients that they see and you pay a flat fee and you've got like they'll do house calls and everything and they actually know their patience now\nRight that kind of thing where they lower that did it different gotta practice management is the I Wonder if there's that kind of application to your world I have no idea I'm making this up right now so I'm fully pharmacists\nJob market is saturated um they've they've been dumping pharmacist more and more pharmacist and ever since I graduated way and\nThat and let's say the U.S in Walgreens is just they're just stamping it out that's the ... world so right and that's\nThe world I came from in a smaller smaller sector and you know here I Am I lost a hundred and forty five thousand dollar income and I'm thinking well you know what next to it [laughter] I'll be asleep I Can't pull the well the ah to the doctor the doctor along and I\nWell I mean there's ... there's two things one is I'm trying to think through if I'm you a business model because you've got an entrepreneurial\nItch to scratch that is some kind of high service and low insurance no insurance a profit carry model where you use your licensing and your knowledge is you're very specialized in very valuable knowledge\nRight and that's not what's your burned out on your burn out on the corporate crap right\nAnd uh and so is there another way to be a pharmacist in today's world that you invent even if it's on a small scale I don't care I'm right I'm going to begin to investigate business model ideas like that around the country and see who is doing\nLike an old school of public area I'm almost thinking like a soda fountain and the thing like the old days you know kind of thing we're stuff but I don't know I I'm just making this up in my head sitting here\nI Know that ... ... here's the thing I Do know about the marketplace the very very high end high service a luxury markets are booming in every sector\nThe uh low end the bottom end which is all price based is booming middle grade product lines of services are not booming in any space\nThose are people I mean in other words cheap hotels enriches or doing good the ones in the middle are struggling right\nAnd so get off on one into those spaces you figured out the bottom and other commodities how spacious killing you so we're probably going to some kind of high end thing is they're the ... to rich people model some way I don't know I'm making this up\nI'm just asking questions out loud now while we're discovering that I might go back and endure another year or two of the grinder\nTo put away two hundred thousand bucks to go live my dream with okay but I'm not going to submit myself to Thirty years of this grind right okay but I put up with all kinds of crap for a little while to get to where I Want to go\nThis last year has been so brutal and my wife and family that you know they they now see what I saw um you know a year and a half ago it's\nBrutal on their wife and family just your time\nYou're ... ... my my morale\nOkay but your morale has everything to do with what you're looking towards you thought you were stuck there I can ... I don't want my Morales bad if I'm standing and poked my knees okay but not bad if I'm standing put money is because I'm walking through that shoveling it to use it as fertilizer to grow a crop\nTrue okay you see the difference I if I can look past it I can walk to anything but you couldn't like passed it in the last year and it destroyed your emotions your your gas tanks empty\nRight I'm kinda glad that I said that chapter you know and I turned ... yeah I think\nMy point is you could walk back into a similar situation if you knew you were only doing it for two years because at the end of two years we're going to do X Y and Z right okay\nBut you gotta have your X Y and Z defined and I'm I'm not capable of doing that in this setting in you know a minute and forty five seconds on the radio but I mean at least get you started there so you got the right stuff do you just got to believe in you again and not completely give up on the idea that you can surf people to a public areas of pharmacy\nBecause you can surf people that way I just don't know how to do it business model because I don't know your world well enough I mean I'm a consumer see the CVS model I see the\n... model out there and see the ... model in the high end on the medical care side that's working really well I'm a customer but uh of that for for convenience sake on the high inside so I don't know I I don't\nI don't know how that works but I think it's for a year on the right track there [noise]\nYou got to have you gotten this this but I ...\nGuy child either of the day random show on the side to

iron\nThanks to those questions first to be clear operation guardian support continues on two thousand Ninety two national guardsmen unemployed right now under the governors or authority that will continue this effort faithful patriots is complimentary to that effort but brings additional capability capacity to help CBC\nWith respect to plus the ... everything that we're doing is in line with an inherent to ...\n[noise]\nAnd that's what our forces and rebel forces activity to chip away with us soldiers the thought\nTo be clear we all use the national forces and that's under operation guardian support very effectively being employed as we speak right now we're bringing additional capability was titled enforces under under faithful patriot a we have the authority given to us by Secretary Mattis the units that are normally assign weapons they are in fact deploying with\nWeapons [noise]\nMake anything is my next year you're talking about a caravan heading down to thirty five hundred people at their hands eventually turned them down to only four hundred people by the border and yet you're talking about\nDuty military that with the devil why do you feel that the cafeteria and all that sort of like yeah\nThis this group is very large thirty five hundred a much larger then there'd be a Christmas carol ... as we've seen in the past\nOr we do see other large groups forming a again there's three thousand or so after Guatemala Mexico border now hoping to join up for the league group um we do see other ... for me you know Salvador and also in Central America so we've got to be prepared for the potential reliable a very large group\nAnd because of the size we we want to be able to handle it effectively and safely and what we saw when this group cross the Honduras Guatemala borders I did a very fortunately they push past Guatemalan security forces\nAre even more risky was on the Guatemala Mexico border or where it was a combination of near riding on the bridge and then crossing illegally to reduce the tropics so we we ... we saw those tactics which are different than we've seen in past large groups\nAre and we want to be ready for that ah and we think this opera opportunity to harden our ports of entry out to be ready for mobile deployment between port is a better way to prepare for the potential rival of a large group like this [noise]\nTo [noise] place or something like that I\nKnow this is the law enforcement operation from CDC's perspective and re partner with the er the all the time to help secure our border\n[noise] next question for the commissioner or for foreign nationals who reach American soil and a sense you exercise their legal rights to seek asylum in the United states how do you plan to receive\nUnder under law I think this thing on policy we'll process to people that we apprehend crossing illegally for arriving in presenting lawfully but without documents at our ports of entry in the same way we're doing currently\nConstantly not returned to Mexico\nA ... that's an ongoing conversation on how we best handle that group it becomes a large group we are talking with Mexico I we're also considering all potential options in terms of uh administration that or\nDid you\nDrive [laughter]\nYes so first of all I mentioned the special operations groups this works all tactical unit the border patrol search trauma in rescue teams uh that's a significant portion of the mobile troops we also have agents identified as members of mobile response teams that come from sectors all over the country uh and then because I work with the northern\nSo so that's still being worked through DOD and exactly what that structure would require it would be obviously depending on which direction we see a a group moving\nA now you can only process a certain number of people at a time or even if they're presenting lawfully a so we would want to work with the government in Mexico if this group does make it all the way to the border and again\nOr the president of Mexico is offered very generously\nProtections employment authorization shelter and status of this group in Mexico so if if you're really seeking asylum you you've reached a safe place and you've been given a generous offer by the first country how did you crossed into from Central America so I think that's an important point to focus on\nUs so we want to work in Mexico to manage that that flow and ensure that people don't try to cross illegally that is more dangerous they generally have to engage with the smuggler or ... and it's even less orderly uh than a large group arriving so that that is we're going to be focused on in partnership with our government in Mexico counterparts anything\nYou've been able to do to actually change that incentive structure that existed last\nProcessing I draw the line them through the ports of entry sent them the other direction\nSo it I think that that's questionable we we as I noted in the outside we we process thirty eight thousand or claims that fear of returned home country at our ports of entry in the last school year\nA that is far and away or a new record so we are for providing access to asylum seeker it at our ports of entry awfully or as as directed so I think that's that's inappropriate points to understand\nLess because of\n...\nThe rapid rise an opiate addiction has become a

the question the annuity recently we had a five year mark and\nAdvising her to all the money I turned ... which I think is a good idea however the question is is that she\nShould have should have that money invested initially at the beginning of the ah turn you know I could have been putting in ... she brings home about thirty five hundred dollars a month and retirement and Social Security but she doesn't meet the draw ... at all you know and they knew that at the beginning of the time\nYou know well yeah you're right that makes me question and other things that are going on that I don't know
