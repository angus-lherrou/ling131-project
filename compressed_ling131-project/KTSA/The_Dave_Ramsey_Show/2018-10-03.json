and picked apart by most of you in this rent but not no one is looking at\nAh whether or not the accusations made her corroborated whether or not there's evidence to support them every person that she

case and the president's simply pointing out the facts of the matter and that is what the Senate will have to use to determine whether or not they vote to support him or not or\nSaying you're saying judge Kavanaugh's victim all this\nI think both Dr Ford and judge Kavanaugh or or victims at the hands of the Democrats I think it is absolutely disgraceful\nWhat they've done and exploited this

all of those facts laid out and I think she makes it very compelling\nCase\nThat I mean I Love when we're all of a sudden and that is a reason why even though he has called for an investigation is

the\nJags on Facebook ... dot com slash Dave Ramsey and you'll get the part of the messages we put on their Facebook does not put everything through the throttle are messages so they can make us by ads from well it doesn't really work\nThat way guys but I Try anyway he says what's the difference between a credit union in a bank\nA bank is owned by stock holders\nThat when the bank makes a profit and they should make a profit we want them to make some profits when the bank makes a profit the stock holders the owners of the company\nYet that profit basically I mean it is the profits dispersed in the form of um dividends or the value of the stock has increased because the bank continue ... whatever it is but basically the owners of a bank are stockholders and that's where the profit goes\nA credit union is operated more like a cooperative\nWhere the owners of a credit union are there it's actually a not for profit technically speaking and\nUm the not the owners of the credit union are the credit union members which are also the customers\nAnd so as a customer of the credit union those services and interest rates and whatever you pay the credit union they profit that has created\nIs return to their members in the form of increased services or in the form of actual dispersed much\nI mean sometimes you actually just get a little check from your credit union put into your account and so uh that's the difference uh banks don't lie don't offer banks don't like credit union as they say they have an unfair advantage\nBecause there have nonprofit status I'm One of that's really not true\nI'm it's real simple the credit union simply does not make a profit because whatever profit as may just fall back into cheaper checking accounts better interest rates on loans or higher interest rates on savings\nAnd so the you know basically they end up not making a profit so if a bank wanted to uh make less profit could do the same thing\nSo they don't have a disadvantage they're just trying to keep stock holders happy and sell stuff to customers the credit union has customers that are the stock holders that since the owners are the members and so it returns and all of that really doesn't matter ... bit\nIf you don't get good service from the organization\nAnd so we endorsed credit unions are not because of their nonprofit status but because they have reasonably priced goods and sir reasonably priced\nGetting services for you to use and you'll be treated not like a number you retreated ... by you know people that actually care you'll also have that similar experience at a local community banks regional banks and that's who I Do business with personally\nI don't personally have an account right now the credit union I'm not opposed to I just don't my stuff our our business accounts and our our personal accounts are all have local\nUh read our regional and I'm a community banks in our area we do business with several banks\nAnd so and it's very simple it's just because I Need to pick up the phone and talk to a human being that actually has a little bit of power that can pull stuff off now I don't my CFO does but my controller knows that kind of thing but but in you know that's what you should want you should be able to walk in and talked to a human and not be treated like a number\nAnd you know so I Do not understand why anyone would do business with people like Wells Fargo or bank of America it's beyond me\nThey treat you like crap and they over charging for most of the services and this day in time there online offerings or their Web banking systems are not any more sophisticated they're not that good\nThey're not good at anything so I just don't get it so that that's why we endorsed credit unions you hear me in some of your city is endorsing a local credit union or a local small town community type bank and I'm just a a huge fan of using that for your\nYour banking service needs and it's what I did\nEverything I endorse on the show is stuff that that I personally do or what do you know in your situation and that kind of a thing I don't have anything is inconsistent like I'm too big or too good to do that I I'm not I don't have a need for some of the things that we tell ya get but\nYou know ... you know in most cases I'm a customer personally Ted is with us Ted's in York, Pennsylvania Hi Jen how are you\nDoing better than I deserve how're you doing just the same how can I help All right ... thank you and your staff writer you're doing a it's a blessing thank you um how it'll be needing our lifestyle saving operation about ten to Fifteen Years if I don't get hit by a bus\nAnd I want to know if I if I should continue funding NHL say with\nMy employer contributing a couple of hundred bucks here or should I just put that extra money into a Roth IRA her four one K.\nWas or just a couple of hundred bucks a year\nThe company I don't know if\nYou can put you come out they're matching a couple hundred bucks a year or more okay showed the the nature of ... what kind of life saving operation if you're going to happen to ... what is it\nI think it'll ever ooh I got ... yes see so yeah ... fortunately you can't live without\nYeah I've heard that you know out Sean how can I have to say it's a it's a slow a slow progression then\nYeah it is they they estimate that you know Seventeen years out ... okay yeah I got to figure to right around the time I'm going to retire so I'm trying to retire early you know and I'll see if I can\nYou know I think the thing is the uh what you're gonna want is a ... you you you got to have the cash in your age essay or somewhere else in an investment to cover what's going to come out of your pocket I assume you're talking to health insurance is going to cover a large portion of this correct\nYeah that's if I don't retire um and I'll be I'm I'm either ... or some other type of insurance policy\nYeah I think I'd be on cobra or or I wouldn't retire because this is our guest thing this is a multi hundred thousand dollar event isn't it\nProbably half\nNow and so I'm thinking we're going to turn retirement around is a little bit um or and or cobra one or two if you want to retire early you're just going to have to pony up for the cupboard was covering the last what two years or something\nResponsible hardworking people I mean I kind of thing and so it's just that we're blessed in that way because I Know people that you know they get their\nRecord deal and all of a sudden some cousin they didn't even know comes out of the woodwork you know and uh I've not had that I Know I've got some cousins that I don't hardly know but none of them came out of the woodwork they stayed in the woodwork good for them so not looking for money why I wouldn't mind seeing some of them but I don't know I'm looking for money wouldn't even though you are\nSo um it it's something everybody deals with I think you know you hear people like at the lotto in this\nAnd then crazy sets in in their family and arts I I'll tell you where else I run into its when they sent a fellow players\nAnd they get a big signing bonus and crazy comes out of the woodwork on them I mean they get some dysfunctional crap in their lives it's amazing and are people who feel entitled to a piece of their success and it it it really is really as an illness that's a problem\nStephanie is

shock it up to that and but dude I'm telling you a word will have some\nDiscussions is he married\nHis girlfriend okay\nI'll bet she works forty hours yes there\nI reached out to most of the time we let real estate that of all kinds of baby steps six\nOr if you have a very large equity line of credit on a rental property you might want to refinance it into a traditional mortgage and get rid of the risk associated with the pop and interest rates are possible called provision for that line of credit\nAnd I want to get yourself in a pinch with the bank calling notes or that they're allowed them to call based on the way that's written like that lack of liquidity is was it could put you in a problem you know the cash to pay him so um but so you\nKnow you got like a ... you make a hundred thousand dollars a year you got a hundred thousand our line of credit that's probably refinance you make a hundred thousand dollars a year and you got it then that was on a lot of credit it's probably a baby step to item um the point is\nWe want to work through the debt but we want to get on with retirement an emergency fund and a reasonable paces well and a figure out where we're going from there\nSo good question Matthew is in Daytona Hi Matthew how are you\nI'm In good and you better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] um how do I have for college and not go into debt\nOkay how old are you\nEighteen Eighteen very cool what are you gonna study\nUm possibly um [noise] pretty much anything that I can get into our ... ice cream\nI T yeah you're saying okay so you like technology yeah All right\nWell um I I think the first go before you go start your education process is you need to have an idea of what you're going to study because that will change the answer to your question that you asked okay so let's say for instance that you wanted to be a Web programmer\nAnd um I've got folk guys on my team that make 'em\nIn excess of a hundred thousand dollars well in excess of that that that ah right ruby on rails code\nOkay not I'm not a bad career and uh that's\nAn example of an IT type of thing okay and Web programmer writing code now if you're going to do that you would not need and it would not be preferable for you to get a four year degree in information technology that's not necessary to do that\nYou wouldn't need to take some classes on how to code and you'd want to learn you know some of the basic IT things and so I Would probably direct you towards a vote tech type school or which is probably a two year degree while you're studying doing that and I would tell you to work your tail off in the technology field\nUh and if you can uh you know bring\nCoffee for people who are doing code and just watch over their shoulder and learn from them and hang out from them and you're a new hobby is hanging out with people who are world class code riders voters than uh you know and you're taking some classes that will get you and they're more than a four year degree will get you and there's a lot cheaper\nBut it depends on what I mean when you say I tape but you could change your mind but I'm ... I'm not going to do I T I Want to go into business well then you might want to do a four year degree with a degree you know the specialization in marketing or finance or something like that and in that case the answer would be different on how to pay for it here's the thing you want to the number one\nCarefully select what it is you want to study\nAnd that it makes your eyes light up when you talk about it you kind of smile down inside when you talk about doing this\nThing whatever the thing is okay you know once you've selected that then you decide how to study it if it's a four year degree if it's a two year vote tech degree\nOr am I going to go to a community college for two years and then go and those credits all transfer and then go to a regular school I mean a four year school for two years to finish up or that kind of a thing\nCommunity college has a lot less expensive and you can get your basics out of the way for the first two years for a four year degree if you want to ... the second thing once you've determined what you want to do and how you're going to do it then the second thing you do is\nCollege cost is the number one cause of student loan that\nThey are and what I mean is that you can buy a Bentley or you can buy a used pickup truck\nBoth our transportation but one is several hundred thousand dollars and one is just a few hundred dollars\nBut both of you know the mall\nAnd and so if you if you don't have any money and you're saving up you can't afford a Bentley you can't afford to go to a super expensive college and there's nothing wrong with that by the way I didn't go to a super expensive college so you go to an end state school\nThere in Florida you go to University of Florida in Gainesville or you go to University of central Florida right there in Orlando a wonderful yeah one of ... wonderful both of them in state tuition not that expensive and uh that's thing one your college selection\nAs at the least expensive college that will help you get the degree that you need to get is what you need a mat\nWith rare exceptions and you're not going out of state and you're not going super expensive private the second thing is then you start looking for scholarships and you make scholarship hunting your full time job\nAfter school job that kind of a thing and you start applying foreign filling out the scholarship forms and riding the essays and you'd probably ask for a thousand scholarships and you'll probably get turned down for nine hundred and fifty of them but if you get fifty one thousand dollar scholarship she just went to school for ...\nThat'd be pretty cool not a bad part time job the third thing is planning on working a lot while you are in school don't borrow money so that you don't have to work work\nAnd get good jobs jobs that pay a lot dog walking cutting grass jobs people don't want to do what they pay a lot to do I'm not talking about minimum wage crap and if you're gonna live on campus go ahead and be an R. A. B. a residential advisor or written that's what they call it what is an R. A.\nHow it is there's a resident advisor okay so there you know the the babysitter in the dorm okay and uh you get free dorm for doing that and sometimes free tuition for doing that and sometimes free tuition free dorm and pay for doing that she'll be NRA if you're going to live on campus or\nCan the cafeteria get free food do you live on campus if you can get a job working for the university the tuition might be completely free\nAnd that might be different to something to look at it so that's the kind of stuff you look at but figure out where you're going what steps are to get their figure out the cheapest way to get their figure out scholarships or somebody pays you to get there and I'm planning on working your butt off\nAnd those things will get you through school completely debt free in this day and time and it can be done Alex is with us in Baltimore hey Alex welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nA Mr Ramsey how are you a thank you for everything that you do thank you a check on that can be a call and what you hear that one I Am debt free I won't baby step three or four or five months say about two months ago are my six months but here's my question and I work full time in a retail establishment\nOh we'll go ahead and pay the mortgage off or out on the rentals and our personal residents Emily is with us in Cincinnati Hi Emily how are you\nHow about yourself\nBetter than I deserve what's up\n[noise] um my husband and I we sold our house and purchased a a flash rental flash home we buy a horse farm and we are renting out the horse farm facility but living in the house\nAnd what we're renting out paying our mortgage mortgage is very large now and I'm kinda panicking about that 'cause I don't like that at all [laughter] and I had been to like he had a business and investment [noise]\nUm and I want to pay it off really act that we've heard of that we don't want to pay that off very it got to pay that that\n... I don't know I Wish I did my had been income\nPayroll down down it was so businesses should\nBe in that\nUm that people have told me that and I like I don't like that idea you know\nPeople are stupid [laughter] people don't listen to stoop ... stupid broke right now the best businesses in the world are dead free ones\nRight now and so I was one of his whole thing was paid off you know how much cash you'd be making oh my goodness gracious [laughter] 'cause I'm a show on this on this horse farm we have four hundred and thirty eight out in the news ... gracious\nAnd right it's worth over seven hundred may like seven fifty\nAnd what's your household income\nUm hundred nine and then we get five thousand dollars a month so I ran to the horse farm\nAnd wonder if they don't pay the rent\nOn now you have to even have to take 'em\nYeah you're screwed\nIn a ... yeah they don't pay the rent is what happens you have all year round to be scared you have a lot of risk here a lot of risk one tenant and if that one tenant doesn't pay it messes up your whole world\nThat's right that's called ultra high risk should you pay this off yes as soon as possible ladder salad one of the two this is an accident looking for a place to happen\nYou get out of this intact but I Would I Would do everything I can to reduce the debt as fast as I possibly could as quickly as you can get it paid off then then it's not a big deal if they don't pay the rent because you don't you know you don't fall over dead but financially\nGee I mean you take five thousand bucks a month out of your life you've got nothing left some bad bad situation so yeah you need to be scared you're smart to be scared and all these people will say you ought to keep that in the situation there what's known as stupid people a

something and so I Want to pay a little patience for money as I have to pay\nSo that I can buy something as soon as I can buy I mean you could go rent something really super nice a super expensive but it would mean you never buy some of your mom and super not buying right did you spend all your money on rent\nAnd you know that's a dumb idea obviously\nSo um I I Would be with whoever told you that

people but here's a traditionally encourage people to do\nBecause you don't currently have a yoga studio and you don't have any idea of validated\nI Want to challenge you to start a little bit smaller and a little sooner so I'll give you an example\nWhere is there a wellness center community center yoga studio ... studio somewhere where you could start your business sublease third base in their off our builds your brand builder demand you have no risk no overhead no upfront costs\nAnd you're able to validate your idea until the business justify you getting your own space be that a duplex that you live about or your own standalone space I'll give you an example there are a lot of churches that will operate when they're getting started out of elementary schools the elementary school right next door household they don't have school on Sundays so they rented out to a church that use it on Sunday\nAnd it's just a great deal to win when it's additional revenue for the school the church has a place to go without having to afford a whole building\nSeven days a week when they can't justify it and I've seen a lot of businesses do that so I don't think your ideas about an hour just down to just start smaller in sooner on a lower risk level lower costs level and validate your idea\nAnd build those relationships build your brand in your demand\nGet that going and then when you're ready to have your own studio it's the next logical step it doesn't feel like a terrifyingly so you never want to look into laws and regulations for liability but also when you think about your space before

launch but needs some advice from Christie we're here for you triple eight eight to five five two to five let's go to Katie who's on the line and St Paul Minnesota Katie how can we'll\nHi Kristin I'm honored to speak with you know ... hair or they might have army guy married no problem I married him three kids I work about four to five job primary in architecture field\nAnd ... and their primary breadwinner right now I'm very excited about what I Do my passion architecture and there had to quit my said yeah that and however I have no idea how long I care to keep up with this for about a year and half ... I've been working at about sixty hours a week our kids\nA lot for me 'cause they having you know a husband and family life you know what you'd recommend I can do I don't burn out but I you know on a cricketer actor singer and played architect yeah hopefully in the near future\nLet me ask you a couple of quick questions here um you know these hourly contract jobs four to five of them if I understood you correctly you got four to five that you're spending like plates all in architecture is that right\n... so whatever down on is a forty hour salary job or the other three are yeah contract project by project alley from here no long distance [laughter]\nOkay so the reason I'm asking this is it it it'll it'll color our advice a little bit ah what happens if you're back off do you have to work sixty hours to make a certain number for you all to be comfortable is that what your reality is [noise]\nSo right now yes my husband will be returning to work in that beginning of next year we decided to stay home we had a baby about a year and a half ago and so our financial situation will change at and kind of gang Uri but right now yeah kind of out of the beast at work I have to\nAnd just to clarify for Christian I the ideal dream is for you have your own architecture firms that right\nCorrect the only thought that was like\nOkay you want to know best path to get their correct okay I'm going to say one quick thing and let you go here's the deal hang on until the hubby gets back to you you know what I mean you got to hang on and you can do it here we are in October first years coming right now you have to do it so I think that motivation just hang in there and in Christ is going to were well known about the plan to get their\nQuick quick question Katie that contract jobs you're doing in addition to the fulltime salary job or those things you're running independently already or do they go through the main company that's paying your salary\nSo they're different companies okay yeah two of them are kind of action I own projects I work on out here in Minnesota the other one is there a company I used to work four years ago that your contract work for\nPerfect okay it's okay that yeah\nThe reason I'm asking is because when you go out on your own even if it's just getting that first client or two that can be the scariest part to validate can I Do it on my own and can I make the sale and can run this whole thing without having a boss that kind of backs me and you're already doing it and that's why I'm so excited in Haiti because you're just going to do more\nOf what you're already doing a little bit and just like Ken that\nYou've got this light at the end the tunnel when you're going to start increase your family household income in other ways to your husband\nBut in the meantime if you want to spend the next two to three months building up the demand to clients the relationship even just taking people to coffee starting to gather interests of other independent projects you could run on your own that could run through this new architecture firm that you're going to run as an independent person\nYou're building it up and of course it will be crazy for a season because you're getting more and more demand but then when you decide to leave your fulltime job it the next logical step where the business can support you the income is there of course that's only get help and your husband had income so you're all ready I Would say\nTo thirty percent down the path and doing this you're starting from scratch or not like I have full time job and I want to do this totally different thing how do I started at\nYou're already doing it you already have clients you're working with I just want you to do more of that and then the next few months as you build that up that will start to ramp up as your husband's income comes in and it looks like first year he probably should be able to comfortably leisure Labor Day job\nYeah and it comes down to a formula you gotta work days maybe step stays baby steps fund the dream so when you put enough money aside plus decide businesses there and then that's how you get to that number where you can step aside into Christie's point does not have to be a ... jump right it should be a nice move and it just takes a little bit of time and patience lays on her way\nInto the tunnel is an important point can cause so many people feel like how can I sustain this well you're not still January when you're that lie to the talent you know this is the first season him to put my head down for a season that man had the rewards and it's worth it things are\nAll right let's go to ray real quick in Orlando, Florida re how can we help\nHey how you doing guys I'm OK though I've been in the field for the past Eighteen years and ah I Love the field the tactics years I've been in the security um which I Love even more\nUm I feel I feel though where I'm at I'm Stuart or the next level to go off
