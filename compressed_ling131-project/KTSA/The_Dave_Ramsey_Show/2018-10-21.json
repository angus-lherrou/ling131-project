you were thinking we're in pretty good shape and then all of a sudden you retire and the bottom dropped out of the market that\nIs a challenge if you haven't made some adjustments in your portfolio work I Would imagine\nYeah definitely and and so one of the things that we talk about a lot with our clients is not just diversification but it's about rebalancing an understanding the what we call sequence risk and\nAs you know mark we have a TV show and and you if you don't\nHave a chance to catch it on TV we have it on our website at Texas financial advisor dot com but one of the segments on there is an absolute favorite segments because it talks about the sequence risk and that's taking money from your investment to live upon but not understanding how to appropriately allocate the investment\nBecause typically I'm investing\nThe way you were the the way you were when you were working doesn't work when you retire and I've had this discussion with people's time and time again they'll show the walking for their analysis and there'll be like well I think I'm doing pretty good my accounts average than eight percent return\nI heard that Dave Ramsey said that I should you know find something that's averaging uh twelve percent return so I'd probably go more aggressive and take out eight percent cash so\nI mean that is just a disaster waiting to happen right then and there because the point here is that even if you average ... percent return if we go back historically and we look at and say like the last Fifteen Years of those investments\nYou see that you you lost Seventeen at one point they went up twenty three it's a yo yo right and so I'm to be able to take out income systematically from an investment that's not geared towards income\nIt could definitely deplete that account really quickly so\nWhen we talk about sequence dress we're talking about timing the withdrawals not timing the market just timing the withdraws that the person takes to create the systematic in some plans for them and it's vitally important for a person to position their assets in such a way that it's going to help minimize the impact of any sort of sort of market downturn\nAnd how that would affect the overall assets that they've set aside for retirement and now to help minimize that risk your assets are going to be victimized by a plain old bad timing so\nThat's your financial future coming up short with your monthly income is not going to work it's not acceptable that as a sure fire way to have the anxiety and feel like you need to go back to work\nAnd so you just need the assurance that the sources that you're going to be drawn your income from such as your ... your Social Security number like that they're going to provide the means to to give you that lifestyle that you've desired throughout your entire retirement years so if you if you have a vision for your retirement\nIf you want to dictate how your future unfold rather than have it dictated to you you need a strategy for retirement\nThe first step here is to get a customized planned for you um this is what we call her TEFA financial freedom road map and this is a detailed analysis showing your entire income picture uncovering areas where there may be opportunity for your assets to generate income during retirement and and this is customize\nAnd it's going to help uncover areas where there's opportunity to help grow your retirement nest egg\nSo it provides enough income for you as long as you need it when you sit down with one of us we're going to provide you with an honest evaluation of how much you save for retirement\nA clear understanding of how much riskier assets are exposed to\nStrategies to help you reach your retirement goals and an idea of how much time you

Brooklyn is discussing things or you absolutely need to know before you make that decision to call ... had yourself into retirement the next item on and talk about there was a long way toward providing you with confidence as your retirement approaches\nTo stay with us a lot to get to this is from Texas financial advisory show would Brooklyn gender willy president and CEO of Texas might influence on you\nWere listening to a Chinese financial advisor in show on their retirements used that word\nI woke up one day and things were different it had been building up for a while I realized all the work I was doing all the money I was sitting all the decisions I was making was part of something bigger than just me and my wife [noise]\nMom and dad and now I'm doing the same thing they did back then\nI'll be applying for their kids their grandkids into our friend of mine\nI should my future family rude\nGeneration upon generation and God willing going for the same way\nAnd that's why I called Brooklyn tremor willing\nWe've got big plans she knows it's not my job a lot of the whole universe\nIs my job to wind up the little corner of the universe that belongs to me\nDo you have big things to do let's talk next in line Angela advisory aid for foreign aid three two Seventy four sixty nine and a four four three two Seventy four sixty nine more taxes financial advisor young I'm\nA\nFinancial advisor monument firemen were\nLooking back to the Texas financial advisor showing more returned my new working as always are pleased to Brooklyn Chandler Williams Texas financial advisory offices in San Antonio New Braunfels and Victoria\nIf you'd like to find out more about Brooklyn the team you want to find out about live educational that's what they put on from time to time throughout the area there is no cost to attend these you do have to sign up those seeding is limited all that information and more on the website Texas financial advisor ... dot com Texas financial advisory dot com we're talking about\nThings are you really need to know before you make the decision to head into retirement and you need to know these things we can have a better understanding of what's ahead and certainly we want you to be able to retire with confidence clarity and a lot of excitement is what was the idea behind this there are a lot of areas where you've got to have a plan to maybe handle some of these challenges that\nThat you may face in return we talked touched on healthcare long term care those kind of challenges what about the market's going up and down and yo yo in because that's what they do\nAnd don't get caught up in it's all about return in return but it's really about income in retirement she might have to change your focus a little bit on how your\nYou know preparing yourself for retirement Brooklyn certainly I guess you know can we talk about budgets on the show or spending plan I think you like to call it a spending plans debt but we need to kind of get an idea though about the size of our as a base if you will do\nAnd it's crucial to know the size of the asset based that you've built for retirement and whether that's adequate enough to produce enough income for you as long as you need it now\nUh persistence decades working ... earn and save enough money to call their own shots financially whether that means continuing to work because that's what they want to do are retiring to pursue other hobbies or other things such as traveling the world spending more time with their family\nDeveloping new law he's a lending time to the cause that you believe and I have a a client of mine who man she she is a fixture at the at the hospital and she holds babies and that is I mean she takes that job just as seriously as she did her executive position so\nIt which is awesome I mean she's causing such a great impact on those babies lives and so uh but that that's her passion and so she's able to do that obviously they don't pay her to hold the babies\nAnd money they pay her the other things right but she's able to do that because she was able to retire she had enough saved and she knows her income is sufficient enough to stay retired but\nYou're the possibilities are endless for that particular client because she had a plan so whatever your vision is for a time and whatever that happens to be much of this stuff you want to do obviously takes money then there's the expenses that you're going to have housing food transportation medical those things aren't going to go away\nOr it always makes me laugh when I meet with folks and they apologized to me about having a mortgage\nAnd I mean especially in this environment I don't care if you have a mortgage interest rates like two or three percent who cares it's like getting money for free from the bank but the point here is that even with you\nGet rid of the mortgage you still have taxes he's still you know says the insurance and a lot of times and because those continue to go up if he comes as much if not more than what your mortgage was back in the day so\nWe know that these expenses aren't going away but the question becomes heaviest save enough to cover those expenses including her heart expenses and your discretionary expenses\nOf course related to that do you know where your retirement paycheck is going to come from now that you're not working\nOr not working as much so did the assets that you've you've hopefully set aside for a time and have the Cape capacity\nTo provide the income level that you're going to need to cover your costs and do the things that you have long a long look forward to doing during retirement\nYou know Brooklyn there there's so many things that I think are really intriguing about what you do for your clients of Texas financial advisory because you've got to you touched on healthcare long term care that we got to have a plan and case because the number one reason the people that are retired file for bankruptcy typical user health care\nIssue you know somebody got sick and and all of a sudden the bills got overwhelming and certainly we've got to have a plan for that\nThe other part of this is we don't know are indeed we don't know our final down hurts my came in Brooklyn and said look I'm going to live for Twenty one years three months six weeks two days you could come up with a plan to make me get to that point we don't know what your point though so they're so such a challenge there\nIn our be somewhere at eight thirty or work those late nights so that is voluntary unemployment but in order to be hard to really unemployed you still\nHave to have an gun these they'll have expenses so that's what we want to help you make the right decision as you near retirement or even if you're already retired and you just don't feel confident in your income plan\nThat's what we want to sit down with you and and help you understand all of your options out there not just the cookie cutter models at the fire houses or the\nThe banks offer and the ... the other thing I see is people still leaving their money and a four O. one K. or their savings than let's say retire and what I Want to can cater convey to you is that those employer sponsored plans are for a while you're employed\nThey're not geared for people that are no longer contributing to those accounts again accumulation mode is much different from preservation and distribution mode\nSo this is something to kind of tucked away in the back of your head if especially if you're if you don't qualify just quite yet but most plans nowadays once you reach the ripe old age of fifty nine\nHalf and I you know that's kind of a magical age again it's all planned determined some folks are able to do this at fifty five or fifty two depending on you know where they're working or how long they've worked there but you can do what's called an in service roll over\nWhere you can take your retirement nest egg you haven't quit you haven't retired yet but you are going to preserve that no more ups and downs you want to roll it out into a self directed IRA\nAnd make the decisions on how you invest it from there and in service roll over doesn't count as any sort of taxable and ten keeps it tax sheltered but it but it does provide a world of opportunity to you\nLet's say it makes sense to start converting that too\nRoss IRA you couldn't do that while I was still at the custodian and the four oh one K. but now we can work on converting it so that you have\nTax exempt or tax free income in retirement\nWhat if you don't like all the funds that send your four one K. because that's what the employer and the custodian picked out for you again there's thousands and thousands probably millions of investment options out there that might be a better fit for you than what just your four one K. offers\nUm and so again that interests distribution becomes one of the first stepping stones to getting prepared for retirement to give you kind of an idea what your home stretch gonna look like how much more you need to save\nSo if you think about that in service roar of your four one K. you are still working you are still contributing to your four one K. you're just taking a portion out to get a better place better ... better ... better area for your retirement so it's actually working for you we know that for one case can be really good and certainly since two thousand nine the mortgage and doing nothing but do up basically\nTo should have been doing well but you probably haven't been getting all of the upside because that's not how things work because you got to balance against the downside city don't go fifty percent up sixty percent down or you know you've got to be kind of in the middle a little bit so you can take that into rivers roll over and then have a little bit more control Brooklyn can help you were to place\nAnd a lot depends on what what's your story in your place of employment allows you to do if you like to find out more about that they'll never heard about hey I'm Still working I'm sixty years old I'm a retired sixty five but I can go and take some mine for Ontario and put it in a better place for myself and my family\nThis is a great opportunity so now in Brooklyn to learn more aid for four three two\nSeventy four sixty nine there is no cause for this just a chance for you to sit down and chat with Brooklyn to learn more aid for for a three to Seventy four sixty nine so let's say you know we're doing all the stuff you're talking about Brooklyn I'm getting ready to start my retirement date I'm getting closer and closer all the time and I'm going I'm not sure really have enough\nIncome coming in to replace those projects in an alarm are coming in once I get tired [noise] what do we need to know about guaranteed sources of income certainly Social Security would be one of those penchant for lucky enough to have one but they're not a lot of areas where we can get guaranteed source of income or other\nWell guaranteed sources of income is not something that a lot of people have in place before they come see us because again as I've mentioned time and time again tensions are a thing of the past and so they're having\nTo figure out ways to create their own pension in a way that they can have a stream of income for either five years ten years Twenty years whatever it is for each client in order to have that reliable income stream something that I've kind of seen a shift and this is interesting mark is a lot of my entrepreneur is my business owners\nWhen the the market's been good and the time it's been good and and their business in the last say five years\nA lot of them are harvesting those gains and you know just walking in their principal and going into an annuity\nThat is going to be a pension for them either I've got one lawyer that actually turned it on right now because as you know a lot of times with with attorneys and other self employed folks they don't have a reoccurring revenue\nAnd so and I have an attorney that does a personal injury attorney and he got a large settlement and took that settlement and instead of worrying about the ebbs and flows of income month after month he bought an immediate annuity\nNow this annuity he still owns it hasn't lost control of the principal isn't lost control of the investment\nIf he dies his spouse either can get the income stream or take the money out lump sum but the point here is that he wakes up January first of every year not worried about his business and one income it's going to bring in and when the case is going to close and when the personal injury insurance is going to pay him\nBecause he knows that that ... going to pay him five grand on the first at every single month for the rest of his life\nSo that's what the annuity can do for you once you're retired but also while you're still working so even if you looked at it in the past or you sit there and you have in your head with my grandma had an annuity I'm not you know I don't want to be like my grandma\nOn these insurance products have advanced and they have over the last eleven years of doing that of all the investment vehicles out there they have made the most transformation because\nWho has the most money in this right now in this economy it's the insurance companies and so they are trying to attract\nMoney from those baby boomers we have ten thousand baby boomers\nRetiring every single day and so they're all walking away with you know sizable nest eggs from their retirement accounts and looking for somewhere to put it that it can be safe and provide them income and so in order to attract those dollars they've made a lot of revisions to their products in order to\nReally be a very mutually beneficial relationship and so\nWe do use those types of of vehicles for clients in order to create a pension plans and provide that income for them either again like my my lawyer client that he's taking it right now but some votes me to want to just wait until they go into retirement so\nAnnuities as much as it kind of tossed around out there that are bad or good you know really it just depends on the person right and I have an annuity my parents have an ... does that mean that everyone should have won no but they could be good for the right person for the right reason\nAnd mainly that reason as to solidify your income\nDuring retirement and which type of annuities the right thing for you I don't know and and if you try and go Google it and figure it out for yourself\nYou will be Google's slapped because there's I mean at last\nLook I mean I think there's like five billion pages of annuity information out there so uh it's kinda hard to seek out on your own what I Do encourage you to do instead of going to an annuity only\nA ... percent is to work with someone like are from here at Texas ranch advisory who's a fiduciary we represent multiple investment vehicles not just a new disease and we also represents\nLots and lots of different individual companies so we can go out there and find the best that for you because as a fiduciary asked to do with you and your best interests so I just find that it's critical though that you find that independent guidance from a trusted professional whether it's our from here at Texas ranch advisory\nOr the right advisor for you but it does make sense to\nUse an advisor in the situation so in order to create your own TSA financial fame roadmap give us a call here at a four four\nTEFA show that's a for for a three to Seventy four sixty nine and never hurts you get a fresh perspective on your retirement needs and how an annuity may or may not help that so give us a call here at a for for a three to Seventy four sixty nine\n... will use the president and CEO of Texas financial advisors started a company in January of two thousand eight of courses Brooklyn and said you can always go to the website to find

shift and you've touched on that little bit earlier as well you know or financial mindset\nIs not that we have to get rid of all risk we gotta make sure that we do have some safety and our portfolio certainly not all about are average return it's about\nThe real return and what do we need to live month after month so there is a financial mind shift a shift from our working years to our retirement years and there's also a social impact as well because we're all going to work with our habits are different now we're not getting up and we have to be the opposite eight or nine or whatever it is you

com\nOr the journal Williams the president and CEO of touch with financial advisors started her\nCompany back in January of two thousand eight officers now in San Antonio the Broncos and Victoria ... we're talking about things you need to do before you make a decision to retire and so really number one Brooklyn I think he I think it's safe to say that you need to know that you are on the right track financially to retire\nBut another big part of that is especially if you're like man you don't work in the financial great opportunity to talk with Brooklyn every week on this program and I'm fifty eight so in theory I should know a lot of this well I don't love the opportunity to listen to Brooklyn to talk about the things that I can tell when it comes to my retirement\nBut at the end of the day Brooklyn really this is where you come in and the team of Texas financial advisory your focus is on retirement planning and strategizing\nFor your clients to see where they are in five years ten years Twenty years Thirty years down the road it's not just the Brooklyn tries to sell you something and that's the end of the deal this is a long term relationship Brooklyn because we need somebody that we can you trust that actually works in a retirement world to help guide us right\nYeah and you know it's interesting that this shift you know getting up and gain that since January two thousand eight and you know I'd say probably at the beginning of my career the majority of my clients were sixty five Seventy five eighty but we've got clients across the board because we've got folks that are in their forties that have\nLearned from their parents mistakes that they don't want to repeat and so the ... whether you're forty or sixty is how do I walk away from his paycheck have financial peace of mind financial freedom and be able to live off of my assets and not run out and so\nWe do have clients across the spectrum because they know that's where we're ending up so we can help guide them and some clients that maybe came to us that are\nYou know just not the right fit for what we offer were able to steer them in the right direction so that they can go to the right it by there for them and then maybe they will once it's the right time come back to us so the key here though is ... based upon your situation\nAnd we've seen quite at that and so it would take I mean it would take a lot to shock the that we're able to customize a program just for you that can also be flexible\nBecause what we do today may need to be changed three years five years down the road we understand that so if he liked\nThe opportunity to see what that looks like right how do you even know if you need it without sitting down with myself one of my if I didn't hear it has the same size

I think you've touched on two ups a couple of times now and maybe you're listening for the first time and you're wondering what what is a tune out\nMaybe ever turn Tony a humane society of their news\nFrom contests and more\nVisual mainly for more\nDetails or to sign up for that\nMoney\nYou're listening to the roof it now to to show with your host swing sharpening fears going\nThis way and hair with a tour\n[noise] so uh this winter and by the uh people the audio is also true that little bit about ... a background in ... so if anybody does have any questions or they can call in heaven\nKnows is came from the insurance industry and as a been doing this for how many years of it\nOr was that us aid for over eleven years\n... years so you know so he's real good if they said they might have hail or what should you do if you think you have a tail a that's a pretty simple answer I think I've it right\nBut yeah so whenever you feel that you have storm damage especially a storm damage a a corner rents that we're looking after him last uh April May hit around the Congress area um we're looking at the civil area shirts\nEr yeah everyone knows that in that area as far as libel that they they they did get some how um but we did get a lot of wind damage as well so if you especially if you have a leak after that storm happened\nGive us a call two one zero four or five for twenty four hundred we our roof fix ... it's the best time to call just to get a simple Ruth inspection you know especially if you have a leak in the house I Will tell you if your roof is maybe five ten years old and you have a leak it's worth the shot to call us and take a let us take a look at it\nAnd do spring lake you know a high rate and coming so out of anybody that has had the reverse effect that\nHas a concern or just give us a call you know I won't come out there and we'll give you a free the obligation that's been a while to give you a thorough inspection or call us up two one zero four or five for twenty four hundred miles already callers I have any questions I Want to cause your studio\nA word answer the questions are\nWe are talking about customer service of a sudden the difference as a customer service that makes us different than a lot of other companies\nThat might not provide the services that we do um but uh anyway you can call us up two one zero five nine nine fifty five fifty five\nYeah one of the questions that uh we're getting um pretty often especially right now is how\nUm customers worried about worried about the quality of work and how how do we guarantee that the installation process will be excellent that's a great question we get we get that question pretty often because\nAnd the reason why we get that question is because\nYou maybe maybe you see some roofing companies that are you know are working on the job and then you see different roofing companies working together and you're trying to figure out who which roofing company did they use actually to get the job done you know sometimes they do sub contractor work\nUh for us we use the same installation team or to make sure not only that the installation of your roof is a is great and got a good quality job\nBut think about this way we're gonna warranty we offered the best warranties and and the ... in town and the reason why we offer the best warranties is based on our installation process because guess what\nEvery job that we do we turn into these single manufacture to validate the warranty to give you that lifetime warranty that you know a lot of lottery thing companies promised that that it doesn't often works is simply because Amy maybe a company goes out of business in the next\nTwo years earlier GIF Terry you have to be certified master elite contractor to be able to offer the warmth as we offer that the benefactors backing up\nWell let me ask you this or doing so what if I was a company and uh I offered you a a a lifetime warranty and I wasn't a master early let's just am just normal roofing company and I I did your roof and I'm Out of business in a year what warranty do you have left\nAbout ... that's what we see a lot of of being you know the better Business Bureau ... said that I\nHad put out a report recently I was like Ninety six percent of these roofing contractors\nAre going out of business within five years you know so you know usually that's the time they get out of a house storm don't know how to stay busy go broke or you know just you know and most of these are held shows or a storm chasers out there\nI mean they have good intentions yeah say hey here's a kind of an opportunity to build a business and make money but you know you see it all the time the guy had on Iran\nYeah but you know and and you see the vehicles that all of a change in their signs all over the place for them they're gone right\nYeah they use the same you know it's easy to buy a two and a phone number it's easy to you know by space in at a at a in San Antonio and say hey you know what I'm local\nThat there's a lot of good companies out there and the you know we're not we're not beaten up on roofing companies sure we'll just well we just know that we were in the number one complaint industry you know our numbers are held against us so to say about you know lighten our industry you know we just we have to dig through a lot of courage to get up there because\nYou know we had a ... was it thirty five thousand complaints consumer complaints that the BBC and the roofing industry and uh I mean the U.S is stagnating number you know the car industry used cars that they've done a great job changing their numbers around for sure but they were like sixty nine hundred\nA complaint for the year so you know we're the number one complaint industry so what we're just trying to educate customers is\nYou know when it comes to your roof go with a thoroughbred go with a company that's been around the nails so\nLet me ask you this question drains Dwayne since where a master elite roofing company let's just say you got roof fixed into your work and let's just you know heaven forbid we got a business but let's just say hypothetically we want to go out of business in five years would you still have that warranty if you use ... and how to master elite\nWell you know that's great and that is correct that are there for probably want me to correct as you go to a little bit as a as a I have to be a part of the bass Charlie\nI mean you know you got to run a strict regiment with them and just stay qualified this is not a program that you just\nYou won the prize at the end it's a continuous workout and staying ... are you guys got to be certified to put the product on a so there's constant work going on with that and one of the things that's really important is your financials you know they just won't give this guy to\nProgram the only the top two percent contractors of North America has ever been honored and uh you know they just don't give it a program about very simple so\nBut if for some crazy a vet that did happen or you could say that the warranty would be picked up by J. F. that to you know the golden pledged program yeah ah we have silver we have so we have about three warranty tiers\nDepending on what kind of coverage because yeah we do understand you investors ... out there are interested in my lifetime wanting to get a home sold so you want to maybe take a lesser ... program we do have we do have different market programs for everybody's situation\nAnd and just said ... reiterate this so since we're a master league contractor if we were to offer you the golden pledge warranty\nAnd let's just say we weren't to go out of business you're golden pledge warranty will not go away because it's backed GS and that's what separates roof fix from every other company is because we're a master elite contractor so we're able to offer the best one or\nKnow we're going to bring J. F. on the show one of the area\nUps are here a few weeks but um you know I'm One of the things why we chose G. A. F. too is\nThere one of the largest manufacturers of North America is hell does command we don't get any type of shingles shortage so we're able to serve our customers faster or they have just the durability of the warranty and the programs within Jay you have to separate ourselves from all the other contractors\nAre really helps us Stay competitive\nAnd so we're really awarded for our good works and uh you know what that go back to a customer service also one of the things that I can say is you know how do you do what's going on while we document we photo document each stage of the roofing job and we send them to our homeowners\nEvery day by email and I also they can check back with the a supervisor or the project manager of the job during the job process there always kept in the loop and communication is where we really shy but one of the things I Do really think that's made of\nWhere we get those pictures\nEvidence call and ms talking about something he sees other pitcher because us up because\nYou know we're all reviewing the pictures when they come in all the way down to my office we see every job that's being produced every day and we can check the pictures and you guys are keeping up with the details of your customers on every job why there'd be Iran and that's\nThat's exciting because you know I grew up in the home improvement industry third generation and uh it wasn't always like that you know once the cells guy sold a job you never saw him again and I think you guys make an impact the quality of\nThe relationship with our customers so well\nYeah our imprint are imprint to a customer is a second and simply because they know that when we go to their house for not just a sales guy you know we want to build a relationship with a customer to let them know during\nThis process I Will tell them during this process at any time there's a disconnect on communication or customer service you let me know right away because ultimately this is the reason why we're the number one rated ripping company and", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "city": "San Antonio", "day": "21"}
