you a unable to discern truth or some sympathize with assault victims only being white\nDisabled you in that area Rudy but um have you you kind of asked me to you kind of asked me to questions you asked me the personal one and then you asked me about the committee so let let me tell you how I've answered the personal one because this has been asked to me before\nUm if Christine Ford was my daughter or my daughter had a story like that as her father\nI wouldn't be leave her and I would wonder why she didn't tell me or why we didn't report it\nUm if she then wanted to know why people did not believe her\nI Would tell her the truth which is that if you do wait that long and if you don't have evidence it is natural that people would not believe you or would at least be skeptical that's not a you know that's not unusual so the fact that I Would believe her 'cause she's my daughter\nIs not gonna be the same way the rest of the world will hear her story or believe it does that make sense\nRight yes it does and as far as the committee I don't I'm Sorry I don't get the connection between uh the the members of the committee being wife's\nWhite men are no more rapacious and maybe arguably less so than any other group you could come up with in the world so I don't know why white men are are not fit to be on that committee\nToday it would have been out of the more the better if they had at least one or two women senators on it but\nThere were women on the committee on with corn ... those guys\nI'm Sorry we're we watch them the same community I saw a number of women on the committee\nYeah I mean I got up this oh why you know but I got up to stoke yeah but what the actual and Janet ...\nWell ... the committee's about twenty five twenty four twenty five people I'm\nA ... it's not ten people the Republicans were men the Democrats had men and women but that's just true of the Senate in general most of the women in the Senate our ... our our uh our Democrats that's why that is\nWell I just take a you guys are overlooking the fact you know here's the lady was a doctor I mean I was shake it up so that I\nKnow and the doctors don't doctors don't lie yellow light doctors please everybody that I\nSold them why are you asking me why would she lie\nWhat she I mean what she had a gay she'd already got how do we know she's lying\nWell she's either they'd be cabinet\nWell ... isn't isn't believing cabin on not necessarily a saying that she's lying because isn't it possible that she was assaulted but he isn't the one who assaulted her\nWell it's a that's what John said who is there a way you I don't know I mean come on\nYou know it really I I feel like I'm I don't know I feel like in good faith I've answer your questions you just keep moving the goalposts on me but I don't know what to say I'm Sorry you didn't like the way it went down but um I I the part of the part of this that will always bothered me um and I've yet to hear and I'm not putting it all on Rudy Rudy is not the only one to say that\nI I really would like somebody to clear this up for me once and for all\nWhite is bringing up whiteness disqualify people from just about anything and everything\nThese days\nOh well it's a bunch of white people it was done by white people though there are our founders were a bunch of white people the Senate Republicans are white people I mean I get it if you feel that it's time for a variety and diversity okay but but what is\nThis sudden lack of fitness on the part of white people I mean you can air brush our history all you want but white people were a big part of it and also a big part of the presents and I don't know if we're really interested in diversity it seems like that would include\nWhite people not speak of every one bus white people does that make sense I I don't get the\nAnd I and again I'm not putting it all and Rudy ... shoulders a lot of people have made that objection about the Judiciary Committee I I'm sure in the years to come the Senate will look more and more like the United states in terms of diversity it just hasn't gotten there yet and that's a function of who runs for office more than\nReally

counties down let's zeroed doesn't screw my cat three two one well\n\nOh that is not like\nThere's nothing like that\nWow I think about it I think about it if you had been married three years and you had no I\nWish I wish I wish I wish it took me a long time to figure this out I was a smart enough to figure it out as early as they did well do I wasn't either I'm fifty six\nOh no one in three fifty nine so you might as well\nYou might as well be free you might as well make the decision when are you going to make the decision you're most powerful wealth building tool is your income when you spend the\nAverage car payment which has five hundred and six dollars over eighty four months right now according the national auto Dealers Association when you spend the average car payment\nInstead of spending it on a ... car pay cash for your cars isn't what rich people do pay cash for your\nCars is what's rich people do I put guys from our cars rich people no darling you will be rich people when you start paying cash for your cars maiming you drive drunk for a little while and then drive a little better gotten a little better do you move up but right now we're going to pay cash and instead of putting five hundred dollars towards\nThe prosperity Ford Motor credit and put it towards your prosperity and if you pay five hundred and six dollars an hour for hours you put a mutual fund and your Roth IRAs got a good track record from age thirty age seven to you'll have between five and six million dollars\nIn that account touchdown hope Iraq the car driving\nA problem in our car raise your hand if you don't have the power and our car payment that's what you're driving\nOr don't lose too attrition each year\nUm and that persistence rate and the size of the book of business creates a certain amount of cash flow generally speaking the net profit after everyone including the owner that's operating a business have been paid the net profit the taxable income of the business\nTimes for or maybe times five is a small business equation on insurance industry it might be different than that I don't know but what what is the net profit if you were running this thing after you pay you a salary\nI'm supposed to leave for what I have a God or it can how can\nYou would make three hundred ten thousand dollars in the first year\nApparently a profit I don't have access to the book yeah profit\nOut after the rent is paid the secretary is paid every body I paint\nAt their payroll after and re after ... after insurance oh\nWell that's not a bad price on a business if you can pay it all back in two years in\n\nLA kind of chickens have out here\nWell if you if you're only paying six fifty four it was sixty five thousand down and you make three Dan\nYou live on nothing you pay it all back\nI think I can tell you\nOh okay well then it takes three years yeah All right but uh that's that's about what I'm Talking about then it sounds like it sounds like there in about four times the net profit but there's that too and does not include having paid you\nAnd so there are a lot of four factor that's a fairly normal appraisal right so they're not ripping you off on the price of a but I Would not going to have to do it I Would start you're on\nTalk and then when you go make a bunch of money in your own if you want to add to your own about buying out another practice you could save up the money and do that is if you are making two ten enter every three years you could save up and buy a business it's worth six hundred right\nRight and so I mean that's pretty cool we can do that later and add to your book of business by buying out other agencies are by buying out other stand alone but I I Can't recommend I personally wouldn't do it if I was twenty five years old if I was forty five years older than I was fifty voters will I personally wouldn't do that um I Would start\nMy own and got it out I did that with this business we started on a card table my living room we've

Would love to can while I Know a guy I'll get Jim awesome sold out but I can get you in we'll get your tickets so you're here to know your debt prescribe I Am a lot about how much have you paid off thirty one thousand seven hundred dollars some bright love it\nAnd how long did this take it took three years almost to the days since I started the financial be very good and you're ranger income during that time about forty seven thousand two fifty thousand good what are you doing I'm by day I'm tech support at travel and expand software\nAnd by nights and weekends I work in the film industry mostly doing onset audio on but in other things to find good for you very cool what kind of that was the thirty two thousand\nIt was mostly student loans but then also a a car loan and a car repair loans\nTo gotcha okay so you're a single guy making forty seven thousand pay off thirty two thousand and three years which is a you know basically a thousand bucks a month give or take during that time average and uh that's the that's really watching what you're doing you rush to catch\nOn the whole thing yes it was it was a very tight ... when I was a at least at the beginning stages I figured it out that um if if I budgeted everything out and all of just the basic bills in food and gas I had about forty dollars left over for months while do it was it was typed\nUp some extra jobs and that helped but you're over ... got a little bit out of film but some doesn't pay too much [laughter] okay good deal good deal so three years ago you said you started financial position rusty how there's no journey again other than that I'm\nKind of a story well first of all my sister who is here um I did uh did your program into their debt free scream and that's how I first heard about you and I was and so I learned some of it by us most is kind of but I also we're like oh that's good enough I got it um which wasn't smart or\nUm so then it was in twenty four teen which is when I moved sixty miles away from home just getting by myself to an apartment a sign a release everything figured out everything was good and\nI had to move on the seventh of August and the third of August my car broke down completely engine died everything is done wow and so I'm like I Need to move I Need to move now I have no way to get there in a way to get my job when I get there don't know anybody up there\nUm so I was just ran out and bought a car and I end up to that point I'd been\nSmart and only buying a cash ... using cash for cars but at this point I was like\nEvery time I get breaks down in a year I'm tired of holy impulse yes and I like I was just like that kind of looks nice I'm going to get that one [laughter] I paid too much for it I'm pretty sure and um and so\nBut of course I'd already signed a lease so that was something I hadn't taken into account right and so moved up there and about four months later my that car the engine fried broke down the exact reason that I bought a new car is what happened\nAnd so it took out a car repair alone and um because I was like I'm not like oh this guy just got a four months ago I'm going to keep it\nAnd um so yeah so replacing the engine at that point in time it was like there was I was over drafting it was it was it was bad um and because I wasn't budgeting and um I think I don't know if it was for moving gift or for worse or um\nOr for a Christmas gift from corney gave me a a a box for financial peace but I was still stubborn I'm so like I put it on my dresser and I'm like I I'll probably do that I don't like it to sleep in the same room with a box it'll be just going to actually learn it you know by us most is\nAnd um it it didn't I didn't [laughter] so um I was still over drafting and actually it was I Believe it was April twenty Fifteen when she came up just to stay over my apartment so she could fly out of Minneapolis to do that free scream\nAnd I'm like she knows my situation\nAnd she ... she will see that on open box as you will give me a lot of crap because she knows and I can't have that that's a good sister rules are exactly so I'm like before she gets here I'm signing up for a class and that was the motivating factors are highly got it so I asked her false rightful only\nOne way to do her debt free scream you get shamed and the process they causes you to be here to there your debt free sharing back to work and I'll take it that work such good family stuff right there\nAnd I should say it ends up being a pretty good book into because I went out of them got out of debt and this last April and um the singles at my church decided to go on this big trip to Montana\nAnd I am I the same vehicle that I got replaced um you know the engine replaced\nIsn't SUB so I'm like I'll get I'll take everybody you know I can put a bunch of stuff in their own I thought I Would uh on I'll take it in for a ... you see with this current I take it in for just a quick all change and turned out before I go and they say oh you're about to blow a tie rotting some other things that's about a thousand bucks and as minor okay thanks\nAnd so I just do that and then I go on to the Montana trip come back and\nCame back in ... and uh my Lehman was also all of the\nTires were were just shredded and there are other things wrong so in a five week period I had twenty three hundred dollars\nWith a hari pairs plus a vacation and I was able to cash flow the whole thing but given the amount of you're not broken you're going to pay for you know ... that's the that's a good laugh when you do not have liquid cars you know [laughter] well I'm ... now what do you sell people the key to getting out of debt is\nYou you really you have to make sure you have to want to do it you know you have to\nYou know you can't just and actually you can't just sort of want to you it has to be the motivating passion for a while 'cause I was like the only thing I could think about for gamers I've got to get out of ... yeah yeah [noise] so um\nIt was obvious your ... your ... was a big cheerleader ... who who were the other cheerleaders\nMy my parents are good cheerleaders yeah and um there was primarily that yeah and um\nOf course a lot of uh people from my church or on the board to on board to ... you know this is my ... and I know that gang they you get tight knit and those classes don't you ... yeah I'll get up and [laughter] that's good stuff so mom and dad's sister financial piece of church all life's good man\nYeah very very many people say you were crazy\nNot at the beginning at the beginning again I was so broad there is like yeah do whatever to get there so you can actually may buy things\nUm but it wasn't until the very end where it was like OK I paid out everything I'm cutting out credit cards I don't want to credit score and said no that's wrong ... anniversary with you know and it was yeah I ... once you start winning then they start wondering yeah yeah like well you need a credit score knew we don't [laughter] I really don't or so ago\nCarbon proud of your man congratulations ... very very well now how old are you thirty All right very good how's your field I have no pay much\nIs it feels so good I've I've had several times since then where I you know just make a payment of ... and I realize you know a few months ago that would have broken me for the entire month and now I can just I Need that night budget and I buy it and and it's good you know it's so it's so liberating thinking back I there's a\nCompletely different way to live absolutely very very well done\nWe've got a copy of Chris ... book for you retire inspiring to you know that's the next chapter in your story to be a millionaire now and you are on your way you know how to do it and you'll be there and you're going to be outrageously generous as you go along you know God owns the money you learn that at the church abs inland or sugar addicted to manage it well I'm proud of you sir very very well done\nWe're not going to issue it and so that'll get you into a mass ... and so you know I Would want if uh\nYou I Want to prove to myself that I'm not going to do this up and that's what I'm telling you to do a is or go to the non classes in nine weeks\nAnd then stay you can watch the videos and you can go on keep going you go to the legacy journey class online\nOr you can you can get into groups on line and say you know should continue the discussion with the tribe and talking about it you got every dollar plus connecting to your bank on line and that's there with you for a year I'm giving you every bit of that um we sell all that for a hundred and twenty nine dollars just about five hundred dollars worth of stuff though\nAnd it's a really really really incredible value and uh it's all a church and we want you to take care of it all we ask is is that you follow the stuff both of you plug into this\nAnd some day when you're doing really good find a guy who um feels like a product and you help him out and that's all ask you to do things for the call Megan is in Chicago Hi Megan welcome to the Dave Ramsey Shia\nHi Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\nI'm I Am a ... forgive me for my ignorance um [laughter] I Am on baby step to we have our um housing our savings that are currently working on our debt we have about thirty four thousand dollars I mean that includes our car if\nWe do not have a mortgage we currently rank now my question as\nWe're going to have it paid off in the next few years maybe even a year right now we have a plan that we wanted to take our children into an RV for about two years and travel the country um however we would have to\nFinance ticket Harvey and something to tell us where we feel like kind of have to ask her kids are getting older I'm terribly would\nNot like to wait if possible but I just wanted to see what your advice for America would be\nSo neat dream I like having the dream cool very cool well I'm not going to I don't tell people to borrow money because every time I find people borrowing money I'll find broke people\nRight and um and if you borrow on something that goes down in value as fast as an RV does I'm going to find really broke people have\nYou ever tried to sell used RV and seen other people are I mean most jak possible to get rid of them are they're hard to get financing on and they go down in value faster than almost anything what wheels motors they are mathematically horrendous\nOr they're just a mess and so um the other the other one is a big a medium sized boat if you get a hundred million dollar boat you can get financing on it and if you get a cheap ... you can get financing on it but the middle range of boats the fifty two hundred and fifty thousand is a difficult product\nAnd uh so you just about have to have the money to just consume it and be able to afford it so what I Would tell you what's your household income\nI'm sixty thousand\nTimes I Would get myself out of debt I'd worked extra jobs and then I Would save up and pay cash for\nAn RV that would um that would suffice for the two year period of time and then if you saw it somewhat of a lost at least you got you know what I mean dead on it and you don't get caught in it it's not a problem it doesn't ruin your life going forward because if you take a wonderful dream like you have and you finance it you're going to turn it\nInto a nightmare right it's going to cause a problem for your family 'cause I mean you put a hundred grand in an RV but at the time you get home is worth fifty right\nAnd you're going to be stuck in a wing all that money and you know you're going to mess up your kid's college plan you're going to mess up your retirement I mean it it could be disastrous if you do this wrong and so what I Do save up and buy one or to look for a program where you can rent one for two years if we can do that for two years and just turn it back in\nA doubt there is one there probably is very very expensive I Know you can rent them short term for the weekend and those aren't bad deals but a two year plan is a different\nUm and when you add all of this up it might be that you guys could stay in your you could travel in your car um or your SUV or whatever it is you own and stay in hotels cheaper by the time you add it all up\nBecause you're going to lose so much money on this transaction and again I'm not trying to ruin your dream I just don't want you going to be a nightmare so do it with no debt you do it used to\nAnd um and do some mathematical analysis on it and you got some nights to do that while you're working to get your other debts paid off right now\nAnd then if you want to say about fifty grand and buy a three year old or a two year old hundred grand thing or something and and then it becomes more twenty five by the time you get home I'm going to be mad at you for that that doesn't ruin your life\nBut if you if you just go write a check and finance something you're going to be in a mess kiddo and I don't want that for you I Want you to win a thanks for the call\nWell was fourteen almost Fifteen million of you listening each week we know how

I'm going to be paid off\nSeventy five thousand\nHow long did this take about Seventeen months good for you wherever you go ahead we were doing the uh pay the bare minimum up until we took the financial peace university and then that kicked it into overdrive few another very cool and a range of income during the Seventeen months honored and then I went to a hundred and thirty where to go and what are you guys do for a living\nWhere everybody entails he's in in the dental industry and I'm In the oil and gas industry oh\nGreat ... very cool good for you guys what kind of that was the Seventy five kc\nIt was a combination mainly all student student debt a student loan debt and then we also had a car note that we we had one year left and we paid it off in three months\n[laughter] alright knocked it out okay so you're going along and are paying on ... and just kind of living life normal it sounds like ... and then Seventeen months ago you got into an attribution virtually in that's cause you to push the pedal on down to the floor and get going under ... started that how did you end up in clients\nWell her uh her uncle actually was hosting a financial peace university class and he tried to get us over to his but they were about forty five minutes from us and we decided well we'll just looking for one locally and we found one at our local parish which was a mile down the road so we couldn't say no to that and\nI I basically had to track him to class now are\nThe truth from okay whose article you're out and it's my uncle or oh okay got you started but then yeah Browne one close by so he's got no excuse me ...\nNow and my brother and sister in law are somewhat in the course of that kind of not invade us none of us as well\nTo go through the same parachute into Iran ... okay All right so everybody's in different places but going through the same time Anton ... very very cool or on the I'll be like you I'd be like you want to do other than a show how did you talk into going\nAnd it's like you know I think I really thought we needed a third party and kitchen all you want to talk about ways paying off our school debt bang I\nHe thought he knew how to get fat and and it's hard to stay here when he had to say about it and how he met that I needed a third party just to get to get him to class with me I just needed to hear\nLike you you know speak to him\nIn a plan that you both can agree on yeah it's you know you know and you're both in sales and mom I been in sales my whole life and one thing about so people as we always think we're getting out earners stupidity\nLike it would just make a little more it'll be okay yeah 'cause you know you'd make a little more with yourself you know I just got to make a lot more out there in four years of my income will go up and my dad would go up and it was just like I had to change something so so Ronnie or what did she say the talked you into going\nNo one thing she just said hey we've got to get on the right page where we were both on opposite opposite ends of the spectrum ... you know she was a spender how is the ... and I knew how to develop spreadsheets but I didn't really know how to go about paying this\nAll off ... in some strategy and you know that's something you could buy into yeah it'll be on the same page beyond the same page as a big deal\nYou know when we first got married day we we were all about buying a house and we got married and twenty sixteen ... and where we were looking at houses were ready to buy and then we realize we're up to dinner eyeballs I Can't even afford it\nAt all [laughter] it's a shock yeah so we got to do something to do something okay so the spreadsheet nerd who needed a strategy goes to the clash and what did you come out with Ronnie where you were how what light bulb moment that you have a ha moment where you want oh\nYou know David it's amazing when you go to this clash you it's a big support group that I think everybody really needs to be a part of and\n'cause we we lived in a very high end area and it was just amazing how much debt everybody had\nAnd were like wow like ... you know there's a big support group and you know this is a great way would start with the baby steps mhm and we did that we had a bunch of savings saved up and we used a lot of that just Kickstarter bizarro intensity and it really helps how much uh we had about ten thousand and so\nThat was hard for a nerd was right that check out and clean out the guy\nWho\nTakes your breath away so Veronica spender goes to clash you wanted to go to class but then you get in there and there had to be a moment where you go and measure I liked dish\nWell it wasn't so much that I didn't like it I just I felt like I Need and like I said strategies to help me 'cause I I didn't want to be in that either I just felt like there is just a huge cloud ever asked him all the time and what was your\nBiggest takeaway ban where you went aha I see that now\nEverything about ways I asked him honestly and I think it lays realizing our roles and and my pain dean thing or that he is and then me and just coming to my senses and saying you know is is\nIs this material things something that I really need to ... and I'm using the ... system really helped me\nAnd and that's how our budget and\nThis is the amount of money we need to pay for groceries and says you know this is how much we we can get to the church and it's just how much we can give people forget and what not and so I just needed to lay out and once we implemented those stats I you know we're just like yeah\nI'm a little bit like Rachel Richard ... is that a budget is permission to spend\nI Love your daughter yeah if permission to spend okay yeah yeah and that's exactly what it is I\nNever sometimes when I just felt like we didn't have any money and that reminds that I had to get myself in okay we don't have money for that but you know it's there and we want it ... you know when I'm In central budget\nBut once I started I let it control me I don't know very very good okay so we know uncle was a cheerleader when your brother was a cheerleader and you had the community that you're plugged into richer leaders who else would your biggest cheerleader I think\nAnd I mean we're really close to our family and my family they're all of them are very supportive of us when we come from five brothers are\nNot cyber five kids from each family Saturday brothers and sisters so we have come from a big family but and they were all supportive of us really and our friends and as well so\nAre you do so what do you tell people the key to getting out of debt is now that you've done it\nI think the key thing David is being on the same page ...\nYou know communication is key and you know we went to the money and marriage last week um ever listen to a lot of the other couples mhm and none of them have gone through the financial peace but I had gone through a lot of seminars mhm and I think if they had gone through a seminar or the financial peace university they would really get on the same page\nAnd it would just really explode once I get through that and and follow the ... the steps yeah\nAnd just you know riding down our goals is really important for us to do and once we had that you know we're very cool driven\nAnd especially in in sales yeah you got to be ... you know we have that target and we wanted to hit it and said just staying focused and dedicated and discipline and really really helped us you know", "year": "2018",
