{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KTSA", "content": "Money um and what's it going to mean well a lotta people are thinking it's going to mean that he wins\nBecause that much money means he will be carpeting the TV and radio airwaves between now\nAnd election day and maybe he will be but it might also mean that the national Democratic Party and donors are pouring the money in because they realize he's not winning that in most recent polls he's lucky to get a into the mid forties\nAnd this may be a last ditch you know Hail Mary attempt to get him a up to fifty percent and into contention it it doesn't look like and I don't put a lot of faith in polls 'cause I don't think polls measure everybody and I think they're tainted and tilted but\nUm there have been a lot lately that indicate that Senator Cruz is pulling away\nFrom congressman O'Rourke so one way to look at the thirty eight million oh boy he's got this thing another way to look at it is it represents\nUm some desperation and a third way of looking at it or might be wishful thinking [noise] um what\nCan't figure out is why Democrats around the country I don't mean Texas Democrats\nWhy Democrats around the country aren't putting this money into war winnable races the a Republican incumbent in Nevada is in serious jeopardy of being upset by his Democratic challenger why not give her the money\nOr Arizona which we think of is mostly a Republican state looks like it could elect a democratic senator\nUm that race is very winnable for the Democrats by the way both the Democratic and Republican candidate in that state or women\nWhy not give a the Democrat in Arizona some of that money why why not win two Senate races that are winnable instead of pouring money into one that doesn't look as winnable\nIs it wishful thinking is buying into the Beto hype or is it as some people suggested this week ... you know out that the absolute abject hatred\nOf Ted Cruz in other words yes it would be nice to win two Senate seats but what would really be nice just knocked off that's mug self righteous Ted Cruz who does he think he is\nSo maybe you know maybe it's store number three I don't know I'm obviously team cruise has to be nervous that is a lot of money and money can have an impact\nThe Republicans nationally have to be nervous because probably now they will have to divert resources from other states to prop up Ted Cruz and make sure he doesn't win but you know the third thing you've got to keep in mind here is that um while you can raise thirty eight million dollars there's only so much time there's only so many\nMinutes of advertising there's only so many eyeballs and bandwidth to buy\nAnd at some point you run out of places to keep marketing and and and and showcasing Beto O'Rourke who by the way I'm I'm not even totally sure that the more people see and hear about him the better it is for him\nI ... a lot of people have said this and I I tend to agree with um his best chance of winning is probably somewhere in the vicinity of\nAh I don't really like Ted Cruz or I'm not really sure that Ted Cruz is a good senator and this guy's the alternative and you know kind of that vague not ... is a is probably very helpful the hip this the\nYuck factor the the the fact that Beto O'Rourke does a lot of sort of cool stuff um but if you actually\nExposed people more and more to him saying this is what I Want to do and this is what I Believe in that\nThis is how I feel about the second amendment and what\nI'm not I'm not sure that translates or makes for more votes so we'll see but it's an incredible amount of money um and I mean it's it's an amount that we have not seen in a quarter\nOf for a Senate candidate in Texas or anywhere else I'm Around the country and again for somebody running for president and I don't mean\nAt the end but I'm Talking about when people are running in the primaries this would even be an incredible amount of money for a national candidate who's running in several different states and several different primaries simultaneously so that's what's going on with\nFederal mania and we will be in the Alamo lounge election night with all these

have a huge family we have six kids between the two of us feel a lot of stress with a blended family mhm a lot of chaos and uh\nJust multiples spent money like crazy and and um we paid six thousand dollars to attorneys and we were I left the house to took our youngest child and ... and just ... and I'm\nOut on a friend of mine invited me um to see you knew you were doing a tunnel a makeover event and she had invited me to go see you and I didn't know who you are but I didn't want to be at home with him I said sure I'll go see you\nAnd I was at the arena yes I was like five thousand or a policy of at a friend's yes uh-huh and so we I went to go see you and I'm\nAt a lot of issues that I hadn't dealt with from my childhood and from for life and I just stuffed them down and I was spending like crazy and I didn't know that I was the majority of the problem in our relationship and then when you said um if you have a problem with money it's not the money you\nKnow I'm just kind of lifted blinders off my eyes and I realized okay I was a problem than on that I had to do something to\nTo get all that it takes myself\nSo I went home and I begged him to give it a shot and I buy your starter ... when I was there and um and we started our journey\nAnd yeah we were we took the Thirteen were a few class at our church we started to church or else along separation from being regular time there's and went through a marriage recovery program and we just go to a really awesome church churches\nCity churches hands what city church ... yeah that's it was it was God just working in our lives from the moment you know forever but really for the moment we started this plan it just everything started\nGetting better and and we were closer together and we were on the same page and um it's just amazing\nAnd it took us thinking Fifteen months to pay off all all of the non mortgage that a hundred and almost a hundred and ten thousand dollars we sold everything inside and that wasn't nailed down in our house\nAnd I mean when the show which flipped with you to it for them the yes went from a whole host spending stupid all the way over to wide open smart yeah yeah wow that's a true one eighty yeah\nWe just it was like the horses that you talked about in your ... few classes and then we just got together and nothing was going to stop us and we ate beans and cheese every day\n[laughter] going into ... we're going out to dinner tonight at a fairly extravagance is good and we're stressed out good no woman or a day but we've we've stay plugged\nInto it and just

say okay but let's try this together and we're not we're not going to spend like what you're spending how how did that next three to four months look like from the from the I mean almost gone to we're going to turn and try this there had it had to be pretty bumpy\nYeah yeah it was it was hard hard to trust her right she spent her whole life living this way with this chaos with money and in debt and and I did it take you to trust her\nIt probably took a year or so really to to see that hey this is she's she's I'm seeing the action not just the words right\nWell I mean that's a hundred percent but I mean probably within a few weeks you kind of how to raise your eyebrow and go wow she's really doing this I mean you really had to see that that go a little bit a glimpse of ... ... is is it grew yeah trust grew over time well\nIn the moment I got home from your class I was going through my doors ... trying to sell so I mean what can I sell so I sold jewelry I so I mean you know he was seeing

sold and when it closes only then can you close on another purchase and if I may and if that means you rent for a little while in between it means you rent for a little while in between\nKnow we're going to end up with two houses\nYeah I Know some other way I used to be honest I don't do it on how about you for brother\nAppreciate that but don't do it you know what happens is is you get everybody does is I Do it do you've done it you get caught up in the the the narrative of this the story of this and it starts to feel like you're stuck and you have to do things but you don't have to do anything\nUntil my husband was that we don't have to do anything just to house and you know it's just the house\nBut when you remember how your heart so big an open when you move to Colorado and you're going to try new adventure I Know everybody call of the same as just the opposite of that I Know your heart I feel like it's in a cage\nAt it yeah I told my husband I feel cornered right now and I call a healing for him\nYou know why you feel cornered is because you're cornered wondering why you would feel court so you're on your eyes you here's what you do when you're cornered you throw up your hands and you walk out\nYep I did that last night I walked out with my husband was talking to the real fear I said I Can't even listen to the city ...\nI it's not a matter of not dealing with it I'm not talking about a voice on TALK I Know I mean I won't go a little bit of Neil ... I'll be happy to close on\nThis deal when my trailer cells\nYeah when my trailer is sold my trailer hasn't so I Can't close until that happens and so you guys need to dump us in the street dump us in the street and go on to them that guy and that's probably what's gonna happen oh well there's a house on every corner in Denver\nYou'll get you another house and don't get desperate\n'cause as soon as you feel cornered as soon as you feel desperate is you know you feel forced\nThat's when you do stupid stuff and there's realtors feeling desperate they're trying to get your clothes on something you shouldn't clothes on\nThey should've been a contingency to start with but now we're going to make it on because you're just not going to close\nIs if you do you're going to regret it you're gonna end up on and both of these houses for ten years\nAnd then you're going to have a real problem it's going to damage your finances is going to take a decade to recover from a ...\nDecision walk away or tell them just we're going to have the brakes boys and girls until this thing closes if we can get this closed and we'll close if we can't and we're not going to be able to oh we're gonna go to the next guy well\nI don't I don't understand you have the right to do that 'cause I'm not closing on Thursday and then but if you want to wait on us we'll be happy to close on it will keep our word but it's got to be based on this thing selling and um I Would walk to exactly what I Do calm down\nMark is with us in Indianapolis I mark welcome to the day Ramsey show\nThank you for your service sir thank you how can I help\nWell I'm sixty and I have six rental properties three litter free and clear and three that small mortgages and I just always assumed that we would probably to sell one of the time uh basically about now starting now and and that would be part of your retirement and a friend of mine said well wait a minute ... have you with the\nUh the reason I thought we needed to sell them I thought that to Social Security at a limit of around fourteen thousand or so that you can make per year before they uh\nYou and nieces way that on long held investments I don't know that a\nPlane that's how I think there's just passive income and doesn't apply you need to check that out I agree with him I'm not positive but I wouldn't keep I wouldn't sell a good investment just to change my Social Security stuff\nSocial Security on that big a part of the equation these properties or two if they're good properties I'd keep them even if it does mess up Social Security\nWell they're profitable hey you know we've we've been I guess you'd say for example it but they're not the you know there is bread and butter well three bedroom one bath houses\n... stay rented it was a big market for 'em right\n[noise] uh yeah yeah but as you know you know rich period I mean when you're sixteen fifty five on the same you know what I'm saying you've been through with runners and\nIf you don't want for renters lots of different equation but I'm not selling them to get out of Social Security bravo I may or may not cause your Social Security problem and maybe passive income might not come up with Social Security\nMaybe you might want to sell 'em anyway if you just don't like being on the runners anymore but overall is real estate a good investment to carry all the way through retirement if you don't mind messing with it that's that's a good investment and this is that\nIran [noise] the\nShe production officer for the day ran from the show\n[noise] make sure you watch it

limit your use as a rule of thumb one buying a used car\nUm\nKnow what I'm trying to determine is is the car worn out to the point is going to give me trouble so the more inexpensive and cheaply made the car is the more the miles would affect it\nOther words a hundred thousand miles dodged neon would be different than a hundred thousand miles Mercedes\nWhy one is used up and the other one is just getting started\nAt that point you know what I'm saying the ... is really tired under the hood of that neon at that point\nI mean do they still make a dodge neon but you get my point the cheap little dinky but car I mean you got a hundred thousand miles smart car that's called dom okay it's not called smart anymore so I just give you that example so no chance I Want that thing\nBut if you got a car that's built let's say a higher in nicer vehicle uh they're typically well bill I mean again a Honda Alexis a Mercedes a beamer a Cadillac\nUm the larger body for products forge building a great product a truck\nA Chevy Truck for truck with a hundred thousand miles on it I wouldn't say anything about that\nIt's got easily another hundred and it may be another three hundred and depending on how you took care of it and what you were driving and that kind of thing um but I I wouldn't think anything about that at all uh again that we can depends on your budget and how nice car you want obviously the least miles or the last year's car I bought one\nAfter it at Nineteen thousand miles on when I bought it I drove until I got about sixty or no I got to got about fifty something\nOn it and um so I was a very low mild car when I got rid of it the other day and um so you know you just you're looking at that your situation to what is the um what is your situation and what can you do but generally speaking the\nThe I'm more of an economy car it is quote unquote the ah the more the miles would have a negative effect on it um\nBecause I'm just I'm just really don't know how to

how good are you there is better than I deserve welcome\nWhat are you guys live where I Am glad\nWashington which is just south of Seattle okay very cool well good to have you guys and the young folks you brought with your the ... what are their names and I just\nWe got there and who is eight and Harper who's seven\nAll right good looking family very cool and all the way across the United states here to Nashville through your debt free scream you bet I love it how much will be paid off right about six nine thousand good for you and how long did that take close to nine months wow that's fast range of income right about a hundred and fifty thousand what are you guys do for a living\nSo I'm In charge of management sales for Wells Fargo\nAnd I'm I'm a full time stay at home mom but during that process I was a um health and fitness coach\nNow okay very good and what kind of that was the sixty nine thousand dollars a couple of cars and a little bit of student loan left\nCool did you sell any cars or did you just pay them off no we just stayed them off in the car got us into the travel okay very cool but nine months ago some kind of a switch lip because men you went all after it you went game own hair this is a pretty serious numbers wild on tell me the story what got you started\nSo probably about six months prior to that we ended up needing a new car needing right I'm going out and we decided to bearing for ... yeah the emergency popped up right yeah and ah we ended up with a car you know we had some strict guidelines we wanted and probably more than we really needed to pay for it but we did the brand new\nAnd it was the ... were just sick of being stuck in kind of paying the bills even though we could pay no problem it was just we didn't want to any more um we want and we're more excited for the future and that was just going to be in the way for the future mhm so we just we went ... intensity near term so ...\nSo how did you end up where in this process to connect with us\nSo it I'm a huge following pod cast a lot of time on the road and always listen to and it's like they'd we can do this you know than us and I we're we've got this no problem so we started doing that at the same time it always been kind of a vision of hours to lead a few at our church celebration center and so we uh\nGot that started right about time we started we got everything in line to start a few in January at our church and\nWe did that and so it was kind of who started it and then as we got a few we were learning for the first time was the mentors and now on a second session and loving it\nWell thanks for leading the class yeah very cool well there's nothing like leading to make you do it I mean that's the way that you you can attend and may be kinda slough off right but ah not hardly it's very difficult to do that but it's almost impossible to lead it and not be game on\nExactly and I think that just kind of stems from let me to it because I Believe in modeling all the years and now if I was going to model what I wanted my children have in the future I had the model at my house\nYou know my daughter ritual cruise always says that when you're teaching kids more is caught them part yes the modeling thing is a big deal they're going to do what you do how many times about open my mouth and one of my parents' voice came out I mean oh my goodness you know that's what happened but it's happened on this show and you're much\nSo well done you guys very well\nDone so when you have someone in your class and\nThe show up for financial peace and they're not game on them because they're scared and they don't think they can do this the the whole hasn't kicked in yet the belief hasn't kicked in yet what do you tell them they need to do\nTo be debt free one of the things you need to do if you want to pay off sixty nine thousand dollars and nine months\nWe did not do that and you start your hands start waving and you start telling 'em right what do you tell them\nWell there's kind of a couple of things I think first of all you got to believe you know I mean it's it's it's a program to believe in it works follow the program and you can do it um second all it takes a team it can't be an individual you know we're a family of four\nAnd it can't just be me doing it which is pretty much what we did in the past I was in charge of the money the budget all that it takes the team and as long as to if you can come together and really get on board\nIt can happen you know with with the steps you lay out it's it's not rocket science you know one of the main\nThings that someone needs to do to get out of debt\nAnd budget right there but I mean I think it is amazing how much money just flies in the door that you I don't make enough no it's their you make plenty you spend\nToo much [laughter] that's true but generally true okay\nSo I I also think that they need to focus on why they're doing at the same thing for their out into the future and um and to recognize that my reason why you might not be the exact same reason it his way but at the end goal that that way in front of us is what we're both gravitating toward\n... okay go what was your why it\nRight here I I like um kids and your family tree I just the legacy I listened to a lot of your stuff in a lot of other um had kept on legacy and love are leaving behind and I think that um if we want to see change like we have to start teaching at\nMm mhm modeling it in teaching it yeah I didn't change your family tree that's a big reason people will do stuff to change the direction of their family that they would never do for themselves and and it it's a bigger and more noble why\nThan just a I Want to go on vacation someday you know what your if you live like no one else later you can live and give like no one else but in the process of doing that you do change the trajectory of your family tree\nSo very well done good you guys very cool very cool or do you have a lot of cheerleaders along lawyer some people that kind of went and I think you'd be more nuts\nYou know we have a we had some and we had some of the flip side right I'm you're going to have someone who tried to play down but you know I think the one thing we had some good mentors that were local that were definitely coaching the sons of keeping us going ... not only through our you know scenario but also helping us lead ... view so definitely\nMhm but not so when he came home that first time and said uh we just bought this car it's killing me I'm listen to this podcast I Want to do something different where you resist under judicial I Will finally you woke up\n[laughter] I Know I had a pet in my stomach\nWhen we bought a car now and so and like internationally I knew that was not the right choice that we kind of felt that pull that we needed to do it or he played your podcast on a date night ... typically remember that date night [laughter]\nThat is so on romance [laughter]\nFor him [laughter] I\nI mean we we listen to that I cast and I um I was really getting on board and about the same time Rachel book had come out that they were like ...\nAnd I was listening to that an audible dot com and just really think thing pieces are coming together and I I Know the lord and lady in the direction of where you need to go and do we just um I got on board after that but I I told him the hardest part of this process for me was\nGetting excited about his spreadsheets that he would email me once a month out like I don't think you know\nOh how exciting it Mr pod cast on a date night Mr spreadsheet yeah this guy he's [laughter] this guy's my kind of believe that [laughter]\nI told her I Love it very well done your guy that's but\nI think the trucks a keeper innocent project truck that you work on after you get your financial straightened out\nOkay um so I I think that previous is going to be hated to I'm with you but I think it's going to be a lot more reliable than a fixed up sixty four I've got a ... I got a Nineteen sixty vet that's rebuilt from the frame up and it's got a wonderful three twenty seven to ... to four but dual ... for barrels on it it's a beast\nOr not but it is a project car I mean they you you know it it runs all most all the time\nBut I'm not getting in that car and and depending on it to be somewhere I have to be it's more of a fun thing to have\nIn the garage and I think that's what you're sixty four is going to be someday um but if you want to sell the Prius and moved to a different car that's just a cheap car was what you would have spent\nOn the truck motor and that kinda stuff and move into a little different vehicle there as long as you're paying cash for it it's a it's a who move up kind of a thing then I'd be okay with that if you want to do that\nBut um but I don't think I'd like to try and get away and I want to do with the project because it's a cool project but I wouldn't do it right now [noise]\nJosh is one of those Josh is in Madison, Wisconsin Hi Josh\nHow are you [noise] I'm good how are you do better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] so I've got a question um regarding a credit card from business trips and let me kind of explain the situation here 'cause I'm looking for someone by um my wife and I have never been through a few but we actually just recently paid off all of our debt at about two and a half weeks ago\nGreat congratulations\nThank you um [noise] I work from home with a relatively smaller company okay and they send us on business trips every once in a while\nAnd we are required basically ... you know pay for some of those business expenses during the trip that money is definitely\nReimbursed for a company that we're going to fee pays for that but we have to kind of want that money I had the time um we've called on all of our credit cards except for one for the business trips because we don't have money\nYou know set aside to be able to pay for the ... and says I might have been much to the expenses run a month [noise]\nWell I'm not I'm not traveling every single month but there I mean every time I go on a business trip it's it's anywhere from a thousand two thousand dollars current anchor the hotel and then you're going to get\nThe money to act like when you get the money back within thirty Dutch\nYeah OK correct so I mean we're we're paying the pain that often and obviously we're not going to using the credit card for our own personal use of\nThe ... you need to see that one time you need to ... from the one time with two thousand dollars in a separate ... new checking account that as a debit card on it and it's used only for one thing reimburse ...\nBusiness travel and use your money on your debit card and you pray your little company doesn't go broke and not pay you\nBack\nA little company you're taking a big risk\nSure you're you're the bank or for the small company that is too small to even fund their own employees travel\nThat's pretty scary\nAt some point they may go belly up and you're going to be left holding the two thousand dollar ticket in your hand that's the risk you're taking so\nLong now so that the company that we go and visit they they don't they don't\nPay you they pay your company and then your company pays you write write your company goes Bryant they're going to take that money from that other company and pay the bills with it and you're going to be left out in the cold someday\nSure I've seen it happen I'm Thirty years or seen happen a lot\nOf ... so then where does that where does that fit in with\nThat leaves you well known as up a creek because you're taking a risk for this little bitty company that's what I'm pointing out for you know what I Would do it all with a debit card if you want to do that that's fine but at least then you're admitting that you're taking this risk I Will tell you I'm going to go back to your little bitty company inside guys I'm Out of that\nI don't like borrowing money I don't want to borrow money anymore if you want me to take business trips why don't you give me the money to take business trips and then when they pay you back you'll get your money back\nMhm it's only two thousand dollar right\nI don't ask people to travel here with their money I got a twenty eight year old young person this trying to feed their dogs and their kids\nAnd keep their lights on and I'm going to send them out and put airline tickets on there on them know this company here pays for their airline tickets and we pay for the rental car and we pay for their hotel in their food when they travel I don't ask somebody here to travel and\nAsked them to pay for me pay back we just pay for and we give them a debit card we give them the cash when they leave the place you're company should do that for you and you should push 'em on it because you're taking the risk otherwise but if you don't want to change the situation you need to funded with cash build a debit card and do away with a credit card\nWith ads gonna make you how that's going to make your stomach because now you're realizing they're real risk there is this is Dave Ramsey show [noise]\n\n\nHey guys this is James Giles producer

million\nOkay [laughter] that would be the most this week one going to have a few million okay and how long did this take\nEight months [laughter] okay and that is a story and your range of income is about eight hundred grand okay my goodness gracious [noise] All right so what in the world this was a bizarre bizarre numbers\nYeah Dave it's a it's a long time coming so we were the Joneses so um you know for a long time we had to have the new everything and the nice everything luckily for us bus for us that we had a decent income to do for a little at all that\nWell I'm I'm just I'm I'm a I T cells guy\nAnd to have any accent how these two little lady Hossam ... okay and so um\nYeah for a long time we got caught up in that and I listen to your show probably for about\nEight months leading up to this and you know for me it was pride and ego just you know I'm too sophisticated for that that's that's for other people and um I came to realize through ah through a lot of prayer and a lot a lot of just\nListening and thinking and knowledge in reading that this was the right way for us so we sold a a lake house we sold a beach house and um\nWe were beans and rice for eight months much to the chagrin of my family um but\nWe made it through and knocked it out and so excite my\nGoodness gracious so I ... as your typical ears income\nYeah I mean I guess over the last ten years is\nSpain's between eight and one point to\nRun out all\nYou obviously slaying it well done so how much of the one million and some change was the sale of the house was what the lake house bring the beat us brings\nSo the the uh the net of the lake house was only like one fifty but the beach house was paid for and it was about four Seventy\n... with a ... I mean the one point five included the pay off with a mortgage or the other one right yeah sure okay so what was the total on the two properties well it says that would have reduced the whole thing about the four Seventy in order to reduce the other ... the\nThe cell or the property was seven eighty on the lake house and we heard about a hundred and twenty left in that okay uh-huh\nAnd that's but that that uh six hundred\nThousand or so is included in the one million paid off for a sure okay so you're so the ... a big chunk of this then if I'm hearing this year I was done with the sale of these two properties oh yeah oh yeah wow\nYeah I Want to read all of the aisle of the extra stuff which is a challenge whenever he or when you were me and I and we were used to doing it where you send this summer is being able to go to the lake and ... and mark caught me on board I mean\nWhat made you decide because I mean I I'm kinda thinking I I might have tried to keep one or two of those are one of those the cheaper one the four Seventy one in ... worked our way through given your income what made you decide to go show radical yeah also and you did it wrong I'm just curious\nYeah I mean for me I I think about like attorney as all the lifespan and I think you know were given maybe Ninety years if we're lucky in that full eternity which is like a a glimpse in time ...\nAnd then within that time I'm given even less of a time to make a generational impact on my kids ... and so for us it was\nYou know I created a list of things that brought me joy and a list of things that created a burden mhm and the houses were\nAt the bottom we're not on the list of the joy and there were at the top on the burden wow and so I was like you know this is let's keep it simple and\nSimply wasn't that way on one of those\nAds [laughter] I was actually not that way for a while one of my best friend's actually said don't you ... they don't have a hard thing to beginning so I mean I'm\n... what's your all's income I can say I might have sat there and argued to keep the lake house or something you know the the ...\nWhat's your wired it was really difficult to to give out some things that you know I felt like we were doing well and everything is we we can do that mhm but it also kind of boils down to the are getting older and we have\nYou know what do we want to do with them as they get old ... and and what do we want to show than and so we had you know we kind of had to have a heart to heart has you know we needed to see what was important\nAnd they're going to see that you know well and the other things are obviously in terms of time spent somewhere where there's the beach with a lake that kind of stuff\nWith the income you've got and no debt even do anything you want to yeah I mean you can go to like in Europe if you want I mean it's you know you can do whatever you want to as as not even anywhere near as expensive as those houses ourselves right it's um you know you are your freed up to still have incredible\nUh family memories doing it doing recreational type stuff is what I'm trying to say interesting very interesting\nSo um so a big pile of it was that what was the rest of the debt\nSo our our whole debt is um [noise] by paying by virtue of paying those off who were able to pay off the home that we live and ... and so we we use the cash derived from that mhm plus cash flow and some savings to pay for our home that we live and\nOkay so it was just three property ... yeah that's what I was all your real estate I mean that's all your debt which is okay this is the home you live in is worth what one point six [laughter] wow you guys are amazing\nCongratulations well and obviously holding back then and clearing that that's a big part of the equation there yeah 'cause that's secure than amazing spam slowly amazing so you're sitting there\nWith a net worth well in excess of two million dollars now easily I'm the I'm guessing it for one case but with this income you got to be loading up so um\nHow Sheffield feels great I mean I'm you know I'm I'm\nI'm kind of to the point of a second guessing even even having so much of our network tied up in a house ... um so but it feels great Mm you know it's it's a it's a first step and a journey\nYeah yeah well I get give yourself a couple of years to think on that one you know where to go you're in
