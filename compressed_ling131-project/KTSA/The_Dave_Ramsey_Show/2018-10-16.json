where you um you go up and you order and they they build what you're going to eat in front of you like an assembly line kind of thing you know so you sign up you kind of slide along and you\nYou say yes or no two ingredients and they put it together and then you get it at the end and you pay for it anyway I'm I'm going along and they had you know how they'll they'll work on several orders at once so they're sliding the\nThe trays or the place or whatever down in there you know adding to each one and then the next one and you're just kind of waiting\nWhile I'm standing there there's flies flying around and I'm just waiting and sure enough one lands on the edge of the prey that has my order\nAnd I cannot I Am so obsessive compulsive I Am I Am watching this thing I'm not breathing I'm like all ten stop\n'cause I'm waiting to see if it's going to go on the food land on the food and thank God it stayed on the edge of the the plate or the bowl or whatever you want to call it\nAnd um but I was thinking if it lands on the food I'm the only one that's going to see this and if it lands on the food I'm going to have to say something because it's just I'm a germ of of this is how I Am\nAnd I was curious to know what they were going to do because they weren't I mean you can't there were flies and I don't know I I\nI don't know what the rule is like how many are are considered acceptable and when there's too many I'm not sure how that works I've seen places that were written up as health code violations for having flies so apparently at some point there is some fly threshold where if you have X number or more\nYou got a problem but obviously every restaurant from time to time we'll have a fly fly and you have this was so quiet it was quite dramatic at the end of ah the whole process I was waiting for somebody to come along and continue to work on my order because I figured if we can just get some activity maybe we can um\nWard off the fly you know I'm I'm not

haven't taken to the taste of crawfish um if it happens in the next door and maybe we'll give it a try right now we're just going to leave them alone so she's letting them just crawl back

I Can't\nI I I fell into the trap of saying well Dave Ramsey that they ran the fed 'em so now I'm not allowed to say your name I'm\nMhm mhm well I guess you could talk to the Y. and asked them if you could split revenues with them or something like that in order to use their stuff\nA lot of was do that with personal trainers and in a sense this is a a type of personal training I mean I guess if you're holding up I Would suspect some of the yoga teachers or the aerobics teachers or whatever at the Y. probably just do a split revenue deal don't they\nDon't ... I I Would I don't I just want to be contract or I didn't want to be owned by the why\nCan now I was there that you're just you're just a teacher right now and what you get in there and you you work out all the kinks out of your system and you learn how to do it any developer reputation with people\nBut I and I may not let you necessarily have a business name on this they may just pay you as a teacher there to live for right now but that'll get some income coming in and get you in the field actually doing this and then the next step would be that you could actually rent\nPart time someone else's gym to do this with or part time someone else's ball fields to do this way and you know you're going to start there if you want if you got the money if you got on but a cash\nNow and now I'm starting from scratch and you know basically a plan that I had an Internet dreamers stage for the longest time and now that I've had a book and I they can be acquired cats I'm empowered I'm Josh\nSaid you know where to go hat start\nI think I might make some money kind of almost as a side job doing this exact thing at the Y. or at some place like a why first and as I said then you get the kinks out of your teaching methods and all that kind of stepped in the next step is you take that cash\nAnd that gives you the ability to rent the gym or rent the ball field on a per day basis but right now let's say you go rent a ball field and and you can't get anybody to sign up for your course\nOh my gosh you just lost all that money oh wait a minute you don't have any money oh my gosh you just got into that no we don't do that\nSee that's that's what I'm trying to avoid so let's create a little bit of money while learning a few things about how to talk to people how to teach people how to coach people and prove out some of your dreams and your theories that you've got here by just poking around on under somebody else's roof a little bit and then\nThen when we got a little bit of cash we can go rent the ball field or rent the gym by the day\nFor a little while and then um you\nKnow that way will break you if you don't get clients a write off the bat when I started financial piece University Our a office building allowed us the people that were tenants in the office building they had a common conference room that you could book\nDoesn't cost anything but you had the book and you couldn't just keep it book you had to just look at you know for a meeting you can you know other people go in there you see it as a meeting and he'll like a hundred and thirty people is a nice size little conference room and all of meeting room kind of thing tables that moved round and all of that that's where a financial peace university started\nIs in that little conference room\nAnd I'm pretty cool if you think about it and so but I had to just look at as a part of renting the little office that I was in and so but it wasn't really my meeting room it was the office buildings meeting room\nAnd you could just use it and so I booked it in the evening and then I looked at in another evening and I looked at it in another evening and then I was booking is so much they asked me to start paying a little bit and then I started paying a little bit but I had a lot of classes going by them but I just the first night I did that are for people came\nThank goodness I didn't rent that thing for the month and therefore people come\nGoes we would have probably gone out of business that month [laughter] so that's what I'm saying it's OK to start it on a very piecemeal basis and started on the cheap\nThere's nothing wrong with that at all I'm really proud of you can do this when I said go do it do do it it's time to do it it's time to get off the dream and move into the actual action go do it you can do this a promise you you can do this very well done good good good\nLara follows me on Facebook dot com slash Dave Ramsey is it worth it to refinance a student loan to save on interest\nIf you're saving on interest you can get a better interest rate it's okay to do that make sure that the loan is a fixed rate and make sure that it is a lower fixed rate\nSometimes people refinance student loans and just throw 'em all in one pile and end up paying a net rate that is higher because they'll mix up a four or five or six and a seven in there and get it all at six but the foreign the father wouldn't cheaper and they don't end up chief of\nNet net net right the aggregate in other words so make sure that you are getting a better rate or don't refinance and make sure it is a\nFixed rate but then you got to do a lot of work to get out of that the interest rates are never going to get you out of it if you've got to get really mad that's how you get out of that and you
