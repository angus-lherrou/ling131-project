{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KTSA", "content": "And show up [noise] the autumn\nThe show with Luis ... of Syria on the automotive reason why she brought us five fifty the essay and ... on\n... [laughter]\nLot of really good conversation here in Studio ... brought up the fact that when I go to our shows or does your dad messed with\nCar shows for you like if you all were to walk around a beautiful car show and see all these immaculate engines and\nAnd and all the beautiful cars right or does he go through and and comment on the different vehicles and to an extent so ah my dad grew up working on cars that we would consider muscle cars at this point I mean they have always been considered muscle cars so the dodge challengers the chargers\nA you know the the Chevy Camaro is all these just beautiful Ford Mustang and stuff like that\nAnd and in that time period or when the cars were hot right ah everybody had their opinion on which car was better we still kind of have it today but in my opinion all make some models\nThey're really the bar is set so high today that they you know I still have opinions but whatever I'm not as passionate let's say and so Ah yes when we walk through car shows day in and and my dad's walking with me there are certain cars that he has favorites for and\nThere are certain cars that I might even say well look at that gorgeous whatever and I can't say it because then you know all alienate half of my audience for this but uh anyway those he'll say oh man that old piece of junk you know we used to smoke those when we do drag racing on Thousand Oaks and he did do right where access transmission and he\nThey used to block off the the Thousand Oaks drive in and do drag racing out there but you know I'd beat 'em hands down with my eyes closed in and half my carburetor working and so ah anyway yes he does have opinions on car shows too and we that brought a from a previously that when we watch car movies together\nOr he'll comment on exactly what the car should be able to do and should not be able to do or what the maintenance would have been like\nSo it's fun and I I find myself actually doing the same thing I'll tell you right now that if I if I see a vehicle if I see a Indiana Jones movie that has a Land Rover driving through it right and I'm going to alienate part of my audience here but\nUh if I see an Indiana Jones movie that there are flying through the desert on a landrover also you know what that Land Rover that he'd made it about halfway through the shot that they just took and I bet they had to fix that thing before they took the next shot because that's how I feel about land rovers or let's go let's go to Rob what can we do for you Rob\nThanks for taking my call I've got a two thousand Chevy pickup with the the six\nOkay it's just beat her work truck idols okay goes down the highway great but when it's recently started when you first put it into gear it it has to take it or sometimes even dies\nOkay and it's only when you put it into gear do you have an engine light on\nA boat it was it\n... it's been on there [laughter]\nOkay so on a two thousand Chevrolet truck I Do I really today just I Want to encourage you to go ahead and get it scanned if you take it to a place that can clear the codes have them clear the codes okay I don't know that every part store can or should or will do that\nBut ... you have some very very common issues on the two thousand\nI doubt that you have a fuel filter but if you do then go ahead and replace it this weekend\nRight of all the fuel filter good okay so you do have a fuel filter and you have replaced that have you clean the throw into body no okay\nDo a thorough nobody cleaning go buy a ... when you're at the store getting it can get a can of throwing the body cleaner and it doesn't matter what brand just make sure that it says throw into body cleaner I Want you to take off the air tube that goes from the air filter to the throttle body and I'm saying this not just for you but for anybody listening\nAh in in at the throw auto body than a look in there and spray out the throne about a real good you should see a pretty heavy carbon ring around your throw into plate okay or I Want you to clean that clean all of it All right if you can activate the throttle plate outside of the throwing a body\nBy just removing a lever then go ahead and do that open it up wide open with the car off all of this is what the car off\nA open wide open spray that throttle cleaner and they're real good use a rag and not a paper towel user bragging wipe it out real good and then sprayed again and you may use about half the candidate throwing a body cleaner okay ah also while you're at the parts store pick up a very small can of mass Airflow cleaner\nThe mass Airflow is located just past your air filter on that and take to undo the two to four screws and take it off and spray that mess Airflow cleaner and then put it right back on\nSo now you're going to do a mass Airflow cleaning and the throw into body cleaning and then uh if you wanted to go any further if you're mechanically inclined get me the fuel pressure because that's what Chevy's have is a bad fuel pumps every single time\nUh the only other thing this super comment on that you're making model is\nThe distributor cap so if you have not done distributor cap and wrote er go ahead and

is what a fixed indexed annuity will do for you\nYou see a four O. one K. won't provide you an income\nA stock fund won't provide you an income\nAnd I are re won't provide you an income they'll provide you funds that you yourself can divide up and spin one way or another but they don't provide you income you have to divide that up and make that money last for you okay and good luck on that

very top fixed indexed annuities everybody says they're too good to be true of you talked a stockbroker they're going to tell you if you see a fixed indexed annuity run from it runs from it run from it\n[laughter]\nThey're going to tell you the fees are too high they're going to tell you the commissions are too high they're going to tell you that the contracts are too difficult to understand and so now I'm going to break it down a fixed indexed annuity\nSome have fees some don't but I was sure use the fees though to even begin to measure\nIn the cost that you're going to be paying through most of your mutual funds your stock funds your different growth plans I was sure you that that's not going to that that ... your fees will be that much\nOkay but world talk about the fees later on in this program a fixed indexed annuity by definition is a financial insurance instrument\nOr an insurance financial instrument you're buying insurance to ensure your money\nTo ensure that your money will never be lost that you can't lose your money you can't lose your principal and you can't lose any of the interest than it earns\nThat is right in the contracts you see and it's done that way because the law states that an insurance company with a fixed indexed annuity they have to match your money dollar for dollar\nWhen you put your money into a brokerage firm into stocks bonds mutual funds while you know what happens\nYou're you're at a hundred percent risk\nA hundred percent risk while you're at a hundred percent risk that means everything you have can be a last\nWe're going to hold right there because we're going to take a brief break and we're going to be right back and just a few moments when we come right back I'm going to continue on about that\nGod Bless you this is pastor ... and the senior pastor over for women's Bible church right here in San Antonio\nMy dear friend last hospice and I started a new video podcast\nThat I Want to encourage all of you to come and

greatness the God has in store for you pray that he gives you the IRS\nTo here in the eyes to see\nYeah I'm Lance hospice I tell you I'm a cigar smoker I've been smoking cigars for the last twenty six years and if you're a cigar person and you really enjoy 'em I got to tell you about a place here in San Antonio is the rebels cigar company the largest cigar lounge in all of south\nTexas has a boutique gourmet cigars humid or at the front of it and it's one eight eight for seven redlin road just north of sixteen oh four one eight eight for seven redlin wrote the largest cigar lounge in all of a south Texas boutique gourmet cigars humid oriented this place has giant\nSmoke heaters throughout it's filled with leather furniture gaming tables shuffle board and the beauty about those smoke eaters is that you can enjoy your favorite stick and not be in a big cloud of smoke one eight eight for seven Redmond rode the Ritalin cigar company\n[noise]\n\nBack I'm Lance office this is the ... radio show and I've really slowed the showdown for you because we now have two hours and the information that we are going to be really\nRelating to you is so vitally important that you can understand it so the fixed indexed annuity you can never lose any money at it is a financial instrument that protects your money against loss it also gives you a guarantee\nThat you're going to have an income that you cannot outlive for the rest of your life\nBut we're going to get into that part in just a little bit so the word fixed legally means that the annuity has to be a guarantee where you can never lose any of your money and you have to receive a minimum yield on your money it can't be a zero can't be a loss\nThat's what fixed means indexed\nThis is where it gets really interesting and it's the part that makes this stuff really fun indexed so many financial advisers in the stock and mutual fund the Treasury's world out there they're going to tell you if you go into the fixed indexed annuity you're you're not going to be able to take advantage of the market\nNot true\nBecause indexed means that your money will work\nFor you with the S. and P. five hundred the Dow Jones Russell report\nUm the essence of the the uh the NASDAQ the foot sea the Barclays the pimco it's going to work with all those indexes so I'm going to back up and go through that again all of the five hundred not just a few\nAll of the thirty in the Dow Jones all the five hundred of the U.S and the all of the thirty and the Dow Jones all of the NASDAQ all of the Barclays all of the Russell all of\nAnything that you're going to end the extra money and\nSo if you have a hundred dollars you say I Want to have my money divided up so it's going to be a percentage will work with this index of percentage will work with that index of percentage work with this index a B C D E F G I Want a certain percentage allocated in these areas\nAnd some of your writing are saying oh my goodness I could never figure that out we know that\nWe we get it that's what we're here for because I Want to tell you something we can't figure it out either\nAnd I'll tell you something else those guys on Wall street they can't figure it out either it is a crap shoot it's going to Las Vegas and throwing the dice across that table and hoping that you come up all winter\nSo the beauty of it is as you spread the indexes across the board one's going to win who's going to win three is going to when you're going to be a winner if there's a loser in that doesn't make any difference you're not going to suffer the loss is just going to be an area where you won't make as much on it\nBut you're never going to have a loss never going to have a loss never going to have a loss\nOkay that's the index is how the indexes work fixed\nNever lose any money indexed means your money is going to work with the indices of the markets across the board according to how you want to spread it out with our help and being able to help you figure out which way you want to go with that are linked talk to the home offices of the companies that provide these products see what's been working best for them\nWe do all that for ya annuity fixed indexed annuity what does that mean well and annuity is very simple it's a stipend\nIt's a stipend in and you or something that's going to pay you an income for lifetime and by the way these products are over two thousand years old not as you see 'em today\nSo lots of money lots of money as a terrible thing by the way I Want you to think about some when you're walking around and you have some money in your pocket and reach down your hand and you pull it back out again in a few bills slip out on the ground [noise]\nUm is that money last well the only way of lost his if it goes down a sewer drain a risk girl squirrel comes that grabs it and he runs often eats it or something like that then that money's lost any other time when somebody runs by it picks up that money\nIs not lost his just reposition and\nSo when you lose money on the market place you have not lost money you've lost your possession of that money and somebody else has now taken possession of your money because you're gamble on those stocks bonds or mutual funds are treasuries that you put your money into\nIt was a loser and you're lost it and now somebody else has it how does that feel\nI'm being sarcastic about it right now the tone of voice because it doesn't feel good I've been there\nDone it\nBeen there done it did it once didn't do it twice didn't do it the third time didn't need\nTo I found out that it's not the way for me to go\nI don't want to own a bunch of real estate because I don't want to have to work in my retirement my retirement is for me to do something that I Want to do not run round fixing toilets loose faucets and trying to repair a roof\nSo that I I can keep some profits outta that real estate no no no no no that's not me that that's just not me I Want to know that my money in my fixed indexed annuities are going to provide an income for my wife\nMy precious Robin after I'm gone from the earth\nAfter the lord has taken me home\nIf we she and I are ruptured out of this world and I just up and die or I Want to know that she's taking care of the rest of her life and the only way as long as I've been in the money business the only way I can ensure that\nIs if I could leave her Fifteen to twenty million dollars\nSet up in a trust fund\nThere would allocate that money to come out to her\n\nSo much a year so it couldn't be outspent and she's not a spendthrift but it's hard to budget money like that and it would take that much if I were to die and now I'm Seventy one my wife is young I won't say her age\nShe's not a kid I ain't married teeny bopper you know but she's younger than me okay and if she was to live to be eighty five Ninety years old or need help at the house to take care of her if I'm not here takes a lot of money to be able to do that\nSo I have my money and fixed indexed annuities and the fixed indexed annuities will provide an income\nFor Robin for the rest of her life my precious little Robin for the rest of her life for as long as she lives and uh she passes away before she's used to all the money\nThen that money that's left over it goes on to hurt beneficiaries or our beneficiaries\nTo do with as they choose okay to do with

thirty percent\nTo start up a we had a pretty good move on that a lot of people took advantage of it a lot of people didn't because just too good to be true\nThey think it's just too good to be true well all those policies have been issued now and they've all come into our office they're starting to finally all come in to us\nAnd I'm going to tell you exactly what took place was some of 'em three hundred thousand dollar plans came in that we saw with folks they moved their four one K. is\nTs peas are IRAs or they just had a chunk of money but three hundred thousand dollars you got to thirty percent bonus that was Ninety thousand dollar bonus added to their plans very first day did you get that no\nBecause you didn't give us a call you didn't come and see is that it happened [laughter] it

advisor whatever they may be I'm going to challenge you to ask them this these simple questions you know while my money is with you\nHow much are you charging me a quarter\nAnd what does that come out to a year on the balance of my plan that I have with you my stocks or mutual funds or whatever it is you have your IRAs that you have with them that's at risk [noise]\nNow once you find that out now I Want you to ask them is how much do I lose on average every year what did I start with and where am I Am now\nAnd now when you get that number I Want you to ask them the next question\nWell okay with the money that you're managing for me right now if I were to convert this into income how much income can you promised me and I guarantee that's in writing that it will pay me\nFor the rest of my life and when I die that income goes to my spouse for the rest of their life\nHow much can you guarantee me and I'll tell you what you know hey first of all you know there's always going to be fees and here\nUm you know 'cause we you know there's nothing for free will you know there's a fee well is there a fee even if I'm losing money well of course because as being managed for you or you're not doing very good job managing ... that should be that answer number two well\nEyes wide open I have more money than what I've got when I first started with your number number also why as it is worth a whole lot more than ... ...\n... it is right now you've told me I've been making twenty four twenty five percent I Want to see where that's at but even if I've done that okay I'm sixty five I'm

clients um prospective clients you know this radio show golly we've been doing this show my son and I for over a decade coming on Thirteen Years been in business right here in San Antonio for\nComing up on twenty eight years hard to believe but then it's hard to believe that I'm also Seventy one years old I stayed at the beginning of our last hour when we started out on this last hour I talked about what our core beliefs are not among go back and I'm going to re regroup on that do it again\nBecause it's important as you're listening to the show that you understand\nWho I Am\nAnd who my son is who we are as a family my wife my children my granddaughter we all have a deep profound love for God and for our savior Jesus Christ and that's because we believe that everything we own everything we have\nEverything that we take advantage of it as a gift from God\nWe believe it and we know it okay\nI Believe and I understand that I Know to the depths of me\nWith all my fiber of me all those little particles that have come together to make up me\nThat I Am a creation of God I started out on this earth is his creation\nI was born as his creation I was not born as his child nobody is nobody is born a child of God yeah I Do some preaching on here I Do some teaching on this financial radio show I'm not a preacher I'm a financial\nPlanner financial advisor whatever you want to call me that's what I Do been doing it well coming up I'm twenty eight years but\nI Believe that there's only one God there's only one God that created the whole universe put the stars up there the sun up there the moon up their\nCreated the earth created everything\nThat's on this earth that walks crawls swims flies\nCreated mankind\nHe stayed at a couple of times in genesis that he was sorry he even invented that ... that he ever created mankind he was so sorry that either\nDestroyed all of mankind except for NOAA\nAnd those select family\nBut God does love us he loves us so much he loves his 'cause he has the desire to be loved\nAnd he loves us so much that he gave up his only be gotten son to die on the cross for us so that is we believe in him\nWe become his select chosen and we can have everlasting life and now we become the adopted children of God now\nWe're God's Children no longer his creation and all of our sins of our transgressions\nWill be buried in the deepest sees deeper than the deepest sees and deeper than the deepest sense of the deepest sees never again to be raised and remembered\nThat's a gift that's the most precious gift mankind has ever received well that's my core belief now\nDown to what this radio show is all about this radio show is all about your money and retiring\nIs your money in the marketplace jumping up and down all over everywhere just bounce in every where have you been getting concerned have you been getting scared about what's gonna happen huh\nYou know what's gonna happen if if Trump loses this next election coming up Trump's not going to lose the election but it's going to be a big loss for him if the Republicans don't win this November sixth election yeah it's going to be a big loss for the president\nHe's my president he's my president\nCan you think of anybody who's ever accomplished as much in that presidential seat has\nHe has\nNo nobody ever has he is amazing what he has done\nHere's another thing look at him he's not even an aging\nThrough this most presidents that would have done what he's done in this past year and a half plus they had been warned to frazzled their haired me falling out their bill wrinkled up they all prone defied\nHaired be all turning gray on them\nWell we know why the Donald ... term great you know has it taken care of [laughter] that's okay he is eccentric is a billionaire and he's a self made billionaire I ask you a question how dumb could a man be or a woman be that as a self made billionaire\nI don't care if they had little financial boost to get started\nQuestion is how they finished one he's finishing with all his money and more than ever started out with billions now I got another question for you how many presidents have ever stepped into that seat\nAnd done all things this man is accomplished and not taking anything but a dollar while they were in the presidential office there's been one or two one or two I don't think Kennedy took a pay check I don't think he did [noise]\nUm there's been one or two others didn't when I was going to tell you right now the Clinton's did they took all they get and then so they're still taking but anyway that's another story I digress away from my financial radio show\nI Know it so [laughter] that's that's because I have to um just because I Can't stand it if it don't so now let's talk about bonuses\nHow would you like to know that you could get twenty two percent bonus on your money from the very first day a hundred thousand dollars you'd be start out starting out earning interest with a hundred and twenty two thousand and how would you like to know that you would never lose any of that money\nUnless you take it out and spend it how would you like know that yes it's possible no\nIt's not too good to be true yes we've been doing this for years yes I've been talking about it for over a decade right here on this radio show has the\nBonus always been twenty two percent know it used to be Fifteen Percent had it always been a Fifteen Percent bonus on this one product know it started out as a ten percent bonus years ago years ago\nWent from a ten percent bonus to a Fifteen Percent bonus to a twenty percent bonus to eight twenty two percent bonus\nOver a course of long years even went up to thirty percent bonus in that thirty percent bonus just came off last month they just took it away and reduce the facts twenty two percent I think about those people that took advantage of that thirty percent bonus baby I want to tell you was\nDo you have insurance on your health insurance on your

go on roller coasters\nI don't like to write up because I'm always anticipate what's gonna happen when I get to the top [noise]\n\nStock market is no different than roller coaster\nWhen you get to the top how many of your fast enough to jump out for that thing starts heading down again\n\nMany times it's not even a jump out spot because all of us are busy working why doesn't that broke or give you a call or manage your money to the point where he gets you out of that last possession ... it's the answer is as plain as the nose on our faces\nBecause they have too many people\nTo notify and to manage and to take out of those positions as they go into a lost there's too many and the next reason is is because if they did take everybody out and closer vice accounts out or move their monies to another plan they still may lose but as they take it out completely those guys don't get paid any more\nThey get paid while the monies in there even if it's losing\nTheir five hundred thousand dollars you lose a hundred thousand dollars you're down to four hundred thousand does that mean that your guy this manager money doesn't get paid any more no he still gets paid he just gets paid on a little less\nWhen your money goes into a fixed indexed annuity do I get paid absolutely I get paid but am I commission against your money no I'm not I get paid directly from the companies that we send the

points was that the first time this year no how many other times that go down there are all ... the whole year's been up it's been a tough year\nBeen a tough year\nThat we ever seen this before yes again and again and again you remember two thousand date do you think that the world financial system has moved away from those severe questions have problems of two thousand eight do you really think that\nI don't I don't\nWhen I listen to the IMF and the IMF the international money fund\nSays that there has to be and there will be a massive financial adjustment in the world because of the global debt of all the nations\nWhen I hear that kind of talk that says to me lamps Lance\nYou better not be keeping your money on the banks boy\nVeteran I be having any money invested in these funds out there that are at risk I Need to be putting more money into my fixed indexed annuities because in the history of the United states that I can remember\nAnd as far back as I can research in history with money annuities are the only things that they were protected money not even a hole in the ground would protect your money\nNo because it's going to get moldy and rock go put it onto your mattress the mice and get it\n[laughter] I [laughter]\nHave a fire to burn down [laughter] oh that's terrible thing I don't even want to think about that but you know no way you're going to have you might protected historically is in annuities\nThat's what you need to do you want to know how you can get away from paying from paying taxes at the end of every year that you make money of capital gains taxes you need to have a fixed indexed annuity\nDo you have to pay taxes on your money if it's in a fixed indexed annuity only when you use it\nOnly when you use it\nBecause it's tax deferred no capital gains taxes it earns tax deferred of those some tax advantages for you I think so as a fixed indexed annuity magic no\nIs it probably one of the best financial instruments out there in the world for retirement absolutely it is\nAbsolutely well a fixed indexed annuity work with a trust yes will will trust work with a fixed indexed annuity yes it will\nDo you have a fixed indexed annuity in your portfolio probably not if you do and it isn't doing as well as you think it should be doing give us a call will review it will examine that we'll see if we can do better for you if we can't we won't\nThat simple what do we charge you are in our offices of the nothing what do we charge you in our office for a commission nothing we get paid directly from the companies that we do business with\nSo this comes down to something is very very very very basic you want to know that you can have your money guaranteed to not lose you can get a guaranteed interest rate on it\nIn one plan\nYou can get a guaranteed bonus on it in another plan and then another plan you can get a guaranteed interest rate and a bonus\nAnd in another plan I can get you as much as ... percent plus a bonus ten percent a year every year on your money and guarantee you that you can't lose any money\nI Would think right now the only thing stopping you from doing that would be that you don't have my phone
