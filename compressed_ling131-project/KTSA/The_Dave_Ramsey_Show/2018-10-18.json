TSA dot com oh you'll see it right there on the front page a few more minutes here we'll get to the poor results like I said we were talking about the the charter amendments and um\nAll kinds of very serious things on the show today but our question was actually about horror movies and this popped into my head because yesterday we were talking about uh the new Halloween movie [noise]\nUm and I was mentioning that I liked the original which I think it was what\nNineteen Seventy eight or Seventy nine something like that probably about Seventy eight [noise]\nUm and I was kind of looking forward to seeing this I'm not so sure now I've actually read the reviews\nThat really rip it that really hate it and some I don't know that that of course you gotta take that with a grain of salt because the people who review movies no offense but they tend to be a little what's the word I'm looking for should not be\nAbout movies and a horror movie is not an are a great artistic achievement I mean what's the best thing you can say about a horror movie cinematic leave that its wealth photograph door it has good special effects may be occasionally some really GOOD Music it's not it's not a high mark set a high water mark\nIn movie making\nI was thinking about why I'm\nI'm much more a fan of the horror movies of my youth than I Am of the horror movies today and I probably already figured this out\nIt probably is because horror movies are best seen when you're young [noise] in other words all horror movies have plot holes you could drive a truck through\nSo you have to be willing to suspend reality and belief in critical thinking just to enjoy any harm movie or what it is probably when you're young and you have a lot of like insecurities and you're just\nFinding out finding out who you are and\nFinding out about yourself and sexuality and other people and\nThat's probably when you're you're sort of like primed for the horror movie experience so to me these movies were the best ones that have a roommate and that today's don't hold a candle to Freddie Krueger and\nMichael Meyers but maybe that's just because when I was that age I was the right guy or at the right point in my life to be seeing those movies and if I was that age today maybe today's movies would seem like the best ones ever made so I guess I kind of rethought\nThat analysis but I I now I'm not so sure now I think maybe instead of going to see the new Halloween movie I should use the occasion of the new Halloween movie\nJust go ahead and watch the original Halloween again 'cause that's the other thing about a good Halloween movie no matter how many times you've seen it and no matter how many times you know what's about to pop out of that cupboard\nOr fall out of that ceiling\nOr who's going to climb through that window it's still makes you jump right and that's the thing about a horror movie that that allows us to forgive awful acting\nAn endless list of cliches stupid absolutely unsympathetic characters we love that moment where we jump right you love that moment where they get you they trick you they love you and then they\nMake you jump and I don't know if it's an age thing or not but I think you're just most primes to to get that kind of a movie\nWhen you're ... what would you say between the ages of maybe like I dunno fourteen and somewhere in your early to mid twenties that life starts to do a little number on you and you know soon you're\nYou're analyzing the plot and you're analyzing the lighting and your [laughter] well I sing the cinematography and then you're not having fun

you live just outside of state College Pennsylvania called welcome to Nashville\nI guess and here I Know that free scream yes I'm not sure we paid off three hundred and eighty thousand dollars oh my goodness how long does take twenty two month\nOkay and you're a range of income is it was about four hundred and Fifteen thousand dollars a year okay my goodness gracious what in the world do you do I'm an emergency room physician\nOkay so you're an MD yes okay and you're working your brains out yes and I'm three eighty was had to be med school to about two hundred\nAnd sixty I was in student loans and about one when he was on mortgage\nYour house and everything yeah wow how are you thirty one how long you been out of school ah about three years okay so you come out of med school and a kind of a ... a year or so it goes by but then right after that you decided to attract the stuff with a vengeance tell me the story my goodness\nYeah well I finished it was actually residency three years ago and when I came out I started going to a church that was doing financial peace university and some of my friends were taking it and talking about it and saying great things\nAnd so I decided to download your audio book total money make over ... and started listening to it and I think that turning point for me was when I got to the point about the debt snowball and lifting your debt\nBecause up until that point I had been just doing everything they tried to avoid thinking about it it was stressful and I just I didn't even want to it you know deal with it and I walked on and I saw that in the past three years I had been pain about Thirteen thousand dollars a year\nAnd about Fifteen thousand dollars a year it was occurring in interest every year so I really wasn't even making a debt and and the student loans and so I knew something needed to change I Need to get serious especially being\nIn my late twenties at the time and single\nI didn't want to have this burden looming over my head for the next decade or two and certainly if I got married and had a family in the future I didn't want to bring that burden into that\nWere you paid off a ridiculous amount of that with a ridiculously wonderful income so you hum wow okay so you you finished residency\nAnd really about a year went by before you started this right yeah roughly year okay where did you come straight out and go into ER yeah yeah Microsoft as an emergency medicine so you were making box already mhm but then you just when you shut down to the math on this you went oh I can do this\nYeah I just realized that something absolutely needed to change because I just I couldn't live like that anymore\nWow look at you and just do what I mean you just do them now do you take a lot of extra time at a yard to in order to get the income and this was one of the ... you are position makes\nSo I actually went to my boss and asked if I could work all night shift in the ER and I did that for the entire twenties too much pointing months because it paid significantly more to work nights\nYou know is it it's just that the Amir double in it uh it's about twenty percent more an hour to twenty percent more okay All right but wow so you really sacrifice to get this done people think you were losing your mind I mean your family your doctor your really enjoy your life I mean yeah the one thing I heard a lot of\nWas in regards to find a new car because I was still driving a used car for medical school at that point might be and how are you did it right and so my friends and family but tell me you know you're crazy you can afford a new car you can afford a car payment and I would tell them no I really just want to save and not by my next door with cash and probably be a used car and they thought I was not\nYeah well you know you wonder I Know I mean you might foreign fishing doesn't you know pretty much ...\nLooking but this is amazing story very well done thank you very well done\nWell you did exactly what I Try to get doctors to do\nMost dogs come out and go finally worked all this time I've gone to school my whole break in life mhm I deserve a new house or a new car I deserve a trip\nAnd they spend money like water you've seen them do it oh yeah definitely and I it's crazy understood all you do would you use kept living like a broke college student\nYeah and I think that was really the key to getting out of that was just to keep living like a resident while I was in his first few years out because that was really the easiest time to do it and so I think that was probably the most important stuff that I took\nYou know 'cause now I mean you make three hundred four hundred and five hundred wherever you make it it's you're going to be unbelievably weapon so you said your how thirty thirty one thirty want all\nThis fabulous income congratulations I guess I'm so proud of you who was your biggest cheerleader I Know you had to have good tractors that was easy yeah but who is the biggest cheerleader or I Would\nSay my parents or my mom had followed you\nFor years and also people in my church family as well because they I talk a lot of them are encouraging me to look into because they knew I had a lot of student loans\nYeah yeah so I mean you went from being completely crushed by student loan debt completely own in it\nYeah I felt like I was suffocating under the day I remember being so scared when I was sitting there and actually looking at the balance is and I didn't know if it was even going to be possible to get out but I didn't really have\nAn other planets I figured I'm just going to go with you know Dave Ramsey and stick with it and just commit to it and see what happens in twenty two months later in the final payment\nYeah you paid off almost two hundred thousand a year for two years ... ... you were on which is pretty incredible but you're making four Fifteen minus taxes which takes a big chunk of it she weren't living you weren't you weren't splurging on anything now are you weren't starving to death but you weren't splurging\nAnd and just completely lean to show as you're going along you're hitting us thing when you're hitting it almost twenty thousand bucks a month yeah I'm Fifteen to twenty a month to only given month at what point when you started doing that did you go wait a minute this is actually going to work\nHow far in more you before the before kind of the ... which kind of flipped for you\nWell I paid off all the smallest lens first I had a total of twenty different student loans and so they wanted to attack the smallest ones first and then once I saw how easy it was to do that and then I started to have\nSome more hope that that would be at what a pay off the largest ones I think my largest individual alone was right around fifty thousand dollars and prior to that I just looked at it and it was like there was no way like there's I'm not going to be able to do that\nSo your trunk and some of these like one or two a month yeah knocking them off the little baby ones when you first started yeah and that yeah but I had to give you a lot of emotional ... definitely debt snowball really kicked in for you then they did what he was supposed to do it let you know that this is going to work\nMhm wow wow wow wow wow wow\nAll right so what is the big takeaway when someone says oh I'm I'm a ... year hundreds of thousands I Can't get out of debt you say yes you can here's what you do you do this\nI think the most important thing is\nJust to stop running from it stop trying to hide from it like I was trying to do um I was I just felt crushed and it was you know so afraid that I Would never get a day and I once I faced it and once I took personal responsibility for it\nAnd you realize that I'm the one who signed the papers ... you know I Need to get myself out uh then I just made a plan and stuck with it and made the commitment to change or your parents' good with money\nAnd they are their income as much less I'm sure they know what mine is bad learn most\nAnd if we should be thrown into something that's strictly tied retirement what you see what we have a lot of or is it would be better to put that into something more accessible like a like a managed a like a some kind of a managed fund that can be accessed tired to retirement if if need be\nWe call those bridge funds um yeah at some point I Would go there but I think you've got some\nLeading up to do y'all been pretty sloppy you make a lot of money to be as broke as you are um how long have you been making that kinda money\nOn the last couple of years okay it's it's it's time to clean up the rest of this mess then you know is Raj them checks today and pay off student loan the car you got to pay off both of them yeah yeah good let's do that today and then you need to have your emergency fond of three to six months of expenses not\nIncome three to six months of expenses and uh that's what we call taken you through baby step three which lays the foundation for a solid financial plan your debt free and you have your rainy day fund\nExcept your home okay then we move on to what we call baby steps for five and six do you have children\nNo not right now okay then ah we would baby steps for is Fifteen Percent\nOf your income going into retirement that's not much with what you guys make but it's a good start and it's not going to keep you from retiring in doing the bridge stuff later which I'm going to come back to and actually do what you want to do but I'm going to do it in the right order\nUm [noise] once you're doing that then maybe step father's kids' college that does not apply here maybe step six pay off your house early Emory job or knock the house out beyond that which is has the same effect to your net worth\nThe bridge loan does because having your home paid off frees you up and enables you to need a lot less income\nTo retire before you can access the retirement funds okay now then once the house is paid off which really did how much do you own your home\nAll the good old two eighty\nOkay if you do what I'm Talking about here probably in about five years maybe seven before you're forty or how she's going to be paid off\nAnd by then you're probably making two two and a quarter if you're on a normal career track maybe even more okay so your income is increasing your debt one hundred percent debt free before you're forty now we can do a lot of stuff\nAnd I have a single parent in the world mathematically one Seventy five two and a quarter or whatever it is coming in\nNow you max out retirement and you build other wealth which will have this effect you're looking for of what we call the ... bridge financing his or bridge savings or bridge investing bridge between age fifty two and\nYou know if you wanted to have enough to and to do some stuff with before them but the whole idea of being that we're going to build wealth as a result\nOf having no payments\nTo go with your fabulous income uh your most powerful wealth building tool is your income we've just finished a study here that Chris Hogan is doing a book on a ... of the largest study of millionaires ever done and what we find is as they pay off their home in an average of ten point two years\nMost of them do not make as much as you make\nThe vast majority of millionaires don't make as much as you make\n'em and then they steadily invest in there for one k.'s and once that's maxed out they do other investing in just good mutual funds or by some real estate that you pay cash for the income producing or something like that where you've got some other moneys that you've got access to\nThat is not return not all caught up in retirement\nAnd so you're thinking right I just put it to the back on the line as to the front on the line on when you're going to get to it\nUm and you'll get there faster if you'll go the way I'm Talking about in the way you're talking about

always fun to be with you the smart conference in Kansas City last weekend phenomenal you did a great job presenting that really connected didn't\nThank you yes it uh it it was exciting to see people jot down some of the things we were talking about that practically allow them to get where they want to be you know that I mean that we can all envision a mountain top\nBut then it gets real scary when we started thinking about how do I scale that mountain top and as we talked a lot about the proximity principal and gave people some ideas on the right people to be around and and the right places that need to be in\nBecause if you want to do something to be in the proximity of that same as it is here to the proximity principles simply says in order to do what I Want to do you fill in the blank that I've got to be around people who are doing that\nAnd in places where that is happening so think about that when I'm Around the right people they all point to the to the right places and then when I go in those places and were specifically looking for three things in the right places where I can learn or I can do\nAnd where I can connect\nAnd Dave when I'm In the right places I inevitably going to be more of the right people and so it becomes this cyclical process that is so profoundly simple\nIt should demystify the path to getting where I Want to go you're an example and here's what's great about this no matter how successful you get your always practicing the proximity principle you're continuously looking to get around the right people whether it be for personal reasons are professional reasons you like to sit down billionaires want to learn things about these men and women\nYou know and you're constantly thinking about what are the places I Need to be an where's Ramsey solutions need to be this is a very simple principle that no matter where you're at in life if you want to get somewhere you have to practice proximity\nYou know I've noticed that happening here in our little a bird outside of Nashville Franklin, Tennessee has has ended up becoming a melting pot for people who write\n... in the self improvement Spanish central and who are who speak in the self improvement space\nI mean I've been here all along or Mike Hi it a ... has been in the ... a friend of mine down the road Donald Miller moved here in the last couple of years or in from Oregon ... from the ... moved here about the time that book took off there's probably a handful of others that I'm just not even thinking in Richmond right now\nI'm but I'm a ... a lot of movement and it just seems to be this thing happening and it's like an almost like an artist community like Asheville North Carolina very much an art community now and you get around things and the people\nAnd the places that something's happening and then you have a better chance of pulling it off center and uh it's not that the Donald Miller or die ranger Mike I interact are already in every day we certainly don't but we all know each other and we all interacted and we've all helped each other that's one way or another ah sometimes it's just a drop by nothing real fancy but it is a very much\nAll within about five miles of each other you know as an example\nYeah it it here's what happens when you get around like minded people\nThen there is a natural\nA force if you will it's almost magnetic\nThat they are going to pull you into their or of a little bit just by their example and you you know there ... there was a guy that you and I both admire I never had the chance to meet him Charles tremendous Jones you know it's a famous saying that said you know who you are five years from now is largely dependent on the books you read\nAnd the people you meet and we've also heard the age old colonialism that nobody can attribute it to anybody but it's not\nWhat you know it's who you know who you know so again what we've done here on the show with with helping people try to\nDemystify or take away the fear of getting where they want to go is by showing them this is a process is not going to happen overnight\nIt might take you four years of putting yourself in proximity to the right person\nFor me to have you know my story you watched it from afar eight years\nEight years of small itty bitty baby steps\nAre of putting myself around the right people and in the right places doing the hard work learning being humble hustling stain hungry and then you get an opportunity at some point everybody's story is different but as I said Saturday Kansas City in the crowd kind of laughed at this\nI'm not selling microwaves on the Ken Coleman show were selling good old fashioned crock pot it's the slow cook that tell meat is best prepared at tell me does best consume there's something to the slow cook that really will allow us to fully develop and fully be who we want to be and it's going to take some time\nVery cool good stuff All right let's jump in Ryan

last six years I've been able to replace a labor I make a living now but I'm just I'm kind of off the ... question it is that I mean\nI don't know I mean it it it is it bad to plateau like that it it if I'm if I'm content and but there's definitely ruler grow so my question I guess was a ... I'm not sure which direction to head because I'm going to spot where I'm fairly happy\nBut why are they so tell me why you're happy defiant briefly\nWell I think possibly and I messed up as a lot maybe greener digging up off the blade but I'm I'm happy to be I brought my business close to home I don't travel a lot anymore and I'm In a time and I get the money there too\nSo well congratulations well it's almost like you're feeling a little guilty\nFor being content you know days purchased contentment Rachel cruise almost wrote an entire book on content that content that does not mean\nThat you're in a bad place I think you're happy you're thankful you're you're grateful you've been able to work hard and get into a new space I think what you're feeling is the itch to continue to challenge yourself and by the way that is also a good feeling you can be content meaning I'm grateful for what I have\nBut I'm not happy with who I Am so I'm very content I\nI'm honestly living the dream this is the greatest time of my professional life I'm having a blast\nHowever I'm not happy with who I Am as a husband I'm not happy with who I Am as a father meaning I can be better so I can be can be ... and grateful but also want to continue to improve you got a great business I don't I think you know I think\nYou become a successful yeah anyway the mouse to regulations weld on\nUm the thing I did when I kind of hit the same place you are was I started the first stage of business and you've passed it substantially is to take care of your family and to survive on the end for the business to survive and what you get her ... once you get past the desperation of that stuff", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "city": "San Antonio", "day": "18"}
