do they look at you while they're doing it\nAnd they're telling you one thing and doing the exact opposite\nI've seen it daily day in day out in my time and experience both working for Governor Perry

barriers improving roads clearing Cain making your way cameras making sure our band more border patrol agents\nWe would have had a vastly improved the immigration system to your question that would've been point based merit based helps provide the labor needed for businesses which is so critically important but yet would have decreased and reduce this chain migration the diversity visas that have

six votes I don't believe that single democratic while there wasn't money\nAnd a very much on party line vote\nWe're close that was twenty two votes away and Republican leadership didn't even with it they didn't even try to pass it they didn't ask the president's support it instead they asked them to support a worst bill and it got a hundred and Twenty one votes\nIf I'm In Washington I'm going to be fighting to make sure our Republican majority fights to do what you just said and pass that bill because we need we got border patrol agents down there that I talked to a guy who's down on the

to fight for the same principles no matter who's in power um I I firmly believe that uh that we've got a good possibility to be able to go lead in the house representatives or if the Republicans are backing control to do the right thing I think there's a lot of lessons that have been learned\nUm but I'm happy to sports in Jordan who supported me and frankly he's running a campaign for speaker

giving me unless there's something we left out of this equation so thank you for the call Josh is with us in Los Angeles Hi Josh how are you\nGood how are you doing Dave better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] not too much I've got a question for you among baby steps which it pay off my house early [laughter]\nUm [noise] I don't have any other debt inside my house I have a six month emergency fun um but I kinda did all your stuff out of order because I've never really liked that but anyway um I have a hundred and sixty four thousand dollars less to pay off my house\nBut I also have about a hundred thousand dollars invested in mutual fund and stuff like that and I'm curious\nWould it be wiser to um take that hundred thousand dollars out of my personal investment put that all important to the house and then just pay off the remaining sixty four thousand or should I leave that money invested and the money that I have every month just accelerate payments on my house\n... what's your household income\nUh probably about a hundred and fifty thousand\nSo you could be like debt free and when you were if you did this\nUh um yeah yeah I'd be done by the end of next year I'm sure if I if I took the hundred thousand for the court house\nOkay if your house was paid for and you didn't have any money and investments would you borrow a hundred thousand on your home to putting investments know same thing in um I don't follow okay\nWell I mean if you have a hundred thousand dollars in an investment and you take it out of the investment in order to put in and pay off your home that's the same thing in reverse if you didn't do that it's the same thing as if you if you leave it in the investment it's the same thing is borrowing on your home to invest isn't it\nGot it yes\nOkay so it's a balance sheet equation meaning that balance sheet is where you list your assets on one side of the pager liabilities on the other side of the page\nAnd right and you can switch them back and forth by borrowing money\nMeaning if you were sitting there with no investments paid for house you could you could borrow money and put you know money you got that over there on that one side of the page but on the other side of the ... now you'd have an investment right\nAnd all I'm doing is on doing that by asking the question in reverse though it's a bit of a trick I kind of courage to uh the trick is that it makes you think not just with your head but also with your heart and I always like to think of when my my head is where I Do math in my heart for a major risk\nAnd your real risk averse you hate that like I Do yeah\nAnd so the idea of borrowing on a paid for house chagrin investment is absurd and your mind\nYeah\nI mean you immediately reacted but that's a hard thing she that's where that's at risk bart this ... that you're measuring this causing you do that you didn't stop and do math you went you recoiled and went whoa that's crazy in your mind right you know\nAnd that that but and and start by asking it in reverse so all of that to say yes I Do the hundred grand at it in a heartbeat I assume this is not in a retirement account no penalties right\n[noise] um no that that hundred thousand is just her someone back right yeah and it only say it I mean you're talking about the head and the heart just with\nThe mathematics of it ... if you ... if I if you put risk getting the mathematics of it and it changes the mathematics and so and and so your\nHeart is actually correct your heart is helping you do a complete measure the mountain\nAnd so yeah so I take the money out of there told him how somebody dead for in a year and she's actually went under [noise]\nThe guy just Blake Johnson's senior executive producer of the day Ramsey show this hour of the show is

looking for some guidance on some things calm so we don't have very much that we've got about twelve thousand two hundred on a car that's worth about nine or should she got twenty three hundred in student loan debt and then we have our house mhm\nUm we bring home between four thousand I'm forty two hundred a month [laughter] um and she's looking she's not really thought if I were their job a career path and she's done a majority of our cars coursework to get an associate from wanting to see 'em about where that would fit into step um\n'cause she's my extended family to an hour right now part time but she gets forty hours a week with some benefit\nI'm ... and the programs that she's looking at\nA radiology attack which would take her about two years to get done in a that's a made us our ... year\nA lab technician more take about a year to get done with our current the stuff that would transpire and she'd been making thirty eight thousand after that or an HR specialists or take are about three years of a shout out of the last you know choice of hers to get done so\nWell you know we're not we're not that much debt and I just didn't know where we should focus on first ...\nWell the first thing is I hear a wide variety of jobs elections here or course yeah she doesn't even\nTowards the rat pack as their number one it's a really good program here in the local area it's a short nap\nYeah you know what I think I hear that you guys are analyzing her career only on the short term income\nUm what's your thinking long term she she right now she works in er HR 'em and surely enjoyed the she is a metal do you\nWant to be ten years from now aside from income\nUm or fat man come she likes Oregon with people and she she was really excited about the rat pack that because we did a site there that are kind of a an orientation type thing and she really enjoyed the the teachers in a facility than they are they weren't on people in that way so of the three I think that will be the best long term for\nMore and there wasn't a two year program did you say Oh yes sir and we're not at all the way\nAnd uh the cheapest term insurance you can buy his term insurance for one year based on your age that year and then it adjusts up every year as you get older okay that's the cheapest term policy by the year\nFor one year it's not the cheapest way to buy it over ten years or Twenty years okay but you know if you buy just based on your age this year\nSo you're paying in X number of dollars\nSome of it is going to buy the life insurance and some of those going to the investment that we've already ascertain just doing poorly okay and less and less every year is going to the investment more and more is going to the insurance because your insurance costs as increasing every year because they are the have you noticed that as well\n[noise] I have not\nOkay and uh because ... and so what we have always suggested that I don't sell any of this I don't give a crap but here's the math on it I have found that a Fifteen to twenty year level term policy locks in and gives you less expensive term insurance\nAnd when you invest the money directly into the mutual fund you don't have the extra fees and you get a better net of fees return\nThat makes sense and does plus when you die with the Wii U L they're going to pay the face and keep your investment that's the worst part of it\nSo it's a horrible playing when you die but ah it's just really bad while you're alive and it gets really worse when you die show what I Would suggest you do is get the proper amount of term insurance in place and then drop this garbage into your investing somewhere else does that make sense\nIt does I think the reason I haven't done that yet because of the surrender charges\nWell you're you've already bought that I mean you're just did that just right you've got ripped and this also means you probably need a new financial advisor because I think I think you have a life insurance salesman this calling himself a financial advisor it's certainly possible\n[laughter] ... it doesn't sound like most of the people in the mutual fund moral don't solve this crap\nThat they had on the actual funds and some of them sell term insurance too but most of them do selfish crap does nobody believes in this garbage except the life insurance people nobody anymore nobody there's no one in the financial arena in the financial spaces as by whole live life insurance or by the cash value in terms of any kind of there is no one out there\nThey're they're just the cost of math is just so horrible and you figured that part out but this guy's doing smoke and mirrors and hadn't the pea under shell and keeping you confused as to teaching you\n'cause he knows if you've ever understood at that you drop it in him to probably so I'm thinking you need a new advisor and you need to get some term insurance in place you need to drop this garbage that's what I Would do\nThanks
