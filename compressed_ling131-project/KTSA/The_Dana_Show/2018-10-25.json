S. N. B. C. contributor so that would that stupid [noise] um the other thing\nThat I'm\nLooking at is how the package that were sent for instance the one that was sent to John Brennan CNN has six stamps on it and none of the stance have posted marks this wasn't mailed\nThis was hand deliver and\nIs it true that if you're ... if you're emailing if you're sending a package and it's like this heavy do you got to put it in a box or do you can you just put it and like the puppy out because I'm getting both sides of that on on\nSocial media do you does it have to go into a box or do you have to and the reason that I Am because I'm at well but it's almost a moot at this point because it wasn't\nIt was it was it was handled it right it wasn't mailed\nI mean that I Can't and I don't know if\nHe picks his enough it's six stamps enough of this because it's a steel parts on it this is the ... at this particular image that the picture that they showed an eye on is that what was in the package\nThat has some heavy metal parts on it that doesn't steal parts on it so uh that seems like it would be a little too heavy for just stick stamps\nI don't I'm just me\nUm but we don't know how much it actually wait which I'm sure they'll let that no I you know they're gonna they're gonna be looking at every\nBit of a closed circuit footage possible they are going to be looking at every bit of footage possible\nSo\nThis is a no yeah that somebody had said yeah the great big ah video hunt against that is true it does now yeah but but I've never\nI've never gotten anything through any postal service that didn't have markets all over it someone said well some of them are invisible marking now they're not they're not stop there or not they are\nIs that a couple of people who have message may just literally just since like we've been on breaking who worked in one retired and won\nAnd I'd say that actively still and they and they had said that they would have marks on them if it was mailed\nAnd and and the one who still works are brought up the fact that it wasn't in a box so even if they had brought it and I thought they would not have mailed it being that heavy if it was a heavy metal item unless it was in a box so that's why I bring that up\nWhich is sort of scripts actually covered it which we don't really know but\nThe where you are not able to reuse stamps is because they put those markings on their friend you might not be able to feed them with the naked eye but under black white or other environments you can see it well you have to market so you don't reuse the\nAnd there's nothing on us so a ... and I I think that's you know it's important to ah the other thing with this is an ... is the\n... and I'm\nThankful that nothing detonated and I'm sure we're going to hear more information about uh about all of it nothing detonated\nAnd\nI'm just still I mean we're getting more and more developments in the president's apparently are going to be making some remarks about this and we'll take it live when it happens\nBut and I'm looking here I see another I see another uh a picture of it of the device um I mean it's a pipe bomb I mean that's that I mean that's deal that yeah the the the individual\nThat I was referring to a message me and said they still work with the post office had said if you're going to mail something if you know not pipeline if you're going to mail a heavy piece of metal like that\nThan it would be you would you would have to put it in a box they're not going to just lay stuff it and one of those little bubbly on blip some and mail it and that's just not going to happen but I still say this is I Do think ah\nI Do think that this is absolutely I mean it's some sort of um it is domestic terrorism I don't know how she put it it's domestic terrorism\nSo fairly and the I mean and it is a goodness so we're going to continue watching this this ah this this story as it unfolds 'cause we're still getting developments them\nAnd I don't want to engage in the speculation that bill de Blasio and Andrew Cuomo engaged in um earlier when they were giving press their press conference I'm I'm I'm not going to engage in that kind of speculation that's ridiculous\nWe're not doing that um but this I'm telling you it is a it is\n... yeah ... I mean ... I mean six stance for the weight of a steel pipes fix stamps for the weight of a steel pipe\nI just don't I don't see that I don't know\nI I someone also so Bryan on social media was also saint hard to determine the explosive weight but it couldn't have been much\nSo I this yeah I Am just really you've had this you have rice and that was sent well suspected rice and to Trump\nTo James Mattis to Christopher Wray Gina Haspel Heather Wilson to John Richardson earlier this month\nUm and then just when if they determine uh who sent this\nThen\nI mean this is just getting out of hand this is just getting out of hand I mean this is you know just come on just come on and it but but and that was that was\nThose were actual that was the actual domestic terrorism too I think this is also domestic terrorism\n\nSo we will uh\nWe're gonna we'll continue seeing and said it will continue following these developments as we get them there was um apparently so now apparently a suspicious package was intercepted by Capitol Hill police and it was addressed to Maxine Waters according to\nSeveral sources this as per a B. C.\nSo this is\nA\nThis so they sent to Massey where I and I don't know if this is the same it we don't know anything about it at All right now at this particular point except that that was just it was intercepted in a it was sent a Capitol Hill police got it\nAnd and we'll see I'm sure we'll get more information more development as to whether or not it was like what we have seen with the Brennan package and with that pipe bomb et cetera\nBut I'm just I mean it is just completely getting out of hand at this point um\nKnow we have more car insurance\nOf free or radio after she connected anywhere you go more than just your favorite radio stations all over the country this first allies radio was your favorite artists and your favorite artist and he was stationed with all that artist spend all your favorite music all your favorite fishes all free our radio\n[laughter]\nWhere [noise] good for America\nMornings five children by fifth EKG essay FM\nOne o seven on Hi this is Jack regarding your GPS say what they want it online at J.

business speculating because that's not what the shows about but at least\nI can express that speculation on my part okay you go ahead and you 'cause you're speculating over there yeah and that's exactly what it is because obviously I don't have any proof and that's kind of how it's designed\nA up to this point because if you notice this will take a while before we really get all the answers on how this all happened in whatever my guess is it will take longer than a fix for midterms to get here\nAnd this is an effort on the left with the coordination of the media to do this and this this is how I Believe now\nI'm only basing this on my experience on how the left acts of politically okay so your idea\nSo this is this is basically my speculation but event that you're that yes you know it's not your supposed to be clear but ... I I Can't help but think that not only was this coordinated which is what you believe what it was coordinated\nIn an effort to help the left as we enter into mid to less than two weeks out and they don't mind making a big hubbub about stuff like this they don't mind ruining the guy's life\nAre being appointed to the Supreme Court they don't mind doing any of that stuff that's how I feel about it and that's how I think this is\n... ... well\nAnd so you have all these questions about jeeze why stamps Jews wise wider wires and both ... everything looks dumb and hope to see because of exactly how what I'm Talking about\nI definitely understand that there is that\nThere is that sentiment out there I\nStill think it's too just like I think it's too early to be able to say yes that is absolutely the ISIS flag on this\n... at least ... you know what I'm saying is I'm speculating and I'm being honest about the fact that I'm speculating though don't really have any tangible proof to back it just tobacco what I'm saying but it's just\nToo coincidental for me to just sit back and believe all of a sudden less than two weeks out from mid term this is what happens like all of a sudden dumpster tart like they've been way more violent before if someone truly was going to retaliate against the Democrats would have been way before now\nOr in regards to how they've acted since twenty sixteen since from from one of the electorate so to me this is too convenient of timing on the swallowing the idea that it's anybody from the right during the ...

I only have enough information to say yeah this is organized because but not motive that you do you think you have a motive my\nGosh I mean what are we seeing says twenty sixteen antifa and others blowing up buildings um assaulting people are being violent stopping traffic consulting people who dared\nDrive on the road I mean all this stuff is the left never condemns as a matter of fact they've actually said most recently that all that's different than what the violence on the right as theirs is justified because they're\nThey're against you know Nazis and white support whatever they decide as the justification\nSo they've literally been violent all the way up to this point and now here we are less than two weeks out from midterm and all of a sudden the right\nDecides to be violent there's no there's no logical sense for me on this nobody from the right is going to be doing this any way as a matter of fact of the bombings that we know most recently how many of them were you know right leaning\nInsult anyway so I just don't buy it and I know that what we're doing here on the show today is just chasing facts and and that's exactly what we're supposed to be doing but I I just can't I'm not I don't buy it yet I'm Still convinced that this is this was a coordinated effort\nOn the political left alone with the media because again CNN really\nYeah everyone knows what the ratings are no one cares about CNN but\nThis is you know again I just watch CNN is giving a ton of clicks today I Wonder what you know right right you know it's just so there's so much for me honestly speculating level to see that this isn't this isn't the\nIf I went crazy you know what I mean what I'm thinking is that this was a coordinated thing and although I don't have any proof you know again I'm stupid for speculating\nBut I was there for it I just don't have enough there\nAre ... there isn't enough there but this is what at this moment I Believe\nOkay make them believe that yeah yeah you can believe it\n[noise] ah [noise]\nBut I still think that we don't know enough I we don't ... other than it's although there was um what was it the um\nOne lock them are covered by the had noted\nThat\nThis was it there was like a flag that was on at an ISIS flag on that was the one that was central Brennan I have seen a million people say that it\nBut it looks like it'll be one of their own their own looks almost like it but you want to verify because we're not frogs are gay we like we want to verify\n[noise] but you know there it is the\nMost popular since ... little ... ... are you so much speculation as a little ...\nA little bit so no I'm not saying I just think it's too early I just think it's too early\nAs think it's really convenient time and I just think it's really widespread so that the size of it as a question or the motive is in question do you know what I mean I just think there's a lot of this\nAh because we don't know which was you know that leads to the reason why I Believe what I Believe I'm a less they have something out there because again the ratio of violent left these\nUm Mm it's much larger we all know this is just prove these are facts even though the media doesn't want that to be the message because look we're less than two weeks off from it or if you have to understand how the game is played we've seen this long enough and that's

looking into the couriers that were used to drop off some of these packages like the packages like the one that was at CNN um apparently it was when they say it was hand delivered at the store us residents\nI read one report that said it was placed in the mailbox I'd I have not seen any reports where and it stated it that a courier was used but I Would imagine that they're going to be able to find\nA if there was a courier used if it was a service or if it was somebody through the postal service um I Would I'm pretty sure they'd be able to find who paid for that\nUm anyway and and a figure out if I'm ...\nBasically who organized at at cetera from there I haven't heard any more developments in terms of new packages being discovered\nI haven't seen any more of those so that um\nYou know more of their there have been no I mean that I I haven't seen any can't have you I have not seen any other developments of other uh packages it would be aware and are so high you would think we and I'm watching I'm watching everything and I will call Andrew Cuomo had said earlier that\nThis was that he had received a ... device and quote\nBut that\nIt was um ended up the NYPD said it was a an

but all that aside we see something that looks like a bomb middle of the people that are nationally known and political figures it needs to be treated that way until ... found out was\nTo you it doesn't look in one and one of the reasons I asked Mrs because for an eye on one of the photos there there were reporters at buzzfeed and again I none of that was confirmed it all just a reporter speculate\nThis looks like the ISIS flag or look what this looks like and then they were kind of everybody was kind of debating as to what they thought the skill level was and therefore\nHow much of a danger that individual posed because I mean is that is that a fair assessment to think that if it's a more sophisticated looking device in the person's probably more dangerous than just you know some uh what what might look like at first glance some kind of not job more on that can't is not really doing anything well thankfully\nIt it is but at the same time that doesn't really get us anywhere if we sit here and go oh this person is it that dangerous let's say you know something blows up because we didn't read it that way\nSo it's not I mean I understand people's curiosity and understand the need to talk about this even this early but at the end of the day there are things that appear to be bombs making their way all the way to the president of in some cases a very influential people which means this is a dangerous person um you know does it take a rocket scientist\nTo use a gun make a bomb use tools that are out there really what it comes down through the Turing and the I think finding bad people rooting ruled out\nEvery hitting them and getting them away from any opportunity to do things like this I mean you know we talk about borrowers all the time you can't legislate your way out of an explosive threats all the walls are already there it's illegal\nBut at the same time all the tools or very most readily available fortunately we were first and then we can look up ways\nTo make bombs legal so at the end of the day we have to rely on law enforcement to do their job support them raise a flag when we see something suspicious and then will dissect how effective this person was or was it hopefully not very effective at all\nOr maybe by the end of the day that person can be apprehended um so you know what if we're talking about this picture that surface the looks to be a bomb\nNo it doesn't look like something that would be very effective but if you compare bombs in Iraq and Afghanistan the more simpler bombs had a higher success rate because if you've ever played the game outstrip the more complicated than it is the more can go wrong\nOn so there's a lot of ways to spend this and look at it as a bomb or looking at that picture my expert opinion would be this is probably not a full of explosive device but there's no way for me to make that you know with any confidence without being right there on it and have more information\nRight well

it\nEither anything in your mailbox I don't care who you are that's your mailbox I just does not I don't that's it's your mailbox that's just bothers me so I don't know and and I'm sure\nWith I mean if their careers involved are going to find out who's doing what\nAnd\nHopefully I Would imagine what the technology and the tracking abilities available to our uh different departments\nI Would imagine that this is going to be that that they'll find the people responsible I Would say relatively quickly I just don't see how some I just don't see how you invaded and with all the technology
