{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KTSA", "content": "A hand ways big tech can shift to millions of votes in the upcoming election without anyone knowing and I asked them if they can shift upwards of twelve million\nVotes with knowing having the slightest idea they're being manipulated and without leaving the paper trail so we're in a new world and we have to start to think in New ways and this is a big\nBig problem you cannot have basically one or two companies deciding what to play five billion people around the world see or do not see period that is out of the question so uh you know\nWhat you're asking me for all the details and what does that he has gone looked like\nNo no not not all the details dog you know what I'm saying is if if the two primary kinds of organizations in his eye that we could throw in third the third would be private nonprofit then there's private for profit and then there's government and so if you say well we'll do it with some other mechanism well\nBut but but it has to be one of those three forms of you said well let's let the Internet decide so I'll throw you one\nShould I be able to access information that disparaging the prophet Mohammed will leave it up to the Internet well\nAre there are three hundred million people in America and they're one point five billion Muslims on planet earth\nHow do you suppose the vote on that is going to go uh for my X. being able to access articles critical of the prophet Mohammed or against my ability to access information because I'm assuming that you're also suggesting it's not just the decision by the United states but a decision by the whole world because the Internet is made up\nOf the whole world although we play a predominant role in it\n[noise] well again you use your ear to ear raising very very important issues you know what what what happened with the IRS under Obama was horrible despicable\nA you know but the system works right of the system works because after all they are accountable to the public and it was found out and you know ... ...\n... you know he didn't work and here's why\nAll they had to do was delayed that free speech past the twenty twelve election and you had the effect now I don't know what the effect would have been if a lot of four of free speech groups had been able to fully voice their concerns they're conservative concerns prior to twenty eleven twenty twenty twelve election but perhaps\nMitt Romney would have been president instead of Rocco bomber from twenty twelve maybe not\nI don't know if it would have shifted that many votes but it might have changed a change number of votes in Congress in the in the house and the Senate and and it might have had that effect but we'll never know you say well we eventually have and their their voice but they've got their voice after the twenty twelve election so\nI I I Can't I couldn't possibly argue with you on that because I happen to agree with you what is this your ear talking about old stuff and you're going to old systems I'm Talking about news stuff I look at numbers every day that would scare you so much you would not get out of bed in the morning\nI Am telling you just by searched suggestions alone those little suggestions they flash at you when you start to type a search term yeah they can turn at fifty fifty split among undecided voters into a Ninety ten split with no what knowing they'd been manipulated\nSeeing what's funny is ... ... lately we've all been preoccupied with people who say well somebody's going to break into the computer system to count the votes or or tallies the votes\nAnd that sounds like small stuff don't even mess with that just play with people's minds make sure I see that on somebody Google said that they get the right kind of results instead of the wrong kind of results and you shift more votes without ever touching the ballots\nExactly that that stuff is kids stuff uh you know a fake news stories as\nKids stuff a Russian placed targeted ads kids stuff we're talking about tiny tiny tiny little manipulations which are inherently competitive when I'm Talking about is the platform itself wants to shift thinking or wants to shift so what do you do when the platform itself wants to do it there's no way you can counteract what they're doing\nYou can't even you can't even detect it I mean I'm working with people now on three continents to develop monitoring systems so we can actually keep an eye on what these companies are showing us I'm tell you we we have to start to think in New ways either new threats that humanity has never faced before\nI'm I'm certainly willing to go there Dr obscene I'm just trying to imagine something that gives them government isn't private nonprofit isn't private for profit but it's something brand new doctor I've seen it's a pleasure thanks so much for the time tonight\nThank you so much there's always a pleasure you but you're listening to the Lars Larson show law

previously\nOf the new roller the new leadership and Saudi Arabia and had\nWritten a a ... a bunch of uh Jamal attests August had written things about the crown prince of Saudi crown prince and he was a legal resident of the United states have lived in both as symbol and in London and so he was in Turkey\nAnd he was apparently visiting the Saudi uh the uh embassy or consulate there he was visiting the consulate in St assemble and then he just liked disappeared\nOff the face of the earth day just disappear and Turkish authorities say\nWell he was murdered and they said they had recordings proving that he was murdered and there were some pretty gruesome rumors going around about how and they were blaming some Saudis that had entered turkey\nNot long before a democracy soggy disappeared and and they left and they think you know the Saudis say no it's not us we didn't do it so it's kind of going back and forth and\nSo this is the ... because this now could affect two different alliances actually three different ... says the U.S Saudi Arabian alliance the Turkish Saudi Arabia alliance and the United states in Turkish alliance\nWhich you know I don't I have my complaints about art on particularly when he beat protestors so but the the fact that this guy was a legal\nResident of the United states changes things\nAnd he apparently like the only thing that he did that would have invoked the Saudi crown princes ras\nIs to have written about him in a negative light and so the Turkish officials said this is why he disappeared\nAnd so there you go so you have there are some senators that want a an investigation and in fact we have some audio here because had an hour it was was asked about this\nDuring a a press conference and they don't really know a whole lot more than what you were reading in the press apparently and it's you know do you believe the Saudis do you believe turkey um and this is Heather now or is it is the state department spokesman on this uh this is when she was asked about it\n[noise] twenty of Seventeen\nEarlier this week or the vice president has talked about this the president has talked about this we're all concerned about his whereabouts we don't have any information on his whereabouts right now for what happened to him\nAs you can see anytime you turn on the news you open the newspaper there is a lot of speculation and there are a ton of rumors out there we're making determinations and watching this for facts we don't have the facts yet and so we're going to hold back on her comments until we have\nConcrete information that the U.S government can share\nWell which is and that's true so now there are some senators and it's a bipartisan group they want the Saudis sanctioned and because they believe that they are complicit in his disappearance Rand Paul wants to stop arms sales and military assistance to Saudi Arabia\nUm and in fact over at Brookings they noted that the royal Saudi air force is entirely dependent upon on American and British support for air fleet of us if teens Apache isn't tornado aircraft pieces of either Washington or London halt the flow of logistics the the royal start Saudi air force it'd be grounded\nAnd this\nYou also have to take into consideration how Iran would benefit from this because it hasn't been one of the things and I think this is a really good point to make 'em that that Matthew Continetti over it Free Beacon noted and I hadn't thought about this previously but it said look what Iran it you know they haven't really been brought up in relation to ... as a hobby but\nIt's a factor because they are pressing up against the Saudis on multiple fronts they fostered sheer rebellion with the kingdom itself and in Bahrain\nThey've armed into bed at who the who have been going back and forth with the Saudis are and they're at its proxies actually are on the cusp of victory in Syria basically control in Lebanon and they've shown chaos in Iraq\nIran's European allies are attempting to create a financial lifeline that would provide relief from us sanctions\nAnd Saudi Arabia has been the lynchpin of America's Middle East strategy for close to a century\nBut that relationship has not been without costs Continetti note what would it cost the if the alliance fractured the Saudis would be imperiled in Yemen potentially endangering the free flow of traffic in the Gulf of Aden Iranian victory would extend a Shia crescent to the south\nAnd the company the one running through Iraq and Syria and Lebanon\nShow\nTrump said that Saudi Arabia wouldn't last two weeks without American Sport\n\nAnd it says it and and Continetti no to the middle east and live on our already filled with examples of state failure is America prepared to risk another study meltdown would deprive the United states of a counter terror ally it would royal energy markets and create pockets of instability in which the hottest an Iranian backed militias thrive\nAnd it would also make of that for Israel to show they say to forestall such a disaster the Saudis like others before the might turn to Russia or China for support\nThat then would accelerate the waning of American influence in the middle east and boost the very autocracies we condemn\nShow\nYou have to weigh evidence and consider how you would punish them if it turns out they acted like Russia or China or North Korea or Syria or Iraq or Iran\nThis is it's not as cut and dry\nThe new ones but nuances debt so for a lot of people it's black or white\nOne or the other one or two a or
