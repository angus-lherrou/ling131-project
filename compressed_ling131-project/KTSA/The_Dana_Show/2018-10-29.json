increase to one percent\nSo there's there's just no way you would have riots industry member in Europe when they were cutting or some of the social benefits and there were then and there were riots by young people you know they were they were talking about the especially they like retirement benefits and everything else\nAnd the young people were writing there were setting cars on fire how dare you take away all of our free stuff well imagine you know an economy our size\nAnd we get to the point that we can't service that debt anymore\nWell remember it was one open that door it was the jet I mind trick of rock Obama as president but that's not a problem\nWell today the the economy isn't collapsing but it will then I compare to chew saying well you're bedrooms on fire but you're in the kitchen yeah everything's fine\nOn an economics I'm On a tax cuts yeah the Republican Party is moving more conservative\nOn spending uh on on the on tariffs and we're not talking about China we're talking about the other ones and no we're moving in the Republican Party is moving in a more socialist right a a a a a position remembers we brought you friday the Commerce Department numbers and a half\nOf the increase we're talking about the increase in the GDP half of that increase is due to government spending ... not not the private market booming now half of it is the private market and preventing and we agree with that\nBut we look at what's coming down the pike here with what Republicans have done and we're extremely concerned about where the economy is going to go\nBut to me when we talked about you know for example tariffs to get and you've got is as I said on friday have conservative lost their economic mind ...\nBecause you have people that are conservatives that would absolutely be against the increased a government causing the increase in prices in goods and services because the goods are going up\nAnd they're claiming that's a that's a good thing that will actually make an economy do better actually two responses on that on friday\nNo no no no no tears makes the economy better no it doesn't know we live in this and so people that were conservative I rent is delusional state of increasing\nPrices helps the economy it doesn't\nIt helps the ... the companies or the industry that it's designed to protect beyond that no\nBut when we get to I mean we've been talking about the blame game in the whole civility thing because on many issues out there we talked about stability when we talk about look you need to get along with everybody well let's talk about the issues you and I taught gone down this road before when we looked at what the leftist promoting in this country right now and what they're promoting is something that we can't compromise\nOn there is no compromise and if there is no compromise what do you do as a nation on sanctuary cities sorry not going to permit sanctuary cities I'd open borders there is no compromise on open borders there is no compromise on sanctuary cities\nKnow where do you go there is no compromise on due process under the law there is no compromise on the presumption of innocence now there is no

hand refer\n\nAnd is your money and I'm Mary McNamara eight six six Ninety or\nRead I welcome in good morning you know when we have a a horrific shootings in this country mass shootings in this country a ... ... and being in that this is going into my thirtieth your talk radio\nA ... and one thing has never changed ... so many so many of us and I think now more led by the left\nOf more than the right we seem to think that when one of these things happens that there is a solution to the problem\nThat we just did this these things won't happen anymore if we just had gun control if we if we got rid of all the guns if\nWe um a a tone down our rhetoric and if we got rid of the guns if we'd toned down our our our rhetoric if we uh made sure that people that had mental problems\nCouldn't get guns and we go through this time after time year after year and I understand why people do it because the unknown scares us\n\nNow why these things happen scares us I mean what what happened in Pittsburgh scares anybody that you could be a you know in your place of worship and somebody would come in with a a gun or and just indiscriminately killed people because of whatever reason\nAnd so many Americans because it's so horrifying look for a solution\nBut the reality is when you have three hundred and thirty million people when you have a third of a billion people in your country\nYou're going to have some people that do this irrespective of what the law is it's going to happen\nAnd when I\nSee the you know the the blame game\nGoing on I just I look at it and I say\nWhen I first became a talk show host you know I was part of you know who's you know who to blame let's go back and forth back and forth and it does nothing it's an exercise in futility\nIt really is there are things that happen that we can't do anything about well and now\nNow we now we can if we wish to live in a much more authoritarian society\nWell there's there's many issues that we could uh and and very severe a potentially deadly concerns that we could do are we allowed to the authorities to walk into homes and and check on children\nRead will\nYes without any information or any kind of of ah you know that a suspicion whatsoever just at will open doors and start looking to make sure that there are no abuse children\nAnd that home\nKnow do when you when you hear these horrific stories of children being tied up and you know locked in cages a rooms or closets and are being starved and and all of this well that there are many we could if we want it to allow that in our society\nWe could just say okay authorities canal just walk into homes at will\nAnd to just to see if any crime has been broken or committed\nYou in one of the neighbors are of the shooter the synagogue shooter was was talking on you know Fox News saying\nI didn't even have any there was no clue that this guy was it was a white supremacist I I didn't know and I wish there was a way to you know to tell I Wish there was a way how do you know what even in a person's heart I mean maybe ... people close to them do um but\nThen beyond that how do you know\nHow do you change their heart ... and how do you predict whether or not because there are plenty of people filled with actual hate\nWhen we don't mean people on social media just talking you know negatively about someone we mean people filled with actual hate that are potentially deadly well there are a number of laws we could pass to keep because\nUh you uh you know this guy was on a apparently a a social media site I'd never heard of a that was ... was a social media site for white supremacists\nAnd\nOkay so your we could say that participation in such a site or is against the law we could say that I'm speaking out with hatred in your heart ... hatred\nFor groups of people are based on their ethnicity or or or culture that's against the law we could pass a number of laws send it I mean how do you change your freedom\nOf speech ... part of the reasons that freedom of speech speech exist is so people do proclaim what they think so you know who they are you know exactly how they all you do by taking away their free speech rights as what you send them underground that's what you\nDo and and when there's pressure from you know society because the reason maybe I'm guessing the reason and I think it's a solid theory here that the neighbor wasn't aware of of this kind of you know hatred in this\nPerson's heart is because in our society\nWe don't tolerate it morally speaking forget about the legality of it all forget about what can be done legally morally we don't tolerate that because the overwhelming majority of people don't have this kind of hatred and evil than there are no\nAnd you cannot ... and and that's what it comes down to there's there's no way of knowing for what ever reason whatever motivation a person might have\nI mean think of all of the reasons that might be stated a in terms of the motivation of of any\nMass killer in our history\nWell the list is very long [noise] you know I I was just I was going through the headlines are just yesterday just in real clear politics and and it was a it was just really interesting a Donald Trump is a shameless liar\nThat's the headline of an article written by former president for rock Obama got his mind with us or no one family Detroit News be honest we hate each other\nBut the one I like the most was Justin Fox Bloomberg's headline if you ignore the news\nAmerica actually seems pretty nice if you ignore the new view ignore the news it seems pretty nuts well I I just I thought it was you know I didn't even read the article I just I saw it but I but it's it's something that you and I talked about before where\nWe've we've
