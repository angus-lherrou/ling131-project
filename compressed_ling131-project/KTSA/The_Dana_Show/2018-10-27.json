Maryland to the district of Columbia to Florida to California\nAnd as it always does the FBI responded with every resource we've got including our joint terrorism task forces are counterterrorism division in our world renowned experts at the FBI lab in Quantico\nBut by then I I really can't underscore this enough we did not act alone\nAs you can see from the agencies and departments represented up here today a threat of this scope of this magnitude requires all of us working shoulder to shoulder and today's arrest is a testament\nTo the strength of our partnerships and what we can do when we all work together\nI Want to acknowledge the many partners who helped in recovering and transporting these I these two are lab in Quantico this is dangerous and highly skilled

which is essentially potential explosives in material they give off sheet and energy through a reaction to heat shock or friction\nThough we're still analyzing the devices in our laboratory these are not hoax devices\nI Want to focus for a moment on the amazing work a lot of folks at the FBI lab based on their initial analysis they uncovered relating fingerprints from one of the envelopes containing an ID that had been sent to congresswoman Maxine Waters\nWe have confirmed this fingerprint is that ... or say\nThere is also a possible DNA connection between samples collected for pieces of two different IDs mailed in separate envelopes and a sample previously collected from say Iraq in connection with an earlier arrest down in Florida\nThis is phenomenal work with the greatest pressure\nUnder an incredibly tight timeframe\nWe see unbelievable work like this on TV and an Hollywood but just see it up close in reality is something to behold and we are so proud of our team at the lab for their work and keeping people safe and helping us to find the individual responsible\nLate last night we also turns to our partners in the Florida department of law enforcement for confirmation of this DNA connection and we want to thank them in particular for they're very quick word\nI also want to thank the men and women of the FBI's counterterrorism division who remain on
