{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KTSA", "content": "What are the what is the more surprising things that they've come up with so far that impressed you\nWell I just think that you know first or just you always are just struck by the incredible complexity of the brain of built in terms of details on details details\nThe the amazing way that the the brain wires itself up a a you know during development in the ... the fetus is is an amazing thing uh and and then just trying to understand trying to come with the techniques or understand how\nHow function really happened so it's there's just a vast array of things that you ... are endlessly fascinating\nOf course you've you've had your own medical challenges as well so I'm sure the medical end the practical end up where we might apply this to help people get past\nSome of the challenges they run into is is a piece of that as well\nRight and and we we have thousands of people accessing the database every day and a lot of those ... are working on a Bronx for the future that could potentially treat diseases and you can look for a correlation between a a gene a gene that might be related to\nDisease and and show how that gene expresses itself in the brain and then and what areas of the right it might be expressed in and all this is available online in a three dimensional graphics outlets so you can you can look at particular genes but the ... of the brain a ... we just think it's a tremendous resource for scientists to develop new treatments new drugs\nI Would imagine that day is a very useful or scientists how how useful as a jar or how understandable is it for the rest of us who are laid\nOff I mean I I think if you if you just got a line of looked at it you just a kind of be amazed by the by the complexity of of of the raw data there but I mean it's it doesn't have a lot of meaning unless you unless you focus on that particular\nThing and now there are certain genes that are for instance associate with certain capabilities like language and so if you ... like that that might be associated with a subset of verbal uh the genes would differentiate us from from other apes for example you could say well where are those genes expressed in the\nIn the brain and that might start to let you narrow in and try to figure out how how language works just as just as one example\nYou know it's interesting a couple of weeks ago we ... we talked to a gentleman I think it's a you'd written the hot zone originally in which is a book about biological\nUh you know about to diseases like Ebola and more recently has written a book called a panic on level four would you just go a collection of different things and he was saying there's a there's a disease involving the brain where\nThey determined that it simply ... you know the what is it ... side of the scene into the for a a components of makeup of the uh the uh um the ... the DNA that said that one of those letters is out of place just one out of the entire double he likes and\nIt causes a virtually catastrophic change in the human being that it occurs in\nThat's right and some of these things are like Alzheimer's or other disease conditions it you know something gets turned on and and starts to a malfunction later in our lives run on reason so hopefully the the brain that lets lets people narrow it on the on the genes related to the onset of these things and then the ticket were areas that were that are affected so\nMy hope again is to just that this vast amount of information that we're\nThat we're putting on line um you know can uh give people inside and uh you know I\nI ask a kind of framing questions like how the Nobel Prizes have to be one before with you know or how many years would have to pass before we fully understand the brain and it's and it's really you know we're really talking at the minimum uh me and many multiple decades\nBefore we really understand but anything that can help them move that process for it I think is is a very good thing to focus I'm\nTalking to Paul Allen to co founder of Microsoft and also the head of the Allen Institute for brain science but you don't limit

I have just just starting on this I don't know if I sent you you guys this bit audio though so that's not even the same and I've talked\nA lot and we have um talked to an uncovered quite a bit about her ... her ancestry claims right\n[noise] uh because she has said she had this crazy story this really crazy story where she was talking about her family\nAnd she had said that\nIt was her mother who was Indian and her parents had to a low so that's a little bit more than ancestry I don't think I gave that I don't think I gave that to you guys and she did this um\nShe did this interview this was when when was this this was back in two thousand and twelve that she did this interview\nAnd it was with I don't remember who was and she was asked about this listen to the story\nActually you're right or wrong about what it is I Believe was starting to look at\nMom and dad fall or very much in love with each other and they wanted to get married and my father's parents sense absolutely not [laughter] you can't marry her because she's part Cherokee she's for self aware and um [noise] after fighting as long as they could my parents went off they loved it was an issue when I write\nWhat so\nWhat that that's not so she actually was saying that her mother was Indian\nShe wasn't just Elizabeth Warren wasn't just saying that she had ancestors do you see how she's trying to subtly move the goalposts she was saying that she was Native American\nFurthermore she actually began in the eighties identifying herself as a minority she did physically herself\nShe changed documentation first off you know the Palau chow book that she plagiarized back in the day I said this back into the Elizabeth Warren who [noise] there's a lot about her ancestry and this news her new attempt at defending it just blew up our face\nA she submitted recipes to a Native American cookbook called powwow child there were plagiarize recipes from a French chef and she said that they were her native families longtime recipes and she signed it Elizabeth Warren Cherokee now that's not enough for you\nWait there's more with the purchase of one slap job you get a slap shot free\nSo she changed her identification on her academic documentation she actually began identifying herself as a member of a protected class\n\nShe identified herself she changed it and she actually checked the box for Native American she changed her ethnicity from white to Native American when she was at University of Pennsylvania's law school and I was in the eighties\nAnd then she changed it was going to Harvard and that was at the time when all these companies were encouraged to diversify their hiring\nSo she actually changed and check literally checked the box and began identifying that\nSo when we come back she's demanding a Trump give her a million dollars because she said she proves she was in it she had ancestry well she never said ancestry\nShe said that she was Native American but since she was one one thousand than something or other that's about nine hundred and some odd dollars out of a million so maybe he should just donate that we're going to we're going to get into that as well and

pushing the show\nIt also gave you [noise]\nA general who is incredible he drank a little bit too much [noise]\nYou know I'm Talking about [noise]\nSo Robert really it was a great general\nAbraham Lincoln developed a phobia he couldn't be Robert ...\nHe was going to have you know the answer but Robert Lee was wondering bottle after the battle of the battle and they randomly give jam all reason I did read Robert really are they at all of these generals\nThey look like they were the top of this last West Point we're the greatest people there's only one problem they didn't know how to held when they didn't know how to find [noise] they didn't know how\nThe way he explains history as a riot it is hysterical so he was in Ohio right he's in Ohio and he was talking about a wheel is is this grand was from Ohio and he was gone you know talking about somebody notable from the state it's at her cetera so\nHe in this story because everyone's like the proof that he's racist he's each of these the nice things about really proof that he's races he was actually talking about how he said yeah he was saying Robert ... he was a good general but Ulysses Grant was greater\nAnd that's how we ended up losing here's the thing I don't think that people didn't here said that him saying this is racist and this might be it stretches like pat and\nBeing called a racist because he believed that rumble was a decent general or a good general you can hate Nazi ism but recognize them one at least understand strategy so you got to make sure that you you beat the crap out of them\nAnd here's the thing with Robert ... Robert he was a West Point grad\nHe was um well respected for his understanding of battle\nAnd I guess maybe they don't teach history and I don't know I saw a bunch of verified check marks everybody was freaking out all these media people they were saying that he was praising Robert Haley what he was saying was that Ulysses Grant was better and it was just Ohio and it was better and that's you know what happened\nBut the fact that they tried to make them like a racist I guess underscores the fact that these people either don't understand history because they weren't taught it or they're trying to be purposely ignorant\nBecause Robert he when he was asked he was given um a role of of a a general over the forces the unions forces before the civil war\nAnd they tried to recruit him and he was actually Robert he wrote a bunch of stuff against slavery he was not for secession he was not for he was a\nVery much I've very reluctant he took ... days to think about this the reason ultimately that he ended up working with the confederacy is because he did not want to bear arms against his home state of Virginia\nAnd you know a divided his family it was but they did and then afterwards even he\nHe wrote a lot of stuff about unity and restoring the union et cetera et cetera he was very very reluctant\nAnd people I guess don't understand that portion of its history the no one wants to believe the secondary storyline or any nuance because it's all a bunch of gotcha BS is what it is it's so stupid I'm this is I'm telling you what this is another example of all of this tribalism dummy everybody down\nHow dumber you that you are wrong with that spin on this it was ... and it was everywhere oh my gosh you guys it was absolutely everywhere\nI've never seen such a thing I mean it let me read this ... this was a reporter was this oh this is one of the guys at CNN hero Trump's comments tonight calling the leader of the Confederate Army quote a great general multiple times\nWow wow\n[noise] this is so ridiculous I'm the first off he was praising grant he was talking about how uh the point of the whole story was how\nAbraham Lincoln chose a guy from Ohio to beat Robert ...\nThat was the whole point of his story this is purposeful deception\nAnd it wasn't just the CNN dude and all that I got more and more examples is so many more examples frail it wasn't just this guy was there was a ton of um\nNBC News that had to watch President Trump says Robert he leaves a great general during Ohio rally calling the Confederate leader incredible what they leave out is that he was talking about how Ulysses S as grant was better and that's why he was recruited to beat him\nAnd again going back to history Robert Daly was a West Point grad you could recognize that he was a good general and not agree with the cause for which he fought just like you can write going back to patent rumble patent could recognize that Romney was a worthy opponent\nWithout endorsing flipping not to use them how are some of these people\nDiscussion today stocks because people choose party and tribalism over intellectualism your tribalism is making you stupid\nEveryone says Trump is turning things into an eighty awkward see no no no no I think media is complete ignoring of nuance and they're dumping of everything down to just the simple as much tribal is reduction is what is making everyone stupid\nI mean it went on and on and on so many examples collections whole collections or Washington Post quote Trump calls\nCalls on blacks to honor him with votes in praise of Confederate General Robert ... that is so blatantly fall he was explaining how Lee was respected as a lead up to how grant defeated him oh my gosh\nStumped telling ya\nAnd there are tons of other journalists who did the same thing air showed us from a has a has a collection of media people who did the exact same thing all the people who were selectively editing his comments to feed the rage mob\nPhilip Rucker a set over at Washington Post at the same thing CNN David Corn seven thousand Ohioans soldiers fighting for the union were killed during the civil war Trump praises robbery the who led the troops that killed him and Trump's Ohio supporters cheer not that's deplorable\nAre you serious\nI mean they went over I mean all of these wrecked Newman rubber Brent Griffith is all of these all of these people\nAnd as I said the whole point\nAnd he he and his actual remarks and I'm just ... he said quote it gave you he's talking about Ohio when Ulysses S grant he said\nUh he goes and it also give you a general who was incredible he drank a little too much you know who I'm Talking about right so Robert ... was a great general and Abraham Lincoln developed a phobia and he couldn't beat Robert he and he was talking about battle after battle he said that he had all of his generals they look right there at the top of their class at West point\nAnd one day it was looking really bad and Lincoln said you hardly just knew his name and they said don't take him he's got a drinking problem and Lincoln said I don't care what problem he has you guys aren't winning and his name was grant general grant and he went in and lock the end he knock the hell out of everyone\nAnd we just all these fingers NASA will require goes see becoming famous coming out jumped yes no maybe anyway for your

literally\nTook when she got her DNA test this is from the story this geneticist quote your samples from Mexico Peru in Colombia to stand in for Native American\nWhat okay okay well okay\nIt's not like there's there is not any Cherokee that you know 'cause [noise] and\nAgain it was one one thousandth or something or other it's less than what European Americans have\nThat's the other thing it's less than what European Americans have which is wow\nAnd that was from New York Times piece that there was a a huge study that was done\nThis was goodness way says a couple of years ago\nAnd it said quote with respect to European Americans have percentages are much more different than African Americans or Latinos with America European American genomes being Ninety eight point six percent European point Nineteen percent African point Eighteen percent Native American hers is point zero nine\nSo it's actually less than European Americans and point zero nine percent let's make that clear because point zero nine is merely point your numbers ... percent that's [noise] that's pretty crazy\nSo it it's just it's just worse so she is an average white person who\nSaid that she was a Native Americans so she could get jobs because in Iran eighty seven is when she began changing her ethnicity on forms that she herself filled out\nWow yeah\nAnd so it was it was more goes well now I proved that you didn't prove anything actually and if she thinks that Donald Trump owes a million dollars because he said if you prove you're an Indian and she goes well I ... the ancestry no she was literally said she ... she was an Indian this is the most is is the dumbest\nThing ever were going to we got more on this and the latest the media the hill came out with a defense the stay with us\n[noise]\n... tell

is so I mean stop to stop to stop just stop\nThere is no defending it there is no defending it this is the ultimate white privilege when you have a bunch of media people going out and defending a white woman\nA white woman super white woman who is wider than most European Americans and that's according to New York times defending her appropriating a an entire ethnicity for game\nYeah [noise] so that's going to be I'm really interested to see how voters interpret her throw in her family under the bus I'm\nCurious about Ninety nine point nine one person what she really is like because it's really point zero nine percent that she is some sort of preview of Mexican descent but what's the other Ninety nine point and I'm doing them effort Ninety nine point nine one percent\nShe's something other than Indian\nShe's like wider than most right people she was like a Viking that story she's like she's super white I mean I've been saying that the bad thing I'm just I just think it's funny it's ultimate white privilege that they are defending her from you know\nI'm sure that the Boston Globe's going to have a another correction by the way that they didn't actually test her actual Native

anything\nOne one thousand and again wider because I'm trying to find this piece forget I have a ton of stuff in the New York times says that European Americans have genomes that were on average Ninety eight percent European Nineteen percent African and point Eighteen percent Native American and Elizabeth Warren is point oh nine percent\nSo she is wider than white you're European Americans and that's a New York times\nStudy so\nNow it is though Native Americans or think progress had a um they ran an op ed from a woman a Cherokee woman who is progressive\nUh Rebecca a ... and she was not\nShe has always been and this was\nGosh this is a a over a year ago she wrote as the un Cherokee woman one would assume that I Would take more inside and standing up against Trump's and I disagree that was a racist remark following the incident Warren lambasted the president telling MSNBC that Trump has done this over and over again thinking that he's going to shut me up\nAnd it hasn't worked in the past it's not going to work in the future a real Native American hero right wrong she was no hero to me when she fell to foster have enough support for native students with Harvard University's

now with this also used to take the smallest\nPortion of something and make that the example like it's the it's the anecdotal\nYou know science behind it all like you know they do that with you know how many abortions are done because of rape right less than one percent but they use that all the time as the reason for Ninety nine percent and it's down here with Elizabeth Warren she's using point zero nine percent of some ... background to prove that somebody knows\nAll of this is is getting into because she's she is strategy is posturing herself or twenty twenty or twenty twenty four and I I

winning I'm a bunch of different demos\nAnd it shows him pulling several points F head several points ahead I don't I I think it's it shows him seven points that I don't I think it's a lot tighter than seven points ahead um\nAnd but apparently it has the if the ... they call it the Kavanaugh fact um\nI if Dean Heller does and I said this on the show before if Dean Heller does stay on\nAnd he he wins this race there's no way in Haiti's that Democrats will ever take over in the Senate ever at all so the the in Arizona in Montana and the Senate those are the um those are the races that

[laughter]\nWhere are all ... all sluggish morals down on\nEither stray where joined me weekday\nMorning by Joel mindful latest news whether it's driving when they start by saying why\nShould do\nAs I told you before we went to break apparently not CNN is saying that\nThe Saudis are are preparing a report that will acknowledge ... death is that this journalist is a legal American resident who was a reporter at Washington Post who is critical of the Saudi a crown prince and uh the ... which is the leadership there\nAnd live it apparently what lived in Turkey was in Turkey and visited uh the Saudi embassy and assemble and then disappeared\nSo now what is being said is that CNN says the Saudis are preparing a report that will and knowledge ... death was the result of an interrogation that went wrong one that was intended to lead to his abduction from turkey this because of it stands a chance of being a huge\nForeign policy situation\nA particularly as I was sharing with you previously how you have um a a for instance of Yahoo News saying well a colleague at Washington Post says that may because Soviet disappeared because Saudi took Trump's remarks on the media seriously and I mean it was natural tweeted a verified account put out [noise]\nSo ... and then the New York times had the piece well this Trump has just clueless when it comes to the Saudi crown prince and they were saying that he put too much faith in the crown prince and this is the result he doesn't know foreign policy let's get to the bottom of this is Steven nice to have an actual foreign policy expert with DC I Do the international\nAre advisory and uh he previously advised\nFormer VP Dick Cheney and he joined us so often Steven always appreciate\nThe generosity with your time thank you for joining us today what\nI Know you I Know you've heard of this right now you're aware of it I I feel like they're ... it's been really politicized but either way it is I mean it's not great what is your take on this\nDay and I think it's a difficult but very very important to step back from things like this or realize\nHow incorrect and misleading initial reports almost always are even just in the last twenty four hours we've been getting some ... uh and then also just acknowledge\nEven those of us were legit experts we're dealing with a lot of uncertainties in a region that is far from a collection of fate\nOr like the middle east broadly speaking is not a real realm of black and white or you have more evil and less evil more danger in less danger and in some cases\nWe can get caught in a single case of destruction from what the greatest danger in the region is and in my view that's the bureaucrats in Iran\nOr does it mean Saudi or clean or just but we have to start from\nThe first reports are almost always wrong and I think that's likely the case here and that this is a much much more complicated a challenge in the region run an on off switch with military support for Saudi Arabia why some of our friendly senators upper goes so far\nYeah and I I've seen a lot of knee jerk reaction ... within some in a certain political party or were they failed this should mean sanctions on Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia said if there's any sanctions you know obviously that's going to disrupt a the oil market et cetera there's already been warnings of that um but at the same time\nI mean isn't this this also still seems I I feel like this is really being seized upon by all of those people mad that the Iran deal was deconstructed under this administration and this is just to try to it and I mean from where I see it\n... it trying to tip the balance of power in that region from Saudi Arabia to Iran is that kind of also happening here there's like a ... there's there's some sub plots happening\nThere are a and from from my point of view there is an extension of Trump's arrangements syndrome that leads people to\nVery disgusting Lee in my view cheer for some of the worst people in the world in getting an advantage over America and our allies in the region a book I'm I'm completely open to the possibility that the Saudi Arabia government is involved in\nThis potential murder a but let's what the evidence come in and then let's deal with it within the context of this is an outrageous act against one person or it crosses a several line who should be dealt with seriously\nBut when you're dealing not just with oil prices but we're a potential resurgence of terrorist networks and the broader Middle East failure\nWhat has been a counter movement is in Syria or that may be leading to some semblance of stability there but maybe not a and that the rivalry for mastery in the middle east is\nIs one where an Iranian takeover is devastating to American interests in my view a and so we have to keep I think those broader equities in mind that that doesn't mean that the Saudis or anyone else get the past we just have to kind of keep perspective\nOn how big of a threat to our national interest is this potential murder a nurses' V. other potential millions of lives at stake and other major national interests\nYeah yeah and and yeah I I I agree how it you know it's keeping that in mind if I say and just to explore at the United states work to\nA dead end in association with the Saudi Saudi Arabia or ... you know put for sanctions et cetera et cetera\nUh what does that do to the region and what does that do to Saudi Arabia's ability to push back against as you were talking about kind of another proxy war with all of these different groups you know who these in the rebel groups have been fighting in Syria a ... and and against Iran which of course has Russia as\nAs you know it's caused a benefactor and what does that did it what does that do to their chance to be able to kind of be stable in that realm and that and that are in that part of the world\nWell number one it would during the Saudis from B. or at least somewhat customers and collaborators with the United states to them turning to the Chinese and the Russians\nAnd for in terms of germ and the military a development and there are broader interest in the region and if you happen to like the very destabilizing influences that Russia and China have been in the broader Middle East\nYou would add fuel to that by going down that road though you may say in principle we have to because it's such an outrage\nFair judgment but the but you have to weigh it reasonable estimation of what the pros and cons are uh I think that it it basically puts permanently and place of Charlotte saw it in Syria which maybe is going to be the case anyway\nBut it also runs the risk of\nFurther destabilizing Iraq\nAh and if if we think that sanctions on Saudi Arabia would be a temporary instability oil markets weight to some of these other things happen and never forget that are more empowered Iran and more disoriented Saudi Arabia puts our ally Israel even grave or risking it already lonesome region\nMhm what do you say what do you say to some of the reaction some of the hot takes like for instance Yahoo News was saying oh well we spoke with a colleague\nOf ... over at the Washington Post and they say that that the Saudis probably did this ... and after hearing Trump's remarks on the media that seems I mean I Can't believe they're verified blue check accounts running with us but that's I mean
