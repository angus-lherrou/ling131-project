Wilson\nPocket pressure how many\nOn the outside can not only did he barks when he was able to tackle he can't he would not let him go\nSo the name that we have yet to mention on that defensive line has a name that Jim Boehm mentioned every week whether it's in his media availability on Monday whether it's during the jumbo Fisher radio show on Wednesdays he talks about it time and again now it's just a matter of\nBeing gay starting to get a sec\nStaff who will actually have pressure\n[noise]\nThey kept getting the Wilson kept getting the Wilson maybe the biggest one was the one in overtime though because it's a make a real goal range right I agree so you push you push\nKentucky back ends up being a forty three yards deal go they push them back to the twenty five yard lined up all got to be data to thirty three forty three yard which is just beyond the edge\nOf the pickers field goal range\nAbout this far out that far yet again told us in the pregame show what's it like what the feeling when you get the sack\nAnd it's like going up to have that right well heaven sent was this attack by Kingsley Kiki overtime\nWill say\nThat\nIt was huge it was it it it's it's one of the differences you look at little plays that is one of that\nWell that's why I call the huge because it made them kicked a long field goal\nAnd instead of the shorter one and all they needed was another foot and it would have clear them know the the the goalposts instead the cross bar across but that's what I was thinking of hits the cross\nBar Titus fourteen Aggies in their possession speaking up their possession Trayvon Williams twenty three of the twenty five yards gel among other first down\nI'm with a yard run that I read that maybe I was a man in overtime and it was good to see\nBecause we'll kept talking about the ... you know gene Sutherland had gone off and then Conor Lamb fear at at right guard and then Ryan McCollum comes in but\nThere is that pride in that all sense of line for a and M. and they really really set that tone on that possession that they set the tone and then ended this game because of how they push that Kentucky line back\nHard to do that in our group that is right up there on throughout the year and he had to go in and the third\nReich lord of the night yeah because they keep on he was down there he was trying to do it didn't look too serious but whatever that next step he needed to take to be able to play to look good and get over the hump and then I think on our land here he left the sidelines after two series he was saying the ... and so\n...\nThey were still able to get push against an excellent defense of her on\nI think this is rose is going to get you know to really did change no Kentucky is a really good team and we're really just saying you know of and it's going to come down to the end like like that so um I think we should just expect the games like this from here on out and um\nShe made sure that we keep on going and ready to finish\nFeel like I'm asking I'm running as to how did you guys bounce back mentally from that\nSong bowling which they return for such and that's tough to deal\nWith ... but you know you just gotta stay locked in the defense when you can't a focus on things that you can ... can control a so as a defense you know we just focus on what we can handle that we're just going to go out there and continue to get stops and we knew that often and so it was going to do what they're going to do that we have a good a good often so we weren't worried about the\nThank you congratulations Well Don thank you [noise]\nThat is that confidence of\nBelieving in this system believing as you say of being coach believing I titled dots and told me during one of the podcast that Mike out goes well the smartest guys that he's ever dealt with and and I think it's a combination of\nIt's one thing to coach it's another to listen and at\nThe same reason why I keep asking all these guys they bought in to a gym boat and these coaches if they don't buy in there they're just they're just talking it's just noise\nBut now that they have not just bought in but now they're seeing themselves get better remembered you both saying we see what you guys can be we're not can chat where where you are Dave what does that do for a player to say oh I I I\nI Am getting better I can play at this I I never knew that you learn a lot about yourself as a player don't you\nWell and that's what Jim was talking about we're going to learn a lot about our team he said yesterday at practice you did that we learned a lot about this team denied\nThat they're getting better and we also learned that they're good good and I I tell you what if all of them are going to be like this I don't think I can handle [laughter] time saying you know they are by all be like this or I don't I Know we can't\nWe can't have all of them like this I can handle that I had dark hair before the season started [laughter] I had hair you get the most\nUnique look of all of us though will and you asked that question but even you on the sidelines knew that there wasn't a defeat us the attitude after that fumble like I and I think that different you've seen\nThat sideline times in the past it hasn't been the same has in early in the game\nYou know Kentucky took the lead and I and I wondered I was kind of looking at him and I wonder\nAre they lacking urgency tonight but as as we went along I realized that this is just a a team that can handle things you know it's a stoic team or nothing gets to him now they've proven that they can play\nAnd what I saw it simply was not a lack of urgency I realized it was the team that can handle situations\nThey say confident through at all even after that some people they said confident then 'cause like we said they had the right to because they were still stop in Kentucky and they weren't allowed a bunch of yards but this is the right to step in gym both process it is yet another one and\nYou know they had that they play with effort every week you know was never question their effort\nIt's just those few bits of execution that have to be cleaned up now and and and he said\nThat the Arkansas you a point of the all the seniors yeah any any called them out is that those who want to make something of this last leader that's in Lebanon type when season\nExecution when it comes then there'll be capable that double digit type one season and there are so close but they're still the the ... you know like the map that yeah that went awry by many mistakes yeah\nAt the effort and the buy in the intensity all that's there and like ... said\nThey took what was a hobby and turned to new profession under general fishery said that before the year they go about their business as professionals now yeah ... that's what it looks like to me and and then when you're a pro\nThat bumble that they were turned protects them you're able to go back and play the next snap and

actually owed them money so you should pay it yeah that's one problem the second problem is is that it's gonna come back to haunt you just because they're not reporting it today doesn't mean they're not going to take an active outstanding account and reported that anytime\nAnd so right what happened what's happened is is the collection agency that you're dealing with the collections company that you're dealing with is just not downloaded their files to a credit bureau but they could do that at any time and then you've got a bad mark not just a mark but a bad mark 'cause this is a defaulted\nThis is a bad bill it's not a current bill because they didn't offer you payments at the start they only offered your payments because you couldn't pay them\nRight and you owe them the money and so uh how much is the bill\nI it's less than a thousand that point\nOkay what I Would do is continue to either I Would continue to pay them the minimum ... and I would build up a you know a lump sum up three or four thousand and offer them that a settlement and let's get it settled in full and get it in writing\nOkay but in writing settled in the fall and I I Would do that because it's already a bad mark on your credit and there's no telling how much they've added to it in collections fees and late fees anyway\nAnd so I you know I I Want to I Want to discount it a little for those reasons in those situations but just to ignore it because it's currently not showing up on your credit bureau is on was because it will end up showing up again\nAnd on top of that you owe the bill so clear the bill move on with your life it's worth it it's worth the trouble to address a good question thanks for calling in Tanya is in Lexington Hi Tania welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHello thank you for taking my phone call sure one time I have I have a question I Am Seventy years old and I'm getting ready to think about taking the payment options for tax shelter anybody [noise]\nUh and I wanted to know what would be something like the best option and I went I took his uh annuity out my thinking was take a lifetime monthly benefit and so then when I went to uh Africa about it they gave me a several other options from\nI'm from the other options for to take a fixed\nAnd they were the monthly income which should be lower but it would include a long term care policy no [noise]\nI neither one was to take another fixed and the lady with a nursing care home policy no or another option but to take a tenure certain with which would be lower premiums and on your lap and then it went right to be a higher premium\nNo okay let's go with a F none of the above um so uh [laughter] the anytime you start weaving in these other policies with it that's going to entail extra fees and garages\nNotice I didn't even ask what I'm not I didn't even ask what the numbers are when that's on the insurance world we call those bundling and there's only one time it was only one time bundling works to the consumers advantage and that's when you put your car insurance for homeowners Richards together\nThat often works to your benefit but the rest of this stuff is gimmicky got your garbage and so far smelled a rat and you have a good ... you have a good nose on your ... [noise]\nSo what I Would tell you there's I Would tell you the check with an investment advisor like one of the smart buster pros and talk about just rolling this into some a very low risk low volatility mutual funds and then just pulling an income off of that\nI think you'll end up with more money alive and dead doing that then you will\nMessing with this annuity because the other thing that you can be sure of with an insurance company or an investment firm anytime they give you a guarantee that means they're giving you less than you could have made if you didn't have a guarantee\nOkay oh and so I you know it's like with your home you didn't get a guarantee when you bought your home no guarantee it's going to go up in\nOh you were down in value either one no no insurance on backing your home no no FDIC insurance on the value of your home and yet you felt really comfortable taking that quote unquote risk why because well we can look at their track record of homes and be very comfortable with them and if I could find a mutual fund that I was comfortable with\nIts track record it's volatility\nAs I was whether you're home at Seventy years old or something
