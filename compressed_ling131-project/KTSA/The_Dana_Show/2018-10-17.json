Y. yeah do you remember when we had the story of the sorority that had to end its taco Tuesday\nBecause they it was deemed offensive\nAs I was offensive attack on Tuesday was offensive it was a sorority and I thought it was fun and they love tacos and you know cetera but they were told that because they enjoyed tacos that they were somehow ah\nRacist and so they had to end their taco Tuesday the sorority as California State University Fullerton\nThey had to stop their taco Tuesday I think they said they said you're all the ... year old being racist so the sorority says well look we've never ask people to wear costumes and you know some people were some prayer rose but it wasn't people love the food and they love the culture and that's the whole thing well then you had the whole world culture not a costume program\nUm and\nThey had to stop it so you can't do that your kids can't dressed up as Pocahontas or princess T ana you can't have taco Tuesday you can't do anything like that\nBut a white woman up in Massachusetts can lie inappropriate and ethnicity and you all are supposed to look the other way 'cause she got that Democrat white privilege and that's exactly what it is\nIt's just just crazy\n\nThat that is I mean as I did have identity politics jumped the shark and I think that's the big question right now\nNo lives with one was on Twitter earlier and she says millions of people watched you real Donald Trump is you fumbled in lied on your one million dollar pledge\nAnd then it took and then took a day for your handlers to tee up this recycled racist name a name calling you've lost a step\nOkay yeah I don't think that you know what and I responded because I was like you're you're white or the most European Americans in you purposely changed how you identify your ethnicity is you can take advantage of diversified hiring if that isn't race is not racist nothing is\nSo you have now you have Cherokee Nation out there the spokesperson well that the secretary\nThe Cherokee Nation secretary of state Chuck hostage junior he got out there he didn't like what the president said he really didn't like what what Elizabeth Warren did he said it was inappropriate in wrong you heard the sound bite you said it was ... this should not be doing this\nSo should not be doing is they released a statement just slamming her they the statement that they as you said that uh\nThe great majority of her identifiable ancestry is European\nAnd\nShe hit back at them she actually trying to argue with literal actual Indians the statement that they really set a DNA test is useless to determine tribal citizenship\nCurrent DNA tests do not even distinguish whether a person to ancestors were indigenous to North or South America\nSovereign tribal nations set up their own legal requirements for citizenship and while DNA tests can be used to determine lineage such as fraternity to an individual\nAnd it's not evidence for tribal affiliation using a DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or tribal nation even vaguely is inappropriate and wrong it makes a mockery out of DNA tests and it's a legitimate uses\nWhile also dishonor rain legitimate tribal governments and their citizens whose ancestors are well documented and he was heritage is prove\nA Senator Warren is undermining tribal interests with our continued claims of tribal heritage\nI mean\nShe's not playing or they're not playing with her so they're saying no that's not going to work but when everyone else says that it's racism so it was a white woman going to call Cherokee Nation racist\nI'm waiting like what do you do white liberals are white progressive because I think liberals and progressives are different what do I progressive do what do you guys do now\nWe have a lot more coming up including sassy Lindsey Graham I ... he says well you know what I think I'm going to take a DNA test due to see if I got more Native American heritage and Elizabeth

those shows why [noise]\nOver nation would show [noise]\nIdealized on Twitter officials than a latch on Facebook\nAs looking at the Associated Press is spin because remember how I was telling you the media was just going all in on this end book clowning itself for the war in thing the reason that I'm bringing this up is because I think it's so much more than just her eyes are we at the end of identity politics do you think\nOr no I mean it's a legitimate question are we at the end of it or net\nSo let me show why do you think that over think about it for real let me show you this Associated Press street so they went they went and hard on this pay\nThey were treating all of this morning as Elizabeth Warren was tweeting all of this morning and they said that uh the first week was a\nPresident Trump lashes out at Senator Warren over a DNA test result she released indicating she has Native American heritage and he says her claims are scam an ally despite her proof\nHer proof Christine Blasey Ford had more proof her proof oh my heavens uh yeah\nNo and so then they deleted it they say we delayed it a tweet with President Trump's reaction to senator warns claim of Native American heritage because it like the context and new to it as coming proof\nShe proved that she's actually left Native American by blood than the average white person is what she did that is what she proved she actually proves she's less than most people\nThe appropriation of and ethnicity\nFor again and we've talked about this and in fact later on in the program Cherokee genealogist twyla barns that everybody MSNBC CNN they all try to ignore because she has been one of the longest critics Elizabeth Warren this goes back to the Scott Brown racing twenty twelve\nI'm wearing it first came out through the Boston Globe\nAnd she uh twyla Barnes actually\nUh went and looked over her family tree went back for records and it was from twyla barns that we got the ... that we got the um the update on it that she had no actual a Native American associations going even way back but the closest that she did come\nIs that she apparently helped round up I'm\nNative Americans in Georgia on Jackson's trail of tears\nSo she's trying to prepare for a Senate race or effort not really Senate race but I think she's trying to put herself\nPosition herself as a contender and what's going to be a very crowded a raise the progressive drama queen people like Kamala Harris and Cory Booker analysis Warren there's not really a serious candidate and there and Elizabeth Warren is showing that with this tactic she doesn't really have\nGood political chops nor does she have really good um I just don't think her political argument is good enough but I like it because it I mean for crying out loud we've got two days out of this\nAnd she keeps tripling down on it so we have more to get into with this um including what the president said about her and the latest because Cherokee nation's not taking this lying down they're mad a and we'll get into all of that speaking of another senator\nIn St Louis Missouri Claire McCaskill is in the toughest race of her life politically\nUh this is a senator and everybody knows my long history with her she hates me with the burning passion of a thousand suns she screamed at me at press conferences before I mean screamed at me and she is always try to position herself as a moderate\nExcept she's been she was a rubber stamp on the previous administration and she's got ... ... ... more progressive\nBut she tries to hide it from voters and she is struggling because Missouri's the state that went by Trump double digits in\nMissouri is the state where you have so many moderate Democrats blue collar Democrats voted for Trump and they're really disillusioned with ... with the Democrat Party and with people like McCaskill so she was very quiet if you notice she was very quiet on Kavanaugh she's been very quiet on gun issues she said very quiet on a lot of stuff\nWell at least publicly but she did talk to project very Todd\nUnknowingly because they were embedded within her campaign and it was very interesting I think the first time by is of Senator McCaskill that this was part of the the the Q and a that this undercover reporter had with her listen\nAbout the man I think\nYeah I wasn't she has but the thing that\nShe's always kind of triangulate on is where she stands on quote unquote assault weapons because she said before I supported assault weapons ban will remember that the go that's the word that they all use is a catch all phrase for semi automatic firearms semi automatic rifles specifically that they would like all somebody has to be banned\nUh and so her staff are actually spoke to this uh in another video listen\nYou can tell them because she does door to somebody on America [noise]\n'cause I Want this I'm a student so I think some of them like semi automatic rifle\nMore soldiers were which is insane to me because when you're looking at the uniformed crime reports from twenty told the twenty sixteen it shows at hand feeding says hurt more people three times over then some Adam attic rifles but here we are\nJames O'Keefe with project very fast action dot com where you can go and watch this undercover this expos eight in full joins me now on the phone James always good to have you and thanks for joining us\nHey Dana thanks for having me back again\nOf course so this is the ... people know Claire McCaskill Senator McCaskill in Missouri very tough race\nOr she's actually being challenged and this is the closest that anyone has ever conference from from basically taking her out politically getting her seat and she's been successful at it previously because she always present herself as this moderate and she never on the big issues the hot issues that every other senator speaks on\nShe seemingly incredibly quiet and ... and and your expos day I'm actually kind of discovered why tell us about it\nWell Missouri Dana ... I Know that you're you're from Missouri Missouri is a special state because Democrats are more conservative they are more pro life they're more pro gun and there was a shrinking base that a clear as to appeal to so this video tape inside of our office shows her own staffers\nAre saying they're for field coordinators talking about how she has to mislead voters um she says of course when we asked her about gun bans we got clarification from her staff you've heard the soundbite they're semi automatic rifle ban another staffer Nick stole roast says that\nShe has the same policies as President Obama but she has to mislead chi chi says that people just can't know that she had the McCaskill a bomb a quote essentially have the same views on everything so there's this pattern in these red states Missouri being probably the strongest example where the Democrats have to lie they have to mislead\nThe voters because of the nature of the political dynamics in that state and that's what this videotape showed that shows all of our staffers saying well she's got this incremental approach she can't speak publicly about it this is what they're all saying behind closed doors one of the staffers actually says she has to essentially lie about everything wow\nYeah she said that they ah what the video shows is that\nOh wait that's just those kids\nLaughing at me\nNow to talk of the casualty address Russian state law\nTo my best friend I'm Sorry about the words\nI'm Sorry I didn't read the warnings about the bears and when that bear showed up I'm Sorry I was eating our Milky Way

Mr Hoskins in his remarks this was something that you had written about ... granddaughter dot com which I think really lays out\nUm the real concern with the issue as it relates to Warren um you had said that DNA doesn't define who or or who is not who is or who is not Indian\nOnly tribes can do that which seems to be lost in this in this whole debate and you and you also say that this this is really it's not about it's not about identity politics it's not about race this is an attack\nOn sovereignty talk to us about that\n[noise] um I think people\nGet lost in the fact that\nIndian especially under the law Indian is not a race it's a status that people have because they are citizens of Indian nation you don't actually have to have any\nAs we think of it racially Indian\nAncestors should be a citizen of an Indian tribe we have um frequent Internet who distant from former slaves of Cherokee citizens before the civil war\nThey are citizens of our tribe because they became a citizen after the civil war\nIt isn't based on race it's based in that that is that when the United states dismantled tribal government and a lot at our land who were the people that were there were the people that actually built that nation created that nation and stayed with that ... those are Indian\nElizabeth Warren has turned that into a focus on race\nAnd it's troubling as secretary of state costs can juniors that because it's a direct attack on tribal sovereignty and Elizabeth Warren is in a position that she has power\nAnd she had actually seriously harm tribal sovereignty\nUm I think one thing that is always it's always troubled me is that she's the attorney\nShe should understand evidence DNA is not evidence the records that I was posted in my blog are evident\nShe her family is always found in the United states records as free white citizens of the United states they are absolutely never found in Cherokee Nation records ever\nLogic tells us her ancestors were not Cherokee\nWe have citizens who actually have less Indian blood\nFor their CD I'd be in Elizabeth Warren DNA test suggests she might have ... different to those people can prove that they have the right to be citizens of our you know Cherokee Nation\nThrough documentation their ancestors were always there\nSo right you know we eat we have some citizens who have no Indian blood we look back at the Friedman\nTheir citizens of the Cherokee Nation\nBecause we adopted them as citizens just like the United states adopted its foreign places citizens\nWe would never you know they look they don't have American DNA there in Ohio measure for American DNA it's the same for for Cherokee citizenship and\nWar and um I think this is probably the most damaging anything she could have done for Indian tribes\nAnd it seems as there was a a a really a awesome opportunity that could've prevented presented itself to learn more about it that was lost when she doubled down and you even made mention of this before I don't know why in the world she just didn't say you know I had\nStories grown up they turned out not to be true I Apologize for that and and then it ... and you know apologize and moved on instead of doubling down and tripling down and then coming out you know with this big grandiose announcement what this DNA tests and doing the video and everything that help to nothing that just as you said that just made it so much worse\nAnd it I'm Still somewhat in shock over everything that transpired in the last twenty four hours because in my mind\nI understand what Indian identity is where it derives from it doesn't necessarily derived from anything that I get as an individual comes\nFrom my being as soon as I Love the Cherokee Nation who had treaties with the United states and that's where my right as an Indian comes from it it's not individual worn does I think to understand that she and she won't give it a ...

any length of time I told you that you should watch these brothers who won and walking Castro their mother is a cofounder of La Raza and they're down in\nSan Antonio and he was I think the what used to be the mayor of San Antonio [noise] yeah he'll land Castro was the mayor of San Antonio and one of my favorite stories about them happen several years ago at a river walk parade\nIn San Antonio they get the barges out and they decorate down an avid river walk parade and Lancaster was on the city council and he was also running for he was running for mayor bad like a fundraiser or something that he needed to go to and so he skipped the river walk parade and in his spot\nA installed his identical twin brother Joaquin Castro it's like the plot from parent trap but with mayors in San Antonio\nAnd so they were on the barges walking was on the barge and he was waving at everybody and the radio host that was announcing it said\nHe was never told that it was going to be walking Castro that he I mean it's just that really aren't Castro on the list and so people were waving and apparently they just all pretended like he was the mayor and apparently he was the here's a city councilman and and\nUm it inadvertently was uncovered and their excused\nWas quote I Can't help we can't help but that we look alike\nAnd\nWalking that well they were shouting at me and I said no it's Joaquin but nobody can hear me 'cause so many people were allowed there like twenty thousand people there\n[laughter] [noise] do you really believe that\nNo it's not it's Joaquin my brother's in a fund raiser
