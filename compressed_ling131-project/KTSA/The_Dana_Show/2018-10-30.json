{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KTSA", "content": "I Lived in the part of the country where from about now till about the end of march it rains about every other day\nWe don't report much on it because it rains almost every day in Nevada where you are it's probably a sunny most every day so nobody comes out and make note of that which has become common in Chicago if you have a few dozen shootings on a given weekend it's not news\nYou know to the news media because as I say well that happens every weekend in Chicago what's the big deal it's like talking about snow in Alaska during the wintertime yeah\nIt snows in the wintertime so why it's the norm so that's one problem one problem is who's running Chicago in what are the policies and and do you want to change those policies dramatically to cut down on the number of murders\nOr another problem is that in the state of Illinois every state in America now allows concealed carry\nI Would love to see them try this experiment go to a part of Chicago that has a particular amount of crime pick a major street that runs through the middle of the neighborhood and say we're going to encourage and make it easy for law abiding citizens to get ... concealed weapons permit to live on one side of that street\nAnd we're not going to do that for the people on the other side of the street waiting to hear and see what happens to crime on those two sides of the street you can almost guarantee that crime would go down dramatically because it it is and Joe carrying a concealed weapon\nAnd having to shoot somebody it's knowing that it's a crook to know your arm they're not going to go after you as much it won't take crime to zero\nBut Florida found out a long time ago when they became one of the first stage\nTo ah encourage concealed carry and make it relatively easy crime went down dramatically and the criminals switch to other kinds of crime they stopped doing as many carjacking Z they started doing more burglaries now we all care about having her house burglar rise but if you ask\nMe whether my you know big screen TV is more important than a member of my family\nThe sensible answer is your family you can replace the TV you can't replace the family member so\nBut as these bigger cities are not willing to make those changes because it goes against Democratic Party orthodoxy and that is guns are bad law abiding citizen should be disarmed and that's what they've done in Chicago drew a large extent\nIf you change that part of the picture crime would change as well so when you say the mainstream media does a look at it it would force them to confront smuggling truce for example I was going to mention denied\nThat in the same city where all those people were murdered at that synagogue\nThe school board had considered earlier in the week whether or not to allow armed guards guards not citizens\nAre the only board member who supported police officers carrying guns was one member of the Pittsburgh public schools now what happened was two days later\nThis synagogue is shot up and people died so I think I think in Pittsburgh, PA that whole discussion by the public schools should we allow the police officers who work in the Pittsburgh public schools to carry guns\nIf they ... they took the vote this last week before what happened to the synagogue what are you supposed to vote would have been or the discussion would have been if they'd taken that vote this ... this week instead of last week\nWe have and it's it's ridiculous I mean everything comes down to money and Cal ... map and then after\nThat money and they're like oh that ain't money money police officers in America carry guns I've always thought you know countries like Great Britain that say oh our police officers don't carry guns that's a special thing if we need a special squad of armed police officers we have to call for them in America\nAs far as I can tell there isn't a single police department in America that has police officers who don't carry guns in fact most police officers are encouraged to carry guns off duty and why because they understand they may run into a\nOf a crime or somebody whose life is being threatened when they're off duty and we want them to end their police chiefs and their city councils and mayors want them to be able to respond but the fact that the major media will not\nReport on this reasonably is a big part of the problem if they went in and cover in Chicago and said would it change things have average citizens could afford to and get a permit to have a gun in their own you better believe it would change things almost every other city in America has already found that out [noise]\nLaws losses show [noise]\n\nHi straight we're living in San Antonio

that to them as a personal offense and so they believe that the existence of different thought is the same thing as the middle finger extended\nThey think that's how they look at it he was consumed

this way and this dude was consumed with hate absolutely consumed with hate\n\nThat's what that's the problem with this this is the fault of this now I saw [noise] and I'm going to get into some of the media stuff because the people out there who immediately went and were screaming at the president and talking about how much I have no idea how to help people came to that conclusion quite frankly\nThey they were mad because they didn't like the the his expression of sympathy they were mad at you know something I mean it is it it it's it's awful every everybody is walking you to comment section essentially and that is what Twitter and I think some social media has become\nPeople didn't like they don't like they didn't they didn't like the Trump tone on the caravan and they're trying to when he was saying that people just can't enter the country illegally and somehow they're saying that that was\nWhere that kind of fuel this which again the guy who did this didn't like the president at all and even said so and his verified social media accounts which apparently still exist on Twitter all of these people who were concerned about tone where the hell where these people when you have\nFolks like Andrew Cuomo who made the declaration that people who who were Second Amendment or who were pro life for people who you know that they had no place in New York or where\nI'm a a you had a bill de Blasio saying similar or or wrong Emanuel saying that these people who believe in in in a Christian faith or et cetera et cetera that they have no place in New York or no place in Chicago or\nYou know they they don't belong here they where where where where people when when they were expressing\nThat sort of that sort of rhetoric and let me ask you this where the ever levine Haiti's where these people if they were so concerned about tone and they were so concerned and there are so upset at the administration if you're mad at the administration\nThen wouldn't you also if just going down that same line wouldn't you also be infuriated over somebody like Louis Farrakhan calling the people who are Jewish calling them termites\nIn that video is still available on Twitter wouldn't that also make you angry wouldn't it make you angry that this guy and his hatred has been mainstream\nWouldn't make you angry that he stood there on stage at a reader Franklin's funeral shoulder to shoulder with Bill Clinton or that the previous administration he was he was a buddy buddy with the previous president I mean if you're going to go after this administration my point is is where where's your post protest Asian over this guy\nIf you care so much about it why were you not up in arms that he had to verify to count and still does on certain platforms and he was sharing his hatred\nAnd that it was mainstream D did die rub shoulders with celebrities the people that you see on cable news or his friends he is the advisor envy mentor of the people who founded the women's march who rushed to defend in protest him\nWhere are you up in arms over that\nIf you think that it was the administration's fault where is your consistency\nAnd furthermore when did you did anything

responded what happened in Charlottesville given how he responds go she'll be given the fact that the people it's what's happened today and through this week and the concept of how it affects the

her\nWhat and they knew that that was on September ... there was in September they knew that in September\nAnd then\nWhat comes after September October now keep in mind this September thirtieth NBC

it was Maxine Waters who who encouraged\nHer supporters to get up not just in the president's face the old administration official faces\nA those actions are from those Democrats the president's going to continue to fight back when these individuals not only attack him but attack members of his administration and supporters of his administration\nJohn Paul but let me ask you why because they feel like it's necessary to active duty for\nTelling me that same job as\nYou do this for the president's\nNumber one job number one priority is to protect the safety and security of American and he's

headquarters in Atlanta\nWhere I've been many many times uh when I worked at a for CNN there was at this it was at those headquarters there\nAnd I don't know anything else about it at this point but it looks they said like other packages and that's all we know that that is a stage of the game\nHorrible I mean like I said game but you know what I mean the stage in the cycle that's all we know and then one of the other stories that we have\nAnd that we're going to talk about a little bit today is uh some of the moving from one thing to the some of the cultural and they the\nUh uh\nWe're going to get into the the Simpsons coming up at the bottom of the hour we're going to talk about how The Simpsons got rid of the only uh Indian it's in Springfield\nAnd in Brazil and this is what I think is interesting\nI was reading the media says Institute that has some a story about this but I was also ratings from some of my friends who are a Brazilian by birth and now American citizens or their parents are Brazilians\nThe president elect their everyone was freaking out they were saying he was like the Brazilian Trump or something like that and they they everyone was wringing their hands over populism and nationalism which I think anything in excess is bad I Hope people realize that's the only thing that is not bad in excess is safe\nAnd and kindness and honesty well I mean as long as you're polite everything else and access can be bad\nAnd everyone was freaking out but as some of my friends who are telling me they were saying look this this guy and I have a friend who is her parents were Brazilian and she was all over Facebook she's not on whatever she does all of her face but\nShe was livid at all the media accounts that she was saying no no no no look look look look look she's like this this guy was talking about privatizing certain industries this guy is talking about defunding abortion 'em and having better relations with foreign entities and increasing gun rights\nI'm what and this is where I saw this with the they're actually consider it because ... obviously Brazil has a huge violence problem there is a citizens council for public secured in criminal justice they said uh they feature Brazil feature some of the most violent cities on the planet Nineteen of the most violent or in Brazil\nYou're looking at thirty homicides per hundred thousand people in twenty Seventeen\n\nIt's one of the most violent countries in Latin America and it's because of organized ... crime out means is looking all the different rival gangs and how they've contributed to the ... really insane amounts of violence um but they also have seriously heavy handed security measures\nAnd so they had ... a Brazilian armed forces that took control public security like in Rio de Janeiro or et cetera but\nNow this this they call them the Brazilian Donald Trump or this guy a bow and arrow is now he's considering the relaxation of Brazil strict gun control laws because the street violence is so bad\nAnd he does not think that more policing\nBetter policing not more policing that are measures not more people there walking around is the best way to go about it they had forty five thousand homicides due to illegally possess firearms and twenty fourteen alone\nThat's in Spain\nAnd so there's a lot of concern there and this is something that has you know and this is actually added to widespread crime epidemic because you I mean if they have a ... I mean it's not easy to get a gun I mean they're basically banned\nSo this is something that this new president elect has been looking at an on and it's weird because show um many in the media events freaking out like oh this is bad look at this bad trend but everyone that I Know\nAnd I have about five or six people that I Know her either from Brazil summer are are legal residents some are actual falling citizens or their parents are from Brazil and they said people who are seen as do not understand\nThey think that any departure from any sort of leftist or progressive rural is bad news\nAnd I thought that's actually really a very good point\nWe're going to keep an eye on that we've got to get going no patriot mobile is my cell phone service and I've used them for what for going on for years I guess now yeah about four years now midterms are actually just days away at this point and everybody's pulling out progress has a plan on all stops\nTo make sure that they ah that they actually eight days you had the day that they come out on top you might not realize it but there are a lot of companies like big mobile\nThat taking your hard earned money and they're pushing progressive agendas with it\nThere is an alternative with cell phones and its patriot mobile it's the first and only cell phone provider built by and for conservatives patriot mobile provides nationwide reliable service unlimited talking tax with no hidden fees plus patriot mobile automatically donates a portion of your bill to the conservative causes for what\nYou go to protect you keep your number bring your device select a new one from their great selection including Android and iPhones beginning at four dollars a month\nVisit patriot mobile dot com slash Dana to start to date Utah for ... and a wave your activation fee for up to two lines stop supporting big mobile and progressive causes make the switch to patriot mobile today patriot mobile dot com slash Dana or call one eight hundred a patriot that's one eight hundred a patriot patriot mobile dot com slash Dana\nOr you tossing and turning more than you're sleeping at night\nI have been there until I tried my pillow now those sleepless nights are long behind me and I wake up feeling more refreshed than ever\nDitch the lumpy pillows let my pillow provide you with a comfortable night's sleep that you've been missing there made right here in the usa with one hundred percent machine washable and dry a boycott and and I'm like those other pillows my pillow comes with a ten year warranty\nYou don't have anything to lose other than us or neck\nBy one my pillow and get the second one for free that to my pillows for the price of one used ... for this buy one get one free special offer you will either love your my pillow or they'll give you your money back\nCoal eight hundred nine for for for nine seven five or visit my pillow dot com and used promote Dana get a better night's rest and try the world's most comfortable pillow my pillow dot com promote Dana eight hundred nine for for for nine seven five eight hundred nine for for for nine seven five my pillow dot com promote Dana [laughter]\nTo me when he visited by you only had three\nContests demos\nOne's own off the Gulf War heritage rain and trying to\nAnd five dollar in Japan for family he'll do they\nYeah San Antonio dot com broadcasters\nCome into our lives on radio and TV bringing our information or to him broadcasters are there for us but who was there for them when they fall on her start the broadcasters foundation of America provides financial assistance to broadcasters in acute below critical donors accident brothers serious misfortune\nIf you do the broadcaster army here or behind the scenes you may need our help so you share our mess with the broadcasters foundation\nDot org ... my first five years away a lot hotter luck talk ... buffer food I'm pretty much can I knew I had like ... ... ... ...\nA herb selection of skin and hair\nCare products and clothing but homemade sweet treats from a local bakery wholesome jams jelly for chocolate you'll find something for everyone including yourself from wind bottle march to seasonal race\nAt items to religious item from the practical to the fans don't miss the sixteenth annual St Francis of uh the the holiday bizarre November third and fourth Saturday nine to five\nSunday nine to three located at forty two oh one days of all the roads admission and parking are free\nSean does sound of reading on the roof delight June\n... happy everyone's you farther out once again about the damage that could be happening over your [laughter] what about the results are competing measure reviews seepage leaving rubbish or whatever whether Mother Nature\nSteve Israel there's room and solve all our gibberish ...

I mean like a ... there was a social justice where who did the uh ... what was it the problem with a ...\nSo now The Simpsons came out and they said that they are\nGoing to just drop him like there's apparently not even going to be a big thing over it they're just going to drop drop the character\n[noise] so I\nI don't know this is this this whole thing is I don't know do you know that he was what was he he was a doctor and a small business owner he was legit the only smart and six really successful character on the entire state of the entire show\n... you would I mean outside of the science just there was really nobody you know he\nWas a nerd right that that's who actually have like a family and I know exactly\nWhat I'm just talking about just smart you could just trying to compare the smarts but the character on the show was not demeaned in any way he was certainly a minority in Springfield he was a business owner as a minority was successful um there were several episodes to where he was like\nApparently electric ... good too but up who was in no way demeaned yeah sure you know\nIf I was reading 'em over at National Review there was a couple of good pieces about it I'm not proud of Shankar's one and he is an Indian American and he was saying that\nI feel like minded left wing Indians are trying to dictate how Indian Americans view American society and he was discussing this one um social justice where you're think piece that was too long and read just cetera um that\nIt was ludicrous that it because he was trying to say that that up who was voiced by someone who is white he goes area and dust to ... the character cannot be taken seriously and\nIt's a yeah it's a cartoon he ... the argument is that well what if if I an Indian uh according to ... shakers is what he was writing it and are applied in Indian had been chosen as the voice about who using using even my using my even worse interpretation of an Indian accent instead of his areas some how would that have clean the slate\nThat says the ... the CIA credit the writers of The Simpsons they confronted with comedy and nuance and because remember there was the one I'm a little scene last season where Lisa was asked well Lisa was the one who had to address she they had they had they addressed it to that character\nAn end in a scene that are Marge was talking to Lisa and she's written an entire book in order to make it an offensive and and Lisa says quote it's hard to say something that started decades ago and was applauded and an offensive as now politically incorrect what can you do and afterwards she looked at a picture of I put it that don't have a cow was an autographed photo\nAnd she goes some things will be dealt with at a later date that's what merge that I think it was great because the literally the entire show was built on his stereotype and if you don't understand that then why in the hell are you talking about it that is literally what the show was it was\nA humorist celebration of all of the stereotypes and when you look at every single one of these characters\nEvery single it wasn't done it\nDemeaning I mean whether\nIt's you know the the the grounds get grants keeper willy the Scots then whether or whatever it was I mean it was it was done is a way to mock American cultural perception\nThat's literally what the entire basis of all of these characters is is mocking American it's a humorous mocking in celebration of American cultural perspective\nThis is how you fit everything through like imagine there's just a perspective on television like Instagram has filters and it's just the American filter that's I mean it it was supposed to be light hearted and funny and everyone's ruining everything and they're trying to make it to where everything is offensive to absolutely everything\nAnd property rights over it and are oh I think as an Indian American what bothers me the most about this and this entire thing is are continual culture war is it a few like minded left wing Indians are trying to dictate how Indian Americans the American society\nThe truth is we're doing fine we're currently the richest most educated minority in America we litter the halls of academia medicine and even Hollywood now our voices are heard in the White House the United nations Congress and state houses across America if you want to pick a minority that has suffered from media bias ease the last one I Would pick as Indian Americans\nWow I mean it's a good piece but this I mean it's just kind of it [noise]\nIs that they're just they're just going to drop in that's just that they're they're just the the thing is is there they're going to drop and this is not\nA ... there is [noise] it it the mob wins because the holes shut the whole show is\nBased on stereotypes of the mob when so at what point does the mob going to start coming for for for other characters mean winter this winter Scottish people going to get mad about grandkids are Willie when are\nItalians gonna get mad at over all the Italians being portrayed as mobsters I mean I could go on and on\nThe problem was much bigger than this because we've seen it how\nComedy has been attacked in the PC culture ... just comedy in general right not not anything you know another thing specific and now they're starting to get a little more specific in that realm of comedy as far as who they attack in what they believe in you know who they virtually certain will towards essentially my um so this was an attack on comedy\nSo even if you weren't a fan of The Simpsons which I don't know why you wouldn't be\nUm this is a bigger thing for me I think this is just another clogging the wheel of destroying comedy in the name was PC culture\nRight now I agree I mean and and isn't it kind of sad that they're just going to take him out I mean they're just going to get rid of supporting him so you're just going to get rid of the most successful character who happens to be a minority on the show us\nWhat progressive than left his ...\n[noise] [noise]\nYeah Andy so anywhere first published the interview with um ... are who told the site that ah people on The Simpsons and that was going to be dropped from the animated show and apparently they verified it from a cause several people they're just they're not going to make a big deal out of it but they're going to drop them altogether to avoid the controversy", "show_name": "The Dana Show", "year": "2018", "city": "San Antonio", "day": "30"}
