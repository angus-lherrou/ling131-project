[noise]\nYou're listening to San Antonio solutions wish audio and in the studio with me I have an ice miracle from the children's shelter welcoming showed you how are you know I'm doing great how are you doing good how's everything going up the children's shelter you know we um\nWhere'd emergency shelter as as many people know is that on ten acres right in the heart of the west side and you know we've been a capacity for awhile already with children and so we provide care for children from\nUm a few days until the age of sixteen okay and then we also have treatment foster care program that you know recruits and license and spawn foster families for children from infancy until the age of Seventeen\nAnd then we have prevention programs that work with parents with children and then we also have mental health services and we recently included mental health services for um parents and so we should that only foreign\n... guys provide that how long have you been around so we've been around since Nineteen oh one's a hundred and Seventeen years immunity yeah yeah\nYeah and so if you know anything about the animal defense late actually got their start because the very beginning in the early Nineteen hundreds we should provide care for children and um and I was all the same time and then that's where animal defense league actually got their start oh wow the early Nineteen hundreds and so I'm very interesting history at the very beginning\nBut you know when now we're we're going to the fall season October's run around the corner in Halloween is one of those favorite um\nHolidays are kids love to participate in so for sure you know candy we do we don't take him out to trick or treat we actually do trick or treating on her camp is okay so our kids even a week before Halloween they left to wear their Halloween costume\nSo you know we need a little Halloween costumes for\nYou know small children even infants even a little Wednesday it looks like a pumpkin you know in ... and all the way until you know a teenager and then also candy\nIt's also something that you know we passed out and snacks\nSo you know it's just around the corner and they love Halloween and also fall so falls around here and we're going to get you know pretty cool pretty soon yeah and so you know we are definitely in need of any type of\nWho he is jackets sweaters long pants um anything that you can think of for fall weather for kids from shore infancy until the age of sixteen okay and um how many kids do you guys think how you have on campus so we can have up to sixty six children at any given time\nAnd so right now we've been to pass that he has his six children wow mhm okay\nUm so you guys have sixty six children and you guys are on the website if someone wants to go ahead and donate a costume or for Halloween where would they go sure they can\nFirst call us at you and zero to when she was twenty five hundred or they can visit us out of ... twenty nine thirty nine west will mine were actually read the corner of St Cloud in Westwood One right near and dear I rode\nOkay awesome so now you're listening right now um you have that information um are you guys is able to you guys take costumes like um that have been worn yeah we ask is that I Am speech gently used okay that they're not torn or tattered or anything yeah\nI was just thinking of um you know like maybe you have a last year's costume but I Do agree and you only work when you [laughter]\nCan come and bring it over to the children's shelter that would be a meeting and then um are you guys said you're going to take 'em trick or treating around the Kenya\nWildlife so you know our staff actually\nHave like it's if he had the uh we you know give up the candy and our kids go round trick or treating\nUp in our mission building in foster care hopes that are in our cottage and uh so they get to to do that and so they come over and trick or treat even the little ones you know all of the year yes yes and so we actually had a foster care picnic that we're having in October ... foster parents are foster kid does and then our kids on her campus\nAnd such a great way for them to take to get together in the spirit of Halloween and fall and integrate pumpkins\nAnd so again it's it's really a community effort and so we know that we can't do this work alone we know that you know the answer is extremely generous and when they give to the children's shelter ... whether that's a costume candy or maybe those are closing diapers wipes formula\nA lot of people may not be able to make a monetary gift and that's okay some people can volunteer that's awesome\nYou know maybe there is an opportunity for people to donate items and you know we've gotten a lot of questions of\nCan you give volunteers who are you know younger than Eighteen we don't allow children younger than Eighteen and our campus you interact with our kids because our kids are under the the care of the state of Texas but what we do encourage hard drives in their schools so safe or they can get service hours out of fat so if you're a boy scouts of Girl Scout to if you are part of\nA school group or a church group and you wanna do service hours and you were more likely you are more than welcome to do it will drive a donation\nOut I mean yeah yeah a great idea and absolutely and then they can get their own hours by doing those drives and that and bringing them all the trash alternately in their survey leaders right and the\nOpportunity for young people to still make a difference in a child's life finish learn it had some um some Eagle Scout to build projects like they've built tables or they build while you\nThere's always room for everybody to help provide a solution for shore oh what's it like being in the children's in the shelter for the child on day to day like with things going on right so when children come into care obviously they're being removed from an unhealthy environments you know and so I'm there\nSo when they are placed with us whether that's to child protective services local law enforcement you know we ensure that first you know children might be hungry so we provide them with food\nUm we were gathering as much information about the child or children at the time\nAnd then we walk them through the process of why they're there you know um sometimes they may have questions of will they ever get to see my parents again and we can't promise that we'd never promise anything to children just because we just don't know yeah and so [noise] we ensure that we are you know\nI'm communicating with our kid owes to ensure that we have a an environment that what we call trauma informed it's really about being sensitive to each need each child ... and so because they've experienced trauma\nAnd says that trauma can look like very differently rapes and so you know we ensure that you know our environment we you know we give tours often to community members want to learn more about the shelters shelter\nAnd you know our environment is really intentional bright colors\nAnd people have said that looks like a camp and so we want to make sure that it's sad because you don't want to feel as though you're being in an institution for sure you want to feel comfortable I learned in school or right and so we have a schoolhouse on keep this we have swings we have\nHave you know he's out of school how yes we do have a ... school districts satellite school and we have instructors from Cape or through fifth grade\nThan children who are in need in special education will go to elementary school and then we also provide transportation for children who were in high school to go back to their home community\nOkay so it's important for children to have normal activity is just like their peers and ... and so we have a movie theater on her camp is you know and so you know we do take him out to activities have grave volunteers who come over and say\nI Want to do birthday parties or I Want to be able to um\nYou know take him out to eat even simple things as wording your own food or being empowered to do that that does a lot of children who have experienced my treatment are typically socially isolated and so they may have set foot in the school they may not have ever gone to a doctor\nOr they've never even got to even choose your own food yeah and so simple things like that can make a difference in the child [noise] and those types of things we always say that volunteers change lives\nUm volunteers my like oh well all we do is rock babies asleep while you're building attachments right you're yeah the relationship and actions we notice a silly and so there's so much value with volunteers and people who donate\nWhen you have people who do that on a regular basis and so and if someone wants to become a volunteer what everyone's process what steps do they take right so I Would encourage you to go visit our website children's shelter dot org and I'm Karen ... is our volunteer manager\nOkay and so she walks she threw first giving you a ... shelter or talking to you about the children that we provide care for 'em kind of exploring options of\nWhat the volunteer once you kind of exploring like is this a good fit for you are you comfortable with working with children of you know from infancy until you know teenagers um identifying kind of what they're wanting to explore and so I think it's\nYou know some people are just wanting to\nRock babies and feed them in the morning and so we have Tuesday Morning volunteers um and that's what they do and then there are some that are on a consistent basis or some volunteer once a month and so it really is depending upon what they want to deal\nAnd so you know if you have a therapeutic animals that you know maybe it's a therapeutic dog we had one kind of semi retired now how do\nYou um and so it's great to be able to see if you have a therapeutic animal that\nTherapeutic animals are great for children yeah you know they'll talk to dogs you know and it it's great to see how they interact with with therapeutic animals um and that's a volunteer initiative right ...\nOh by the mother of a uh

for fault [laughter] specially folks and Africa\nSo I brought that up because there's so many different elements December when this was her first of all a trip to concentrate on what I say not what I where the problem is when you're wearing things like that which is very charged the symbol of British colonial around and just don't understand the fashion choices\nOh my God so Loni is in Africa and she's got the pits helmets that white hat\nA or a you know it's it's a helmet but it looks kind of like a hat that you'd see it all those old Mikhail Dan is white can only use them as old as British stuff because that's what we do we have to go to the point where we have to pick things apart and so now they're looking at her is in some way shape or form they're looting ... that she is racist\nBecause of her fashion sense\nThat personally he's half way through our political political and Jackie out if I had to wear ... outside of Americans that are the ones that are ... where our political ... and and I just wish that franchise with maybe think\nA little more with him around her\n\nLike you on her team usa grown I'm told me that how it feels that way that I\nNo no no shoe to warn that but that's\nThe hilarity ... of this right and remember she's got that that interview coming out and it's it's so funny\nBecause as people she talked about the fact that people talk about her all the time and and you know that it's that it's that it's not you know it's it's ridiculous\nI could say I'm the most boring person on on the world usage of the most bully personal one of them if you see what people are saying about you\nKnow there there's a bunch of women on the view right a bunch of privileged ladies on the view sitting around but what what she's wearing it's racist I mean she might as well aboard a shape for God's sake she might as well up\nThis is a group of people that do not like people that no more than that they don't have a rebel and not knowing they rebel and not preparing they reveling\nNow I think it's different I guess I have about what we just don't care you know I Do think when you're when jackets and say I really don't care and I went home is in Africa like and send them to think that there is that I don't think should be the last\nReally or maybe she just put it on a thought well I look good and this looks pretty cool and I'm Out here and this looks like it could be a Ralph Lauren polo shoot and that there is nothing more to it other than\nThis but wait what was going to take it a step further\nGiven ones are loaded with a real true problem Harris is when you don't do any homework about where you have you know she moved on when you think about some of the things that have been sent about Africa the kinds of you know I met him and Feldman says we argue\nThat that what it says is that really what it says is that it it just you know it it made me laugh because I'm interested to see what she has to say in this because again here's the ones that you say\nOh you want about Trump and everybody Trump seems to sit down with just about anybody who's willing to put a microphone in space a\nLot of administrations [noise] uh didn't like to do that he didn't care oh he may go on Fox a lot right like he may have some parking spot on Fox and friends but he's not afraid to sit down and talked to be not and he'll do it\nAnd so will she and ... and and she's opened it up this time the people were surprised that you know as if if you read some of the excerpts from this but didn't listen to the people who were there that there was no like hey these are the five things you can you can't ask\nHer it was like ask anything\nI Know people like us to speculate the media likes to speculate about our marriage and um that could lead to gossip but understand the gossip says newspapers magazines [noise] getting advertising on unfortunate ... in this kind of world today\nYeah we do we do I just found it to be very fascinating\nBecause she just did sit down and she's like let's have a conversation and and they talk about our marriage is all in all kinds of stuff and I find it you know that that is about as open as you're gonna get you get the first lady remember her husband\nThe president United States half the country doesn't like him right a lot of the world doesn't like him he\nIs a he is a everywhere he goes he's a lightning rod for criticism and for and and that's the reality of it she's married to him on top of all of that stuff you've got the personal stuff which is\nStormy Daniels much of these other women the you know the Access Hollywood tape all those kinds of things so it's you know I don't know what their personal lives like I don't know what kind of deal they had to know any of those things but\nIt's it's it's tough and she's she's a straightforward honest and I think she said yes I think she really has it was one of the few people that has his ear and uh that is interesting it is is very interesting but the fact that she's willing to sit down and talk about stuff like that\nGood for you good for you three two three five three twenty four twenty three and she had been to show is your Twitter you can tweet at us you know so right now ... many of you are probably\nJust inundated with how many\nMarshall's today for stuff when it comes to the midterms right are you for this

a beginning we're not pass if we are not civil and we will not apologize uh-huh unquote\nBy the way maybe they were following up on Hillary's remarks did you hear what she said this week where she said Democrats can't be civil with Republicans during Donald Trump's presents\nI Wonder what would have happened if she had one and Republicans said the same thing we certainly can't be civil until Hillary Clinton's term is over\n... of course get it if you wear a make America had ... anywhere you're you're in danger in jeopardy I mean it's amazing what's going on out there\nYou may be putting

for sure that he's wrong seventh it's gonna happen if this continues at something like that is going to happen the left\nAnd the Democrats and the media which kind of results seems like these days the money's not supposed to be like that but it sure seems to me that they're on the left they can't accept the fact that President Trump won the resistance of you know that's what they call it started before he was even president\nAnd there may have been we're finding out now a soft coup against him to remove him from office\nMore and more information is coming out about that but by the way we're not supposed to find out the information Hillary supposed to win and Obama said she was gonna win and there was no reason that you wouldn't when we went and found out about any of the stuff that that makes me think like a banana republic\nBut there were those in this country they were ready to overthrow the will of the people in whatever fashion they could so in my opinion that was the beginning of the civil war may have started before that but that with what's been going on President Trump\nTo overthrow sitting president to go against the will of the people just because you don't like the results let's let first is right and it continues they hate President Trump's so much\nThat anything goes because they have truth on their side they can't imagine\nThis the shock them when I say it on other shows that there probably an equal number of people that were devastated by the election of President Obama I Do for many resistance but I got to be honest I I like to count the days okay this year is over you know all you have three more years left of it\nBut that I didn't never occurs to them because they're so arrogant to begin with\nSo I Want you tell me if you agree with me how bad things have gotten between the two sides in this country and do you think we're fighting for the soul of our country that there is such a thing as I Believe as American exceptionalism that is under attack\nAlong with our basic institutions free speech and I love that's under attack what we're used to think of traditional marriage\nFrom individual rights to free market capitalism and these are all under attack and if I Am right what are you doing about the upcoming elections to make sure we don't lose the house\nWhere impeachment hearings they said this now I've learned some of the others who by the way if you imagine who is going to lead these committees like Jerry Nadler Maxine Waters no she's going to the banking with what you would do\nI Wonder what you're doing about making sure this doesn't happen impeachment hearings will likely began the day the Democrats are sworn it they're going to try to teach President Trump and they've got they've already said they're going to try to teach cabinet and you're gonna have hearings for ever\nTell me what you think of what you're doing about this at eight six six Ninety red eye and this whole week I'm throwing in on red eye radio but just a couple of more points to consider\nWhile you're calling and I want to add that the extreme hatred for President Trump is palpable you can feel it I Know Hillary was all set to be crowded and they were shocked by President Trump's win but the hatred for him knows no limits\nPart of it I'm sure is what they regard as his unsophisticated behavior in a good part of it is his personality which can easily alienate people I knowledge that you difficult sometimes especially with the things he says he often says things you shouldn't especially on Twitter and he picks fights where there should be not\nHe demeans the White House see I'm being honest by answering some of his outrageous critics\nAnd he's clearly incapable of accepting much of any criticism I get that all of a few of us are but the spice his personal short ... I think I better and see the softly so some of those in the left don't have a breakdown\nOf the ... mayor credit that fact breakdown judging from what is going on these days I think President Trump has done a great job as president\nThat's right I didn't even say a good job I said great job now you can disagree with me but then vote him out false don't try to undo the election results those are much I didn't try to undo a modest when\nThere was no such thing as resistance\nMake sure you guys on the other side you get the vote on on your side if we lose fairly we lose but don't set up the dust Sears and use the power of government to destroy your opponents this what happens in banana republics not the United states of America don't destroy what makes this country so unique and so exceptional\nSo I Want to know do you agree that there's a civil war going on in our country are you prepared to fight back to save our country let me know what you think at age six\nSix Ninety read I

on with mark Hi Robert\nHey good ... a good evening I Believe you're\nCompletely correct when you say that the left 'cause uh convince themselves they're good and the right as bad I Wonder when you can correct me if I'm wrong but I Wonder if the right uh you know sort of copying their civil war language can be dangerous I Know I'm twenty five and are just getting off the coast campus\nUm the younger right we is a really um [noise] they're they're in love with this idea of you know not your grand puppies GOP so they they're\nReally getting going along with the idea of punchy back against the left but I Wonder if our energy should be more focused on convincing the left that it's not this um this good versus evil that they probably don't even they kind of a justified in their work you\nYeah I don't think you can convince the hardcore left it there is no talking I mean you'll find out there maybe some independence you can reach maybe some of the Democrats I used to do a show in Los Angeles where I had two Democrats two Republicans on every week\nAnd those kinds of people you could convince and by the way there's a you can almost distinguish the left from liberals liberals used to be like Alan Dershowitz where if you disagreed with people you know you followed it through the ideas and and the ballot box what the left or people like the antifa gr\nUm where they wouldn't even let you speak that there's a new fascists even though the cues their enemies of being fascists so I don't think there's any talking to the left if that's what you meant\nBut I Do think there's a great middle that you might be able to reach and even some perhaps conservative Democrats are and that is true of our base to my best to the hardcore conservatives right wing conservatives you're probably not going to change their minds\nWhat you try to do in a reason fashion people who are open to it have you met people at school that you can talk to as opposed to some you can't\nUh no no not at all so you can't talk to them at all [laughter] no yeah no I Want to go you're saying yeah they've they've completely censored who they want to um [noise]\nYes yeah I I I get what you're saying yeah do you do you have friends on your side [noise] [noise] yeah I mean\nAh you know like a young Republicans group right\nAnd it said other neighbors of under that one yeah how about your professors and teachers I'm camps and you don't have to say where you go\nYeah no that that's a pretty it's pretty left leaning to you can't really get a word and and then when you do it just kind of a shame fest\nYeah pretty discouraging uh what's going on campuses especially you can never hear a conservative speaker they won't let them talk my right\nOh yeah no you're absolutely correct\nYeah so I think you have to join the organizations you do so you don't feel alone and try to work on people you can't how about your family how do they feel that they didn't think did they think you're crazy\nNo neither do you ah thankfully I grew up in the Christian hill so to stir up fairly pretty level headed\nYeah well I I Would suggest to you that you you know keep up the fight with people who are willing to listen and try to work on those people who might be persuaded by the fact many people don't know right they live their lives they work hard at their jobs and the you know they tune in occasionally maybe that's why the Kavanaugh hearings will be effective\nBecause I think the great majority of people were not happy about the way he was treated and and what went on there the idea that allegations are enough\nTo convict you at least in people's minds or some people is is that raises is against the whole system where you're innocent until proven\nHe was guilty just because he was accused of it and so maybe that influence on people I think people are going to be surprised by the elections but Robert I I think of your call and hang in there okay\nThank you thank you very much twenty five there's hope let's go to a\nOkay David you think people are voting for or dead huh David in Cedar Rapids OK\nI'm OK what it is just the uh after I grandfather and my mother and my\nGrandmother ... passed away a I've noticed that um [noise] I joined the sheer lane county Republican caucus committee you got people who are at the polls\nWho are going to take a look at you know all of a you know then they see how people are voting\nAnd I've noticed that you know one looking through records that for some reason my grandfather and grandmother and my mother all voted for Obama twice even though they die before\n... did you report it to anybody I tried to take some action\nI did it's just that you know it it was kind of like a yelling out of stone wall\nWhere women must [laughter] yeah no this\nIs a real problem with voting integrity in this country and it was known for years of people in Chicago people voted in Chicago but now across\nThe country there are people voting in your case you twice they voted for Obama I mean if you don't have integrity election system anything could happen it's amazing when you look back on it that Trump won that Bush won because I Believe that we're finding that kind of fraud\nThat uh people who wrote in in California you you know you can vote by DMV and they admitted that thousands of people voted there they said there was some snakes with voting machines we had a real problem when you can't trust the outcome of the election\nWell the thing is is that how the ... Republican caucus committee changed\nHere in Cedar Rapids was that we got a whole new Patrick people in a whole new batch people actually interested and say I'm going to make sure my vote is actually counted\nAnd so we have all these younger people ... says I Love this idea I'm just going to make sure that this guy over here that I don't trust\nIs being ... and that's how we changed from Democrats city to Republicans pretty getting this last election\nWell that's good so there's still some good news even despite the fraudulent voted by the way that doesn't take into account illegal immigrants right\nIf illegal immigrants are voting and that's my whole point and that's another topic if we ever allow illegal immigrants to vote Republicans aren't going when another election at least nationally uh in our lifetime ... there's no hope when you let people vote who aren't qualified or are not citizens of United States\nYou're you brought up a great little election\nActually got to get her to go a little ... they're the they're okay it's all depends on how you treat the individual", "show_name": "The Dana Show", "year": "2018", "city": "San Antonio", "day": "15"}
