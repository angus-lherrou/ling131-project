joined this in my city ... devices all that's already in progress right now\nAbout any of the incidents this week in New York\nWe don't underestimate the difference even one person can make towards our collective safety and neither should the people of New York city and want to reiterate as I did yesterday and as I Do any time we talk about far reaching investigations of this nature of any other kind that nothing we do in law enforcement we do alone\nFor a joint terrorists taskforce comprised of professionals and the agencies you see here today and others were investigating all of this with great precision that can say with certainty\nThat we will identifying the rest of the person or people responsible for these acts make no mistake\n[noise] New York city's intelligence and counterterrorism kind of terrorism capabilities are second and on every day they are not just this week or detectives and analysts are constantly poring over the French dream as we proactively deploy a resources around the city as needed\nAnd you're seeing that today too out of an abundance of caution will tell you that when we look at the events of yesterday and today I have a match pride in incredible work the men and women are the NYPD to each and every day especially when it involves partnering with the organizations represented here today\nAll concluded by reminding everyone that law enforcement professionals do not care about the politics behind these acts but we do care about is keeping the public reserves safe\nThat's it that's the job fighting crime and keeping people safe and through the fall and willing partnership of everyone who lives and works in and visit New York city will make the safest large city in the United states even safer Mr Mayor that you're very very much\nCommissioner I Want to express my appreciation to all the men and women and YPG who have done an outstanding job yesterday and today addressing this situation and to all of our partners federal and state partners everyone has been working together\nTo address this forthrightly now look one of the things that we emphasize the moment like this is that you're going to see a lot of police presence it's important that we proactively take steps to protect\nThose who have come under attack\nClearly what we've seen in the last few days is an attack on media outlets an attack on prominent public figures\nAnd we're going to make sure there's expanded presents as long as we needed to show very vividly that New York city takes these issues seriously that we are defending\nPeople who are coming under attack that part of how we protect the Democratic process is to show the threats like this not taken lightly so that expect that presence and I know that for those who have gone through this or in the last few days that's a presence that they appreciate greatly\nWant to say that uh everyday New Yorkers have responded to the situation with the kind of strength and the kind of resiliency that this city is famous for it makes me very very proud of\nAll eight point six million New Yorkers as they have handled the situation a with a real sense of resolve a they're not going to let an act of terror intimidate them and that's a really important in this moment to say whatever the motives of the individuals involved\nAh the people in this city or are not being thrown off the game or not having their values undermined or the way of life undermined New Yorkers are standing strong right now\nIn the last thing I Want to say is you know it in a moment like this there's a lot of concern there's a lot of fear\nA clearly it's upsetting time it's a time when there's been too much hatred in too much division in the air\nAnd in that context people can feel powerless I Want to remind people that everyone has an opportunity to play a positive and constructive role here uh first of all\nHelping law enforcement this is something that everyone can do if you have any information at all that you think could help law enforcement to address the situation to share it with law enforcement immediately or let them be the judges of the value of the information don't hold back\nA so many times and I agree with the commissioner law enforcement that ultimately has proven they will find the perpetrators but so many times it's because\nUh an individual citizen step forward with information that really led to the key breakthrough you have information\nSharing if you're concerned about uh packages that could arrive at your home or your workplace you see something that worries you reach out to the police get ah their involvement to address the situation\nPeople can be part of solving this immediate challenge but finally we all can be a part of solving the bigger situation that we're facing as a society as a nation\nA tone of civility a tone of mutual respect is something we all can create\nWe shouldn't just ask what are the most prominent voice is doing we also have to ask question are all of us\nTreating each other with respect treating men and women and law enforcement respect people in the media report the news treating them with respect this is something that we all have to do as a way of addressing a crisis like this and we can and I have great confidence that we will thank you\nCan as matter of fact to Germany right now the FBI\nJoint terrorism task forces around the nation are fully engaged on this investigation we're working quickly to process and analyze relevant information from us\nSuspicious packages recovered over the last few days we will continue to do so for as long as it takes an until there is a resolution\nThis is a nationwide investigation involving multiple jurisdictions coast to coast to give you a sense of scope just here on the New York to ATF agencies ranging from ATF\nUS postal inspection service the secret service the NYPD the New York state police and dozens of other federal state and local agencies are working shoulder to shoulder\nI Want to thank those partners for their efforts there collaboration and hard work much of their leadership is in the room with us today I also want to personally thank the hundreds of men and women that are up the street working on us together\nThe FBI will continue to focus all of the resources at our disposal to identify and apprehend the individual or individuals responsible for these acts\nThe investigation is still in its early stages I have said this each time that we face similar situations but it bears repeating today it is vitally important that we do not inadvertently disclose information that could adversely impacted our investigation or a future prosecution\nThe public understands the need for this level of operational security and for that reason I Will not be able to answer specific questions on what we know\nWhat I can say is that at various times over the last few days Ken suspicious packages were located at multiple locations in New York Maryland Florida Delaware and Los Angeles\nLaw enforcement responded and each package which collected by experts and examinations are now underway at the FBI lab in Quantico\nAdds to the device is located in New York which contained a powder\nThe initial analysis indicates that the powder in those particular ... did not present a biological threat other analysis is ongoing however it is worth repeating that any device could be considered potentially dangerous and treated as such until proven otherwise", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dana Show", "city": "San Antonio", "day": "26"}
