Ron which starts at seven thirty or for the two mile walk\nThat ... been starting at eight thirty and I wanted to emphasize that um or I guess an ounce here on your show that um [noise] sheriff Salazar is going to help us kick off\nThe walk person have yeah I Love that he is a big supporter of what we do and and when I called his office they said absolutely so he's going ... and then I just got word that another local so lab is going to join us spurs Jesus [laughter]\nJeez so we're we're all we're all going to say do you know\nA lot of people don't notice but I'm In his previous life before taking on this incredible ministry but he does she was um a personal trainer and he was ...\nField back in the day when I actually exercise [laughter] that is that like the most random they [laughter] I Love it though I Love it\nAnd he he's terrific and so we're we're ... we got support from all walks of life and we also have a for any one we want people notice is the family friendly event and a lot of uh kids walk with their parents with us\nUm we're going to have several superhero characters their sheer uh this year too so it's just a tremendous event that brings a community gathered together\nIt helps to I'm a share or build awareness of the HIV aids situation in San Antonio ... county and then it helps us with our mission of preventing HIV and also helping those who have that\nFor sure and people listening I'm now you do say that this brings that community together yes it does how does this how how how this health in the past someone that has reached out to to you guys oh sure\nWell I can tell you we have you know we we do thousands of tests a year or so that's that's one way free HIV testing either at our location at eight one eight east Grayson or in our mobile unit which go it's our empowering the van and it goes\nEverywhere in the city with that we can possibly go college campuses corporate campuses you name it were their health fairs everything I'm so money raised from this event helps to fund that as well as our education program which is um [noise] uh in\nPublic schools of San Antonio not all of them but about Fifteen of the school districts have how last year alone we reached twenty thousand a middle school and high school students throughout the public students\nThroughout the throughout our area [noise] um and on that note uh one of the things that we do when we go in to do a an educational presentation to explain how HIV is transmitted how you can prevent it or or the resources you have if you get if you are if you test positive\nWe bring what we call 'em safe advocates meaning San Antonio AIDS Foundation we call it safe\nAdvocates um we know for a fact several of those are actual clients of ours or have benefited from our services directly\nThere is one man in particular who does a lot of speaking for us and he tells his story to the to the students his name is Louis um he is probably in his fifties now he's a\nFather and grandfather and wonderful man um she uh\nFound out he was positive several years ago after having been a a drug user and had a lot of problems in his life and um he was able to be helped by the San Antonio ... to get his life back channel you know to uh get into the continuum of care he needed and to become more educated\nAs a result of direct services from us he\nUm has pledged to help us in any way that he can\nIn perpetuity basically there isn't anything he won't do for us hands here and he's done media interviews for us he's very open about his status and she really likes to talk to young people to explain that this doesn't have to be your life you need to take control now you need knowledge now and you need to prevent and you know be be careful\nYou know it doesn't mean you can't have relationships but you know be cognizant of the facts and act accordingly so that you can have a healthy life\nDefinitely and I love the he spreads the word and after I mean they took him in ... no hesitation and help them out and traders lie ever really\nAbsolutely I mean that's one example of that story just a bounding throughout organization in the three years I've been working there um I've been amazed at um\nThe if the breath and scope of the people we've reached and um how many of them are willing to give back once they got their situation under control um there's also plenty of people who advocate for us who are HIV negative but they believe in what we're doing and they they understand the realities of\nBoth preventing 'em and living with HIV and the twenty first century and say it's a different era now doesn't mean that the danger is instill their you and I discussed this before I'm a San Antonio unfortunately in the last couple of years has had the highest number of new HIV diagnosis diagnoses\nIn the entire state of Texas\nUm and it's especially among young Latino men a Nineteen twenty for a man who young men who have sex with men\nUm and so that's

and this is it\nNow the fight is going to continue to go on and on and on and on\nI Do not see how it's possible for my colleagues to say was perfect confidence that judge Kavanaugh has the temperament independence and credibility to serve on the United States Supreme court\nYou know exactly what's going to be the playbook on both sides what's going to be exactly what you thought it was going to be he was going to be contentious it was going to be ... this is that\nRight like they don't get any better that it's right here is like this is what it is\nAnd you know when Mitch McConnell came out and said your vote your votes right here this vote\nIs the biggest you're going to have because for a lot of them their votes are largely nobody cares you know pay any attention but this was big for two reasons one because of what it is going to do with the court and sue because some of these people\nHe knows voting in certain directions they're going to be issues down the road\nAbsolutely\nThis is interesting very interesting I Love Chuck Schumer says here though let no\nAmerican be surprised\nIf judge Kavanaugh becomes a decisive vote to restrict the rights and privileges of the American people while stretching the bounds of privilege for the current occupant of the White House\nIs the fear factor that puts fear card always good everybody has that's what they do\nAgain you it's no longer you being a you go out and you talk of the microphones and you do your thing it's no longer that right you don't get to do that anymore\nIt's not that now it's you've got to be able to get everybody riled up you have people bussed in and and you know I was\nThinking today what what is the gone so let's say it was it was a female\nRight was it was ... a ... that would have been the one right now here's here's a woman who is a lot of people thought it was going to be very good super Hoover pro life they were already taking aim at her\nOver the last couple of days thinking they might have Kavanaugh done they were taking aim at her and then some of the groups she's been associated with because she was going to come in and destroy the whole roe v Wade and this is what it again it it wouldn't have mattered well how would that have gone\nLike these are the things that you know just understand this for what it is it was politics and now you're seeing is

it is just ugly the way that things have gone\nWhat left wing groups and their democratic allies are down to judge Kavanaugh is nothing short of monstrous\nUgly then has it's been ugly and both sides have been I think the way that this thing has happened in the way this thing has gone down at this has not been a shining moment in our history of politics\nRight I mean you look back and like I look

can cooperate\nWith each other and it's going to be very very hard for the court because then they're going to have a certain class of them\nYeah yeah there's a cloud is over ... because the courts have become politicized look let's be real for the last ... years and California's a perfect example California voted on marriage equality or gay marriage it's whatever called today that's politically correct and that makes everybody feel good and the people of California\nVoted no marriage between a man and woman than\nMayors like Gavin Newsom started saying we're not going to recognize that then it went up to the flagpole to to you know to this Supreme Court and then to you know from this court this Supreme Court to to you know to the district courts all the way up there and so he basically said as we don't care what the voters\nBecause we can pick and choose politics it's been in the court forever there's a reason that people judge shop\nBecause they know they can find the judge that will give them the things that they want as far as the ruling goes based on the political side of how this judge sees the law so don't pretend like there's no politics and the court he can't be\nUnbiased that's what I hear I'm like Ruth Bader Ginsburg out here hammering Trump\nAll the time so we know who the ones are liberal and who are conservative it's not like we\nWere like oh my God this is that we didn't know they had any kind of political leanings they're human beings of course they're going to have political leanings absolutely they are\nIt's it is what it is we can either stayed here\nAnd pretend that somehow that this wasn't about politics you know what this was about it was about roe v Wade that's exactly in the end one hundred percent this right here is about roe v Wade\nAnd the worry of what's going to take place it's not about guns\nIt's not about the you know look for a lot of people libertarians that Hoover conservative people they look at him as saying well you know look at a thing on the Patriot act and teach them you know search and seizure and and some issues there\nBut for you for hence the reason when you look at all of the people that are protesting right now this is about roe v weight\nThat's it\nThat's the politics of what this is he's a monster he hates women and he's going to take away your choice\nThat is it\nFrom said when he has a chance to appoint to the court whose gonna find judges that are pro life now he has said\nThat he doesn't want to go back and they shouldn't be a duplicate that but it doesn't mean\nThat it can't be challenged by states maybe not on the federal level but state by state\nVery interest\nBut don't tell me this is this is what it is about this er it's about sexual assault about I'm sure that plays in for some people but a lot of it is just about choice\nThat's it I get it I understand\nThe way that the I I look I don't care that you fight against him I got no problem with that\nPeople ask me out of your pro choice or pro life I myself personally I'm about life I Would never take away anybody shores zero seals not it will never do that that's true and you and your maker and your conscience you do it there you go live your life I don't want to pay for it\nSo you go what about marriage marriage equality government you got a marriage I think we can all agree on that get out of marriage\n\nBut this right here was about that the perfect storm hit and this is what it is and the fight is going to go on and on and on and it's only become more partisan and only more tribal until us the people in the middle the Seventy percent of us think about how many independents are really out there most of you out there\nYou're pretty independent you okay with marriage right\nYou're okay with pro choice pro life 'cause you don't think much about it you're moving on with you said you don't take away any but his choice that you don't want nobody want to talk about it and a lot of people you that that is your for for a lot of people this is the only thing they care about as long as they have choice they don't care if the world goes how would have asked you\nKnow give it a Ninety percent of their ... these people cheated on a singular thing\n\nAnd there's people out there on the second the second amendment stuck that's what they care about I've always said the fight is the exact same it's just a different subject\nIt's control but\nLet's be real for just a second this is what it is\nThree two three five three twenty four twenty three at you had mentioned show is your Twitter you can tweet us love hearing from your show movies coming out of a couple of movies stars born I think it's just like the twenty eighth adaptation of this movie\nAnthony advertisers want a thirty seven and I couldn't find he was right there was one I guess Judy Garland and then there was another one obviously with a Chris christopherson and Barbara Streisand\nAnd then you've got Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper one coming out today and the fight is on his like how good is this move you'll say Bradley Cooper is the best movies ever done he things in it you're gonna be amazed to hear it\nAnd it's kind of keeps pretty much straight down the line and and this is lady got his first movie role she's done I think she did American horror story she doesn't other stuff it was the first big acting role in the movie and everybody says she's greater voices amazing [noise]\nMovies coming out today that I'm interested Jack and are going to go see a tomorrow's called venom harshly [noise]\n[noise]\n[laughter] [noise]\n\nSo ... in this movie and it's very interesting because a lot of people think this is a shot at Silicon Valley because you've got the ABC\nCorporation right near the alphabet corporation you've got the Google's you've got the you've got the Iran must get a lot of people think this is really the lawn must these people who are trying to change the world and the multibillion air\nWho are looking at space looking how we can merge bodies together and willing to maybe do things that are unscrupulous and doing some of these things and a lot of people say this ... this movie right here is Iran mosque is the villain\n'cause you've got this young upstart tech guy who is for all intents and purposes\nThe building and trying to create something and with the stuff he finds and space through space travel lo and behold this is what it is and its venom and Tom already gets infected with this stuff and the way it goes and you know the craziness and the power of him being able to shape shift and I find it to be rather interesting 'cause I'm like yeah\n'cause like there's that worry right that that that you look at the facebooks and the Silicon Valley to the world and\nThe the alphabet corporation to the of of you know the Google's and and and all of these people in the control the amount of money the things that are doing that we don't know they're doing you know like why does Google and all of these companies trying to extend the lights what are they looking for what are they trying to do you know the way that they're\nYou you got to be careful and the pressure has been on them uh and so\nMitch knew that hey we can afford we've got to get through the cloture so we can actually stop the debate about it and take it to a final vote\nSo let's do that and one of you will have to say yes or did you get to that point and we know that was mentioned\nEven though he's a Democrat he's also with a ... situation because he's got to walk a fine line of being a very red state\nAnd he's the blue Democrat he's ... he he is he's a blue guy if you read guy blue guy read person bloopers he's in a red state bodies on the blue T so he walked that fine line and so look\nHe was always going to be close chances of of ... being the decider pissed must be very\nExcited very excited subject we're going to be very exciting who was with me\nBut nobody one here\nI think in the and this has been ugly and nobody is a winner and I think the way that we\nHave handled this both sides has been at times just awful\nAnd it's not been good\nIt's not going to go this is something you do you this is something you use as I don't do this kid's let's not handled things this way three two three five three twenty four twenty three ... and Joe is your Twitter you can tweet at us high school or high school this feels very\nNineteen Seventy sip Tommy it's an unusual\nFor high school cheerleaders to bring goody bag for the football team during homecoming week but recently some treat that Hartford high school had a little something extra in them\nPrincipal ... they were giving him took some balls from possible or brownies may have been what he's with marijuana

brought pot brownie to school some for football players they say the leftovers we're used to sway voters to become homecoming queen ...\n[laughter] so that app is very okay to say I was very interesting so what it allows you to do that if you can be a whistle blower completely anonymously\nSo you can\nSay something that you don't have to worry about the repercussions coming back on you

next time there is a a an opening on the high court than if this president is still president uh how that goes but ultimately\nNow you're going to have to wait and see what what Kavanaugh's does on the bench what effect he ultimately has and that won't be seen for years and so the when there is that\nIt's an odds game as we have been saying for for many years going back to Andrew Breitbart and his comments to us during the twenty twelve race\nAnd\nTalking about how important the Supreme Court was when we asked the question why should we support or should conservative support a moderate like Romney at the time\nFor for president and his answer was SCOTUS Andrew Breitbart censor was very clear and it is an odds game because you can support a John Roberts Neil Gorsuch\nOr Brett Kavanaugh been through all of it you still may not get those decisions you think you're going to get its always intriguing but sometimes it's disappointing and how they decide and we'll again we won't be able to see that effect\nOr if that's going to happen uh for many years ultimately on the court there there will be cases where his decision will be key in those cases but we'll see how he decides and and what his thinking is in those opinions as they come across\nRight I mean if what what it's about ... if you look at his judicial history I Would say that\nAre most likely I'll agree with eighty percent of what he may be eighty five to Ninety I don't know ... between eighty and Ninety percent all agree I'm a ... with him you know we we talk about a true construction as some and by the way when we talked about ... what was that the ah\nWas it the location device so the location of ice on the cars\nAre about ... what was the case that everybody has a cell tower two was the ...\nThere for everybody where everybody said we're we're especially the never Trump first came out and said see you didn't you say he sided with all the liberals as soon as you didn't\nGet your judge ... and then we had to point out as many other people did no uh actually on that particular case it was the liberals on the court or and and the Gorsuch that actually used the Scalia ruling\nA you know Scalia was probably the true with the the most construction as judge of of my lifetime paying attention to what the Supreme Court has a has a has has done\nClarence Thomas always is not always a construction right\nClarence Thomas will a judge based on at times based on what he views as a conservative win for the day right that's not what I'm looking for I've never looked for that I Want that's up to the legislature to decide\nTo me there's these are all constitutional issues on one judges look at the constitution said doesn't say that no well that's not up to me to put that in\nDon't bend the constitution or straight from the constitution in order to fit your\nPolitical agenda right so I'd say ... I'd say if I look at a a a a Clarence Thomas he's probably got a ... a Scalia was almost Ninety nine probably Ninety nine percent\nJust doing it off the top of my head Clarence Thomas probably somewhere between Ninety and Ninety five percent ... depending on depending on the year [laughter] yeah and and what I'm hoping is that you have a\nA you know you have a cabin on that ah would get to the Ninety percent level at least a for me on on the on on the important cases I'll be very pleased to greater than that but again nobody expected Roberts to rewrite Obamacare righto huge\nAnd and then you look at some of his other cases you're like oh ... absolutely right absolutely right absolutely right absolutely right\nSo I'm a again this to me was about\n\nThe greatest thing that came out of this besides getting a ... Supreme Court justice that isn't a\nA roof gator ... Ruth Bader Ginsburg is the fact that you and I talked about that the left has made it very clear what they want\nA but I don't think that the Republican Party or\nI think a lot of conservatives knew this was this was a a part of who they were I don't think a lot of the moderates in the Republican Party\nThought they they were uh\nI I Will say some of the moderates that were never Trump or some of the conservatives that were never Trump per se but to see it in action and to see them look to see the debate points that they were bringing up\nTo see what they want it done to see that they rejected the mindset of due process the mindset of a a presumption of innocence this stereotyping\nThat their convenience all women are to believed unless you're deals those type of woman over there and by the way to one of the stories of saw is that now Democrats are starting to blame white women for cabinet are being put in well wait a minute I thought women were always right\nRight and then I then they started blaming Ivan Eddie and the case if he well wait a minute I thought the woman was women\nWere always right right yeah yeah but that case of too many holes well that's the whole point that the\n... the so now we're just in a comparison of holes in a case Frank you are stating that and so they're all over the place and when it comes down to is\nThey're just trying to fit in argument to fit their narrative at the moment in order to get the judge in that will fulfill their liberal desires and a judge that will legislate for them they're all over the place on their opinions\nHave\nTheir opinions don't and their opinions on their goal post move all over the place right\nSo to me it was the fact that you were able to see the left and them and not just the far left\nWhat you saw because we normally get calls where people will say well that's not the mainstream of the Democratic party what you saw\nOver the last two weeks was the mainstream\nOf the Democratic party in Washington DC the leadership of the Democratic party that reject due process under the law reject a presumption of innocence and we'll slander and the fame somebody's\nCharacter without evidence to do so yeah\nAnd I think a lot of I'll tell you I had a conversation with independent Bob yesterday boy he was renting he was the burn in my ear\nUh because ah as you said you know and and I've talked about independent fought for years and used to vote for Democrats he started telling me how I can never vote for democratic get ... ever when I'm being told what white males think is always wrong and white men are always evil and women are always to be bullied because everybody knows that's not true right\nBut that's where they are so we'll get to that up by the way last year it was getting rid of the electoral college by the less we told you the next thing would be getting rid of the Senate they got there because of all this now ... [laughter] is Han BC reporter who said you know basically it's time to get rid of the Senate\nSo if you ever to the electoral college go to the Senate the pits our entire narrative that\nThey actually hate the constitution of the United states and where I actually don't like the United states because they want to change all the basic tenets of the constitution so that we will get to that House Democrats talk impeachment a Senator Graham says you want to pick us go to judge win the presidency hey let's get back to Russian collusion\nWell it's about time there's a couple of Russian collusion story so out there but but not the Republicans are Trump colluding with the Russians by the way no ah wow left is really going back let's bring back home and all for prospective see that [noise] well yeah\nWell why don't we first see how many of the protesters there at ... on the steps can identify Colin Powell through a picture or tells you buy given his name if they're given his name who he is or what\nHe was back to that guy that was new and for the national anthem right ah plus a tropical storm Michael heading to the panhandle of Florida above the latest updates on that plus your calls and comments if you'd like to get in lines open now eight six six Ninety read I [noise]\nWas ready to do with a record ...

them one less worry wouldn't you\nEvery year thousands of truckers lose their jobs homes and more when a medical problem causes financial hardships but with your donation to the same Christopher truckers relief fund you can help get them and their families back on the road\nDonate today of truckers fund data work that's truckers funded dot org ... today at truckers fund dot org [noise]\nSo [noise] they're [noise] read I read [noise] and they have certain\nHunting I'm Gary McNamara eight six six Ninety or right I just uh one note here ... uh and and let me point out something that that I just you know I look at conservative media and I just say stop it\nAnd whether it was the you know and it drives you you know we know he's conservative but he basically just you know list things but he had the Taylor Swift story as a number one story half the day yesterday yeah and it's the number one story right now on Fox that call right\nNobody cares what she thinks no ... nobody cared opening Taylor Swift things why do the editors at Fox News\nBelieve that she deserves the Taylor Swift comes out in support of tendency Democrats who cares oh she before she had said she won't speak on ... who cares nobody cares nobody cares what she thinks\nThere's so many things that we can be doing as a as as as a media that are important and I'm not saying you don't put the you don't have the story somewhere ...\nIn our cars you can you give your story but it's been the number one story now for a few hours sitting there on as we go into a Monday with everything that's going on right right Taylor Swift as a story that they they put up there even though ... story and you know him supporting Donald Trump is a Side Story\nIt's notable and it's different because you have a a mega hip hop star supporting Republican presidents who was hated by pretty much everybody else in his community and in in his profession so that's notable because\nIt's not what a what he respects unique it I've got ... news just things that are unique and different ... and ... and the thing is is that\nUltimately though the the endorsement\nDoesn't really do anything now sometimes you'll see a you know these mega endorsements come on ah come on board for an Obama but that wasn't what got Obama to the White House the endorsements don't do anything except show that those celebrities are getting on the bandwagon\nA most often but you're not it doesn't matter who the celebrity is\nThat's not the influence with the with the people that's not the the real influence with real Americans they really don't care what celebrities have to say politically unless those celebrities are getting involved in politics and they're going to run for office that's that's the difference\nBut I just just a that was just decide comment there'd be a chance I just saw it and when I went up cycle can let me when I woke up well you know it's funny when it when it when I went to sleep last night it was there when I when I woke up to come in the show was there and I'm like All right enough in our pre show meeting we were talking about it because Sunday\nWe always I always measure of the day by the number of\nOver the top breaking news headlines and sometimes it's breaking news on an event on something that happened and it's actual breaking is often it's breaking news breaking news Trump tweets that no that's not breaking news\nThe the\nNumber of stories on Sunday dwindled down to just nothing I mean it was it was really well it was down to Taylor Swift endorses Democrats that's what it was down to because\nHere's what happened Saturday you had your vote Kavanaugh confirmed\nThe left is going to wind about it they're going to whine about it a little more on Sunday Morning and then as we predicted or as we told you it's really not a prediction because they are too predictable on the left all the protestors go home and it's over you know you you still have some talking members of the house talking about impeachment\nNot gonna happen it's not going to happen because\nYou're not going to move on it when when you know you want to do well if you want to open this door if you want to go down that road\nGo for it I'm sure you'll have some radicals on the left on Capitol Hill that will keep talking about it but it's not going to happen for a reason because there's nothing there it's the reason the confirmation vote went through and he was ultimately confirmed\n\nNot going to have them well we can move and we can do this it's those stories are given the same credibility that the Van Jones story\nWas given when when when Van Jones is rolling up his sleeves and working and the grassroots effort to change the minds of the electorate there's no\nThat didn't happen in fact Hillary\nHad a net loss of luck doors and Trump had a net gain after the election after the election because these people don't live in reality\nThey don't look at the facts and anything they don't they don't care about the process they want you to believe that ... that the process is that they slap on their Superman Cape and they're going to be a hero in a moment\nAnd it doesn't happen that way you had a situation in the cabinet confirmation process that was while it was distorted\nIf you look at it the President Trump\nWas the one that really made that happen in terms of extending it out\nSo there was a supplemental background check\nThere was zero zero credit of course and he wasn't looking to get credit but the people he wasn't looking to get credit from the the media or the left of course\nBut the people the everyday people look at it and they'll they'll look back on this process and go well one of the you know what is it that the the ones I I mean they don't follow it every day and we know people work\nAnd some people work around the clock and thank you for listening and you don't take it in like like we do or or or your average new sound would do\nSo you don't have all the details but they look back on this\nAnd they look at the facts of this by doing just simple research and they see that it was the president himself that allowed the process it was Chuck Grassley that allowed her to testify it was the Republicans that gay per every single chance to prove her case\nAnd she could not\nThat's the reality of this all\nNot that the you know the left wants you to believe the protesters in the ... and the baby's\nWant you to believe that it was the Republicans who squashed it nope they opened it wide you could not have given them or her\nMore of an opportunity to come in and prove her allegations not not to the fact that she has to prove them like a court of law but just something just to stay in children of\nA preponderance of the of of running of the the evidence something\nTo back it up and she couldn't do it now\nAnd neither could neither could re mirrors and and if you look at what was actually done the ... ... what what didn't what did we find out the only thing that we didn't find out\nWas Ford who said that her the the uh the notes and whether she had video whatever the polygraph doesn't and the therapist notes would cooperate what she said and she refused to turn them over right it's really the only thing that we don't know in that because she refused", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dana Show", "city": "San Antonio",
