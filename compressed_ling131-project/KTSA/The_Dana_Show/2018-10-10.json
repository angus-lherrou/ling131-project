{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KTSA", "content": "If you come in and say I think you're doing this wrong and we'd like you to change it\nHow receptive or public school administrators to that kind of message\nWell they don't have to listen because they get a guaranteed income stream as long as you show up with your kid\nThey get money for the education of that child so they don't have to listen to the parents but the sister ... that the leader of this willow charter school in Walla Walla in order to attract the students to his school he has to listen to their parents because of the parents\nDon't like how they're being treated in the school if they're being a padded on the head just raise money for the PTA and go away but they typically are in a public traditional public school if the if the parents at a charter school or not being listened to then they'll pull their kids out and put them in you know back in the traditional system or some other charter school\nAnd that changes the dynamic I mean that is what is the key to why charter schools are growing in this country so rapidly and why they're so attractive especially two groups of people who have been left behind by the traditional public school system that vulnerable uh people who\nHave either special needs kids who are low income that haven't don't have a background education themselves that is the word has spread charter schools so for example another\nBenefit of this will a school it's the parents have said they want their kids to be safe that's the most important thing of course\nNow lead role there are some other specific things or ways in which this charter is different for students and the conventional school\nWhile they wear uniforms that's part of keeping them safe it helps the school building identity and that helps the teachers know who is supposed to be in the school and who isn't you can imagine if they can see if someone come in the school without a uniform that you know right away he doesn't belong there that keeps a school more safe\nAnother thing that the school does is it designed the learning to make it fun engaging for students so they have a lot of projects that they do it interesting electives\nThis is in a community where a lot of the people there are working or they would have his panic backgrounds and so the teachers are teaching the kids Spanish as well as English or do I\nEntered one school uniforms were not more popular in the in the schools because you're right it does your meal lemonade some problems with a limited a little bit of a of gang issues that may or lemonade or issues where some students\nYou know may may resent others for having a you know I guess more expensive clothing or if one of goods because that if you're going to eliminate those things and and as you say help build school identity and keep the kids safe you would think that'd be something that everyone would sign on for oh\nMost definitely and and you know often you hear\nA parents complain about\nThe lack of seriousness of purpose it at schools that that there's too much noise in the classroom that kids are distracted don't associate that teacher of there being disrespectful et cetera et cetera while you you you put a uniform on a kid and all of a sudden the child says well this is\nThis is different I'm putting on a uniform I Am going to school to learn and there's lots of studies that have shown that said that the students in uniforms kick their job as a student more seriously so\nI have always wondered why we don't all have uniforms at all the schools it's a very I mean especially in the in this day and age of being concerned about uh you know kids bringing guns to schools I\nThink that would be the first thing you do it\nAt this point lead we don't know whether this is going to actually produce different results or has it been in operation long enough I Know they're shooting for two hundred and fifty schools at their target height capacity but do we know enough about how the schools performing to say that it actually works\nWell this the charter schools you're saying or this school in particular will\nThis one just opened on August Thirteen ah so it takes a couple of two or three years before you know if the school is doing well but we have\nUh other uh results from the other ten charter schools that had been in a ... operating already in Washington state and they just see the Washington state charter school association just released the test scores for those\nSchools and they are out performing you know by far their peers

that's the top story is you'd have to primary ... oh my gosh this is really where we're going\nSo she resigned yesterday did you guys watch the official swearing in of a justice cabin all did you guys see the swearing in of justice Kavanaugh justice\nCapital to go see that I watched it had a beer oh did you I went to an October fest in had a beer I had a beer for Brett I'm Sorry justice Brett justice Mr justice Brett Kavanaugh I Know I'm not going to stop saying it I have I'm\nA first off I'm sure that you also the protesters right everybody's other everybody saw the footage of the protesters people or yeah imagine what they're going to do for the next appointment\nJust saying if President Trump were to get another appointment I [noise]\nI don't want to say that there would be violence on the part of the last I really hope that they grow up a little bit and that's some of their elders and butter kind of take a hold of the rain because these people are crazy just some of the protests that I've seen\nAre pretty amazing Corey Booker was out there saying that they they're looking they want to impeach cabinet and I thought are you working secretly with Republicans\nSeriously I'm just\nReal question are you seeking working with him because it seems like it seems like that's that's it if if\nYou're trying to work with the Republican Party and increased voter turnout\nAll day that's the way to do it oh my word get everybody to think that have Democrats take control of the White House that you're going to impeach the guy that they all that was like one of the top reasons that people voted for Trump oh man that's just not the way to do it\nSo all the protests we had the uh really awesome ceremony yesterday the president when he and I ... I have a very with me I've got a a lot of things up here when the president\nWhen he uh when he actually\nUh when he spoke and was just and was was disgusting uh having a he apologized he said you what your family has gone through any apologize for a campaign of political and personal destruction which is true\nUm that's absolutely true\nAh audio some bike tennis is what some of the president's actually you know what let's I have a couple of soundbites let's start with ten because this was when he was a a actually sixteen I'm changing it I'm Sorry this place because this is this is that exact quote this is when the president apologized and before he introduced him for his remarks listen\nI Would like to begin tonight's proceedings differently than perhaps any other events of such magnitude on behalf of our nation I Want to apologize\nTo read it in charge over all family for the terrible pain and suffering you have been forced to endure\nThose who stepped forward to serve our country deserves a fair and dignified life evaluation\n... and it's true\nIt's his his remarks are true uses if he's absolutely he's absolutely right and it was by the way Hillary Clinton responded to that she was livid\nOoh speaking of which I just saw this one by one was a there she and bill are going on tour live nation actually tweeted out like a a little bit ago they're headlining an arena tour I don't know if it's me too movement but it is somewhat funny\nBut she criticized the swearing in ceremony she said what was done was a political rally that's what she said she was mad she said what was done was a political rally and she had said that I you know I don't and I have the auto hair she said it was a political rally\nAnd its undermined the image and integrity of the court it saddens me uh she I mean she was saying she didn't she didn't think that he should have been a I guess that he should have a policy I don't think that Trump should have had to apologize I think the Senate that the Democrats in the Senate should have had to apologize to be quite honest\nThere were the ones that that ran him through this they were the ones that did it audio soundbite Fifteen\nTrump again hit on you know you were you were he says you are proven innocent a lot of people went after this remark listen\nAnd with that I must say that you share under historic scrutiny were proven ... thank you [noise]\n... yeah\nThis I don't know if he was he was never he was accused but he was never proven guilty I don't know if you can even be\nWhen innocent if you were never proven guilty that's the only thing I Would take it that I Would say I don't have I mean he wasn't wrong you were saying that he was innocent and but I don't think that because he was never proven guilty\nSo many times I hear well this was a job interview and it's not a trial and that's what Democrats say so that they can\nThey don't have to meet the high bar of proving these baseless smearing accusations that they love it individuals' whenever they oppose their their ideology or whenever they just oppose them even if they're nominated by someone who's ideological\nStatus they oppose and that's what was obviously what was happening with the cabinet situation but for them to say well it wasn't a trial there\nThey're what they're saying as we can say whatever the hell we want we consume your him as being a pedophile or however a gang rape is that center and we don't have to prove anything because it's not a trial\nWell if it's not a trial and he refused to bring forth any evidence bye Felicia now he's justice Brett Kavanaugh see that didn't really work out in their favor dead at a smuggling smarmy as they stated it\nSo now he's justice Cavanaugh I'm I have some of his excerpts

... we're going to talk more about this but I\nDo all that stuff I don't want us\nTo this point yeah me the the other idea where she was saying you can't be several people she um which is interesting she\nWas asked about um the Kavanaugh\nEt cetera et cetera this is her literally telling people to stop being civil to one another listen to listen to what she says here\nYou cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough\nTo win back the house hand or the Senate that's when civility can start again and so then the only okay oh I'm going to come\nBack to that later I Am I'm Amazed at because she's essentially saying you don't have to be civil to people because of a straw man and that's what she's doing here the simple existence of disagreement with her platform\nIs considered destroying that's how they that's how they exaggerate it\nThese individual people like Hillary Clinton and this is why you saw the Portland stuff which we are going to get into and of course the crazy protest over a cabin on the stuff that was taking place last night even\nIndividuals believed that when our system is utilized in the manner in which it should be by individuals who simply have greater numbers that that somehow you're destroying everything in which I Believe you're doing your said et cetera et cetera et cetera\nI can ask more from all of our lawmakers and the stupid red meat crap\nWhat does that mean when she says you're destroying every they're destroying everything that you know you believe in well can you define that please how what what is it that you believe in and how are people destroying it\nSimple answer how in the world are people destroying what you believe in you she believes in abortion the last I checked it illegal I think it's ridiculous and I think the fact that it's taxpayer funded I think that no one should have\nTo be forced to buy taxation assessed and then people are stealing our dollars to go and subsidize an organization that spends money against a for a political party and what you do not support so we are forced a under penalty of jail to pay the Democrat Party\nTo continue campaigning let's just be real about Planned Parenthood's the middleman 'cause they get federal dollars\n[noise] so our federal dollars see I'm all those flavors and I choose to be solved the as hail over that you're damn right I Do [noise]\nAnd I think they should I think that I think it should stop and I don't think anybody should personally I think it's a joke as long as we're forced to fund things with which we disagree I could go on for three hours about this\nBut I digress see that that to me it's more of a step of destroying something in which I Believe because I'm being forced to subsidize it I don't force you to buy my animal although I think as long as we're paying for people to abort their babies as a form of birth control than you should purchased my em [noise] ah but\nWhat is she when she says ... ... the the things in which they believe are being early destroyed and what manner\n\nAnd what manner how how is anything she believes in being destroyed\nSo she didn't lose so her dream of being president well that didn't have it just because simply Americans didn't want her whole her own party didn't want her which was why she had to cheat new super delegates in order to steal the nomination from Bernie Sanders her own party didn't want her\nSo why\nI'm you know I'm just how I just think that's stupid to say and it's really ... exaggerate isn't the right word it's hyperbole of the worst kind\nShe simply saying that the existence of another opinion is threatening to her she find fat threatening the existence of a different belief she finds that threatening\nWell I'm not sure I'm comfortable with anyone like that in elected office because the United states has made up of a multitude of different beliefs and thoughts and in order to dehumanize your opposition you wrongfully cast\nThem as people who are oppressing you and destroying your the things in which you believe in simply because they win elections and they exist\nThat's\nHow I interpret her statement running it through several filters that's how I see it [noise] so I I just um I I don't think that that helps and she's sitting here saying well we can't have civility until so what she's saying is that so long as people disagree with you can't be civil she's telling people to not be civil\n\nThat remember how mad people got me when I did a show promo and I used an hourglass to know when the show would start and how everyone including the New York times and Clinton's surrogate screech from the rafters oh my gosh it's so violent\nHere she's telling people to stop being civil with other individuals simply because they think differently from them and yet that's not a call the violence Maxine Waters isn't a call the violence I mean if you really want to have that conversation\nI just think that's incredibly irresponsible you cannot be civil with the political party that wants to destroy what you stand for\nShe's\nEverything that she everything that she does and everything and what she believes it's completely manufactured because the she says this and she caught this attitude after the fact Hillary Clinton is always a day late in the dollar short I mean days late like months days late\nBut now now she's copying us I just find that fascinating\nI mean it's just it's just manufactured in Seoul is you can't be civil with people well your party has already stopped being civil they've been doing that ... that's that's been happening for a long time\n[noise] I I I Do think it's it's really\nFunny that she's saying she's looking at what her party's doing and she's trying to speak to them in a way to still remain relevant because of the base of the Democrat Party they believe in these tactics as a way to campaign they believe in these tactics as a way\nTo um to to try to when when they lose at the ballot box [noise] let me share with you this headline this is from Robert Costa over Washington Post I find it really

E.\nWhat about that\nI I mean I just I don't care what you're protesting for that crap is ridiculous\nYou immediately will you immediately undermined everything you stand for by behaving like that absolutely everything you stand for\nMe how you're going to sit here and protest injustice while you attack an elderly man simply because he's trying to get safely to point a to\nTo be or how you beat up another person's car causing three thousand dollars worth of damage there was a woman who was driving through and again the big fat tasty white dude who was calling everyone else Whitey seriously the guy was this pale as as just literally assaulting\nCracker he was so pale I thought it was a ghost in June ... genes\nIn short he had the big baggy shorts and the chain wallet like he lost his dog and um he was screaming at this woman like he was in ... and they were all yelling like I'll Beecher ...\nTo the one who is just have to stop like she just wanted to get to where she needed to go oh nobody\nWas antagonizing are provoking these these dogs they just they they're already provoke because they just they just want to go out there in ... hard\nOn me and they were rude I couldn't even believe that this was allowed could not even believe that this was a loud\nAnd there's some people were saying well Ted you know the mayor out there um where is ... who runs the city\nWho runs the city\nI was never a it was awful and so I you know I don't know I\nWe've been to Portland before what'd you think\nThe people in that we're going that were amazing there's some there's some good a great time very roofing full there though but they they were cool the ones that were cool but just like California there I met I not have taken kindly to somebody telling me\nKnow can you imagine if that happened we were there because we were driving ... in Portland and can you imagine because if it was it rich those drivers mhm he would've ... I wouldn't have let him turn either yeah I think he would have just kept going\nYeah you just slowly go\nBecause that's not illegal\nIt's my right of a trend that's my ride of a ...\nFor them to be in the street without a permanent like the un blocking traffic that\nIs and I would have filed charges and then I Would have tied them up in la fair until they all had to sell everything that they had in order to continue to fund their fight is not elite people need to be pressing charges against this stuff one day they're going to mess with the wrong person and they will take them to court and they will bankrupt them\nCan you measure good old man was armed and he was being chased by this\nGroup the what I had every right he would have had every right to be able to they went at him they'd put hands on him\nThat's what I think they need to start thinking about in regards to their quote unquote shovel protests\nYeah now I now I just I just it's just crazy just craziness just craziness\nSo I I've just that made me so mad I was just watching all of that stuff people try to do that in some cities like in St Louis they try but then they they get them off the highway\nI you know I don't know I don't know if law enforcement refusing to get involved if that was one of if if it was an instance of like how in Baltimore nobody wants to do anything anymore because they're always afraid that they're going to get called up for doing something and then they'll have to go to court so I don't know if it was one of those situations are what\n... what comes from the top we knew what the Baltimore mayor was all about\nWell yeah you got to give them a safe space but you know what I mean like afterwards police didn't want to engage they would rather just respond as a as opposed to just you know what I mean because they ... everything that\nThey do a second guest even it even know it was a predominantly black law enforcement demo mean predominantly black officers everything that they do\nIs is\nJust wrong before it's interpreted correctly yeah and so they don't they don't\nWant to police basically they just they will react and there have been studies on this and who would blame them and I don't know if what we saw in Portland with some of these do just standing in these officers standing to decide if that was you know one of those one of those instances\nBut I I'm\nJust to see Republicans don't have to work to cast anybody's anything like that Washington Post these they don't have to\nBecause the left does it themselves so I wanted to pull this does the story one remember Sheila Jackson Lee that guy uh the unpaid they were trying to say hey this guy was an unpaid intern\nRemember there's the staffer who worked for Dianne Feinstein and um has a Jackson Costco he was doc seen putting private phone numbers of the wives of senators and everybody else I'm he was actually even going to uh put the medical records of their children on line\nYeah well he wasn't just an unpaid staffer he was actually a fellow and he was paid he was paid by an outside institution according to a couple of different reporters and they're trying to figure out what outside institution paid him but he was paid\nHe was a paid staff or for Sheila Jackson Lee and by the way I've never seen anyone actually\nI'm no Democrat has denounced any of that by the none of them not a single one\nNot a single one meanwhile I look at\nAll of the the the violence like how we we had here this is a Democrat staffer paid staffer for Democrats\nOr was posting private information even ... about the lives of the senators spouses of senators their children young children or they were going to uh he just died Cosco was going to publish a their Children's Medical records as well\nAnd and one wanted to encourage violent you have people you have Hillary Clinton saying telling people we played that audio you can't be civil to people anymore you're Maxine Waters saying go and find them make them uncomfortable I've been seeing this in a number of different places there are other actual elected officials that are doing the same you know those kinds of essentially saying the same thing\nGo and find and you got to make them feel uncomfortable et cetera et cetera\nUm but I\nDon't really blame for instance Rand Paul's wife she gave an interview recently\nKelly Paul where she says she feels frightened because the Democrats have been so hostile remember it was a Democrat\nWho first tried to kill her husband at the congressional ball field and it was a Democrat who attacked him

them always a pleasure to have you it's kind of a it's a it's a surprising kind of news day I didn't think that I Would see Nikki Haley stepped down from her post said as UN ambassador particularly because she has been so successful at what she has done\nA ... what are your thoughts on this ... is this surprising to you\nIt is surprising to me and there's a couple of other surprises wrapped within it first the the letter of resignation seemed to have been almost a week ago\nAnd it's a surprise to me that anything in Washington has kept a secret anymore so that first and foremost was amazing that something as I think important it was kept under wraps that supposedly she and the president has talked some months back it\nIs really kind of normal that when you take these big jobs they can be exhausting it I think it's actually rational as that's just a form of management to rotate people through either you stay for two maybe three years where you got to stay the full four and see what happens after that and that's a big commitment so\nThat part of it doesn't surprise me as much but it really especially after going so deep into the rabbit hole of the capital earrings\nAh this was a really big change of topic and surprised smart\nYeah very much so there was a lot of speculation as to what perhaps could have contributed to her\nA decision to leave some were saying that because she defers foreign policy wise from the president which I never really necessarily got that impression\nUm other stay well it could be because sessions has going to step down after midterms and then ... going to go into sessions a spot and then Nikki Haley will be she'll be able to take ... but that's something that grandmothers said that he wasn't interested in doing\nAnd others have said well it's you know perhaps she just wants to spend more time with her kids you know et cetera ahead of the twenty twenty campaign because I Would think if she is a serious contender for twenty twenty four she would want to stay in that position so to what do you attribute that to think\nWell my one of the best pieces of advice I got when I first wanted the government is always assume something other than conspiracy\nBefore jumping through all of the way things might move around\nA and it may be something no more different than what she said\nA ... year you're involved in politics your governor of a steak is do you think happened in South Carolina while she was governor of that state that were cut it out of the average challenges\nUh and uh she wasn't the full on board Trump supporter going into this I think she's been historically successful UN ambassador\nBut you know talk about an institution I have almost no respect for and she goes in and she actually did I think some meaningful things on behalf of a president and the foreign policy that I think she'd basically adopted his priorities and and muscled them through are necessary\nI think she became our version of the Iron Lady up there a Turtle Bay and uh so those people who are her fans I Would consider myself to be a fan of her performance in this role or it is a little disappointed to see her stuff away\nA but she's definitely going out on top of her game I Would say\nA in a in recent times there have been some long knives that have been trying to go after her about curtains and travel expenses\nBut that's only going to increase if she stays in place for the future and boy do I think she has a future that she has to be among the leading contenders for twenty twenty four [noise]\nUh and uh that's where it's due respect to the vice President Pence Irish I of grace the steam poor\nThat guy can you imagine that would be the ... that'd be a good ticket over twenty twenty four I have to say that would be a fantastic ticket or who is who do it 'cause I Know that there have been some names tossed around to step into her her spot ah but nothing has been confirmed yet the president has said it take you know a week or two weeks\nI'm but is there anyone that and and they do you anticipate him taking someone's similar to her style because she was pretty hard line she did not mess around I mean she was\nA diplomatic to a point which I think you kind of you have to be ... at the un because you have people who are sitting on human rights council that themselves guilty of human rights abuses so it's kind of an exercise in Ireland\nEven participating in the United nations and any sort of governing there who do you think would would that would if you had a short list um would be um ... would be considered\nWell president has bought more or less intimated he already has a list ah and like I can tell you that uh I have I'm not on it and I don't know the people are that are on it uh but\nThere should be on it I'd love to see you\n[laughter] I thought you were my friend but [laughter] they definitely have I think now the blessing\nOf following someone like Nikki Haley cheap cloud a lot of ground\nSo basically so someone who can be diplomatic in the sense of getting things done uh but you don't have to respect people not worthy of respect and you don't have to respect institutions on worthy of respect and she wanted to do the business of the country I think she did a good job of it I think that's cut somewhat from the Trump claw\nTo to go about our business they're that way and so I have to believe that it's going to have to be somewhat similarly disposed person\nWhether it's from the hill or from a state I don't know uh but I if it's just kind of the run of the real diplomat and that's just way out of central\nCasting for this construction in my view that would be a real dollar from like ... like I say she she almost makes you want to believe in the un again which I Can't yeah\nYeah now do you think there's a chance and it could be a family member because some of the speculation is that it could be and I think this might just be because Haley mentioned a Jared Kushner and Ivanka a win in her remarks to the media she sat there with the president\nUm 'cause he was involved and for instance and within a mile and a number of different things that do you think that that's a possibility is that are we reading too much into it\nUh to me that is a fantastic options is because I Can't imagine with her a liberal ads left to explode\nAnd that was a and there's just no of you know I don't think that there's any reason\nFor Jared or the bunker to do anything other than what they're doing I thought it was really interesting good investor Haley\nA pointedly went out of her way to give give them credit\nOr something not that many people in Washington or going willing to do a you know I don't doubt that they have been playing some important roles behind the scenes frankly I was amazed at the first lady went on a an interesting Africa trip and almost no one wanted to care here she was doing good things with good people and\nPeople just wanted to jump back into the pool so I I think it's interesting the Jersey they've all been able to do those things but my goodness\nWhat a ... a just an absolute freak show that confirmation area would be if we if a family member or put forward\nYeah we thought we ... the confirmation hearings and that whole process was an oh my gosh I Can't even what you know what it would test the tickets if it was a
