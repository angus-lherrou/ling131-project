{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KTSA", "content": "And you could sit on a beach somewhere or have a nice house and go on vacations all over the world and do nothing just live on the money\nNow on the ... on the other hand the New York times makes it sound as though if you inherited four hundred million dollars today tell me this do you think you could turn it into several billion dollars\nLet me tell you something there are an awful lot of rich parents out there and rich grandparents out there\nVanderbilt and be like that who knows for certain that if you give\nFifty million or a hundred million or two hundred million dollars to your kids I've never had that happened to me and in fact I don't have any close friends that to happen to them we made our money the hard way we worked for it but if you inherited that money is a guaranteed that you get turned four hundred million into several billion\nAnd the answer is no it's not guaranteed at all it's very easy to take four hundred million dollars in turn into zero very very quickly\nYou'd go out and you invested in a bunch of different business enterprises and maybe you lose your shirt\nI think it's a rare individual like President Trump who is able to take money from his dad and I think he was glad to get it and turn it into much much more and he's done just that\nSo that answers that it's all ... almost as though the New York times who wants to reach read a story that says a Donald Trump is really worth as much as he claims to be worth be he got it only because his dad left him something most parents trying to leave something to their kids so let's take this down about six nachos\nAnd say let's say than instead of four hundred million\nLet's say your parents left you a house worth four hundred thousand dollars that's entirely possible in today's economy if parents bought a house for fifty grand thirty or forty years ago and it's worth four hundred thousand today\nIf you inherited four hundred thousand dollars do you think it's guaranteed that you could turn into several million or several tens of millions no it's very easy to spend the whole bundle or invest it and still lose it\nAgain it takes a rare individual so what about these tax schemes are tax Dodgers they're using every favorite word of journalists to try to say this is dirty money demand has\nThe very first line of the stories is President Trump participated in dubious tax schemes during the Nineteen nineties including instances of outright fraud that greatly increase the fortune he received from his parents much and then he'd go on to talk about how he inherited the money\nAnd how he helped his parents to dodge taxes that he and his siblings set up corporations to disguise millions of dollars in gifts from their parents\nRecords indicate Mr Trump helped his father take improper tax deductions worth millions more he also helped formulate a strategy to undervalue whose parents real estate holdings by hundreds of millions of dollars that reduced the tax bill when the properties were then transferred to him and his siblings\nBut here's where I think you get to the key part of the story that is not reflected at all in the headlines the story\nThese maneuvers met with little resistance from the Internal Revenue service the times found the president's parents Fred and Mary Trump transferred well over a billion dollars in wealth to their children now not four hundred and Thirteen million billion\nWhich could have produced a tax bill five hundred and fifty million which speaks to the death tax\nIf you're a parent you want to leave your ... your kids any amount of money should the government take over half of it when you do that\nI think most Americans who are not billionaires and they're not millionaires they may not be a hundred thousand dollar airs or whatever the word is for that you say when you leave something for your kid should the government take over half of it and most of us said not only no but hell no\nBut the key part is the Internal Revenue service looked at what they did back in the day when Donald Trump was just a real estate guy and his dad was a real estate guy didn't have any special influence wasn't running for president was when president of the United states and the IRS apparently said\nThat's okay and I assume they did the same for a lot of other people as well so the IRS says it was okay to do what\nThey did then what's the beef today or is this just another way for the old grey lady the New York times to try to paint the president one more time after they've done it a thousand times already paying him in a negative light thing most Americans should look at it and say good for you Donald Trump's\nLawyers losses show

you can't [noise] um\n...\nFlickers a coward if he thinks that Brett Kavanaugh tone is the problem\nJeff Flake as a clown and a coward\nIf he thinks that Brett Kavanaugh's tone is somehow disqualified because Jeff Flake had every opportunity to voice concern over that very issue as he's there silently on the Senate Judiciary committee as everyone else open their mouth and then\nHe held gr back into a corner and he just walked out like a beating dog to where he was confronted in the hallway he takes the easiest way opera himself every single time if he really believed that and he said nothing that he is that damn coward\nThis is where the fun stopped a coward\nAnyone who thinks there's the problem there is this a problem with the tone of an individual who has had\nFalse accusations mirrors and unsubstantiated and on the court rubber rated claim leveled at him\nHas had his children threatened his wife threatened his name drug through the mud because you have an entire political mind that in this country that cannot get over the fact\nThat America did not want what they were pushing and they're going to take it out on this guy\nThey did wild selling you align a BS that they care for

care about winning when they created a damn sexual harassment slush fund to pay off all the people that their congressional members harassed it at\nTaxpayer expense\nSo tell me the concern about winning it is nothing more than these people using women once again as political tools for the matriarch ... they tried they claimed that they elevate women but\nNo they don't they don't\nIt

apparently listen to Blumenthal here\n[noise] I Believe that Jeff Flake [noise]\nTruly want a real investigation ought to check the box sham and that's what the FBI or to be doing difficult though because it is very well ... is\nAn arbitrary in fact true accelerated true artificial to really get the job done\nYet [noise] told you\nWell it's not the FBI said they didn't need a week Blumenthal Who Lied about serving in Vietnam apparently thinks that they do oh speaking of which he got so mad\nAnd decided to yell at everybody he's saying that there were there were people marrying him for lying about serving in Vietnam [noise]\nUm and he he he got really mad but when the president called them out on it last night at the rally and Tennessee and Blumenthal responded and he his defense was literally to ignore the fact that he lied about serving in Vietnam and it was only to touch upon how the president had a misspelling\n[noise] he misspelled something or other I mean even yeah so that was his bag that was his big guy I'm I guess he thought that that's how he would\nHe would somehow [noise] um the ... dispute the claims which I thought was kind of that was that was fascinating to me he\nSaid no it was it's it's a lie I mean even you know which is pretty lefty they even think yeah you lied to New York times wrote the story about how it yeah do you live\nAnd I guess he thought he was going to come out swinging and defend himself I just don't know if I can I trust the temperament of a senator who lives about serving he treated these ridiculous personal attacks are are simply untrue here the actual facts and then he leaked linked to this random website\nWhere a\nA an article that says Trump attacks Blumenthal over Vietnam service and he says the Twitter and chief has dredged up an eight year old issue against US Senator Richard Blumenthal that the voters thoroughly ignored in twenty ten so you know it's not relevant\nAnd then they say oh well President Trump who who's Vietnam Era services precluded by doctors diagnosis of bone spurs attack Blumenthal in a tweet that contain three factual errors which they never elaborate on and arguably spelling mistakes\nAnd he they never literally mentioned the fact\nMean they just glossed over the fact that Trump was right and they said can you believe this guy that's essentially what they said so\nI re tweeted it and said shorter Blumenthal it isn't true because he made a spelling mistakes over budget is true and here's the snopes one I Love it when snopes works against other liberals and then the New York times piece Richard Blumenthal is words on Vietnam service differ from history and\nHe had said they had oh we they had his quote a what we've learned something important since the days I served in Vietnam\nUh and you exemplify it and there was one problem he never served in Vietnam he came five military deferments from Nineteen sixty five to Nineteen Seventy here the audio flashback
