left the FBI um continue to do an investigation limited in time and scope or to the Kurds allegations that are there\nThat's Jeff Flake who is thrown a curve ball\nTo everybody so I have to explain this again he said limited time and scope everybody understand what that means let's talk about that people are tweeting Abby Chad they're going to ... they're going to bring out forty women doesn't matter just for the time he's agreed to do this\n\nAnd the scope is this it's Dr Ford\nIs none of the other allegations which by ... by in large everybody's pooh poohed them even the people in the left have you noticed that the ... they they are not even really throwing that out that those allegations seem to have come and gone as fast as possible so we're on to something else now and this is the one they take as a credible\nAs it gets in this [noise] so what ends up happening here what ends up happening here is it'll be a week in scope means that\nThey are going to investigate only this if you bring them somebody else did there they're not authorized to not going to be authorized why Trump is so angry about all of the FBI stuff that's going on in Russia Russia Russia and the Mueller probe is because there was no parameters put on it\nMeaning he had the entire thing that he could go after so what do you do you go and find all the people you possibly can are associated with Trump in any way shape or form you investigate everything about them hoping that they know something along the way you find a bunch of stuff right it's like throwing a fishing that out there you're looking\nFor tuna but you're catching all kinds of other things well guess what you gotta keep those other things in this evening catch a bunch of other stuff you gotta throw back because all you can do is cats that one thing if it's there\nNothing else you can't do anything else nothing\nAnd Jeff Flake was the one that people were worried about and people like wow I ... and he's not the enemy of the people\nSeem to I used I that is the kind of craziness that's out there\nHe's not he's doing what he thinks is right he's he's he is\nHe's looking at this he's got some doubts in his mind and I said\nAll along all of this which I Believe to be one hundred percent political all of this\nWas to get somebody like flake Susan Collins Lisa Murkowski to vote no to put enough doubt in their minds well there's enough doubt that they want an FBI investigation and they're going to get that and here's the thing while that may be something\nThat the Democrats were really hoping for by the way along the way the Democrats could have done a lot of stuff like that they have the power to subpoena they could've subpoenaed mark judge in other people\nThey could if you don't need Chuck Grassley that they could have done that\nBut there are big worry is this was about the delay\n\nAnd that's all they want well they're going to get a week to lay by the look of this and while it's Mitch McConnell's floor now so this ... they have voted now to send it to the floor with like voting yes with the Republicans in doing so Mitch\nMitch McConnell could essentially today go we're going to vote on this but he knows and he's been told by Jeff like you don't have my vote if you decide to move forward this without investigation\n\nKnowing full well that there are others like Murkowski in towns have said news that we won't vote unless you do this\nAnd somebody's got his plane as the Trump so I guess that if they match [laughter] uh\nYeah and Trump asked Trump and Trump said ah you know he believes a you know Kavanaugh but he said that she was she was she she's very believable and and as well and or whatever they decide the Mitch McConnell on them\nThese good with translation it's going to happen\nJust wacky every day it's something new so we'll find out we'll find out what takes place and it it it's going to be interesting and this is the politics of it all and it's a it's the defense of this is the stuff that drives me crazy\nRight like I'm this is my frustration in you know what we're trying to do here is I'm not the Hannity's in Russia's of the world they're going to tell you to vote for I'm not going to be you know your ... I'm I'm not going to call you a great patriot are great American I\nWe are the all metal\nWe can look at stuff with reason objectivity open mind and we can go at it in that and say I I can look at this and be open minded enough I don't come at stuff like this I've said all along if I was Chuck Grassley what I Would have done\nYou call everybody out on the floor you look at them and you say hey\nWe'll do an FBI investigation again in scope but will only agree that if you guys agree to vote with him put them in a corner put them on the defensive give them what they want with the ... of what you want and find out how that rolls\n\nMany people don't want to do stuff like that they don't\nRight and and and you know they want to just ... they're not jamming him through it's going to feel like there jamming him through if you're on the left side of the aisle\nBecause it's so close but\nThis process could have been you know the Democrats yesterday let me tell you that the service

the United states will become has and will become more expensive\nWhich will hurt the bottom line of the GDP\nSo I you know look there's a there's a ton of things here and you just mentioned something that just a couple of days ago we're way far off we're not going to have to deal with the president knew that he had to have Canada in the dealer was a no go in Congress wasn't going to go anywhere right\nSo he was under that he was under that pressure to come up with some kind of deal otherwise it wouldn't go through when he had to get it done now because they want it done before December first when the Mexican president does out right so we're right at that sixty day deadline it's got to be done now so there was pressure on the administration\nDid the administration crumble on parts that they wanted I guess we shall see it was interesting that ah I read a couple of articles in the last couple of weeks from Canada\nWhere they said you know what the Canadian government decided to do which is not going to respond to Trump anything ... he can sit there and script just be quiet say nothing\nDon't give them a target back don't say anything and so if you if you think the Canadians have been quiet lately because of it\nThat was their whole purpose let's just be quiet but Canada knew that they they look they understood candidates stood that look one of the things that we have against the United states in this deal is Trump has\nTo get it done he's got to get it done by a certain time period otherwise you know the Congress is not going to pass a trade deal that separate from Mexico and therefore that's the pressure they had on the administration\nI guess we shall see well yeah it it here's what I don't fear right now I don't fear any um\nAny promotion of of a a massive I guess concession by Canada by the administration you\nKnow because the dairies tiny ... and that's that's the whole thing is that the movement if there were big movement here we we know about already that would be in the media that would be the story that Trump claims\nThe fault\nSo again how much of a victory as it did it do anything did it change anything and if we haven't gotten the steel and aluminum tariffs done then what does that look like\nBecause that that right now if you look at what is really impact of the economy so far it's been it's been that just the threat of those when they started talking about those tariffs\nSo let me ask you this is it are we at a point where both Mexico and Canada because we talked about how not a lot of details and promote about Mexico right so we just to the point where they said look we both got to say we have an agreement to start the clock ticking for the next sixty days right\nWe've come to terms and will work out the details later and we push off the deadline for now\nThan we have a lot of stuff to talk about including that a cabin on the FBI investigation or how the goalposts have been moved remember last week I said that they moved the goalpost\nAre basically from a a a you know a a an American ...
