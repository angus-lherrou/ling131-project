{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KTSA", "content": "And then the Supreme Court at the United states said no you have to be specific and that sort of made sense you have to look at that particular case you have to look at that person's history are they really the worst of the worst but there's the trick\nThe opponents of the death penalty by the way had never was in fifty years convinced any state electorate anywhere in the United states to change their mind about this have nonetheless convinced several state Supreme courts that it is in fact arbitrary and capricious to decide who is the worst of the worst when in fact\nMost of us would agree that something that should take the very careful deliberation of at least twelve people on a jury\nAnd when you do that I mean I Would think that arbitrary would be the uh the polar opposite of particular that if I drove in Astoria where you make your home and and Tina said where's you eat and I said well there's a place over there and we just pick something you know that happened to be within view that would be arbitrary\nIf I say we should we should carefully read all the reviews we should call our friends and say we're gonna we're gonna make a very careful choice that's what you're describing that the jury does but it looks at each and every case and decides does this particular person\nIn addition to that that does this person deserve it and then there's the test a three questions for quest\nAnd test Josh in Oregon to or question test you know it it is is it not merely it intentional but a deliberate killing did the victim do anything to provoke it\nIs the Senate likely to commit serious acts of future and then even the state's proven all three of those at Oregon State has to then proof that the only ... should be death the jurors all unanimously have to agree to it Washington had a similar but\nSlightly different in one significant way they had ...\nProportional punishment meaning that because people like the Green River killer it's got the death penalty defense attorneys were able to argue hey if you don't give the Green River if you don't get the death penalty than my guy all the killed six women got it\nOkay so the other piece of this is racist I looked at the state history of Washington state there have been about Seventy eight people executed since Nineteen oh for more than a hundred years sixty six Caucasians seven were black and a smaller number were Asian or Eskimo so\nThere was one Eskimo who's executed so\nIn that case how can they call this a racial ah a racial application of the penalty I Know that folks are going to say well forty percent of the people in Washington death row right now are black and forty percent of the state population is in ... to of thought or okay to have nine so well I was counting I've got a ... different list in front of me but any case\nThe but I'd pointed out to people in the program that\nOf all the murders committed in America six percent of the population black males commit fifty percent of all the murders in this country like it or not for whatever reasons or whatever historical ... five\nPercent of the victims are black and Ninety five percent of the victims are so if half the murders in America are are are black or white or black not half the black people but half the murderers are black why would it be considered racist it forty percent of Washington's death row was black\nI don't think you can simply ... you have to do a case by case right ticket or inmate that reversed was in fact the black ...\nWho was convicted of killing a white and and and there's kind of it's kind of stunning to read slate magazine where it talks about the\nDefendant having commissioned a study from the University of Washington the death row inmate commissioned a study which then convinced the Washington Supreme Court to universally turned back but after a while but but you haven't done it originally up there has been making it a point since he was elected in twenty Thirteen\nHe doesn't care what the law is doesn't care what the U.S Supreme court says more importantly doesn't care what the people of Washington state\nYeah because Washington state's citizens could tell their lawmakers get rid of this horrible penalty but they haven't done that as you point out in any one of the fifty states including most liberal but here's the ... the contradiction I see there how can you look at one particular case\nAnd then say let's apply that rule if it was ... and there could have been a conviction where somebody was convicted because your whole adult pack of racists bigots on the jury Josh thanks very much I appreciate the time you you bet that Josh Markey\nOne of the nation's top experts he's written about it

like people conflate\nYou know immigration with illegal immigration people like the conflict guns with illegal guns and I think this distinctions important to make mhm\nYeah I just I I mean he he\nWas um they met there having they met in the oval office before they had lunch and they're just I mean there are apparently discussing a bunch of stuff including criminal justice reform which by the way this administration has done more on criminal justice reform than the previous administration and even Clinton\nUh and they still have a lot to do which I'm I'm happy to see like for instance one of the things that I Hope that they look at it as the the fact\nThat I mean how many what is it did you were with the book um uh and I actually I I wanted to order at a three felonies today how the Fed's target the innocent have you heard about this it's it's this is because the the\nTerm felony has been expanded in so many things are classified as felonies now I mean non violent offenses are classified as felonies now and I'm the book which came out a while ago it says that the average person\nCommits they that the law is that that three felonies a day how federal criminal laws have become so dangerously disconnected from the common law tradition that we had\nThat it actually allows for prosecutors to eat pen arguably selling his ... his behavior on\nJust seemingly or classify seemingly innocuous behavior as questionable ... because the definition and it's because the classification of Sony has been so expanded\nYeah and\nThe I mean it gets it gets into your state and local you know et cetera et cetera says the volume of federal crimes in recent decades has increased well beyond the statute books and the morass of the code of federal regulations so you have I\nMean it's it's it is and and and it's written by this guy he's a lawyer and I mean it is scary to think just um how\nI I mean it's just I mean it's scary how how much it's been how much it's been expanded and ... especially when you think about that in terms of uh in terms of rights giving up your rights rights forfeiture that's pretty\nI mean that's kind of ... that is scary to think about it\nI mean it's scary to think about it like for instance I pull up a kind of a couple of things because there are\n\nThere I because this book this book is really good I'm\nBack here for instance uh this comes from this was one of the things that was it was disgusting to the Lacey Act if he received an odd package and um there were a couple of hundred and make sure I guess this this correctly um policy Mike and wrote about this as well\nSo here's an example\nYou own a small business that you important fish from another country and and you distribute it to restaurants one day you're expecting your usual shipment and it arrives but not in court cardboard boxes the way it usually does this time it's in plastic\nAnd it turns out that the originated in country bands the shipment of fish and plastic Steve just violated a foreign law or the Lacey Act the Lacey it by the way is what they tried to get Gibson guitar with\nYou remember that Gibson guitar which completely fine when it was importing rose would for its front boards and they argument under the previous administration was that they were in violation of ... the act which they were not and it was trying to pack them with a number of felonies\nThis is when I first heard about this book because it was like this sounds like they're really trying to drum up something and that's when I started looking into ... I'm like how the hell is that a felony and I went in and started looking at the um so and so anyway you own a small business you're importing fish is safe to seafood right\nDrunk so you got 'em your shipment and it comes it comes in plastic instead of cardboard boxes so that that violated a foreign law for other country of origin\nSo as a result that's the Lacey Act under that act it's unlawful to import export cell acquire a purchase fish wildlife are plants that are taken possess transported are sold in violation of us are Indian law in interstate commerce involving fish wildlife are planes taking possessed are sold in violation of state or foreign law that the actual writing\nThis actually happened to three Americans seafood dealers\nAs a that had no prior records they were this was back in two thousand and one they were trying to pack them for importing lobster tails that were the wrong size and packaged and clear past plastic bags rather than cardboard boxes and they sentenced them to um I in total uh ten years in prison\nBy the way do you know if you take a fake sick day that could be actionable in another\nOkay so yeah ah this was the Supreme Court actually had to go back in Edmond of the statute\nBecause it was so vague so for instance say that you would you would never do because we're all responsible people\nThat say that you know you got two tickets to you know playoffs or something and you you if you want to be able to take the day off work 'cause the seats are amazing you know you're not going to be able to get the chance again so you called and you say you're sick\nUm but apparently that is described as quote a scheme or artifice to fraud\nAnd the ... the company of their quote intangible right to your honest services which can be arguably arguably a federal crime and the statute which show unbelievably vague that a couple of years ago the Supreme Court had to get involved and actually mended to apply only to bribes or kick backs\nBecause it was show and that's not the only one that that statute that's insanely vague like that\nUh it was so ambiguous even Justice Scalia who was ah still on the bench when this was when they were a remedy and they said that it criminalizes equipped criminalizes a salaried employees funding insect to go to a ball game\nRight there was um for instance back in Nineteen Ninety six here's another one there was a well known automobile racer Bobby answer he got lost in the woods essentially he got convicted of a federal crime he was sentenced to six months in prison because he got lost in a blizzard in Colorado for two days washed while snowmobile and\n... and he was guilty of quote unlawful operation of a snowmobile within a national forest wilderness area and he didn't know who was in the wilderness area because he had gotten lost in the middle of the flipping blizzard\nThat's a felony do you understand\nAmerica storm and everyone gets are very best prosch every day of the

no problem with him saying\nGeorge Bush aides black people not at all\nIt's a threat to the narrative is what it is because it shows that if you can mainstream independence thought particularly if you come from Hollywood then more people can do it the biggest threat to Democrats right now is for\nThe idea that to be anti Democrat is the new\nGoing against the grain people love to be counter culture and\nSorry but all the social justice warriors them and all the things that you think are freaky babies they and that it does not counter culture as culture of mainstream\nCounter culture is finding

I did four or five years ago where I said that's the new punk rock\nThat's counter culture Democrats do not want to have anti Democrat day the new counter culture because then that comes to ... that becomes trendy\nAnd there are people out there who really don't have deep roots in principle they just want to go with what looks trendy\nBecause if it looks trendy it makes them look like they're smarter without having to do the work of actually improving their own intelligence and improving their knowledge and expanding what they know about an issue it just looks like oh why is that person

common ground with Trump you've gotta be crazy\nRemember when the view when when Mike Pence talked about God Speaking to him and what is the view say oh that's a mental illness and then when you know ... comes out and so some things that happened to be what the media considered to be right leaning thought\nAll of a sudden it's mental illness together it's like when they don't agree with you there are only go to use to call you crazy or to frame use some sort of you know mentally ill person\nAnd it's disingenuous if there's nothing intelligent in regards to a rebuttal to the position that was actually said it's just simply to say you're crazy and it was the laziest argument over yeah\n\nI mean it is I think that says more about them than it says about comedy I mean they're not have you heard anybody challenge any of the merits of anything that is discussing\nI haven't\nI mean I'm at I'm actively looking literally on social media right\nNow we're not going to find it because they have no argument against it I mean look at all the policies that President Trump has put in place and that are actually successful since his first days president yet none of the media wants to talk
