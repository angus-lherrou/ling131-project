paid attorneys and we were headed for divorce so we have a huge family we have six kids between the two of us so a lot of stress with a blended family mhm a lot of chaos and uh\nJust both of us spend money like crazy and and um were paid six thousand dollars to attorneys and we were I left the house to took our youngest child and ... and just ... and I'm\nTo have a friend of mine invited me and to see you and you were doing a tunnel a makeover event and she had invited me to go see you and I didn't know who you are but I didn't want to be at home with him\nSure I'll go see you and and I was at the arena yes I was like five thousand or a policy of at a friend's ass uh-huh and so we I went to go see you and I'm\nAt a lot of issues that I hadn't dealt with from my childhood and from for life and I just stuffed them down and I was spending like crazy and I didn't know that I was the majority of the problem in our relationship and then when you said um if you have a problem with money it's not the money you\nKnow I'm just kind of lifted blinders off my eyes and I realized OK I'm the problems and um that I had to do something to\nTo get all that it takes myself\nSo I went home and I begged him to give it a shot and I bought your starter ... when I was there and um and we started our journey than\nYeah we were we took the Thirteen week a few class at our church we started ... search of a long separation from from being regular tenders and went through a marriage recovery program and we just go to a really awesome church churches\nCity church ... what city church ... yeah like I said it was it was God just working and our lives from the moment you know forever but really from the ... we started this plan it just everything started\nGetting better and and we were closer together and we were on the same page and um it's just amazing\nAnd it took us thinking Fifteen months to pay off that all all of the non mortgage that in a hundred and almost a hundred and ten thousand dollars we sold everything inside and that wasn't nailed down in our house\nAnd I mean when the show which flipped with you to his foot up doesn't it yes [laughter] went from a whole whole spending stupid all the way over the wide open smart yeah yeah wow that's a true one eighty yeah\nWe just it was like the horses that you talked about in your ... few classes and then we just got together and we're nothing was going to stop us and we ate beans and cheese everything\n[laughter] ... we're going out to dinner tonight at a fairly extravagant good then we're stressed out\nGood no I just having a ...\nDay we've we stay plugged into it and just never never given up I mean we we had the opportunity to leave your classes at our church and we now leader to two separate campuses and we worked with just dozens of families and home\nAnd singles and pray with them and the coach him and now it's\nA lot of great stories and come to us on the right path yes\nYes and I wanted to tell you that are\nThirteen year old on started this journey with us when she was eight she went to our classes and a lower coordinating she's she called that they use coordinator she passes out papers and everything and and\nSo she'll lay on this plan and she goes to school and she gets her teachers mortgage advice and and stuff like that and she's just totally on the planet I fear for their kids have taken the class that we just\nWere gone for all six of them to to be in there and be on the program with us\nYou know we we really haven't stopped living either I mean we've had to buy a vehicle along the way we cash flow that um we put all new ... solid oh floors in our home and we are cash flow to trip to to Japan to see a couple\nOf our grandkids well by the way we have seven that's awesome yeah so so uh\nUh uh go back to five years ago you call him and say come home was ...\nWhat were the next I don't know I'm going to guess at a period of time three to four months like\nThis marriage is just hanging on by a thread and you say okay but let's try this together and we're not we're not going to spend like what you're spending ... out of the next three to four months it looked like from the from the I mean almost gone to we're going to turn and try\nThis there had it had to be pretty bumpy yeah was it was hard hard to trust her she spent her whole life living this way with this chaos with money and in debt and and I did it take you to trust her\nIt probably took a year or so really to to see that hey this is she's she's unseemly action not just the words right\nWell I mean that's a hundred percent but I mean probably within a few weeks you kind of how to raise your eyebrow and go wow she's really doing this I mean you really had to see that that go a little bit a glimpse of whole oh yeah\nOh oh yeah is it grew yeah trust grew over time\nWell in the moment I got home from your class I was going through my doors for trying to sell to I mean what can I sell so I sold jewelry I saw I mean you know he was seeing that I was generating there and I'm from this jewelry and he's like oh okay and on and tell him put it towards the credit card so you heard\nAny bay business a rival anybody and just amazing she sold some of my blue jeans for fifty dollars a piece where the collecting dust you know\nAnd God has redeemed every bit of that in this marriage and I I got to tell you there's no way you taught that many for the Fisher lifted classes without your marriage story causing people's marriages to be healed\nTo here in in any I'm more in Longmont, Colorado working in the manufacturing homes\nIn which the manufactured home that didn't that the kids not closing on\nYeah his mind oh okay not a lot of an outcast deal okay and we just found out yesterday for wheelchair what she had shared if the kid had already put this application for weeks ago when he put the offer an a ha and we didn't find out he didn't\nYou just need to sit there and you're manufacturing home and manufactured home until you get it so when you get it sold and when it closes only then can you close on another purchase and if they're made and if that means you rent for a little while in between it means you rent for a little while in between you know we're going to end up with two houses\nYeah I Know I don't have to be honest I\nDon't do it on how about you for rather well appreciate that but don't do it you know what happens is is you get caught everybody does wish I'd do it do you've done it you get caught up in the the the narrative of this the story of this\nAnd it starts to feel like you're stuck and you have to do things but you don't have to do anything\nYeah go ahead and tell my husband and I said we don't have you any than just the house and you know it's just the house\nWhen do you remember how you heartfelt big an open when you move to Colorado and you're going to try new adventure\nI Know everybody kind of the same as just the opposite of that I Know your heart I feel like it's in a cage\nAnd yeah I told my husband I feel cornered right now and I call a healing for him\nYou know why you feel cornered is 'cause you're cornered wondering why you would feel court so you're on here's what you do when you're cornered you throw up your hands and you walk out\nYeah I did that last night I walked out with my husband was ...
