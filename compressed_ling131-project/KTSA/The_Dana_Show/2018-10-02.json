mind denied\nExplores a you know I'll tell you I've got to change my narrative here so that they listen to your ears quite All right on your head to people all the time\nWell it just kind of like what are your previous callers era where you'll have a lot of time\nBut anyway this is a victim cultures they seems like it's just a holdover from the sixties it's gotten so bad that we have a full adult basically was lead a pretty ... pretty good life and uh oh I'd\nSay a damn good life I I think you're I think you're okay 'cause I didn't have it by most people's standards you think boy if that was the most exciting you know that he got involved in that he went to some parties and drink some beer when he was in high school uh he he had you know we'd probably qualify as boring it many of the high schools I I Know of\nWell and that's it you know they got to go all the way back\nWhen the guy was a lawyer and it just kind of all of the bottle so the thing is I guess with the push on the media\nWherever he goes oh gosh shot casually let that go that is a satire sitcoms your talk shows to the ... with a push is so heavy that pushes so are you did it\nI guess it was a show that even if he will speak out against any sort of victim culture whatsoever so pervasive nowadays really whatever's going on\nYou know that these people go take a left or what you're talking about west but you know ... or ... you know they they spoke about being strong nose and it just takes such a runner\nThat you can't believe it so I guess my question is you know in my opinion\nIt's gotten so far so pervasive now that that that they got to do this kind of stuff that is out of the bottle how's it going to be\nPut back in I I don't know that it will\nI guess and here's here's the thing to him if somebody like me comes out and criticize as somebody who comes forward as a victim they're going to say well you're attacking the victim I have no interest in doing that\nBut I Will tell you this the one the people I'm impressed by I remember that broke on I don't always agree with Tom Brokaw says politics and things like that but he wrote a book called the greatest generation now and I interviewed him way back in the day when the book came out and he talked about a man who came back from World war two blind in both eyes\nAnd what did he do you know he did he said it at home and collect his disability check he became one of the best\nPeople I think he was in the Chicago area\nAnd they would literally send other veterans to him who were demoralized because they were a ... they were remembering all the things that have been done to them the limbs they lost the disability that they now suffer and we feel for all those people this guy though didn't tell them to say well just be a victim\nHe taught them how to get things done and they looked at him and thought\nThis guy came back blind in both eyes and became a fantastic you know businessman insurance agent he did well and he did well despite a disability that you could say is pretty devastating for somebody to want to work in a business where you have to read a lot you don't have the tools we do today\nAnd and you say well if if he can do it\nThen I'm missing a law or an ... an arm or hand or a leg\nIf he can do it I can do it then they sent sent people to end veterans to him for inspiration\nInstead today when was the last time that you saw somebody lauded for taking a disability and doing well despite or in spite of the disability what'd you hear more is this person is disabled and they're you know their their disability has overwhelmed them\nI'm impressed especially by those people who say I may have lost this or that but I'm going to go ahead and I'll live and even better life than I Would have otherwise

other way\nWhat changes what changes\nWhat is it what is the seventh FBI investigation going to find that the six previous ones didn't what is another FBI investigation gonna find particularly after he was nominated to the federal court years ago what is the seventh one gonna find I mean\nIt it is it deflects retiring he can he's just worried about his legacy what is what is it ... what do they know they're going to find that's the other big question here's the thing\nI don't think that this is you could you you could think that Jeff Flake was is it is a total compromise run that he screwed over the geo pills so this is the second way to look at it\nBecause this whole entire thing priest opposes that Democrats are in any way acting in good faith\nThis whole thing another week of investigations priests opposes that they're approaching it from a a fixed point of good faith does it seem\nAfter watching the last week unfold two weeks of old that anything these people dont have done it in any way indicative of good faith\nWithholding the name\nWas holding the an accusation instead of if it was so serious why did they sit on it for six weeks\nIf you're acting in good faith do you sit on a serious allegation for six weeks\nAlmost two months do you keep it from your colleagues do you do not refer it to the FBI for natural investigation\nOr when you finally do send it over because you're you're staffers are bickering do reject enough portions of the letter that it's completely irrelevant including a name and a number of of of significant\nPieces of information is that is that do you think that that's acting in good faith do you think\nThat it's acting in good faith that for two weeks people sit here and go well we need to have another FBI investigation we need to have the FBI look into this and then now that the FBI looked into this they're saying well they're they're not going to have to find anything in one week\nSo wait a minute it was important enough for you to say that you want to they have better look into it but now you're doubting the FBI's ability to actually look into it\nDoes that sound like that's in good faith do you any of it because the none of that stuff it sounds like it's in good faith to me\nAll of this ... it was serious enough only to bring it up now was it serious enough to report it to the authorities when you've got the accusations it wasn't serious enough to bring up back in two thousand and six when he was first nominated to be a federal judge\nIs that it because that's not in good faith none of that is in good faith\nDo you think it's in good faith to leak it to the media\nBecause it doesn't sound like leaving it to the media is acting in good faith\nSo that's the other way to look at it you can look at it like flick compromised to a bunch of people who have no interest in acting in good faith that all whatsoever\nSo these are the two ways that you look at it [noise] I actually think it's a bit of both I think that they both can be true\nIn maybe not equal parts but I think that they both can be true I think both of these things can coexist in both be the answer\n\nThat is um that's\nI and I think that's the situation here\n\nBut the ... we had just this is this week we're going to probably hear even now everyone's focusing on the drinking which we are going to talk about a moment the goalposts are moving\nNow it's well you know really can't be because the investigation is only supposed to be limited to what is public and it's not supposed to last any more than one week Rosenstein apparently told flight that it's going to completely the course they're going to get it done within a week\n\nOf course they will I had a question to that I had asked earlier and I haven't gotten a good enough to answer to it um I was I was curious as to whether or not um I was curious as to whether or not Dr Ford is going to release to the FBI her therapists notes that she's refused to release to the Senate Judiciary committee because\nSee this is what happened when the FBI investigates this isn't a criminal this is just back another background check if they find anything\nYesterday refer it to the Senate Judiciary committee\nSo why now would you not share therapists knows which is the key part of what you claim is your ... the cooperation of your story to the Senate Judiciary committee how how can you have a full investigation when you're a therapist knows where you say you first told you first mentioned Brett Kavanaugh\nFrom back in twenty ... well when you won't make those public when you won't make them available to the individuals that are investigating the situation and come into a determination based on the available evidence I Wonder how do you hope to have a fair and and real investigation when you're withholding pertinent\nEvidence I don't I think\nThere's I think the investigation is a sham and just\nIt was ever therapists notes and the questions to the polygraph\nIf they if they were in good faith interested in a real investigation those things would have been made available to the Senate Judiciary committee immediately\nFirst and foremost the whole damn accusation would have been set on for two months all of that would have been available to the Senate Judiciary committee and the fact that it wasn't makes me question any good faith effort from this party and it undermines any credibility that anybody may have\n\nAnd that is not the fault of the Republicans it is not the fault of Grassley it is not the fault of of of uh Lindsey Graham it is not the fault of Brett Kavanaugh it's not the fault of anyone in terms of how that was handled\nSo I think it's a bit of both with a lot of not good faith movements\nAnd then we had the Mitchell memo believe all women except Rachel Mitchell were going to discuss that because Rachel Mitchell doubled down and says there's not enough evidence there even go to court with it there's not enough evidence there to substantiate even an investigation\nWe're going to talk about that as well coming up and can you expect to James James Comey weighed in with an editorial yesterday do you expect a fair

is a noble cause they're not going to get much scrutiny the people who are trying to take Kavanaugh down but that they use what this can be played out over time and destroy the ability to get people to come forward\nYeah I and I I Do I completely think that Lindsey Graham is absolutely correct in that um and and right now the way it's\nAs it stands Schumer says well you know it won't hit more than a week for or this or this investigation and the Kavanaugh is that still going to be his answer within the next forty eight hours and the next Seventy two hours will have to be his answer I'm so curious as to whether\nOr not that's going to change its especially now that you have some Democrats saying well we have to include Deborah Ramirez into this and we have to include a Julie sweat Nick who is completely not credible at all whatsoever I mean you're unless you're talking about it's gotten believable for a grown woman that no one remembers\nTo go into a a high school party so none of that makes any sense none of that makes any sense\nSo this is a this hopefully we'll see what happens within the next week and we'll see if the goalposts ... joining us right now uh from the great Republic of Texas Senator Ted Cruz\nWhat is obviously going to be a very very busy next couple of weeks he joins us on the phone senator it's a pleasure to have you thanks for your time today\nDay and it's great to be with you thanks thanks for what you do each and every day defending our liberties\nOf course well and we appreciate the words that you shared with the Senate Judiciary committee as well it was a very very tough few days last week and I have\nTo ask you about your colleagues Senator Jeff flake because he said his decision to call last week for an FBI investigation he intimated that it was done out of a higher moral duty or do you do you believe him how how do you feel about about his call for an investigation and to that point is the FBI capable of a fair probe\n[noise] well I'm not going to second guess his motivations I'd yeah I'd like our objective needs to be to move this ... this nomination move expeditiously and and and and confirmed judge Kavanaugh and I think we're on a path to doing that uh and that Jeff said\nFor for him to go forward that he wanted the FBI\nOr to conduct background investigation into these allegations that that that is happening now and and and the way we requested that the FBI complete that investigations note in in no longer than a week and so on friday we asked them to get get the results\nAre no later than this coming friday there they're engaged in that investigation now I think we will get the results I think\nEveryone expects the results\nAre to be very similar to what what what we found that the here um I I think it was right\nOr that that that we gave doctor for that she had a full and fair opportunity to tell her story I think it was also writes the judge Kavanaugh had a full and fair opportunity to defend themselves and and and at the end of the day\nI voted yes confirmed judge Kavanaugh because when you have conflicting testimony from the both of them uh to to resolve that conflict you look to other corroborating evidence and all of the corroborating evidence in this case\nA conflicts with the allegation and and and so we'll await the FBI a background investigation but but I think the expectation a most senators is that is that it will be a very similar to the testimony we've heard already\nDo you think that there's any chance this goes beyond one week\nBut it depends what's in the ... the FBI or investigation obviously if if if if that investigation undercover at a uncovers things that are are\nConcerning that that that could delay matters a but assuming the FBI reports are consistent with the sworn testimony you know the three ... witnesses that Dr Ford identified\nA she named ... witnesses all three of them\nGave statements to the Senate Judiciary committee under penalty of perjury under penalty of five years in prison if they were lying\nAnd every one of the fact witnesses who she is a disputed her story including a one woman who was a longtime friend of hers that new says she doesn't know stabbing on it and and there's no recollection of ever be any party with judge capital that that particular\nUp from a witness who had no incentive to lie what every incentive to back up those allegations\nI'm ... that I think is quite significant than and assuming that the FBI investigation reveals the same and I think we have every reason to expect that uh that I think we are likely to see the the the full Senate voting\nI'm voting on this nomination at the end of this week\nRight this this whole requests for this investigation it seems somewhat predicated upon the belief that your your colleagues from across the aisle politically as the minority party in the Senate Judiciary committee that they're acting in good faith\nDo you believe that they are I Know that you had harsh words correctly where it's not really harsh that you know honest criticism about how everything was handled you you made that very clear during the ah the committee hearings and when judge Kavanaugh and Dr for both appear do you think that they're acting in good faith going forward\nI or the Senate Democrats have demonstrated beyond a shadow of doubt that they're acting in ... face a within minutes of judge Kavanaugh's nomination being announced\nA name many of them made explicit that they would do anything and everything necessary to try to defeat this nomination uh we saw\nDuring the hearing a couple of weeks ago we saw the protests are that that it's been publicly reported were were actively coordinating with Democratic senators to have protesters stand up and scream and disrupt the hearing the first day we had Seventy people arrested\nOr the best of my knowledge that never happened in a Supreme Court nomination hearing in it and it shows just how extreme just how radical Senate Democrats are on this\nAnd and most strikingly if you look at Dr forge allegation window that the the democratic ranking member Senate centered Dianne Feinstein\nHad these allegations in writing on July ... months ago and she did absolutely nothing with them she didn't refer them to the FBI she didn't refer them to the full committee she didn't ask for them to be investigated when judge Kavanaugh met with her privately in her office she did that scored a bounce them\nWhen we had three days of public hearings with judge Kavanaugh she didn't ask for a word about it when we had a confidential hearing that is the explicitly designed to consider sensitive matters she didn't ask word about it we also know\nThat Dr Ford testify that she made very explicit she wanted to remain confidential in the the only people that had her letter she told the committee\nFor herself her lawyers Senator Feinstein and the and the congresswoman ...\nThat means that when when the letter was leaked it could only have come from one of the Democratic members of Congress either\nCongresswoman issue or her staff or Senator Feinstein her her staff or somebody they gave it to", "show_name":
