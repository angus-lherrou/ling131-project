can never be one hundred percent certain that something is not going to head and negative consequences somewhere down the lie\nAnd then it specially true of GMO foods because GMO food being eaten in America and other places for many many decades and literally\nThousands of studies have gained download a and nobody has found any link between GMOs and a negative or at the U.S health consequences which really means\nThat it is much more likely that the precautionary principle and the anti GMOs stand in Europe is not really driven by health concerns but it has driven a buy\nA specially farming lobby and farming lobby in France is extremely\nPowerful and without French consent you kind of a way to get anything done in Europe because the French ... is such a very important country with the European Union\nSo in other words and if I could make the simpler a or a piece of it simpler Marion or if you have farmers who say if I use the GMOs seed ah for my competitor uses the GMOs seed he or she can grow many times more\nProduce or crop than I can with the same amount of land and the same amount of labor so it's a threat\nTo the to traditional farming because the marketplace will say well if you're growing twice as many bushels a weed you're going to make more money if you're ... you're a pure broke a if you're growing twice as many uh tons of grapes to\nMake wine from ... you're going to make more money and you may be able to ... at a lower cost and your old fashioned folks who say no I'm not going to use GMO or they're going to lose out commercially so they don't like is there any reason\nYeah so it's old fashioned\nProtectionism and from the perspective of Europe in our midst and especially ... makes sense they ever farms all this lead much smaller uh they have much less a technological input on their farms which means that their costs and to be higher and ah they see\nThis as a way to keep American pro juice out but of course that doesn't make it more\nIt doesn't make it economical um it just makes it\nA but it makes it ... it makes sense from that perspective but it's but it's not a good idea for for example for the European customer uh the British um estimate\nThat when they leave the European Union and when they are allowed to him or American GMO foods therefore the prices will go down by eight percent and\nA lot of saving as I have him on our fault for people yeah especially ...\nUh marry and tell me this so how does this threaten people in Africa because people may I don't know this but much of what Africa grows you know some of it feeds the population but some of it is for export to Europe and the Europeans say we won't take it if you grow GMO\nThat's right so a little bit of a background or last time there were a large a shortages of food in Africa which happens at the turn over the millennia roughly in two thousand and two or so\nAfricans actually refused American food aid even though that people are starving um because they were worried that if\nGMO corn and soy yeah I'm ... uh intermingled with domestic production of corn and then the Europeans\nWell there used to import coroners from Africa or let me put it differently that the Europeans would label\nAfrican corn as being\nGMO infected basically because it lets those jokes on its way and it's ... or ... percent\nOff a lot more than a joke when I say all the home page which is ... and then that could be your ... in order so the Africans who should they basically said well we cannot whisk oh a cultural\nExport the European Union so a rather well it is not to accept American food aid and laid out people stop and that\nIs unbelievable you can read about it at human progress dot org Mary and to be as a senior policy analyst and we appreciate his time lawyers

they have to say something they'll say the enemy of the people barked Kanye out of the ... out of the game\nOh I like how they're just so laughing about it I you know looking back in ... a couple that's Halloween all of our bumper tracked music is reflecting the fact this is a day\nWhere all my normal everyday items in decorations makes sense and our bumper music makes sense it's the one day you know so I really really just and marinating in that\nI said when all of this went down with the ... thing right when he came out and he was saying what he was saying and people were so mad at oh\nI just I I I was definitely not one of the individuals who wanted to run out there and Chris and him the newest night of conservatism\nBecause that stupid\nBut I like when people ask questions as long as people are civil and cool I'm civil and cool\nAnd it's just it's that simple and I like people who ask questions and I like people who challenge the status quo and I like people who say why do why do people have to think this way or that way why why is it bad if we just ask a simple question you fascist why can't you know just simple things like that you know the simple things\nSo Kanye West\nUm he had been working with cheap USA and I'm a\nA bunch of folks and he met with the president remembering where the ... about what the president everybody went after him because Hollywood is just a ridiculous thing a Hollywood you know you everybody has to agree to saying because heaven forbid we have any sort of diversity of thought at all whatsoever\nIt's kinda creepy like the Borg except the without the hot costumes\nAnd really just a supremacy is you know strategy and just overwhelming numbers but anyway I mean just\nThe um I'm not glorifying the board mind you I mean because they were they did end up being defeated but I'm just simply saying that it's a maniacal group of individuals in a fictional fantasy world um that in many respects echoes what we see in Hollywood except without being daring qualities\nNow moving on\nSo calling us had met with the president then everybody saw any they they've had the photo up they did all the things and and I just kept thinking you know I\nThat's at some point it really seems like a ... you know he may he may end up changing his mind who knows\nWho knows what he's going to do is calling us he might you know who knows well apparently he did so TMZ I think has the story first where\nSo there was what is it there it's called the black exits meaning the black exit from the Democrat Party and so there was a clothing line that was launched and I don't know if it's cheap US air kind of someone's or\nTV or say Kansas owns and it was ... or what I don't know but uh apparently it was\nUm it was this\nClothing line that was going to come out and\nIt was debuted at this event that was in D.C just over the week and it was hats insurance I think we had it as actually like a quick had mindedly uh yesterday was that of course I don't I'm pretty sure\nSo he took to Twitter and\nWas not pleased about it tiny west took to Twitter and this was after it was announced and I think everybody just sort of thought that you know he knew of what was happening but he said I'm he tweeted a\nHe said uh I support or creating jobs\nAnd opportunities for people who need them to ... the most I support prison reform I support commonsense gun laws that will make our world safer\nI support those or risk their lives to serve and protect I support holding people misuse or power accountable I Believe in love and compassion for people seeking asylum and parents who frightening protect her children violence war\nAnd then he also said I introduce Candace talking about oh and so the person and it just kind of see the person who made the logo and they didn't want their name on it so she used to mine I never wanted any association with blacks it I have nothing to do with it\nMy eyes are now open and my ... my eyes are now wide open and now realize I've been used to spread messages I don't believe in I Am distancing myself from politics and completely focusing on being creative three exclamation points\nAir well now\nIt could be I I just I just don't think there's somebody that went as hard as he did when he was meeting with the president and everything else I just I just don't see I don't think that he had a change of heart I think that he actually politically he built I think he you know I don't know I think he believes in some of this stuff\nI think he believes in certain things um I but I also think that he is not a conservative at all\nI think that there are just some things that there's some common ground you know like prison reform for instance there's some common ground\nStuff there [noise]\nI also think that he's under immense pressure from Hollywood there are people who are supposedly his friends attacking him because he was just speaking out differently about different political issues which I'm Sorry but if you treat me like that you ain't no friend of mine\nIt is amazing you'll find who your friends are once you start speaking about stuff you find who your friends are then you find who the ... the people who are just not in but social climbers and they want the association you find the cleaners Klinger honors the people who just\nWant to hang out for the ride and they want you know they want some of the that that you find those people right quick the week people fall you see\nI don't know maybe we can from people I Know you find those people super fast and you also find that people that you know really appreciate you for being you write because simply voice you know an opinion about politics I I'm an ...\nThomas Jefferson quote but I've never thought a difference in political belief which stand in the way of me being a friend with someone unless of course you're talking about completely disarming the and making the victim in which case stuff off um but other than that\nI think you can find common ground with people but by finding common ground for those who have one brain cell up I don't mean that you compromise what you believe and I'm just saying you find something that you do agree on was someone and maybe start some sort of amicable relationship\nThere it's not hard it's like people forgot how to get along but I think he got so much pressure yeah people who claimed that they knew him people were friends with and people you know et cetera that were trashing him in the press mainly to get their name and the press more than anything else there was a huge amount of pressure\nI think people realize if you even have one person who is prevalent and pop culture that decides to speak out on these issues then that could create a that creates a a an affect people start other people will start believing this they'll start going all they'll start thinking the same thing or they'll start asking ...\nSince then the underdog has always been trendy the
