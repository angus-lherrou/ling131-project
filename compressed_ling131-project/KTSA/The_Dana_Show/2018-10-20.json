{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KTSA", "content": "Right right so we found that they are really two two kinds and then we can kind of dig into details cater to two kinds of dark horse is the first people who look like they struggle\nEarly in life and then just out of nowhere or just like incredibly accomplish right there's another group that are they really have success\nThey they realize they're not really happy or a failed so then they make this a pretty big pivot to something else and or like rock stars there too and I'm In either case what ends up happening is they really are looking inward and prioritizing what matters to them and that's what puts them on those paths\nProfessor rose that second category the ones that all those who goes suggestions that now this isn't for me and you have a favorite example of that who's who's known perhaps for my audience\nYeah so look I'm well first off a like I had a biased against super famous people so\nI grew up in rural Utah so by the way what why have you on your show was saying\nI Am a transplant to Cambridge so um we I purposely didn't want to study famous people are celebrities cause you know what I like those insights early so useful to people right if you're rich or have a lot of connections like but so I Will tell you that I'm Out of the everyday people will tell you who became excellent\n... one of my all time favorites in that second tight we talked about is the kind of Alan ... and ... and if people Google and you'll figure out just how amazing isn't a first but he is a world class Taylor\nLike the spoke tailor it right and like for the rich and famous for like celebrities you know the whole patriots football team if they think and he came from a hardscrabble town where he actually was an entrepreneur who had a bunch of bars and restaurants and real estate and realized you know what that's just not bringing him fulfillment\nSo we sell the news on and goes in search of what's really going to matter to him and they said he ends up being this amazing Taylor and usually it's not we think about how people get their\nWell but uh I can imagine is friends' reaction or his family I'm going to sell all this stuff and I'm not making this great income and I'm going to go out and make men's suits and and what his what his family and friends would have said to that\nAnd here's the thing because I think most of us when we care about people\nWe we think that the standard way that like all these institutions have told us as safe as we think it's safe we think it's secure but in reality as long as you're being true to yourself and I don't mean that some some fancy way I mean it like\nKnow who you are you really value and make choices off of that and when you do that you're motivated engaged and you're going to crush it right and that that's what really successful people have in common\nI'm Talking to Harvard professor Todd Rose who hails from Utah that's got to be unusual because what are you hanging out with a lot of swells we're all talking about their private school upbringing on the east coast\nThat's what I mean well you know I I went to public schools my kid with the public schools and I'm proud of that fact\nWell and I I think you should be I think people can get a lot of the public schools have we demand that the public schools actually performed sometimes they do and sometimes they don't like I think they could use a little bit of competition but what about that first category you talked about give me an example there if you don't mind\nI'll give you my favorite ones I'm so we talked to a woman who was a high school dropout and she\nGot pregnant and it'd be a single mom by twenty she was working at a fast from a joy\nAnd in in a New Zealand and her life was kind of rock bottom she had to pick me where she's out in in the rural area with some of our family they have or look up at the Milky Way with some binoculars and she just become obsessed about the stars\nAnd she committed yourself to try to figure out everything she cared about the flash for ten years later right she's managed to become an internationally respected astronomer she discovered a planet she discovered an asteroid she's published in all these scientific journals she never went to college never even got to high school\nThat's great well and of course I I can think of an old example you probably wouldn't have used but ... had from what I've read of him he was a terrible math student for a long time and punish public school wasn't exactly doing it for him and he certainly wasn't doing it for them and then later on he becomes the rock star\nThat's right and and look we we celebrate them once they become successful and and my point is simply that we individuals in this country have way more to offer that our system sinks\nAnd the second we stop thinking that we're there to serve the systems and we start building systems that are responsive to us as individuals we're going to unleash so much talent and\nFulfillment in this country will just be surprised the book is called dark horse he its author is Harvard professor Todd Rose professor to

whisper campaign to try to whatever Trump I don't think people give that much of a crap about his reputation in this as opposed to well how is it that this is again you're a columnist for the Washington Post is targeted by Saudi Arabia how the hell does this happen\nWell there's more to the story as there is with every story\nAnd I do think that Shawn Davis has a huge point you're talking about the same people who Dallas Lee defended Brock Obama's insane stupid non deal with Iran these people are ... are apologist for Iran so if you immediately don't go with whatever narrative\nAbsent

impeachment and you said in July the what is a member of the house right now voted to impeach if you changed your mind\nAnd that's when he kept going on and then he 'cause he talked about he talked about Russia he talked about\nEverything but the actually answering the questions and then finally goes well but yes to answer your question or do you think there's enough there for impeachment and in fact I Would vote on it what do you mean enough there so he would he's he's but he said he was neutral on a vote to remove but he would vote to impeach\nWhat is it even me\n\nWell I don't even know why he's not going to be removed yeah that was the whole point\nUh you can't there's hardly any of this works\nI'm Glad that that uh Dana Bash pin him down on us that was good because that he just was all over the place with his answers I mean he just he's not a good candidate he's just simply not as a candidate by the way he also said that his mom is a lifelong Republican except she's not\nSo Eli she's not a lifelong Republican she's a a Brock Obama donor she donated to Brock Obama and she's voted in Fifteen of the Seventeen a Fifteen of Seventeen democratic primaries\nOkay well um\nThat would

results\nOf about a breeder for investigations that would be able to get to the bottom fairly and I'll see you on the\n\nTo be very severe evidence it's bad bad but we'll see what happens\nNow it is it's it's bad stuff uh but\nWhenever you ask questions about it the media immediately assumes that you're somehow participating in a whisper campaign\nWith which has saved Trump and discredited individual but there's more to it than just that I'm joining us right now Dr Judy Jasper who just as his wheelhouse of course\nUh who knows all about this just to give us some perspective on this and Dr ... the president of the American Islamic forum for democracy and he's also the author of a battle for the soul of Islam and you can actually take back Islam dot com where he's also the founder on Dr ... thank you so much for joining us\nIt's great to be within a thanks for having me\nGive us some perspective on this because I you know I I find it hard to believe that the crown prince of Saudi Arabia\nWould decide to because he had hurt feelings over something that a ... you wrote about in his columns that he would carry out an assassination in broad daylight ah where his people in his inner circle would be caught on closed circuit TV entering the consulate\nAnd just over over the column I mean there seems to be a lot more here I'm ... ... is that an accurate way to kind of view the situation\nAlthough certainly a lot more there and it is is just baffling to me to see the\nGyrations that the left media the legacy media is doing in this story which is all of a sudden they've taken a guy\nWho you know under any other planet or would be I'm surprised even had a resident visa ear and out of the Washington Post as line I think him and making them into a hero and they haven't really looked at his writing then we'll get to that in a second what\nAre the Saudis are concerned they're ... they're they're Middle East dictatorship and and yet the President Trump was left with the\nObama disaster that had been so one sided to the Iranians that he's trying to resurrect sort of the twentieth century\nModel of foreign policy which was a balance between Sunni and Shia so at the end of the day us are becoming unhinged about what happened to Mr ... is going to end up benefiting the Iranians the Qataris and the Turks\nNow that doesn't mean that an ally has free will to assassinate the\nA columnist an activist but we should not be a glossy glassy eyed on exactly what this guy was all about and what was the about well I'll remind your three or four months ago the Saudis put into sort of a detention and the Ritz Carlton all of the the royal family that was involved with the Muslim Brotherhood\nSo they took basically a trillion dollars that had been used globally for the last fifty years where the Saudis had been funding Muslim Brotherhood operations around the planet the last six months they put a stop to that part of the leader of that was allowed in will lead who owns a center at Georgetown has owned a uh a center at Harvard\nEt cetera which has been radicalized Muslims in the west well one of the close friends that will lead is ...\n... came to America a year ago there's no doubt that the princes folks wanted to bring to show the end for interrogation and another thing so odds are that went sour odds are like many other dictatorships on my only knows the Syrian one pretty well\nThey're pretty ruthless bugs and they may have just gone\nOut with the bottom line is this guy was part of the royal family that was pro Islamist pro Muslim Brotherhood anti American very anti Israel the Saudis shifted than the ... month decided to become more pro Israel\nIsn't real reforms it's more pragmatic politics and this guy was standing in the way of that with a Twitter following up to three million we're starting to write more and more critical against the Saudis and\nThey probably wanted to contain it\nWell that and the and that would make sense the New York times had a piece of just a few days ago where they wrote about his membership and the Muslim Brotherhood which is why I thought it was so weird that the Washington Post that it was\nConservatives that we're conducting a whisper campaign because I looked at the New York times piece and they said you know ... friends were even saying that\nWhenever they would talk with him he very much expressed Arab anti western sentiments and he was a very much into political Islam and he was very much more extreme than some of what was being promoted and the charm offensive\nBy the Saudi crown prince and you just touched on on doctors Yasser you just touched on\nA one of the other point I was going to ask you was whether or not that charm offensive\nAnd and all of this reform that we hear being discussed with the Saudi royal family and with Saudi leadership and policy if it was real reform or if it was more just sort of\nUm a way to to survive politically and you answered that for me\nYeah I mean NBS is no more real reformers in ... according to the Washington Post contrary to what the Washington Post said two months ago ... was writing about how the caliphate\nIs real the Muslim Brotherhood should be a given time to evolve in the bottom line it's a majority of credit of approach to the ... if you will and that's not liberal democracy and I have to tell you I did my cats\nSo that'll air this weekend on the show gave a reform this is the name of it and I basically talk about how much this service and how much it breaks my heart\nThat they are lying I think a gentleman who yes we should speak out our allies should not be taking a abusing or or violating human rights of people that are American residents or alone and I said what the Saudis should do if they really want the ... for what they did that this man\nReleased rate better we relieve release the leader of only or the attorney that has been in jail for defending raped but we we have called for the release to fund the prisoners of conscience in Saudi Arabia or secularists\nWho are Christians who are other minorities that have been abused and nobody cared until somebody who was in the inner circles of the Islam This lobby in Washington\nAh got assassinated and now all of a sudden they care what the Yemeni to her being massacred whether Saudi now all of a sudden the elites in Washington care about the human rights abuses of the Saudis went for eight years we couldn't get Obama dimension once the name of a dissident in Saudi Arabia that we've been working to help\nSo this is just the I mean the reality is is that\nUh we should change the way we approach and hold them accountable we should not end arms deals but actually start to hold them accountable and the reason we shouldn't and the arms deal is that the balance against the Iranians there's nothing more\nBackslapping that's happening now than between the ministers of foreign affairs in Syria and Iran and turkey that are cheering on ah the the decrease in the civility between the American and Saudi relationship\nYes and and and that would explain why all of a sudden as you mentioned how that nobody really said anything about the president's silence of previous presidents silence and all of these dissidents and\nUh and individuals that you named who are wrongly imprisoned or they haven't really said anything about them the or the the previous administration silence of it but this ... and ... those are all the same people that were attacked\nMorgan stay connected to the latest news weather and traffic for

I mean I just think regardless it robs the ... the more important points that were being made at the beginning\nThe fact that due process is under attack due process is being undermined our Fourth Amendment rights are being undermined and there is absolutely and I have talked about this I've mentioned it in my books a cultural war on boys\nAnd it just missed\nAll of that because they went from talking about this to\nWhom Jane I just\nIt's a problem that the left has when they talked about skin color to like it's not\nWe all know that that's not it right the someone's character that makes the movie are has nothing to do with their skin color so I think you're right the dilute it'd be really important message which actually there's a lot of important information and messaging in the commercial if it goes important but when they talk about the white Dems lynching or white girl calling rape or whatever\nIt loses it loses me you know what I mean that must have just lost on me completely and\nI was identifying with them or ... at first like oh these are boy moms and I'm listening to boy I'm like I Know and then right when they went to the ... I'm like oh\nYou're the care about their husbands their sons their their reimpose the care about those ... yeah I get that but then when you went right into that left the tactic of saying it's um you know what I mean that's what it it's a lefty tactic that turns people off and we saw it in twenty six and\n... and people need to realize that didn't work for them just as you said it did it work for Democrats and twenty sixteen so why would we use it ... why would anybody on the right use it\nLike you said it takes the focus of what really is the solid messaging of this book and just focuses it on the frivolous empty left you tactic\nYeah that was that was enforced because I think it was you know you have boy moms talking and it's a powerful testimony from boy moms I'm not saying anything of that girl ... but you know ... moms of boys you know you all know and to hear them discuss but then right and then they took it they used that identity politics that that\nUh uh\nThat identity politics that tactic that we have seen the last few so often and that's when never ever adopt of an unsuccessful tactic from the left never because it will if it's it's not that it never is going to work it's not going to work if it doesn't work then it's not going to work with you and it just as even I just don't like any of it\nI don't like them for the road with them all the way through even the part where they were talking about you know hey the presumption of innocence until guilty you know becoming the presumption of innocence\nLike I'm I was all the way with them and that commercial after that and they talk about what ... it's like come on yeah no Democrat don't really like them yeah that's a living do that\nYeah goodness anyway so that has a\nYup that was kind of problematic we have a Louie Gohmert congressman Louie Gohmert is going to join us at the bottom of the hour to discuss that migrant care of and that is winding its way I guess they think that they're gonna have a

intentional lash on Facebook so the president has said that look this caravan of migrants that's flooding through a bunch of different countries I guess preparing for some sort of stand off at the U.S border where people a plan to apply for asylum the president said look\nYou tweeted and said we strongly and formed a president of Honduras and if that large Carolina people heading to the U.S is not stop and brought back to Honduras no more money or a will be given to Honduras effective immediately\nWell now we hear that Mexico is moving to stop the migrants caravan and the outgoing Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto\nA they have any trade deal with the United states and so obviously I think he's looking to score some points and it looks like they're trying to do whatever they can to stop and joining us right now on this issue\nIs our good representative from the beautiful Republican Texas congressman Louie Gohmert who are of course obviously has been watching us as that they're gonna be coming up to the widow of this southern Texas border congressmen good to have you as always\nAlways good to talk to you know you bet\nWell it's been at this thing isn't it yeah yeah and thank God that Trump is the president literally thank you know I get tired of\nPeople calling us names haters and all these kinds of things because we want to do what would be best\nNot only for America even if you don't care about the Seventy thousand Americans that died from a drugs mostly from Mexico or if you cared about the Mexican people and the people in Central America you would say yeah let's stop\nThe secure the border which don't encourage these kind of caravans there been projections maybe one in four or more\nA girls that come up your right along the way\nThere are people that die every time that there is this big assault and I think our department of justice\nAnd are in jail or be looking\nAt whether or not there were any Americans that were helping plunging helping with funding on this assault on our sovereignty but the best thing we can do from Mexico\nIs secure the border build a wall where we need it and so it cuts off the eighty billion project ... gone from the U.S in the Mexico drug cartels for drugs\nThey're projections that may be that much or more was made all human trafficking in sex trafficking by the drug cartels but you've got those tens of billions or maybe hundreds of billions of dollars\nOff that go into drug cartels and the corruption slow store crawl and Mexico becomes one of the doubt Gen economies in the world and brings El Salvador\nGuatemala and Honduras along with it but a\nTrump is taking a strong stance and I'm so grateful years it despite what\nThe haters the ... the all laughter mainstream whatever you want to call me do whatever they say it's still the most compassionate thing we can do is not continue to encourage what Obama did people get hurt doing that and killed\nYeah no that's that's for sure the uh one of the the the guy I guess who is one of the other or one of the organizers of this had been detained by Guatemalan police officers they said he wouldn't comply with Guatemalan immigration role so\nThey arrested him and deported him back to Honduras are we seeing more cooperation as a result of Trump saying look will will will end a weren't will close the\nWill close the border are are are they now it seems like they've been incentivized to see maybe perhaps cooperate a little bit more\nWell yeah you're exactly right that's what's happening and they all show no this is just now that Obama this is a man that will do what he says\nAnd so uh they know we Syria's they noted serious when he says the workout and ... and put tariffs on or where and when he says look we'll put the military on the border if necessary and and I talked with the\nThen candidate Donald Trump two years ago about this uh and and the fact that actually\nWoodrow Wilson one of my least favorite presidents he actually did one thing right after\nSome punt Jovi is gay came across into the United states and killed a bunch of families are age that general Pershing down or they get they put military in this new thing go National Guard ah\nAnd I asked the the apolitical nonpartisan congressional Research Service\nFor report on that and they said we can't say for sure but\nIn essence a probably Seventy five thousand ...\nUS military National Guard were put on our border I could have been as many as a hundred and fifty thousand and then pushing led some actually into Mexico chasing the bad guys\nBut you know what when he put the military on the border nobody nobody came in that we did not want to come in\nAnd uh you know they this president knows that and he's willing to do what's necessary that not only protect America but\nProtects others who might be tempted to\nTake a caravan and lose their lives are being raped or be subjected to sex trafficking humans advocates uh it's it's the best thing we can do for both sides of the border it really is and thank goodness Trump is going to do that\nYeah I definitely and I mean I wouldn't I think they're going to have the same problem even if they may get than they do end up making it all the way to Mexico because from what I understand Mexico told them well if you're ... I mean you can't just entering illegally you can apply for asylum well then they're going to have the same problem that we would have\nAnd I would think that they would want that word before these people got their border\nWell and and actually Mexico in the past ah with Obama a they would let people like that come through\nKnowing that when they ... they say you jump through Mexico as long as you don't stop here so in other words they just wouldn't enforce Mexican law and okay you can pass through just you know make sure you go at it\nIn the United states but they knew the law that if they come into the United states from Central America come through Mexico and then get into the United states you don't they don't have and it's a legitimate asylum claim because your right hand and I go\nTo the states from Honduras or El Salvador or ... or Guatemala and say\nI Need to claim asylum but so is our country was jak right you know legitimate just object to the poverty because that's in every country [noise] but uh to say I was being\nTortured or ... well if that's true and you needed asylum for your Central American country\nThen you should have claimed that women in the next\nCountry who came to her [noise] so right he got to the United states already gone through so you could attack claimed the style of bear so he legitimately cannot claim asylum in the United states because you could have stayed in Mexico without being persecuted [noise]\nSo I was younger when I tell ya", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dana Show", "city": "San Antonio", "day": "20"}
