senator Cory Booker had had said verbatim how is he too biased in defending himself the craziest it came to mate of questions\nIt's hard to understand where they're coming from because they're trying to put the actual context of him being a judge in deciding between two people that aren't him right and whether or not bars isn't vulgar but see this is him he was accusations towards\nHim and of course he would defend it with bias because it's him so this has no correlation with him is sitting as a judge wild deciding between two other parties where he is not involved\nRight so they are telling him well you know we would have considered ... but after all of the years that we've perpetuated um after all those came out those smears that we pushed we didn't like how you are addressed

was ... she was an essentially she was\nSaying let's be on civil she was telling people to be on civil with each other she was telling them and of course remember\nThis is after I which I think it's incredibly are responsible for Hillary Clinton to have said this because we're talking about a time in which Democrat shot up a congressional baseball field attack Senator Rand Paul in his yard sent powder and other things\nTo run a Republican senator and other lawmakers offices on threaten the children of a number of Republican lawmakers ah docks Republican senator threatened to put the medical records of Republican senators children on line can I go should I go on\nThis is a time when people who are on the left have been protesting by burning down buildings and punching people in the head and engaging in property destruction and Hillary Clinton says this\nCannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back the house and or the Senate that's when civility can start again\nDoes she stay instability we can't have stability and so we have power\nThat's what she said we talked about her comments a little bit yesterday but I have more on them now she's saying that we cannot be civil until we have power we're not going to be civil to you we're not going to be civil period until\nWe have power bottom line bottom line and\nThis by the way she's not on the same page as the media who is coordinating a massive push back against the mob narrative\nSo yeah and I have more on that so Heidi Heitkamp she said that she can stand\nClinton's remarks Heitkamp said on Cooper last night I mean I Can't uh she said first off she said that it was ridiculous what she had said that what Hillary Clinton had said she said well it's ridiculous uh she said that ah it's\nThat I mean I Can't imagine how you get anything done if you don't bring civility back into politics and that goes for both sides\nHigh can't went up ... ... she went on to add that she hopes we can find common ground in this country et cetera et cetera so\nThat Hillary Clinton's remarks were incredibly unfortunate because this is the exact same time that Democrats now have been fighting to ah\nAvoid the mob tactic now do you want to know why there's this coordinated effort to push back on the

simply don't like her yeah I just they just don't they don't like her because she just is not um\n...\nShe's not she's not a likeable person some women are like that she's just not a likeable person\nI don't know who I have always liked\nWell until they decided to do this nonsense um Jamie Lee Curtis I was I never had a I like her husband's movies best in show is one of my favorites I mean it it's it's so I was kind of she's not promoting her new Halloween movie right\nAnd she's\nWhat Michael Meyers comes back and they do all that out again isn't that what it is\nI haven't seen it yet and I was going back and forth as to whether I was going to see it so she remember when Levis\nDecided that they were going to get involved and gun control\nSo she treats [noise]\nTime to break out my old Levis corporate leadership when it comes to gun violence is crucial and creating the change that needs to happen okay this is one of the stupidest statements I've ever heard and I'm gonna come back to that she says I hand clapping Modi and stand with Levis and we'll buy often like Nike doing the biceps thumbs up saying\nStop so [noise] I Know well\nOak celebrities now are coming out in force to try to be ...\nThey are they are ... ... like Taylor Swift as making bank off of being woken you guys are all the all the people out there on the left us who are like now totally fine and all over her are complete fools [noise] she's making money off of being yeah\nShe's making money off of being well so Jamie Lee Curtis comes out and says this and um she's\nIn her movie it's a Hollywood the latest Halloween franchise she's Laurie again and she's trying to survive Michael Meyers latest murder thing and I don't know and so now progressive or saying because uh some people have criticized her for using guns on her movie they're criticizing her for advocating for\nGun control and they're trying to make fun of everybody from you know I I was just it's\nA Fox News had a tweet at the Jamie Lee Curtis wields firearms and new Halloween movie despite advocating for gun control [noise] people who are criticizing this tweet I think missed the entire point and of course they do they missed the they missed it the absolute point a because these individuals I think that\nThere isn't a good purpose for firearms which civilians period\nI mean that's ... that's what they think that they that there isn't any kind of\nUm good use good purpose for firearms and I think that what her movie shows and the fact that she's using guns and it shows that yes there actually is a legitimate you know actual case ... they they they can be used for good\nAnd I don't know I just I see I have always been has she always been kind of political or no I don't remember [noise] I don't think that she is I don't know\nSo skewed politics when I see her you know what I mean what most people know what you mean Schumer's and ... and such that I didn't used to have that image for I Know have that image for them because we're down to poke your political\nI mean isn't a huge part isn't a huge\nPart of movies to it or whether they're you know scary movies or action movies are et cetera isn't a huge\nPortion of the plot good\nGuy with a gun to something useful with a gun to gun solve problems isn't that usually what it is\nYeah and so one of my friends asked this question do you think that showing\nThat guns are useful has more or less influenced than actors advocacy against guns\nThey think and it gets do you think that actors in movies using guns showing that\nGuns are useful and that they solve problems does that have more or less influence than the actors advocacy against guns\nAs soon as it would be the movie that has to be the movie that has more of a YMCA\nBecause see I think it kinda cancels out the and that's what people and so all the people criticizing the Fox tweets apparently are too stupid to understand and which is kind of embarrassing everybody wants to go out and be first to clap back but I'm just like you guys are so nuance because nuances dead it has made people dumber the point is is\nThat she is advocating against firearms she's an anti gun advocate in and coming out and supporting anti gone advocacy which is\nKind of drowned out by the fact that in her film she shows with her character that egg gun can solve a problem and that a\nGun is useful and that a gun in the proper hands does not make the person who is wielding it evil it does not through osmosis transfer to\nThe possess or some sort of maniacal quality it solves the problem and so it's just kind of funny that she comes out with this advocacy\nAgainst the exact sort of firearm usage she finds useful and uses to solve problems with her film and that's the entire point of this\nPeople are like oh my gosh I mean how you're going after I mean there there were like laughing at her are laughing at at a you know this tweet that somebody at Fox put out and I'm just like how\nAnd like for instance job look at them over at St progress that deer Fox News movies or pretend\nYeah that just showing that gun solve problems isn't pretend\nThat is not pretend you're talking about a firearm solving a problem solving a particular issue while at the same time outside of the film you advocate against that reality\nOh yes\nI was one of the original as one of the original organizers and have to take some\n[noise] that has to take some issue with that and ah give a lesson so we're going to touch up on that next hour as well uh so I Know it's just people are people are fascinating they're violent the left as violent and they always have that\n... Neal so yeah\nLet's uh we have a lot more than the way also we're following the latest with um hurricane Michael as I understand it I don't know what the separate but\nAh\n'cause it's a category for right now oh this is what's crazy so hurricane Michael's a category for its wins right now are reported to be about a hundred and fifty five miles per hour\nA category five Atlantic hurricane is one at a category five hurricane is one where the winds are a hundred and fifty seven miles per hour\nSo that tells you that it is right at that threshold it's literally just two off from being a cat five\nThat is unprecedented supremely powerful\nWill help everybody is oh gosh I Hope people are staying safe but that's yeah it's based ... that's called the staff here Simpson scale which I just now learned about it's a hurricane scouts where they measure wind speed\nAnd I'm a all that and but yeah a hundred and fifty five miles per hour that's a that's kind of work for but if it gets it's a hundred fifty seven at the category five\nAnd it was full on a hundred and fifty five when it made landfall category for like just right by storm surges in about twelve feet is what I is what I heard so good night this just terrified absolutely terrified let's go ahead and take it into some lord a man\nTime for for a person and it's time\nClose to we\nWant everybody to stay safe in Florida I Hope you all are ah and ah we're praying for everybody in the panhandle area 'cause it's a pretty area right there the whole\nWhat is it you have um a Panama City got you got Rosemarie beach jak speech seaside\nThat's a a a bunch of pretty areas over there [noise]\nOkay I really I've been wanting to really bring this to you I was going back and forth as to whether or not I wanted to do a Florida Man story but I'm hoping you know did you know some cases of this was in Orlando Airport\nAt frontier passenger was removed from her flight Tuesday yesterday why\nShe tried to bring her emotional support squirrel on board she refused\nTo get off the Cleveland bound planes to the crew call police I guess she was on her way home\nAnd she they said that their score squirrels are not allowed on frontier flights they're literally as video there are people that videotaping\nBecause she was taken off the plane with her emotional support squirrel and they had scored her off the plane to the main terminal everybody could plane because she would not get off the plane so everybody had to get off the plane\nAnd it was a huge inconvenience for everybody and they said squirrels are not allowed on it yes I don't get how the hell I called the U.S on you I'm Sorry your squirrels not an emotional support animals dominant\nMy only question is what emotion is that squirrel supporting just don't eating nuts I don't know\nI I don't what what is the ... ... they they're tree rats my uncle ate them I mean what you know what is it what is it do you what what is how it it's an emotional support animal I was watching some comedian\nThe other night and he was like pets or just the animals that we don't eat\nSo they're the fluffy cuter animals we're likely teenagers that will hang everyone else in the ones we\nEat or physical support the ones we have as pets or emotional yeah that's what\nYou don't keep an emotional that's their fluffy and cute and they can like show they can respond to you in a way and make you feel better squirrels do not do that because they're\nJerks their tree rats and I don't like them that's it that's those those veterans right there ah let's see here so\nJust as I said oh

don't think anybody want to know what I Would fight\nAgainst the person ... but the thing is logical people just don't see it\n... yeah I don't know uh [noise]\nAnyway I just that's just frustrates me and it's always I get it like guys we're going to go register to vote like yeah\nAnd then you have Taylor Swift out with her Instagram post\nGuys like I Need you to not like the for like Marshall like black burn you need to vote for like ... guy because he is not again forcing people to perform and by the way this is also a misnomer because they're like he's not against same sex marriage except back he actually you know\nThere's a difference though people say you're against same sex marriage when actually it's not just don't want the government of forced to church I go to if they don't want to do it to do something that they don't want to do\nBut if you want to be stupid and kill nuance and contribute to the dumbing down and basically the evolving everybody's brain back\nThat of just uttered I mean then by all means go ahead and make that speech just stupid overly simplified claim [noise] but actually fill the guy she endorsed she's she went on this tear on Instagram\nYeah like he's he's like totally like for these think he's\nFor same sex marriage and nobody apparently fact checked ... post because he's totally he'd actually supported Cavanaugh I still don't like him because he's a Democrat or end its policies I'm sure personally he might be a nice guy politically I don't like his policies because he's for high taxation and he's weird on guns et cetera et cetera but\nHe actually supported cabinet came out and said that and he was against the government forces have same sex marriage so all the stuff that she's saying that she hates than she turns on in literally endorses a candidate who's [noise]\nI'm like nobody nobody fat check you take say nobody checked that silly\nAnyway so she apparently said something that I didn't pay attention to either because I just don't I just don't care anymore do you know why I don't care I used to love award shows back when they had people who could play instruments and seeing without auto tune I loved it\nRemember those days gosh\nNow you get people out there and it's like they can't even keep up with their ... their background vocals they can't even keep up and nobody has been hints nobody plays in eating there's no instrumentation it's like sampling and you know et cetera and there's a time and place for that but\nThe whole damn show really the whole show the whole show for real\nIs there a metal category they amazed to those people ever get invited like did you did you ever seen in this moment planning is probably not probably not yeah I just oh man so I um\nI I don't know I just didn't I didn't I didn't watch it because I Want to watch Rita Hayworth than studs who could sing and dance and I will say Taylor Swift rights around stuff and she can play instrumentation I just think that her Instagram plus the stupid because all the stuff that she said she endorsed the guy who actually supported the stuff that she said she was against which is why she was endorsing him\nAfter [noise]\nAnyway but um\nI just yeah I just don't I We'll we'll see if they actually go out and vote typically that demo doesn't really go out and vote it's just not a thing they're just not that never has worked I remember when I was a teenager I never ... MTV was like rock the vote and we're like yeah\nNo I did though 'cause I was a political weirdo even back in the day if anything shiny happens that the they're not going to know [laughter] [noise] oh my gosh you also I just dropped an album I Can't [laughter] kind of a visit my and I are going to listen to it and look up everything about it\n[noise] anyway that's pretty accurate I think yeah we uh we\nGot to get moving on coming up we got quick vibe Josh Hawley will join us oh and by the way that the Taylor Swift thing though really quickly I Do there was a ... there was a really good piece it actually it was written by a progressive and I thought this was so right on it was from the metro\nAnd um this very progressive author says Taylor Swift is I don't believe her sudden wilderness\nAnd it's true and what she had said was a that Kanye West is doing something very dangerous and problematic by constantly endorsing Trump\nAnd he says if this free thought movement which heaven forbid\nBut she brings up the point last year when Taylor Swift attempted to do a blogger for a post on pop front magazine and oppose the blogger deconstructed the images of Taylor's video look what you made me do she highlighted all of the images that seemed to support the alt right\nMegan's blog post asked Taylor Swift to clear up any misconceptions that her fans in the public may have by publicly denouncing the alt right Taylor's answer was to sue her and try to silence her and she only had two hundred followed her followers on Twitter and so again during the day and age you encourage people young people to vote\nAnd so this author says you know she's probably doing this because she does not want to look like she is in any way keeping any kind of company with ... because she's made an entire career plane a victim\nAnd everything that she has done since Kanye went onstage to try to take her award away from her everything that she has done since then has build\nA build up for a career further off of that narrative she's always the blonde damsel in distress\nAnd she says that and whenever any legitimate critique of Taylor Swift arose you could fall back on that she could fall back on that moment of this being disrespected here's again\nKnowing that Conyers public all endorsing Trump and knowing the saying the enemy of my enemy is my friend I Can't help but think that
