conflict of interest regarding a state government contract and uh and and it's it's pretty significant what he's on tape\nSaying well dreams just so people understand see any that you referred to earlier his contributions and expenditures within the state of Oregon anyone can give you any amount of money to a political campaign because the state Supreme Court\nHas ruled that money is free speech so you cannot put limits on free speech so it's a First Amendment interpretation of campaign contributions the only requirement is\nThat on your knees you have to show where all your contributions came from and you have to show where the money was spent ah what is not required but probably should be\nIt because you're not supposed to do it at all is when you have people on your staff were taking a a paycheck from the public treasury begin to do campaign work on the on the tax payers done that specifically illegal\nSo you know you you see this kind of thing go on\nAnd literally a I Know that we've got people politicians before who've had their a PR person usually called their public information person writing speeches for a mayor or for a governor or for a senator\nAnd they write them at their desk at work on the public's time that's illegal to also illegal for them to get on the phone now outside of work time\nA chief of staff or anybody else who works for a politician can do violent you know they can go out and volunteer on a campaign as long as they're not doing it while they're at their official job so we're not we're not adversely affecting anybody who's\nYou know freedom of participation in politics or freedom of speech\nThey can do it but they just can't do it while they're being paid by the taxpayers this was going on and it's interesting and I wanted to get your comment on this the fact that somebody involved in this you know who was who was watching it happened knew that it was illegal and knew that Kate Brown knew it was illegal and let it happen anyway\n[noise] well there there was a store reported I'm a Lars uh two years ago in a Willamette Week by this reporter left wing or for Nigel ... reported on this previous scandal I'm a ... involving there's actually a company\nA called see any of the end of the systems and it was involving the former\nCampaign former chief of staff or standing Leonard who did not disclose this conflict of interest regarding the state government contracts so this\nIs the any systems was the name of a company a name of a A N January in January of two years ago Brown's campaign decided to fire this contractor they handled the reporting of the nation's a lot of in the ... stuff but it was interesting about it cold link it myth in the video here\nIs that that is that Kate Brown knew that the government side was directing the campaign side and the greater story here is that for an ... as a manager not my words\nHis words quote she's a really awful manager if people operations and structures unquote this this campaign manager says that that brown knew about it and and and and there's this moment in the video if you watch this video\nWe ask them will dictate know about it and he goes she had to have now and she he's reluctant we had to meet with him a number of times he didn't want to throw his former boss under the bus obviously he is a\nGood Democrat passionate about the cause and all that stuff loves identity politics but but didn't want to admit it and we got him to admitted that the end it's a violation of Oregon State law that she has to respond she has to say that he's a disgruntled staffer because he's not disgruntled he happens to lay Kate\nBrown he actually got let go and he was let go by the chief of staff who's on the public payroll second thing you incorporated and I appreciate you doing it as Adam ... reporting from forums dot com where he documents tens of thousands of dollars of spending a public money by Kate Brown to take trips\nAnd she'd take a trip give a speech that was official government work somewhere and then spend a couple of days at campaign fund raisers all of the costs\nOf that Trump being paid for
