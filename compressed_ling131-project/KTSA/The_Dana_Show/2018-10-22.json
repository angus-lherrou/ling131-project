the survivor families of of first responders\nOr firefighters police MS technicians who oh wow this is your life in the line of duty for sure and so um the clubs purpose is to be there for the survivor families ah they're there to provide assistance you know when a tragedy strikes like that um\nYou know a lot of times the family just needs a little extra help and they may have to fly and relatives for the bureau of the kids you know you have more than one child you\nMight need to get suits for them for those kind of things that that are immediate needs a the one hundred club is there for them\nUh and the big picture is a depending if there's a one child or several children I'm the one here club creates a trust fund for that child on the death of their parent yeah and um and then\nWe we grow that and then uh every year we have a a a luncheon and at the lunch and we give away or present the scholarship to these children who are now young adults and that turned Eighteen and as long as they're in rolling in and the credit university and\nAct passing grades and all that their entire education will be paid by the one hundred club\nAnd so uh it's it's just one of the ways

actually made a super cute video far squeaky clean and twenty scene campaign and\nOne of the things that costs a lot of money at the shelter in that we use every single day is paper towels okay we go through them like crazy and honestly will spend thousands and thousands of dollars to keep keep them there at the shelter um and so she she made a real cute video with some ... some ... kittens and uh\nAnd we noticed that people started sending us paper towel roles you know taxes on which was fantastic theory hell yeah we really appreciate everyone jumping on that right away and seeing that there is a need and and being a part of that you know important event and um it really makes a huge difference because like I said we go through the sixth grade [laughter]\nNot at all the ... so making people aware with Cuba video Veronica I mean were you\n[laughter] [laughter] that's\nReally awesome though I Love I Love about helped out big time yet to 'em because definitely sometimes people

without her being in the foster home who knows you know how things would have been yeah she just was not thriving at all and the shelter environment it was way too much for her and she needed to be in a home\nWhere you know she was getting that love and attention that exercise that she needed on a regular basis yeah um so it's been a great opportunity for her to to being a foster home and so now we're just hoping that she gets adopted 'cause she's super sweet and shut the fantastic you know with someone who is ready to adopt\n'em a larger dog because she is very activities and very active\nSo

information is it healthy children or [noise]\nYou're listening to San Antonio solutions wish idea in the studio with me I have an ice miracle from the children's shelter welcoming showed you how are you know I'm doing great how are you doing good how's everything going up the children's shelter you know we\nUm where'd emergency shelter as as many people know is that on ten acres right in the heart of the west side and you know we've been a capacity for awhile already with children and so we provide care for children from\nUm a few days until the age of sixteen okay and then we also have treatment foster care program that you know recruits and license since ... foster families for children from infancy until the age of Seventeen\nAnd then we have prevention programs that work with parents with children and then we also have mental health services and we recently included mental health services for um parents\nAnd so we should only foreign ... provide that\nHow long have you been around so we've been around since Nineteen oh one's a hundred and Seventeen years immunity yeah yeah and yeah and so if you know anything about the animal defense late actually got their start because the very beginning in the early Nineteen hundreds\nWe should provide care for children and um and I was all the same time and then that's where animal defense actually got their start oh wow the early Nineteen hundreds and so I'm very interesting history at the very beginning\nBut you know when now we're we're going to the fall season or two whereas run around the corner in Halloween is one of those favorite um\nHolidays are kids love to participate in so for sure you know candy we do we don't take him out to trick or treat we actually do trick or treating on our campus okay so our kids even a week before Halloween the left to wear their Halloween costume so you know we need a little Halloween costumes for\nYou know small children even infants even a little Lindsey it looks like a pumpkin you know in these men\nAnd all the way until you know a teenager and then also candy it's also something that you know we pass out and snacks\nSo you know it's just around the corner and they'll love Halloween and also fall so falls around here and we're going to get you know pretty cool pretty soon yeah and so you know we are definitely in need of any type of\nWho he is jackets sweaters long pants um anything that you can think of for fall weather for has from shore infancy until the age of ... of six team\nOkay and um how many kids do you guys think how you have on campus so we can have up to sixty six children at any given time\nAnd so right now we've been to pass that he or she six children wow mhm okay um so you guys have sixty six children and you guys are on the website if someone wants to go ahead and donate a costs you more for Halloween where would they go sure they can\nFirst call us at two one zero to when she was twenty five hundred or they can visit us our location at twenty nine thirty nine west with mine were actually read the ... on on Westwood One right near and dear road\nOkay awesome so now you're listening right now um you have that information um are you guys they will do you guys take costumes like um that had been warned yeah we ask is that I Am speech gently used okay that they're not torn or tattered or anything yeah\nI was thinking of um you know like maybe you have a last year's costume but I Do agree and you only work when you [laughter]\nCan come and bring it over to the children's shelter that would be a meeting and they um are you guys said you're going to do take 'em trick or treating around the Kenya voted\nLife so you know our staff actually have like it's if he had the we you know give up because the candy and our kids go round trick or treating\nUp in our mission building in foster care hope center in our cottage and uh so they get to do that and so they come over and trick or treat even the little ones you know oh you yes yes and so we actually had a foster care picnic that we're having in October ... foster parents are foster kid does and then our kids on her campus\nAnd such a great way for them to take to get together in the spirit of Halloween and fall and integrate pumpkins\nAnd so again it's it's really a community effort and so we know that we can't do this work alone we know that you know the engineers extremely generous when they give to the children's shelter ... whether that's a costume candy or maybe those are closing diapers wipes formula\nA lot of people may not be able to make a monetary gift and that's okay some people can volunteer that's awesome you know maybe\nThere is an opportunity for people to donate items and you know we've gotten a lot of questions of\nCan you give volunteers who are\nYou know younger than Eighteen we don't allow children younger than Eighteen hundred campus you interact with our kids because our kids are under the the care of the state of Texas but what we do encourage our drives in their schools so safe or they can get service hours out of that so if you're a boy scouts of Girl Scout to if you are part of\nA school group or a church group and you want to do service hours and you were more likely you are more than welcome to do it with Dr a donation\nHad idea yeah great idea absolutely and then they can get their own hours by doing those drives and that and bringing them all the trash alternately in their servant leaders right and yeah\nI mean the for young people to still make a difference in a child's life finish learn it had some um some\nEagle Scout to build projects like they've built tables or they feel like you\nThere's always room for everybody to help provide a solution for shore oh what's it like being in the child's shoes in the shelter for the child on day to day like with things going on right so when children come into care or we see there being removed from an unhealthy environment and you know and so I'm there\nSo when they are placed with us whether that's through child protective services local law enforcement you know we ensure that first you know children might be hungry so we provide them with food\nUm we were gathering as much information about the child or children at the time\nAnd then we walk them through the process of why they're there you know um sometimes they may have questions of will they ever get to see my parents again and we can't promise that we never promise anything to children just because we just don't know yeah and so [noise] we ensure that we are you know\nI'm communicating with our kid owes to ensure that we have a an environment that what we call trauma informed is really about being sensitive to each need each child is it because they've experienced trauma\nAnd said that trauma can look like very differently rape and so you know we ensure that you know our environment we you know we give tours often to community members want to learn more about the shelters shelter\nAnd you know our environment is really intentional bright colors and people have said that looks like a camp and so we want to make sure that it's sad because you don't want to feel as though you're being in an institution for sure you want to feel comfortable and like you're in school or right and so we have a schoolhouse on campus we have swings we have\nHave you know he's out of school how yes we do have a ... school districts satellite school instead of having instructors ... through fifth grade\nThan children who are in need in special education will go to elementary school and then we also provide transportation for children who were in high school to go back to their home community\nOkay so it's important for children to have normal activity is just like their peers and ... and so we have a movie theater on her camp is you know and so you know we do take him out to activities have grave volunteers who come over and say\nI Want to do birthday parties or I Want to be able to um you know take him out to eat even simple things as wording your own food or being empowered to do that that does a lot of children who have experienced my treatments are typically socially isolated and so they may have set foot in the school they may not have ever gone to a doctor\nOr they've never even got to even choose your own food yeah and so simple things like that can make a difference in the child [noise] and those types of things we always say that on cheers change lives\nUm volunteers my like oh well all we do is rock babies asleep while you're building attachments right you're yeah the relationship and actions we noticed that a silly and so there's so much value with volunteers and people who donate\nWhen you have people who do that on a regular basis and so and if someone wants to become a volunteer what everyone's process what steps do they take right so I Would encourage you to go visit our website she'll ... she'll true dot org and I'm Karen ... is our volunteer manager\nOkay and so she walks she threw first giving you toward the children's shelter talking to you about the children that we provide care for 'em kind of exploring options of\nWhat the volunteer once you kind of exploring like is this a good fit for you are you comfortable with working with children of you know from infancy until you know teenagers um identifying kind of what they're wanting to explore and so I think it's\nYou know some people are just wanting to\nRock babies and feed them in the morning and so we have Tuesday Morning volunteers um and that's what they do and then there are some that are on a consistent basis or some of the volunteer once a month and so it really is depending upon what they want to deal\nAnd so you know if you have a therapeutic animals that you know maybe it's a therapeutic dog we had one kind of semi retired now how do you um and so it's great to be able to see if you have a therapeutic animal that\nTherapeutic animals are great for children yeah you know they'll talk to dogs you know and it it's great to see how they interact with with therapeutic animals um and that's a volunteer initiative right ... you know whatever\nThanks good to know him yeah I think you guys for all this information and I really appreciate it and and one more time let's let them know for anyone that just

I've heard from some of my uh democratic\nPeople they're kind of hoping he loses and the reason is because they see him as a person who could be more of a threat to\nTrump than in the Senate\nThing about that for a second he may not win his race\nIndexes against lie in Ted will touch on that in a second but better do\nMaybe more of a force on a national scale and sometimes that happens right sometimes you know you're if you're if you're somebody says is a conservative and you're in California the chances of winning some of these things are slim to none you have a broader appeal nationwide\nThen\nYou do in a place like California same thing for Beto crews he probably has a broader appeal his politics elsewhere would get him\nSome Republicans plenty of independence and tons of

town hall ... uh they asked him the question that many people are are are are are talking about as far as they take\nBack the house in ...\nAnd you said in July that you would as a member of the house right now voted to impeach heavy changed your mind\nI haven't um let me let me put it this way\nI'm there may be an open question as to whether the president than the candidates sought seclude with the Russian government in two thousand\nAnd six team when we saw him on that stage in Helsinki defending Vladimir putting the head of the country that attacked our democracy in twenty sixteen instead of this country and its citizens and the amazing democracy was collusion and actually\n[noise] uh [noise]\nLike I said earlier political is reporting that you're going to be disappointed why why why why why why\nYou're going to be disappointed the Democrats here here's my question to people out there who independent are Democrats who think that Trump did something do you trust Bob Mueller and his report if he comes out and said look\nThere's no they're they're so\nWhat are you going to do right what are you going to do so ... they're going to grab it everything\nThey're going to grab it everything they don't like him so you've got to get everything it's ... it's it's it's it's if it's not this remember how many times the goalposts moved in this investigation started out as Russia and we've since moved the goal post on numerous occasions\nYou may have wondered when he fired James Comey the principal investigator in what happens in that election whether that was an attempt to obstruct justice but win by broad daylight on Twitter he asked his attorney general Jeff Sessions to end the Russia investigation always say that obstruction inaction\nIs it is it obstruction so Dana Bash actually does what good reporters do she she ... she ask questions\nThe best course to get there so that every member has all the facts and that there are compelling enough to do the right thing is to allow the full independence and integrity Bob Mueller investment already said\nEven though that's not done that you would do to impeach and so according to the constitution that mean that the president has committed the crime of treason primer bribery or a high crime and misdemeanor which one of those do you think the president has committed\nI wouldn't like in a impeachment to an indictment there there was enough there to proceed with the trial\nYeah and that's all it's about it's about in the end is slowing down impeaching him knowing full well that you're not going to get him thrown out of office\nAnd if there is no there there were doing to the country's you this is the other thing and this is something we've talked about before\nYou go to potentially put yourself in a situation where you look like such a obstruction is in the whole thing is you don't care about the country you care about destroying Trump and taking out Trump that you put in a situation where you you focus so much on it\nThat it hurts the country maybe slows down the growth of the country people start panicking we know how ... confidence and things\nCan be can be wavering at times and waiting and when we started to see things go and you're going to give Trump another opportunity to say look man\nWhen I had the house and the Senate\nWhat did I Do unemployment economy ... all of these things were going on they come along boom\nThey put a stop and everything talks about rolling back taxes that's all they want to do talk about doing this that and the other and then what happens everything's slows down everything when I was in charge was rolling they come in here\n[noise] boom look what happens and you may give people arrive do you know what he'd write everything was ruined it there was going good it was because we live in a world where in politics we need the other side to suck now\nYou feel like we can have a victory he wants to impeach he did not have been waiting for the evidence yeah let's impeach\nBut two hundred and forty two years into this experiment\nWhich is the exception not the rule in world history nothing that guarantees us the two hundred and forty third where two hundred and forty fourth to all of us to stand up for that democracy\nThe best way to do that and so expressing it on the twenty second of October the first day of early voting than the than election day on the ... of November but yeah a to answer a question I I Do think there's enough there\nFor impeachment and if af are I Would I Would vote on it\nSounds great go ahead do it I don't know what's gonna happen I couldn't tell you what's going to happen uh if they went back\nI Know that there's going to be tons of investigations are going to try to get his taxes they're going to do a lot of different things and what you're going to find\nIs and and the way that our politics to set up is you know we're supposed to fight right we're supposed to look for ... you know I I talked about what Thomas sold before the ... the great thing that he said there is there's no solutions there's only trade offs\nThat is true of a solution is too close to his fourth ... there's a solution to that problem but the trade offs are it's the give and take we talk about right you're not going to get a hundred percent\nI'm not going to get a hundred percent\nBut the squeaky wheels demand a hundred percent or nothing they don't care about the other eighty percent that wants some sort of trade off to move something forward\n\nIt's sad it's sad that we're in this situation he was asked because he

I think putting on our ... and we're going to be like we always do we put on our our substance had which is looking at the issues and basing it on the substance on our\nPolitical ... put it on my political had I thought that what came out of the the the campaign from the Republicans and Democrats I thought the best campaign slogan actually came from Trump there was jobs not mobs very a very easy to understand\nAnd very quickly on the the caravan here because we have lots of talk about today and uh it's funny sometimes I just wonder how do people think and this is comes from from the uh people to support Trump but this was about Trump it's about to get to Trump and I'm thinking to myself and you are the same thought think people\nWas it was for him this works for him we're moving towards election day\nAnd the closer the caravan comes\nTo the U.S border is going to help Republicans and help Trump but I'll tell you that was gonna say it's a ... because this is because that's all I heard this is a conspiracy sources behind it and and they're doing this in order to win the election will then try and spend more money to win the election in a more caravans come in\nIf they believe that that's an effective way to win an election because it's not\nIt's not it it the we set it and it was the time and everything going on and twenty sixteen but Trump owned immigration illegal immigration if you want if he if he is to get back on track to get funding for the wall this will be part of it\nIs five on you and I were talking about if there's a conspiracy yeah it would be the trumpet behind all [laughter] than a billion\nDollars to make it happen 'cause it's working for him right there is any conspiracy politically that would be called brilliant or affective in terms of a positive for one side of the other they would be him behind the conspiracy because\nThis works for the president and Republicans if you've got five that this is what we saw a few years ago a few years back or when you had an influx not quite\nLike the caravan mob or whatever you want to call it\nUm but but pretty much the same effect right there are about to reach the border and you had people\nYou had Democrats who had rank and file Democrats saying no no no no no no we're spending people on those ... spending money government money on people who aren't citizens and we're not spending enough and in the cities and in our town on our kids and that's the way that went and\nThat was before Trump was president ah if you think this is a conspiracy let them try it it does not work for the left\nComing up on the show first the one over one thousand\nAnd twenty four we will we will get to because still I was with you and I both on vacation very rainy vacation whether I was in New York or whether I was here didn't matter ... it just it rained it was a complete to wash out and in fact the most the the biggest thing that I accomplished was I got three room steam cleaned in my house\nAre brought up the steam cleaner and did a three rooms and how far more to go\nA so that was really what I did over ... ... you know vacation oh by the way very quickly\nHappy sixty seven

attempting to be transparent to oh I uh also coming up on the show Hillary as just like Mike Myers from Halloween she just won't go away or I should say Michael Meyers yeah Michael Meyers Michael Meyers is pretty funny right All right in ...\nUh the uh the the jobs not mobs political slogan that came out while we were on vacation and the Democrats platform is what we thought it was going to be which is put hats on Kavanaugh to those Democrats upset about the ... a ... death where were you on Benghazi right\n\nWhere were you on ... because the criticism of the administration luck none of us know everybody becomes an expert on these things oh here's what happened to have no clue what happened and maybe somebody in the CIA knows what happened\nMaybe Trump knows what happens maybe somebody some of them in the house and and uh the house intelligence committee and and the Senate intelligence committee maybe they know none of us know what really happened over there but one thing we do know is the hypocrisy of the Democrats\nThat in essence said when we found out that Hillary Clinton in the state department lied about Americans being killed in a terrorist attack and lie to the American

early on red eye radio and he is currently and I'm ... eight six six Ninety or read\nI weld him and a good morning yeah so I'm the whole just we had a comment on the Elizabeth Warren thing because we were on vacation or a ... last week but first off you've got cultural appropriation and write and write journal chill appropriations she's\nShe's a appropriating a culture and the thing I liked his when he even came up with the one sixty fourth while she could be one sixty fourth or could be won over five hundred and twenty or one over one thousand two hundred and twenty four\nAnd it was like yeah but the one or even if it's the one over sixty four and I don't even know whether this is true or not but somebody pointed out they said when all the average American is one point eight percent Native American so it doesn't even mean but the average American\nIs that that particular point so without question this is ... ... you know cultural appropriation right this the the second thing was\nYou want white privilege white privilege as a white person claiming that they can be whatever they wish to be whatever minority they wish to be that they can be whatever minority they wish to being the other thing was the median jumping on this is it as if this legitimize\n[laughter] yeah that her veto you're like Rob no doubt that we did was yeah that that ... that was it\nBecause there was some here's what was I think great about the whole scenario I don't know that was planning on the part of the president I don't think it was it was just basic basically it was his rhetoric on his side right\nBut remember back in twenty sixteen we were saying okay when you're on a stage with Hillary and you're you're debating just throw the facts out or you know she lied about being ... she you know uh the she broke the law when it came to her email server all these things is throwing the facts out and have them fact check well they ended up back checking\nElizabeth [laughter] and Elizabeth Warren's people basically doing that and then they come back as if it's legitimate right\nBut then they remember they kept changing it then all of the ... was the Boston Globe way out why yeah we made a daycare out and we made a mistake again and it just got to the point of being the most bizarre thing yeah right and I'm thinking to myself\nWow how bad are seriously now you when I Need to reconsider ... we need to get out of this radio thing and get into political consulting do yeah I Would totally do that and just say you idiot yeah\nWhat do you think that they're not going to war [laughter] look\nIf you're going to waste your money waste your money on us give us a million dollars and we can be a lot better political consultants for whoever you're using right because remember this means that Elizabeth Warren got together with all of her age and they sat in a room and said okay here's our plan to counter Trump [laughter] yeah and everybody shook their heads going\nHa ha ha ha ha ha ha that's only go was that was that you think there was one guy or gal in the room that said\nNo no [laughter] they all they all there was an overriding vote sorry we all voted you were deciding to go with it because [laughter] we're just a tactic become a good idea\nAnd and but this is not this is the mainstream remember when you had the Kavanaugh hearings the first Kavanaugh hearings\nAnd it was the first day and remember that whole weekend the Democrats on the committee had decided whether or not they were going to do a full on walk out or you just do the ... right and they thought that it struck destructive thing I you know with Grassley a basically would be the tactic they would use that is what they went with\nAnd like they had that meaning they met\nAll weekend about it okay would get up and walk out [laughter] which ultimately they did a during the a committee vote on on on Capitol you know and that you had come out of Harris going outside and doing the\nPress thing and all that but it wasn't that wasn't so much the ... that was like the protest after the fact they still voted yet and they still voted so there wasn't affected really anything you know it it will show but\nBut they had the meeting that first weekend they had that meeting will just get up and walk out this\nIs this this ... this is a mainstream Democrats today this is not the protesters\nAnd we talked about how the protesters ... lead the party they lead the party they lead the call for the party but how many groups how many different causes and different protest groups are there this\nThey have no direction because they're in every direction and it's\nIt's it's crazy and then then I guess the the other point was so Elizabeth Warren then does DNA matter quite right does this does is destroyed transgender isn't mhm if DNA matters\nBecause remember the the the next thing as as as we all know uh we we've gone through the whole trans racial thing than the left just starting to embrace fried or remember you're talking about Elizabeth Warren who was [laughter] before this one of the leading liberal icons\nYou know socialist icons social justice warrior who broke a ton of social justice warrior rules and regulations ... number one you were saying the DNA matters does in this so DNA matters across the board then and then it matters for ah your your sexuality it matters for your gender huh\nThat writers for your race huh right is is that the\nIs that the whole point or or does it not in okay what's the determining factor of what you are then what is the what is the [laughter] where does that decimal point go what is the what is the fraction that indicates that you are a particular ethnicity just great stop\nWell and if I were doing a debate with her on stage I Would say a former President Obama said race is just a social construct yes do you agree\n[laughter] and people forget about that because again what you know it that when a president\nObama ... just before he left office I Believe that was the was the lead her New Yorker I forgot what I think it was ... he did a a an interview with\nThey asked him you know why do you say that you're black when you know your ... mixed race soon and he said because I've come to know I've I've come to realize that race is a social construct ... it's what you think you are ... or so\nIs that it it now is that done now\nHas the left moved on because when when you look at it there were so many rules of the social justice warrior that Elizabeth Warren broke and they were completely quiet mhm totally silent ... everything from cultural appropriation\nTo the fact that ... race apparently is no longer a social construct it has something to do with DNA that's why\nAre you using science swore I met [laughter] remember when Ben Shapiro brought up the science on a on the doctor drew show he was threatened with violence\nSo you can't bring up the science that's wrong but see this is this is the madness of the left because there are so many different directions how do you know which one is the\n... here's here's the thing when Trump says something the majority of what Trump says that they criticize and fact check this off the cuff Mm right\nIt's it's an opinion or just the thought that he just boom the roads out right and and and the insanity of the left", "show_name": "The Dana Show",
