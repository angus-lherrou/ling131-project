course\nThe president and the agreement that nuclear agreement on this treaty is that going to withdraw he says that that that ah independently secretary of defense James Mattis is completely aligned with tromp on\nPulling out of that nuclear treaty with Russia a so I mean whatever Madison is okay with I think I'm OK with uh the INS they say that Russia's already violated it on this and then the

to have you thanks for joining a\nHappy to be with you\nSo I'm going to start first off I Want to start with the Russian treaty that the Madison is on board with the president pulling out of this date the claim is that Russia has already violated that is this going to spark an arms race though\nWell whatever arms race there's going to be is already under way there's two major for all the United states is not alone in saying that Russia has violated disagreements or the United kingdom or other allies are completely on board of noting that that's really a question of what you can do about it\nUh and the other major flaw that others agree with the United states about is that it doesn't capture China and China is the most rapidly growing nuclear arsenal on the planet and so the foreign policy of unity southern doesn't necessarily covered the needs of twenty eight feet and the Trump Administration has made a habit\nOf calling out ineffectual agreements threatening to withdraw from them and oftentimes it can provoke constructive debate about how they get back into a better agreement ... but I strongly sent that's where this is\nRight and at this issue why do it now as opposed to I mean obviously this has been going on to with a violation of dying by Russia for quite some time ah why why at this particular point would he would he choose to to withdraw now\nWell from my point of view is never a bad day due to a good thing so it's what we needed to do it it's a good time to start it may have something to do with Basset or John Bolton being national security advisor at the ... yeah that route or more experienced arms control and counter proliferation expert\nAs national security adviser and so we've got someone who is uniquely experience to go and engage this challenge I think part of it is that there's a lot of intelligence coming in\nA in and out of government that suggested China's really breaking farther ahead\nI think that's what finally tipped the arguments on this is not just the U.S Russia issue it's a global nuclear capabilities issue and from that at this point of view there is no reason limiting ourselves if the other party is violating it and a third party that's not in the group is running it\nMhm is there a chance that because the president is you know obviously would like to include China in some sort of agreement is that what would they even be would they even do that if that's something that he would even be able to get them to do\nWell he's been able to do things that most experts didn't think could be done already so I Can't say it's impossible because a new NAFTA was impossible and then here we are right and so but I think that there's no reason to believe the Chinese will want to do that and I don't think that the Russian necessarily walk\nTo renegotiate because they had a good deal that did what they wanted which was to annoy the United states in limited ability to deal with China\nA and basically we get all of the followers of arms control theology to get into high church about how important is for the United states to disarm itself in order to keep the world stage\nYeah this is um I I Want to switch from from this to Saudi Arabia and of course the region where in Russia does play a huge role this ongoing discussion and investigation of the the death of democracy yoga and I was talking to them a couple of people about this including last week we were stuck with doctors duty Jasper who\nIt was it was fascinating to see\nA and MSNBC and other networks tried to spin\nIt questioning of why Saudi Arabia would\nOr ... as as conservatives ... engaging in some sort of whisper smear campaign even though it was in New York Times that had reported just in several days ago\nThat ... was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood and it was to show the who is aligned with the more extremist members of the royal family and he was against their support of Israel and remaining a very much in support of Palestine have untreated one time a deer America you're nine eleven is our twenty four seven\nI talking about that Palestinian and Israeli relations\nAnd so there I think that there are there some genuine questions as to what maybe not saying that it's sanctioned but\nWhat possibly could have no cost Saudi Arabia and the crown prince to to take this this insane move but the way that the media is handling it trying to somehow a tennis on Trump is is is bizarre to me and at the same time\nUm there's shows Steven they're so concerned about Saudi Arabia\nThere they think that it's so bad we need to stop any kind of deal with and they get these are the same people that are very eager to suggest that we must make friends and Renee friends when Irwin over in Turkey\nAnd it'll Irwin who in you know I was jokingly saying that he was like the valedictorian of jailing journalists and they're in NATO for crying out loud that seems to be hard to reconcile for them\nLive and you got some pretty much right this is a perfect Middle East story there are no angels turkey is a mistake pro is llamas to invest this guy was no saint doesn't mean he deserved to be murder especially when it sounds like he was murdered desperately awful\nAh watch turkey does not have clean hands when it comes as long as ... in the broader Middle East or in dealings with the United states frankly a Saudi Arabia is far from perfect country and it's part of democracy or but\nIt is balancing against Iran and turkey to a degree that have been in favor of the worst of the worst groups\nIn the middle east in recent years or so we've got a bad person who's a lot of journalists he was a commentator a former intel guy that was in favor of the Muslim Brotherhood\nDidn't deserve to be murdered but that's where he was a and usually a media would go to the nice things to try to get true facts on a victim that they didn't sympathize with\nA and it didn't happen in the United states or to the United states the fact that this guy had an affiliation with the Washington Post didn't make this an attack on America was oh tack on its own another government's\nSovereign territory consul uh and so it's it's a perfect Middle East stinky piling mess uh and uh I think that just like I said last week I have no more convinced we have a hundred percent of the truth of the Turkish government says they're\nGoing to lay out more of their version of the truth is there ever was a tolerance than my disposition for this hour truth and your truth separation radio America it's definitely a political
