thought that\nShe said I don't like last night and it's a window where why or how do the next day I get a caller in on it a secret service and I thought it was a joke that I kept laughing and that they were serious\nAnd I feel they only that's the last\nThat long a local police department and\nThey would not cooperate so that he had four if there is a is that might delay or even in a Hollywood

like they don't have any plants actually kill like\nAt least she does there's hit die but it's just like I have a gun you know basically they all left right and I said\nWell I I Would tell you that I'm aware on this show if somebody ever calls the show and says they want to do harm to either a current president or former top official and government a senator or an ambassador\nA secretary of state and as the case in Hillary Clinton's case that they have special protection and the law that is a federal crime\nTo threatened to kill them now you know that on a day to day basis\nYou know that if you were to reliably threatened somebody even just Joe schmo in your local community not Hillary Clinton you threatened to kill somebody and it's a it's a credible threat or is that a reasonable person would take it as a credible threat\nThat's that usually constitutes the crime of intimidation it's sometimes called by other names in other states laws but you have to be careful about that kind of thing if somebody can make the case that you threatened to kill either former first lady secretary said\nUm the secret germs have come out and have a chat with you and that usually strange it

former president and his immediate family and it also covers may major party nominees for any of those jobs so\nIf you're the ... so you're a Democrat or Republican nominee for president of the United states vice president United States or their families once you become the nominee even if you didn't get production already the secret service is going to say you're protected by the outlaw and frankly\nI I think it would survive a constitutional test on First Amendment free you know you you walk into the court and say listen I have the first amendment right to threaten the president in the

person don't do this that's horrible reasoning come on Senator Murkowski let's do this\nGood grief that's just horrible reasoning\n[noise] I just don't understand what motivates her\nThis um [noise] oh my goodness\nI uh\n[laughter] yeah I don't think she was paid off I think that what she's trying to do is maybe run a third rail like an independent maybe and maybe at one point of Democrats ended up taking the Senate she would caucus with him\nShe wants to go with the power is that's the only thing I can think of that's the only thing I can think of a\nMarco Rubio said earlier today that a no vote on Kavanaugh would be logical interpreted as your pursuit you're presuming that he was is guilty of the accusations that were made against him and that's what a no vote as\nA he's qualified he's a texture list all these accusations um that have been made against him are they haven't been proven\nSo what else that's what all of this is about all of this is just about all this is about\nSo everybody's basically Susan Collins has the Senate and the whole because now\nWell we've got like what forty five minutes and then she says her vote oh my gosh what if Manchin mansion citing vote\n\nI'm going to tell you if he is the deciding vote and ... days on that do you realize how Democrats are going to come for him [noise]\n\nMan alive he's not an extremist Democrat he's the ...

I mean it's like a whole ... story and it came to life after one woman um there was a a woman who lost her life in his clinic and when they were\nBecause they had first responders that couldn't get to her because the doors were barred and had stuff\nIn front of them and then they go in there and they find out not only is\nEverything discussing Les dirty but they're actually like no doctors there and they just have a teenager girls running the place and\nHe had a collection of aborted\nFetuses and ... and he was doing some super really\nSuper illegal super late term stuff\nIt was horrified I ... and then when the grand jury\nWhen they when they had that people who were testifying before the grand jury and I was reading their testimonies I couldn't even get there are some of them\nAnd it was so heavy and so I have a lot of respect for the people who came together\nTo put together this movie that is coming out on October twelve guys now the trial of America's biggest serial killer because they were working from actual fact from what was happening in this case and it's horrifying enough just to glimpses that you get of it\nBut you know they had to really roll up their sleeves and get into it and I God love him for joining me right now is international film and TV star Peabody Award winner ... who directed this really horrifying film neck welcome to the show\nAnd thank you so much for getting my introduction right now so many people\nThey know not everybody is as good as we are and we we really take care of our people here that's the way how it works\nBy the way congratulations on this film out a really fantastic\nCast and media dean king Janine Turner ... ... and obviously you uh directing at this how hard was this for you to do because I Know everybody I think most everybody you know we caught him up and most everybody remembers this awful horror this horrifying story\nHow difficult was this for you to to tackle as a director because this is some really heavy stuff\nYou know um when we started working on the script eh we all kind of agreed that what we needed to do was just tell the truth about this and not try to surmise about it at all because the fact that the case or so or a chicken and egg cells\nThat we didn't really need to offer our opinion about it so that's really how we approached it we approached it just like we were telling the truth crunch story and just and it's interesting that killer happened to be an abortion doctor who was killing babies after they were born and it was it's very grim subject matter that the movie itself\nIt costs about the egg catching him and convicting him\nStrangely uplifting in a way it's not and gory and it's not disgusting it it's actually a day test screenings and people people really love the ...\nAnd that's a lot of talent to be able to to ... to ... to do that and and I know that\nYou know reading some of the testimonies and I know that this is you know you showcased this aspect of it in the film of some of these women who you know they had never been pushed to speak out about what was it about this stuff until some of the more horrific things happen and they were really brave and and that they were speaking out but just the abuses that this guy\nIn the in his clinic I mean it's horrifying and I love how you said the facts are bad enough\nThat they can speak for themselves I mean that there isn't there really isn't any room for pontificate in this film because he is such a his evil is such a presence in this film on how to talk to me a little bit too 'cause I Know this was it was a labor of love for everybody who was involved and it took awhile for this film to come together\nUm what what did you find to be the most challenging aspect\nOf putting a real life story about a topic that is normally not accurately portrayed and not honestly discussed by Hollywood and pop culture what was the biggest challenges you ran across you know and and directing an end to bringing us to live\nIn a while the the most challenging aspect of it really was a way to present the story that that it would it would still be accessible to a wider audience I mean\nWe came out of the movie with a PG Thirteen waiting which is why I like to get all along and and the way that we did that was by\nNot only sticking to the facts as as much as we could put them together cause you have to rearrange some things and you have to combine some characters in order to make the movie but there's not as much of the truth of what happened in the courtroom and what happened in your best ... in the film\nDishes truthfully as we can make it\nAnd uh you know the challenge of a ... making sure that you you told people about the uh the harder it details and you didn't rub it in their face you didn't shock them with the actual gory\nA visual images to and I think we accomplished that you know quite well everybody that she's in movies\nYou know we've been doing a lot of testing is a decade and they always talk at movie out grateful that we don't let these images in their face and just let the horror of what this man did play in the theater right\nI Know in the beginning of this um and and and everyone was\nTalking with next year see him you know from from justified and are so many other so many other films and and now his new film that he's directing guys now I had read\nUm this is some time ago how initially um the film ... this film was blocked by the trial judge because he didn't like\nHow he was portrayed he had been called like one of the most corrupt ah has hit the hit Philadelphia was one of the most corrupt governments and he was mad about that he was mad about his portrayal and are you at the patently got through that\n[noise] well actually he you know you haven't seen the film he was he was really talking about the book and just assuming that whatever characterizations he didn't like in the book was in the film and in the film I mean it's not portrayed as a bad guy at all just sort of has to stay in their overruled [laughter]\nPretty rural right we don't we don't\nReally go after the judge in the movie at all so I think they must have cleared up the misunderstanding uh because uh that all the way so\nYeah that's that's that's awesome you have ... he's a he's a detective who's running this down and
