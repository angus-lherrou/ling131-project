call and thank you so much for your ministry thank you how can I help him along to find like by default three months ago I put my town home on the market and my sister who I've my penance by default [laughter]\nUm found her own place currently sitting empty the entire complex static and has gone down in value from my unit is very Fifteen thousand dollars less than what I had bought it for five years ago right now I'm sure there are the units of the same style inland as mine and I know the lowest\nPrice avid like a thousand dollars good\nUh yesterday his family and it came on the market has been less than one hundred Ninety five out fan\nAnd starting to feel that if it can feed it out because it's sitting empty and winter is coming you know I was thinking of dropping my price to one Ninety four and adding an incentive that out over paid six months of condo fees got\nAnything out there with me and I would pay five to six thousand dollars out of pocket on the market is discharged and my question is how\nWould you how much would you pay out of pocket to get rid of that thing how long would you go\nHobbies you'd have obviously you'd have to have the money to pay out of pocket that'd be one limiting factor in Ireland on it I don't know how it what am I to judge the situation and how quickly are these things dropping\nOverall and you know that's going to give me my urgency\nUm I I don't want to just get emotional about it I'm going to judge the future and say these things are going down in value there's already five of them on the market\nI've got to be the lowest one on the market um this is not looking good you know so um I Would I drop it another fifty thousand no I wouldn't know [laughter] you know so you know so in some point you do you laugh right in and that's that's\nSo uh but ... but five thousand out of pocket to be done with this two hundred thousand dollar or a hundred and eighty dollar mortgage yeah yeah I'll be done with that in a heartbeat I'd do that too 'cause 'cause you know waiting two years is not going to help the situation is what I think I'm hearing\n[noise] right yeah exactly and worst case counseling and when the pay is not a place to live in the wintertime\nWell but I mean really I mean this winter but in general this complex is not going to heal and become worth three hundred thousand two years from now exactly yeah\nIt's going the wrong way and so it's starting to get out of town you know and uh yeah I'm with you I I think you're right uh I don't think you're panicking with the numbers you're giving me now you started telling me somebody wants to offer you a low ball offering you have to come out of pocket with thirty grand I'm probably gonna wait the winter out you know\nMay put it in in it and wait all spring and see what happens\nBut there's some point that I'm not willing to be that far below the other properties that are on the market but uh but overall yeah let's get rid of this thing\nGood question I'm sure you're facing this open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five things for joining us Andrea is on Instagram I've not got over a million people on Instagram\nWow and I'm

months of expenses saved\nDo we save up for a down payment on a home or we start investing were both at the same time we'd love to buy by the end of next\nI think it's fine to wait for one year the

know what's funny is from what I've heard from some of my uh democratic people they're kind of hoping he loses and the reason is because they see him as a person who could be more of a threat to\nTrump than in the Senate\nThink about that for a second he may not win his race indexes against lion dead will touch on that in a second but ... maybe more of a force on a national scale and sometimes that happens right sometimes\nYou know if you're if you're somebody who's ... is a conservative and you're in California the chances of winning some of these things are slim to none you have a broader appeal nationwide\nThen\nYou do in a place like California same thing for Beto cruise she probably has a broader appeal his politics elsewhere would get him some Republicans plenty of independence and tons of Democrats but in taxes you don't have a lot of that you have a lot of Republicans and even though they're kind of pissed at time\nAt ten it's still\nA red state now as I talk to him last night at this town hall ... uh they asked him the question that many people are are are are are talking about as far as they take back the house in peach men\nAnd use that in July that you would as a member of the house right now vote to impeach have you changed your mind\nI haven't um ... let me let me put it this way I'm there may be an open question as to whether the president than the candidates sought seclude with the Russian government in two thousand and six team when we saw him on that stage in Helsinki defending Vladimir ... head of the country that attacked our democracy\nIn twenty sixteen instead of this country and its citizens and the amazing democracy was collusion inaction [noise] uh [noise]\nLike I said earlier a political is reporting that you're going to be disappointed why why why why why why\nYou're going to be disappointed the Democrats here here's my question to people out there who independent or Democrats to think that Trump did something do you trust Bob Mueller and his report if he comes out and said look\nThere's no they're they're so\nWhat are you going to do right what are you going to do\nSo they're ... they're going to grab it everything they're going to grab it everything they don't like him so you got to get everything it's ... it's it's it's it's if it's not this remember how many times the goalposts moved in this investigation started out as Russia and we've since moved the goalpost on numerous occasions\nYou may have wondered when he fired James Comey the principal investigator and what happened in that election whether that was an attempt to obstruct justice but win by broad daylight on Twitter he asked his attorney general Jeff Sessions to end the Russia investigation always say that obstruction inaction\nIs it is it obstruction so Dana Bash actually does what good reporters do she she pushes she ask questions\nThe best course to get there so that every member has all the facts and that there are compelling enough to do the right thing is to allow the full independence and integrity or Bob Mueller investigated already\nSaid even though that's not done that you would bow to impeach him so according to the constitution that means that the president has committed the crime the tree than primer bribery or a high crime and the demeanor which one of those do you think the president has committed\nI wouldn't like in an impeachment to an indictment there there was enough there to proceed with the trial\nYeah and that's all it's about it's about in the end is\nSlowing down impeaching him knowing full well that you're not going to get him thrown out of office and if there's no they're they're doing to the country's you this is the other thing and this is something we've talked about before you go to potentially\nPut yourself in a situation where you look like such obstruction is in the whole thing is you don't care about the country you care about destroying Trump and taking out Trump that you put in a situation where you you focus so much on it\nHurts the country maybe slows down the growth of the country people start panicking we know how ... confidence and things can be can be wavering at times is waning and when we started to see things go and you're going to give Trump another opportunity to say look man when I had the house and the Senate\nWhat did I Do unemployment economy ... all of these things were going on they come along boom\nThey put a stop and everything talking about rolling back your taxes it's all they want to do talk about doing this that and the other and then what happens everything slows down everything when I was in charge was rolling they come in here\n[noise] boom look what happens and you may give people the right to you know what he'd write everything was ruined it was going good it was because we live in a world where\nIn politics we need the other side to suck now so we feel like we can have a victory he wants to impeach he did not have been waiting for the evidence yeah let's impeach\nFor two hundred and forty two years into this experiment\nWhich is the exception not the rule in rural history nothing that guarantees us the two hundred and forty third or a two hundred and forty fourth to all of us to stand up for that democracy\nThe best way to do that and so expressing it on the twenty second of October the first day of early voting than the than election day on the ... of November but you have to answer a question I I Do think there's enough there\nFor impeachment and if af are I Would I Would vote on\nThat sounds great go ahead do it I don't know what's going to happen I couldn't tell you what's going to happen uh\nIf they win back I Know that there's going to be tons of investigations are going to try to get his taxes they're going to do a lot of different things and what you're going to find is and and the way that our politics to set up\nIs you know we're supposed to fight right we're supposed to look\nFor is you know like I I talked about what Thomas old before the great thing that he said there there's no solutions was only tradeoffs that's driven solution is you know two plus two is four Thatcher's lived as a solution to that problem but the trade offs or it's the give and take\nWe talk about right you're not going to get a hundred percent I'm not going to get a hundred percent but the squeaky wheels demand a hundred percent are nothing they don't care about the other eighty percent that wants some sort of trade off to move something forward\n\nIt's sad it's sad that we're in this situation he was asked because he he went into the lion Ted thing the other night in their debate he was asked about\nCalling a as I call theater theater cruise
