came back they didn't find anything they found\nThere was no corroboration of claims they found no new evidence nothing and I I I wanted to share this city to show the lawyers\nFor ah\nThe lawyers for a a a Christine Blasey Ford they were they were just quite upset because they knew where this was going they knew what was going to be coming down the road right so they sent this letter to Chuck Grassley\nThey sent this letter to Chuck Grassley and they said quote a because remember yesterday I shared with you the letter that Chuck Grassley sent to her lawyers saying we kinda need your therapist notes especially considering that you're literally\nThis is your your this is your evidence for cooperation so it's kind of important you know if you're going to say we have to consider this as evidence to support your\nClaim than we need to see it you know that's that that's how it works right but hey Democrats were saying that this wasn't a trial okay well then tough tough means we're\nGoing to go ahead and hold the damn boat you know 'cause you said it wasn't a trial good on you for taking that road so the lawyers for\nFord sent this to Grassley they say quote regarding the documents you've requested in your letter of October second twenty Eighteenth Dr Ford is prepared to provide those documents to the FBI\nWhen she has interviewed we have not yet heard from the FBI about scheduling an interview with her sign Deborah cats and Lisa Banks here's what so adorable about that\nIn the ever levine hell do you think that the FBI reports these findings to hey I'm going to give you a I'm going to make it multiple choice you guys ready\nWho do you think that the FBI reports the findings to do you think it is to a the Academy of arts and sciences in motion pictures [noise] do you think it is be\nHillary Clinton or do you think it is the Senate Judiciary committee if\nYou had to pick one of those choices that to\nThe FBI report their findings to and what the FBI gives the Senate Judiciary committee as\nOr what what the ... or how they're even going to come to this decision what do they do with the information that's given to them that led to a decision your choice came I Would say the Twenty one members of this year you are correct sir you win prizes\nThat is absolutely correct absolutely absolutely correct so\nAnything that the ... that the FBI were to get goes to the Senate Judiciary committee which is insane that they're saying well we can't we can't give it to you we want to give them to the FBI when we sit down for an investigation\nIt's a stupid delay tactic by her lawyers it made zero sense Adel whatsoever to hold is one of the committee\nConsidering what ever they discover\nThe committee because\nEr into just a background check out the request of the Senate\nJudiciary Committee that's right class that do it is that is who gets the information so is she refuses to provide the evidence okay\nBye Felicia we're moving on we're going to hold a vote that's how this works you can't say well I demand that you consider this evidence and ... as a way to corroborate my play but I'm not going to show you this evidence\nOkay by this work none of this works this way there is a process but it's not a criminal\nTrial yes thank you so much for reminding me that you know that's why we're holding the vote\nAnd and by the way why perhaps it was in her lawyers goal this\nMakes sure looked like she wasn't entirely forthcoming during the hearing I mean let's let's examine what information did she not disclosed during the hearing because that was\nAnd I'm Sorry I'm having a Sam kennison moment guy that was the it\nWas the whole purpose the whole purpose of having a hearing you don't go\nWait a minute there's been things that I purposely withheld from the hearing that's not [noise]\n... no it doesn't work that way at all if you had to pick between a not how this works and B doesn't work this way actually both would be right\n[noise]\nSo then it was I mean it was pretty amazing to me to see that that and of course that's not gonna that's not going to work by the way one of my super super smarty pants lawyer friends who is a a litigator he says look [noise]\nUm and what he ... he says the failure to turn over relevant information actually in a courtroom leads to dismissal so they better be damn glad that this isn't to trial\nOoh\nOoh that's my little lawyer friend who lives in California so just than just saying it is and and so now and I'm also super I Am of that with this other talking point all ...

kind of magic and ... who is supposed to be used in order should then it's just missed\nPeriod that's how it works in trial\nThat's how it works if you're I mean they kept saying well it's not us as a job interview it's it's it's not a\nIt's not a job interview it's it's a it's a job interview not a trial okay well so uh this so Cory Booker he's mad\nHe said that there are hints of misconduct in the ... caused cabinet report they're also hints that he grabbed a woman and groped her while they were in college\n... there's no sense of that to uh we also have let's see uh Ronan Farrow went on a tweet storm\nAnd when I was a he said I feel like I'm being silenced FBI declined to interview the primary witnesses related to the cabinet allegations it was tasked with reviewing some of them resorted to send in an unsolicited sworn statements\nAnd he uh\nThey wrote a piece of read the New Yorker about that and then his surrogates are saying well you know if you need any any more evidence that the uh that this that this has turned them into ... at you know journalists to become advocates will know and that's what Ronan Farrow is here he's he's he\nHe I think undermined everything that he was building he became an advocate and forgot his journalistic purpose\nWhich was unfortunate because he had such a promising career now nobody can take them seriously anymore no one can take them seriously they have tried they tried to delay delayed delayed delayed the lay\nYou had her\nAttorney saying well we're not going to we're not going to basically cooperate who by the way that they know to the Senate Judiciary committee is that the new standard you can just say no\nI didn't know you could do that she she wouldn't turn over her notes\nShe refused David French and attorney wrote about this my friend over at National Review\nHe said no she she outright said she wouldn't do it and it undercuts any effort he says this is a serious problem and it undercuts any effort to prove or claims against Brett Kavanaugh\nThe American legal system is characterized by mandated transparency\nAnd he goes what my friend and I said he says in criminal cases the prosecution is required to release exculpatory information in other words it can't be required to undercut its own case and civil litigation parties are generally required to turn over not just all relevant non privileged documents to the other side there are also require\nTo turn over all documents that could lead to the discovery of relevant information that is one reason why the decision to litigation ever be taken lightly 'cause you're opening just ... it's called discoveries what the process is called\nSo [noise] but the Democrats kept saying on purpose well this isn't a ... a trial says job interview\nSo essentially what they were saying is well we don't have to meet the standards of fairness or balance or anything like that we can just make a baseless accusation and not have to prove it that's what they were saying and in\nAny other any other courtroom it would have been in a courtroom it would have been dismissed and it was and it and it should be a bit and should be dismissed here they can bitch and moan all they want you about something being incomplete but you all have nobody to think for yourselves you got an individual who could not corroborate a single one of her claims\nYou got an individual who refused to cooperate and provide information to the Senate Judiciary committee that could have further shed perspective and ... and ... and some sort of and could further illuminated the scope the breath of her of what she says corroborated and was evidence of her claim\nShe refused to corrupt a cooperate her attorneys refused to cooperate Democrats refused to cooperate and now they want to complain about the process and say that it wasn't it that it didn't include everything\nAgain\nWhy I have no idea what you're saying that\nThis is insane\nSo going forward oh and I wanted

committee including Mike Lee of just walked out onstage they're going to give a press conference on this FBI Kevin report right now let's go to this in progress\nFor good afternoon everyone of what we know for sure is the FBI report did not corroborate any of the allegations against judge capital and the second thing we know for sure is that\nThere's no way anything we did would satisfy\nThe Democrats are they've always got a reason while the goalposts needed to be moved further down the field farther down the field and uh nothing we could do would shut us down their dug in are you saying that uh from the beginning\nAnd with that I Want to turn it over to Germany Ross lay on the members of the committee was like I've done a really outstanding jobs\nThank you for either [noise] um [noise]\nBefore I say a few words are\nSo I won't have to announce each person after me is going on in this order will be hatch corner Lee and tell us so please just come to the podium and say whatever you want to see and then we'll take questions\nFrom this is the eighty seventh day or that's\nThree weeks longer than the average is the last three or four\n... nominees to the Supreme Court so don't tell me wherever spent enough time [noise]\nAlso I feel very good about where this nomination is right now now I don't see that from the standpoint of counting votes I say that from the standpoint of the qualifications of this candidate eight and the fact that those qualifications\nTo be a Supreme Court justice based upon his twelve years on the DC circuit without anybody find any fault with his qualifications to serve there\nBut that hasn't been talked about much everything else\nThis person is very well qualified a person that believes in the principles of due process the presumption of innocence and readiness to serve are recognized so judge Kavanaugh should be confirmed\nOn Saturday all this started down hill very quickly on about July the town when Schumer said\nThat we're going to do everything we can to stop this nomination and you can look back eighty seven days and you see that everything but whether he's qualified to serve has been brought up brought up\nI tried to come and I think I've carried out what I promised immediately that we want to have a fair and thorough process we had a\nFair answer all process and I think that's best demonstrated by the fact that we\nThe minute I read about who the person was in the Feinstein ladder\nDr Ford I read about her name and the paper we got on it right away to provide the form she wanted an intern we provide the same forum for Kavanaugh\nBut what I've been dealing with since July the towns the downhill slope that show has put us on Israeli dealing with a demolition derby\nAnd were they just about destroyed a good person to be on the Supreme Court\nSo hopefully we're forty eight hours away from having a new person on the Supreme Court\n[noise] a certain endorse everything that's a fair amount of combat is a said\nLike I'm disappointed in my democratic colleagues for what they're doing there is no excuse for a but they're doing it I'm grateful to the FBI for their efforts and doing a thorough very important investigation\nNone of us said that of judge Kavanaugh dead what he's been accused of doing by some of the Democrats and outside people some outside people should be disqualified but after investigation for both the committee\nAnd the FBI we have found nothing absolutely nothing to cooperate accusations against him [noise]\nAnd we need to confirm him right away this confirmation will be a victory for the Senate as an institution a reminder that the politics of baseless personal destruction has no place here\n\nI think he's one of the best nominees I've seen in my forty two years in the United States Senate [noise]\nThat's how I judge to him for the way he's been traded yes this is an important position yes and Democrats have a right to feel very worried and upset about about ... a Republican getting this seat 'cause they thought they had won the election\nBut that isn't the case\nIn our side is handled this I think with discretion\nHaving every problem that has come up for\nAnd frankly I Hope we can just move forward and get this done is the right thing to do judge Kevin I was a great judge filmmakers right justice on the United States
