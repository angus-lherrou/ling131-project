same thing and I know some of the folks over at a high um have been a ... in fact I was reading John you this morning who says it's settled law and he's one of those individuals who is\nVery much a he or she is very much against the president actually he thinks he believes that it is modifying the constitution without going through the proper channels\nAnd that's kind of he says that the Supreme Court has consistently ride the fourteenth amendment to grant birthright citizenship whether it's the United states ...\nUh which was an Eighteen Ninety eight ended up held the American citizenship of a child born in San Francisco to Chinese parents who themselves could never naturalized under the Chinese exclusion acts are also he writes the court held that the fourteenth amendment affirms the agent and fundamental rule of citizenship by birth within the territory and the allegiance protection of the country yadda yadda yadda\nUh then they he cites fly larvae do uh where it was a five to four ruling that the fourteenth amendment equal protection clause require taxes to provide public school into children of illegal aliens and all nine justices agreed that quote no plausible distinction with respect to the fourteenth amendment quote jurisdiction and that's what we're going to come back to\nCan be drawn between resident aliens who's entry into the United states is lawful et cetera et cetera et cetera and we talk about a legion so we talk about jurisdiction because people are ... are wanting to\nDefine what do you mean by jurisdiction is that does it have to have to do with allegiance to one particular country you know et cetera\nAnd so ... and then there are individuals who absolutely do not believe that this is that this is settled law and they think that it's it's not settled law to the point where we need intervention from the from the executive office\nAnd that is that is what a lot of that is what it again at a bunch of other lawyers are are and and pundits are arguing so I think it old I I think it comes down to\nA couple of things uh\nWhether or not people actually really one thing whether or not individuals believe in the founders it seems to be like a founders intent and people trying to define or redefined word that's kind of what I think it's kind of falling down to\nAnd I don't know I'm kind of I don't support birthright citizenship\nI don't I just don't I just simply did not I think that um you have to go through a I mean everyone should go through proper channels and and by the way dean of the mind that you support lawful entry\nIs not being against lawful entry I mean that's\nThe same thing birthright citizenship and yes that's what we were just talking about is when you have as I was just discussing and one of the cases that has been previously\nDecided not necessarily on where the United states ends on birthright citizenship but on this particular case when you had to Chinese Americans who were excluded from be naturalized because of the Chinese exclusion acts back in the late Eighteen hundreds\nAnd so as a result of that they had a huge fight over their child whether their child could be considered a ... they would have citizenship through birth\nBut typically that's not really how this is being decided that's not how it's being determined I mean I was reading the story just the other day of ... to a bunch of Russians are coming to Florida and they're having babies in Florida\nAnd then their children just with the hopes that their children can be American citizens and that's where of course you get the term anchor baby so I don't believe that to non citizens can give birth to a citizen and you know I just don't I ... and people can I respectfully disagree with people who who think otherwise\nUm but to that point\nThe\nIdea that you are somehow bigoted or against immigration because you believe in an organized unlawful entry is the height of vulgarity\nStupidity and dishonesty and when people have to refrain and a dishonest fashion and maliciously I might add and try to re purpose their opponent position so as to give them advantage that means they've lost\nThat means that\nTheir argument cannot hold water\nThat's what it means\nSo we're going we're going to get into we're going to get into some of this because I think whether or not the president can do it\nIs that's the big discussion can he do it is this something that he has the ability to do um there was um uh some\nThere was there and there are also some discussion where people say that the directors of the fourteenth amendment\nThat they did not the text of the amendment does not address the crux of this particular problem and that\nWhether this is revoked by executive order or legislative act I mean it it gets it gets into kind of Iraq um some ironic territory\nIn terms of living constitutional ism et cetera et cetera were going to talk about that with Jay Christian Adams as I said um additionally\nThe a\nAnd I was reading another piece in the wall Street Journal from a judge on the Fifth Circuit court Jim ... hooves specifically wrote\nAbout birthright citizenship and also cited Dred Scott uh the Dred Scott case the judge Roger Cheney which by the way and my first book I have an entire chapter that looks at the at the racist rich of gun control because interestingly one of the very one of the very measurements that Chaney used to deny Dred Scott\nA full citizenship as he should have been granted is that because of the racist or gun control laws of the day because he could not possess firearms due to the color of his skin and the the biggest regulations that were in place at the time that was one of the measurements by which judge Roger teeny withheld\nFull recognition as a person as a citizen of the United states of America to Dred Scott\nVery interesting is that not it's always keep that in the back of our heads because in some aspects these issues are

to talk I'm Sorry but you are you are not\nYou are not clear headed or rational enough to engage in this in this conversation because it because this is people who said this type of stuff these types of things\nThey're not interested in any sort of solutions they're not interested in actually discussing anything and tried to resolve differences they just want to throw out rhetorical bomb like that
