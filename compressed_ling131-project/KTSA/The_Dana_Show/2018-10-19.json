Bush for all his other faults did exactly that at twenty eight or twenty nine\nHe realized he was drinking too much and he simply quit and he just quit cold turkey and said I'm not going to drink any more I thought that was a wise choice for him\nAnd we ought to applaud him for instead we tell people you're so brave to admit that you're an alcoholic but after all it's a disease you can't control that you caught this disease of alcoholism that with that kind of excusing of things or\nYou know some kids in in school they have more you know a a behave in a way that is that breaks the rules\nAnd they get suspended and then we get people saying well you're only suspending them because they're black or Hispanic know you could say the Asian kids get suspended less than the white kids to why don't we all behave more like the Asian kids unless like the white kids in the black kids in the Hispanic kids let's set the Asian kids as the bar\nAnd it would be no different John\nThen the kid who goes out for football and he sees somebody who can throw a football a long ways and very accurately and he says\nThat's going to be by benchmark instead as a society we're bench marking off the guy who can barely picked the football up instead of the guy who can throw it very well we're showed shooting for the lowest common denominator it's a race to the bottom\n... we are I mean it's a sad state of affairs that is ... with with several generations younger than myself but but you know the comment you made about everybody take responsibility at recognizing their actions and they've done something to correct those I mean I've been in the same boat I've gotten\nMore tickets and I liked it and sometimes I have to sell it to pay those tickets would align myself with a friend to get to work or to get around or something along those lines I mean that's just responsibility that's just\nAnd you're going up you took the pain that went with it in pain is an important thing but you know another motivator\nMy wife and I one time took a group of people they paid their own way I couldn't afford to do it but we went to Israel for a week which is very nice group of people I still run into some of them today I get emails from them and one time we were in this little town and we saw this man\nWho was it was an Arab town it was in it was ... it was in Israel but it was mostly Arab and in some Palestinians even some Arab refugees and all\nAnd we saw this man out on the street and it was a little ... they could have been a little town in Arizona and the kind of looked like that um and this man was just screaming at this woman\nOut in the street and I said what's going on there 'cause I don't I don't know if you've ruined I don't know Arab or a couple of words in Hebrew and our translator said his guide\nSaid he's yelling at her because she's begging I said does he do you think he knows her and he goes no he just saw this woman begging and it went up and started yelling at her and basically saying you ought to be ashamed of yourself are begging you should go out and do something in our translators translating\nAnd I thought can you imagine in America somebody walking up to a bomb especially the able bodied twenty something bombs that are populating big cities now and say why don't you get off your rear end and go get a job there seven million empty jobs could you imagine somebody being publicly shamed in America\nFor not going out and doing for themselves instead as you say we've got all these people running around saying\nGosh they're all these people living on the streets through no fault of their own well some of them may be but a whole bunch of them are out there doing things for not doing things just because they're lazy lawyers losses show [noise]\n\n[noise] get ready to vote Henry Oleg judge Scott robbers ... county court twelve judge Scott Roberts has worked hard to reduce the docket by over thirty three percent the reduction of nearly one thousand cases Justice Roberts experience includes twelve years as prosecutor for the ... county district attorney's office\nAnd eight years a judge a county courts wealth with experience comes accomplishments judge Scott Roberts is passionate about the mental health courts doubling its size and making sure that those in need receive the care and compassion they deserve judge Roberts has tried over one hundred cases and\nWorks hard to save taxpayers money by continually reducing the jail populations judge Roberts has endorsed by the San Antonio police officers association married for thirty two years and judge Roberts is a man of faith family freedom led judge Roberts continue\nGreat work in service to our community by reelection judge Robert ... county courts will judge Scott Robert ... tough but fair I'm Scott Robertson I approve this message political ad paid for by the ... judge got Robert campaign [noise]\nI stray where right now is the time for you to build your fence with Paco ...

great and small victory was fined ... thanks very large or\nSupport more victories were veterans go to ... or\nAnd there's a lot more politics and activism and all kinds of stuff there that's that's involved with it but the thing like I said that that I think is\nIs asinine is if this Saudi prince this\nA crown prince was really bothered by this guy the way that you don't do it is to be really public and do it in Turkey\nBecause turkey would love nothing more than just the Saudi Arabia screw up you definitely don't do it in a sample you definitely don't do it with people that are in your inner circle that are easily identifiable because they're seen with you whenever you travel including to the United states and within the United states it's just not the way you do it I'm not saying that there's a proper way to go and\nYou know assassinate someone because it's wrong but I'm saying if you're trying to be ... just about it that the stupidest way to go about doing it\nI mean that's just the way it is [noise]\nBut at the same time you know in looking at the relationship the United states has relationship with Saudi Arabia it's not like just the and be real we don't have a lot of options over there we're going to settle it set up to Iran we don't get friendly with Russia I thought wait we're not supposed to like them right isn't that how it goes\nI mean in Iran and Russia are thick as thieves there there one in the same essentially because of the the deals that they have the trade deals that they have with each other and Russia has Iran's back so do the same way that he does with a ... year Russia has a ... back in Syria so\nIt's all a power play Russia wants to be a kingmaker so that they can have control over the region meanwhile the United states has been allied with Saudi Arabia and they really would love to see this reformer made out to not be a reformer which is why he doesn't himself zero favors if something like\nThis happened right and then at the same time what how I mean we're we're we're ... alliances he um was a legal resident of the United states lived in London and and uh as simple as I understand it went to the Saudi embassy in Istanbul which he was seven minutes before it was it was reported that he was killed [noise]\nUm he had previous alliances with Muslim Brotherhood apparently angered the crown prince as well um and he wrote things I'm undermining uh with the er or criticizing with the crown prince was doing\nSo and there is it's it's not and then that you know Mike Pompeo goes over there to have a conversation and you have the media that loses their ever loving mind\nBecause like Wallace here because they think he's being used as a prop he's a damn diplomat who is it represented the United states and going over to have discussions with someone to find out hey did you kill somebody how these people think is going to happen pot pales going to go over there would be like hey\nGround print to cut him up what's up did you did you ... how ... how did it happen\nI mean diplomacy it's why it's not meant for me or do ... pay if it's an art I could not be a diplomat do you know why because I feel like blowing smoke of people's backsides and I can only\nBe nice to someone I don't like for so long I mean I'm going to be real with you it takes a lot of energy for me to politely smile\nOh shock stretch it out of it\nYou see what I'm saying is I can never be a diplomat a lot of these people can be diplomatic because they're simply\nDumb and it's just that's the bottom line\nThey were talking about his last column ... Jamal ... Washington Post is last column with the Arab world needs now is free expression and our media over here has they're really they're pushing the story because they're looking at at it as a way to indict Donald Trump\nThey're pushing the story because they want to say that the Saudi prince was inspired by Donald Trump's words were in he said fake news is the enemy of the people and then the press lie to but to everybody and said oh no you said the president the enemy of the people\nAnd then they present these these you know botched soundbites where he you get half of ... not even half of a full sentence because they're desperately trying to make it out is though he declared war on depressed\nWhen ultimately it was depressed that declared war on Donald Trump and as I was discussing this morning on Fox and friends it's really a lot of the chattering class that has declared war on the people who support this administration\nHe simply said fake news is the enemy of the people I think fake news is the enemy of the republic and\nAnd do an insane that he accurately called them up for what they're doing but I made the mad because they don't they don't want to deal with that so here we are\nSo they're trying to blame this on him they're saying the New York times says the president has cow town into a mad prints I don't see how and waiting for details to come in\nBut this is how this is what they are pushing\nThey're trying to make this the focus for mid terms instead of the care of and that's gonna that's coming up from uh South America and we're going to talk more about that we also have a quick five on the way and uh some of the latest polling where it concerns Texas and uh some of these others and then later on in the program a\nAdam ... who has the gubernatorial candidate

and betting on me and my campaign um he's the attorney general of the famous Harry he's supposed to be going after fraud not parts\nThe painting is you know the so I'm not being there I've been very upfront about all my positions [noise] in fact now I remember that very individual talking to me [noise]\nTrying to get me to say\nTrying to get me to tell him to say something different than what my positions are and I said no you just got to tell the people on the doors it is what it is I've made no secret that I think we can support the second amendment and universal background checks and banning bump stocks mind on record is out in the open for everyone to save\nShe actually said assault weapons ban and then her staffer says yes she does support a ban on some at a map rifles and that's what she is desperate to avoid discussing a Josh Hawley responded and said senator accusing people of crimes as a serious thing if you have evidence of a crime please come forward with it immediately otherwise please stop politicizing the legal process for your reelection\nI think it's pretty insane that she was caught on tape literally saying the truth about her positions she blames Josh Hawley for it because I guess she thinks that he works with James O'Keefe which that's not even true yeah\nYou're confused can we can views about I'm confused the if it's fraud but she did nothing but explain her positions that she's been public about already\nHow was it for oh yeah\nThat was her because she got in trouble because her staff is saying oh yeah we totally take money from Planned Parenthood and all that stuff is ... dressing in the oh no no she doesn't want to ... she's trying to spin this desperately I just think it's a weird she's so desperate to avoid talking about it that she blames the AG she blames Josh Hawley her Republican opponent\nThat's just dumb I mean can just be really Frank for a minute and I do not mean any disrespect to either Josh Hawley or James O'Keefe so do not look at it in that context but let's let's be real James O'Keefe as a barn burner\nThat's what he does Josh Hawley is a super serious lawyer\nJosh is ... is interested Josh Hawley and I don't I've never met him in person ever I've only ever spoken to him\nOn this program and then I had one phone call with him prior to him coming on this program um 'cause every now and then I'll do that I'll just just so I can hear a gifted voice and just say you know thanks for coming on I Do this with some of my guess is can can attest that that I have never spoken to him outside of that\nEver ever\nIf you were if something were to happen and you subpoena my phone records and you look at all my tax and everything I have never spoken to this dude ever\nSaid that one call before he first came on\nAnd there was like a couple of minutes and we mostly talked about you know when I moved from Missouri and then asked him you know about his family and then of course where did you go to high school 'cause it's like a thing anyway but my whole point is that\nThe accusation that he was somehow involved in this is even dumb or when you look at the behavior of both because James is a barn burner and he will jump into the fray\nHolly is a very serious studious lawyer and I'll be real I think that I think that she is so [noise]\nHe is everything that a Democrat like Claire McCaskill would fear\nJosh Hawley he Holly very much support the Trump Administration and he's very much is is in line with the immigration with the tax reform with the trade manufacturing et cetera\nBut he is very uh he's law and order right he's super serious and I almost think that's a negative for him\nHe's just not shrill and over the top he's not he's he's pretty laid back I mean he'll he'll could go out when he needs to but he's just lay back and he wants to get it done\nAnd while people are running around waving their arms trying to distract from one identity politics tactic to the next he just gets it done\nAnd that almost kind of goes against him because a lot of people view that as an mistakenly I think is a lack of charisma and it's not that he doesn't have charisma it's just that he is very serious\nAnd I'm not making this comparison either but I'm just saying no one would sit here and be like John Wayne is a charismatic he just says no charisma because he's so serious no one would\nEver say that just people have different demeanor and that's his demeanor and I seriously doubt that he would have at all a had the time or be had been interested in participating in something like that get real\nTo my knowledge I don't even think he even knows James's crew\nNow there are people in Missouri who do because Missouri back in the day when I Lived there was a the hotbed for activism [noise] uh but I think that was before Holly even came on the scene\nSo the I I think that was just a she lied that was a lie that she said she lied again and she's desperate to spin\nThis says oh no this isn't so much an issue of me lying to voters about how moderate I Am and my staff telling voters that I'm going to I'm totally onboard with impeaching Trump or if\nThe house and Senate somehow change hands to Democrats\nAnd we're just going to tell those moderate voters that supported me to get over it I mean that was literally the quote from her Stafford they have to get over it and her staff or say well she you know support should ... of a ban on some item attic rifles\nNow McCaskill what's weird when she was talking to that reporter she wasn't saying anything that was already not publicly known everyone knows it's just a ... as she supports an assault weapons\nBan but here's the difference she kinda got caught\nWhen you're talking about an assault weapons ban you and I both know that a lot of people on the left use that as the term coming all semi automatic rifles but they know that stain awesome I automatic rifles will scare the crap out of you so they don't say all of a semi automatic rifles they say assault weapons\nSo as to to suggest that they actually only support band and just a couple of kinds of semi automatic rifles but that's really it\nBut that's not what it is they're talking about going after I mean if you look and I have them easily pulled out the two thousand and two wells are all the way through two thousand and sixteen FBI uniformed crime report which was the last collection available and they'll have others coming up I think there's one singular twenty Seventeen report that's been published\nNothing for twenty Eighteen yet but the two thousand a twelve and twenty sixteen report when you look at the breakdown and these are murder victims these are not people who are\nA suicide et cetera uh the vast majority if you're comparing quote unquote assault weapons with I don't know maybe say automobile accidents are hands feet and says those are two and three times a deadlier than just quote unquote assault weapons\nAnd that's according to the FBI zone statistic which is easily available on line by Googling for FBI uniformed crime report to UCR twenty twelve to twenty sixteen they also have it available in a PDF format\nHe'd like to save and keep it you know just for grants and go gold\nBut the bottom line is that it's it's not even it's it there's so many other things that are way deadlier but that's why they don't want to say they they stay assault weapons they don't want to say semi semi automatic rifles because then you when you go after some automatic rifles and you're going to go after some automatic handguns and then you're just going to go after whatever else was left\nThis jak regarding war shady essay every day at Facebook Twitter and online to\nStay connected than\nStanding toasted

like\nColumn and part of it but it was in Texas and this hipster right this crazy hipster dude\nIs walking around tearing up Ted Cruz signs and he's in these baby poop brown pants\nAnd he's got he looks like skinny he looks like meat head from Archie Bunker and he's walking around and he's tearing up these cruise lines and he gets in this guy's face is simply recording of destroying people's private property and then I think he stole someone's beer and walked away I mean it's crazy\nAnd just absolutely on hinged there's just no reason to act like this I think these people some of these people are not so that brings me to destroy that I heard about yesterday\nThis is also nuts so a guy named Mike Stark and he works as a tracker and let me explain it really quick or a tracker there these individuals that work for political campaigns\nAnd what they do is they go around and videotape that candidate everywhere they go simply they Stockton and videotape them everybody uses um you know some are nicer than others I've met someone some Democrat trackers that are perfectly fine this guy's nuts\nBut and I wonder if it's because of he doesn't\nHe works for American bridge twenty first century which was founded by media matters founder David Brock\nAnd it's funded it's it's facilitated and subsidized by George Soros so David Bruck media matters George Soros I mean yeah that's pretty aggressive so he got fired after a report came out that\nAh he has been incredibly aggressive apparently and he\nWas arrested for battery of one of Adam lack salt staff members and lack salt is the Republican gubernatorial candidate in Nevada\nAnd he was hired this dark I was hired by American bridge in January and he was\nFound previously of disorder guilty of disorderly conduct had to pay five hundred dollar fine I'm after an a some sort of all her cage and other Virginia parade with Ed Gillespie I remember that one and I could not believe this was the same do because I just think who keeps hiring the guy who continues to hire this guy this is so crazy\nI mean this is nuts and so\nAh\nAnd other people have been speaking up about him but he said he was arrested for battery against black solves a campaign manager\nA and I mean this is this is crazy a Christian Davis than a was the one who was less quote terrified and traumatized she had bruises on her neck in arms because this guy apparently just got all up in their faces as they were leaving an event\nAnd he's I mean I've seen photos of of Christian and she seems quite diminutive next to this guy who's quite big will Christian joined us on the phone right now to tell us exactly what happened Kristen thanks so much for joining us to share your story this is crazy people are not\nThanks Dana I'm great to be with you yeah it it really you know\nBeen doing this for awhile and um you know both sides have tracker is usually it's a pretty respectful a professional relationship they can near event yesterday to lead a very nice they usually leave 'em and vice versa\nFrom the start this gentleman was you know way more aggressive than I've ever seen 'em before my life you were kind of just standing there and he physically you know came into our group a camera in in ... actual face church chasing us down the hallway\nI'm physically bumping into numbers my staff to myself\nYou know he was even thinking like this is really inappropriate with it but this guy's doing 'em and so we went into a private room and shut the door and this gentleman you know pushed it open I got trapped between the door and the wall\nAnd and my arm kind of twisted behind me and I'm you know he just kept holding on and at that point you know I kept trying to get free get loose about three different\nMale members of my stuff bigger guys and the myself we're trying to pull him away and cannot do it very very large strong guy um and he just kept Pena gripping harder and that that's really when I got scared I'm In I just kept saying please like you're hurting\nI'm calling just stopped I go away and someone get the police um and just really just kept pulling tighter um and saying things like out I'm only you can make this stop you know\nI'll stop hurting your you know basically insinuating that he would stop hurting me if he would talk to them rather than answers questions and so it was very very alarming I'm just a you know I felt unsafe for myself obviously but also for my candidate for my staff\nUm because no one could kinda holding back finally when um the security and and see marshals on site got there they were able to so you know he kind of backed off and the only way he backed off was then and um you know I have a ... for the kitchen I Believe this this just happened\nUm I mean everyone has seen some stuff on the news they just don't\nUm actually no it can happen until you're there there are behind you and you can get free 'em\nOver someone that is trying to scream questions that a candidate because you know that's what his employers paying them to do 'em and you know what I had no idea where he was at the time it was only then after developed him up and said this guy is interested in a bunch of times and it's just I cannot fathom a ...\nAn organization like American bridge keeping this guy in their payroll even just with one arrest a few months ago mhm um yeah and then so I see I Believe they fired him now\nUm but it but my question is why why was he working for them and you know this is what they were paying them to do and you know it's it's kind of it's upsetting because most of us out\nOn campaigns are working for people we believe and we're trying to run campaigns focused on a message\nAnd the other's rhetoric that heats up now and then but that should be you know I I consider myself kind of tough but to actually be scared and really really shake and the rest of the night afterwards um and you know kind of scared to do with her about myself\nI'm it's just something that I've never experienced in in politics before and you know I think when we see\nPeople you know I think like attorney general Eric Holder was here campaigning with our opponent just a few weeks ago and he's saying you know kick them when they're down and see here 'cause like ... saying you know don't be civil like these are things that encourages this kind of stuff and there's no place for it\nAnd no and there are there isn't it\nAnd he was ... and as I understand it he was arrested for battery\nAnd you're at or ... you and you're going to press charges\nCould yeah um and so I was it's been kind of a whirlwind of the day just trying to get my bearings back and so you know my my my focus is you know we get back to work I Want to ... at the camera a moving and gifts when\nI'm so that that process um you know we will be a court date and all of that um and so we will um yeah no I I fear as I started wondering what I don't want to happen to anyone again\nWhy could yeah exactly and because he has a history you mentioned that this has happened before this happened several times with him before\nHe he was taken to the ground by police and he was arrested because of his uh behavior towards candidate Ed Gillespie this was back during the Republican gubernatorial race in Virginia", "show_name": "The Dana Show", "year": "2018", "city": "San Antonio", "day": "19"}
