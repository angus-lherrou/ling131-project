approaching yet another one where people who have been told that the color of their skin or their orientation or their sex\nThat determines what party they vote for\nAnd Democrats will say well we're the ones who are really not protections for you will really what are you doing in terms of protections\nYou do a couple of things about bathrooms and you support like pronoun usage but what are you doing for their businesses what are you doing for their health care\nYou're making it harder for them you're you're increasing their taxes you're making it more difficult for women business owners like unemployment's at an all time low that didn't happen under a black president\nI'm just\nI mean you could argue when it happened all you want to it happened after tax reform\n\nAnd you would have taken that would have been wonderful to see I don't care who's president I Want lower taxes period I Want a healthy economy period but the point is for all of the discussion about catering to specific demographics\nThe party that parade that as their identity the most\nDo the most harm to those demographics economically in terms of foreign policy\nI mean you're really you're really gonna work\nAnd and give money to a country like Iran to execute people for being gay\nUh come on\nSo this is what I've always you know I and I look at my friend Bruce and now here his social media accounts and that's the privately controlled public square and it's kind of a weird\nFor anything but he was suspended because honestly I think it's because he's a gay conservative because he does not say\nI mean there are people who stay horrible things that people who've told me that I should die and that I should be shot their accounts are still up they're gay patriots has gone Jeremiah Wright who says the most awful hurtful things\nAnd the most anti Semitic stuff that I just I'm shocked at\nIt I mean it's like I just want to go it's twenty Eighteen you know ... I mean this is a guy who idolizes Hitler and has said\nSuch his account is allowed to he's still on there and he says this stuff any posts it\nBut a patron is permanently banned\nSo I have to ask what does the less find more threatening a raging anti Semite who says horrible things about Jewish people who says horrible\nThings about women too by the way saying that apparently were not intelligent enough to be involved in men's matters\nOr somebody like a patriot who simply a gay conservative and has never been derogatory on social media they find that more threatening that tells you everything

voting for universal background checks in a country that loses\nThirty thousand people to gun violence several years and follow the money in each of these cases if you look at the political action committee contributions to Senator Cruz it helps to explain\nThe reasons for his ... and how corrupt in Congress has become I don't take that back when he's not a gun\nOr actually you do you take it through the tax oh my gosh welcome back into shown to be the last that was from that some of the Texas Senate debate last night\nAnd I watched it like I said I watched it because I actually wanted to figure out where he how I wanted to see how far left he was actually\nAnd what I determined was that he knows nothing even less than John Snow it's crazy but he and he did you toast trying to get every talking point in there and I and he kept talking only with his right hand which made me really just don't like a symmetrical things like that it needs to be you need to use both hands\nAnd just know anyway um but I did\nIt was it was really interesting uh in watching that because with that when when he says he doesn't take pac money no he he accepts money through packs there's not really a difference and he was asked also well how's he going to do handle border security and has the answer legit was to [noise]\nUm well just um build a stronger\nBridge to Mexico we need to spend money on infrastructure\nOh okay he\nSaid lower taxes are are are driving the deficit which best actually government spending you keeping more of your money isn't costing the government anything the government spending more money than it takes in is what is costing her daughter um\nAnd he was rude he was just rude and and just yeah listen to tent listen to audio somebody tent this was crazy oh no wait no not listen to eight this is how nasty he got listened to a\n... not going to be honest with you is going to make up positions and votes that I've never held ever to dishonest for the call them ... and it's why the nickname so because it's true\nWell OK then give us an example he also said that he would be willing to work with President Trump except he already called for the impeachment of President Trump Beto O'Rourke called for the impeachment of Trump several weeks ago\nSo how are you going to work with him when you called them impeach him and he said it\nRepeatedly and then he and then the moderators last night they suck there were horrible the moderator sort of Texas in a debate last night you guys were bad really bad first off you asked the stupidest question number one number two you kept interrupting people\nTed Cruz mostly but both of them really and even when they're time wasn't up because I'm the crazy person that starts the clock whenever they start talking because I Want to see what the moderators do\nAnd multiple times they interrupted candidates before the clock I'd run out I've moderated Senate debates before so I Know exactly you know they've stopped\nThere were horrible is one of the worst it was just it wasn't one of the worst ... and it was pretty bad and I take it back is pretty bad\nAh and\nThen there was audio soundbite tennis was how nasty he was check this out\n\nReally interesting to hear you talk about it ... circus after six years in the U.S Senate I'm listening um if if you have this special relationship with President Trump um and then were is the result of that I'm On were all talk\nAnd no ... on the tariffs that the president as loving the trade wars that you've entered this country into the sorting no state more than it's hurting Texas\nI mean ... is he going to say that's like a rhetorical tech he has it's really annoying\nStop it stop saying I'm I'm I'm a\nStop it I I don't even know what his point was there he just wanted to get an insult in\nUsing the his last six years in the Senate somehow what he's asking for the results of his relationship with Trump and if you can't point to everything economic\nI mean with jobs including how things were handled with Hurricane Harvey ... specifically in the state of Texas um that's the messaging Ted Cruz should be but they do just clearly doesn't even know you just rather would slam without facts than deal with facts\nHe's not going to share thirty million dollars that he raises other Democrat Senate candidates as well\nBut I but socialism though but the socialism\nBut I Do love that he said I work with anytime that anywhere anytime anywhere benefit Texans but how does he does do that when he was called the impeach Trump but he actually said his response to his plan on border security was to spend more and it's a structure quote our bridges that connect us to Mexico and ... oh man\nYou're talking about we have a problem with money\nAnd here's the other thing cruise actually noted that beta O'Rourke Robert or work\nHis support for the ten dollar per barrel oil tax\nAnd or work beta responded by calling Cruz ... on the line ... came after this because Ted Cruz accurately noted that Beto O'Rourke supported a ten dollar per barrel oil tax which is going to translate to about twenty four percent or twenty twenty four cents per gallon increase in fuel price [noise] yeah\nAnd people out there were stupid and didn't know what the hell they were talking about some one person said no his vote with no to the tax but it wasn't because of the bill title that he voted no on and I conveniently and helpfully linked the vote\nWas called quote ... it was it was the bill title was expressing the sense of Congress opposing the president's proposed ten dollar tax\nOn every barrel of oil and he voted no because he supported a ten dollar tax on every barrel of oil so I just think it's it's hysterical that was so funny for me\nTo see him kind of go back and forth on that but he got mad when Ted Cruz pointed that out and then he started name calling beta or work started name calling when Cruz accurately pointed out hey\nIt's a ten dollar you wanted a ten dollar per barrel oil tax as you wanted and he said oh so which was super funny\nSo anyway uh this um I just I've watched it and I [noise]\nHe's just bad and speaking of Texas Tech check

afraid of the popular outcry\nWere energized by it and that sort of help us do our job and do it better\nMm what that Tim Kaine Hillary Clinton's running mate she's not afraid of the popular outcry what does that mean meaning he's from the unpopular so ...\nYeah I don't know I'm no clue no clue ah okay well\n[laughter] go fight in the streets maybe not the best thing right now\nYou know I mean
