sound bar is a is a convenience more than great audio you know that I mean ideally you'd have for but who has a space for this or you'd have a left right center channel so that's three speakers in the front you'd have a ... outcome was somewhat first and then\nTo get the full surround sound you have to speakers cut up at your ear distance from the TV left and right as this rounds and then some people even have at most they were firing speakers they have a rear surround that go behind you\nA trans how serious you are about ... ... is great because TVs generally come with awful out those videos you the sound on that right it sounds like birth to her for her broker yeah it's\nVery it's very flat in in my living in the fact it pretty large my couch I Would say\nEasily may be anywhere from Fifteen feet away from the TV thought it's very difficult to ear\nYeah ... yeah so that's kind of a\n... that's one of the things you get with a barge get much richer sat and much louder south a scot will consider home theater gigs always recommending the videos if if\nIf if you don't want to spend a thousand dollars on a salad bar and you certainly can poke audio and others have very expensive sound ... if you're going to spend that kind of money I don't do you know let's wiring is an issue or don't do it down but\nBut if you want to spend about a hundred and fifty dollars busy you as a very nice sound bar with a subway for wireless sub woofer which gives you a nice rich sound\nAnd with the sound bars they have multiple speakers in their their bars that go along the entire bottom of the screen and often have seven or eight speakers in there which means that can simulate surround this\nThe one I'm looking at the visit us be thirty eight Twenty one is the thirty eight is it is it's like thirty eight inches wide so it's almost as wide as your your TV [noise] and it sounds great I think it's and it's a hundred and fifty bucks\nBut at that that's pretty good right there you're appreciated yeah my pleasure yeah I mean I\nLike I said you can spend my wife bought a a a boat was a sound bar plus sub offer\nAnd it had a kind of a navy receiver and all that jazz and it ended up being a twenty five hundred dollars which is just said this before we were married I probably would have stopped or if if you're going to if you want to spend that kind of money you'd really benefit from having\nAn Avi receiver that's the first cost and that's about three or four hundred dollars and then for anywhere from a thousand to Fifteen hundred dollars you can get a five point one surround system so it sounds so much better so much better speaking of\nYou know we're going to do are going to change microphones 'cause I I thought I'd steal Heather's microphone I'm getting paid for paid back for it\nBecause her microphones a little buzzy oh it just got better a little bit let me take another call and I'm gonna switch microphones while we do that a back to line one market in Grand Rapids Michigan mark\nI live a good to talk to my friend [noise] I'm a I'm thinking I made a mistake about three months ago when I went back to a contest for TV [noise]\nYeah what happened just so you you were what were you doing before Comcast\n\nA TV we were string\nWe cut a quarter you said I don't want cable I'm going to save money I'm going to get everything over the Internet or over the tough as they did that save your money just out of curiosity\nSaved me quite a bit of money on me about a hundred and twenty dollars ... ... ... ... an antenna put on the house and that was good\nBut that's the best deal and television is over the air if you could do it\n[noise] yeah well that's why I went back contest they started having the big problems with the uh am tell yeah so anyway Comcast you get a little itchy and also they're given some really good deals elsewhere content or TV\nI remember I here's the deal income catch if you could recover cast also if you go into the office because they have offices\nAre often they're like storefronts and a Ted Talk to the human [laughter]\nOr ... or you can often get a great deal they have wonderful offers but the trick is the only uh you know work for the first year and then all of a sudden you build doubles so the trick and I asked I asked the woman she said yeah we we always have something just keep coming back before the for the years out\nAsk for the new deal\nYeah so that's just something to keep in mind [noise]\nYeah I got a really good deal for ten years actually you're the one you're caches HBO Showtime them so much for yourself\nA member of the ... yeah you got but it's all just got to pay attention to it so but what's the ... but now are you glad are you sorry what you said you had some issues\nOn one issue is the remote we got the fish and then I'll get I Love that ... that you can talk to by the way that's great\nThat is a nice feature yeah Comcast is working hard with the ex one system so we're to compete with you know really what is a threat to their business model which is people like you court cutters so they they they want to make sure they're offering something for that extra hundred twenty bucks\nA pretty good anyways the other day you know they use them for the Internet forever the other day I woke up and no Internet connection\nDo you go to a browser and wanted to activate right listen to the table right if you will not afterward I have an air is us the surfboard sixty one forty one box was three\nIs that is that yours or that that one the Comcast provided you have your own\nYes it's my\nJob I like those air is so here's what the the way this all works uh the cable company sends us say say they spend a little signal down to the modem to activate it ah and you can I think you found that there is a website where you press a button and supposedly it does that\nYeah but if that doesn't work then you need to call the service rep and say hey it's not activating and they can do some things now I've had a number of different things come up that make a difference it's funny because it was working right\nThrough and um it's kind of you know and just a pain you gotta keep going through it do you have do you write Harley says well no no no\nBut it's like that isn't it like your breath on my own personal highly um well I uh I don't know what else\nTo do you know bad capacitors would have the same thing and that was a\nProblem for a while but I think those have been pretty much a solved as well um\n[noise] boy I you know you ... usually\nIf the mother board has issues you know there's a perhaps the ram is not being seen you'll get posts code she'll get beep some groups but it sounds like you're not getting the power on self test you kind of it's freezing right at that point\nRight [noise] yeah and I don't you know ...\nOff the top of my head I don't have a good solution for you on that one anybody in the chat room or listening wants to call in and make some suggestions is not it's not posting I think because uh it's it's stopping at the post otherwise you'd get something you get you get sounds at least so\nIt didn't have any little uh other trouble like a like log files are ...\nBy not getting a log files so there's nothing to look at [laughter] uh\nYou you know I'd refreshed the bios or you know make sure maybe maybe it could be the bio

and they say don't on\nPlug it if you do so and so it may be that that's that that's what's happened 'cause it sounds like that's not getting run at its it's freelance by\nThe only thing I haven't done is maybe just re installed the ... or more if you\nCan yeah I Would certainly try that\n[noise] All right well good luck might yeah used to be I mean this is a fun\nThing to do as a hobby to

E. R. K. dot com and you know you it's pretty clear what's going on as soon as you go to a site like this\nYou're doing something you're seeing ads most of the time and if you do enough of that they make\nMoney because they can charge the advertiser and they send you some small amount it's kind of like if you have a cash back credit card right and you get one or two percent back\nWell of course you get one or two percent back as a credit card companies charging the merchant five percent they're giving you a little bit on the side they're making money too that's a win win you know that's great doesn't cost you anything except maybe some time some attention\nSo it's important though to understand and if somebody wants something more than that if they ever ask you this is the classic con game [noise] and this is this this is the unfortunate thing is ... con games that worked in real life\nAre now in a in the Internet world\nAnd they're ... what's funny is does the same games they're the same games they're just change the Nigerian prince scam\nThings like that they've been going on for years in real world and now the Internet's just given them a whole bunch of new ways to play the game there's a wonderful book it a highly recommend are called the confidence game why we fall for it\nEvery time [laughter] it's by a a a wonderful woman named Maria ... Copa I've actually interviewed her on this game it's a great book and it's about modern cons and their relationship to\nThe old cons breeze a fascinating person she's actually become a poker champion she's reading a new book about\nUp high stakes poker in order to do that [laughter]\nShe's a become a poker chair and she's brilliant brilliant\nBut her book the confidence game is a great read if you want to kind of\nUnderstand I'm sure that's been excerpted magazines you could probably find it on what parts of it on line to understand these old games and how they're you know the pigeon drop games do you ever see the sting or ... I Love I Love con men a lot of great movies and books about Conn but\nThey're just all of those games have made it to the Internet and new kind of clothing but the same exact idea and in general\nIf I were to generalize all of these games play on one thing your greed\nSomething for nothing so that's the that's the alarm bells something for nothing as the alarm bell\nIn general things like the pigeon drop require in the long run you to give them money in order to get more money back that's how the Nigerian prince scam works for instance you ever get that email sure you have\nA low I'm a Nigerian prince I have twenty million dollars I Need to get it out of the country fast and I need to help somebody in America\nI'm going to get in return for which I'll give you ten percent but if you answer those emails eventually they're going to say you need to put some money in my account just to pay for transit fees or whatever they're going to get money out of you so all of these kinds of games in the long run\nWill take your money but the way they do it is by promising you something for nothing so just don't fall for that you know that you're you're smart and the the just be aware of the Internet is bringing these wonderful\nFun things into your home as we entered late stage predatory capitalism\nBut there's some of this is fine you know if if you use Facebook can you love face but you get a lot of Facebook you know that the information you're giving them they're using to sell ads\nThat's fine that's a fair trade as long as you're doing it with eyes wide open same thing with Google we get so much value out of things like Facebook Google Twitter Instagram\nThey're all free well but there's something there there's a way they're making money 'cause they're not free for the guys who run those companies as expensive so what are they making how they're doing it generally it's advertising speaking of which is wonderful show absolutely free but [laughter]\nThat's only

I don't know all the details to it but I'm basically the question of if I get to DVR replace\nAdult replacing the DVR and please [laughter] that's going to cost you so much money for a sub optimal solution I I think she's got a uh she should write the whole thing off\nA the camera records to a DVR by some cable that she's got attached to the cameras that comes into the business is that it\nYeah and it's all connected on I mean her network I mean her home network and everything so she was able to you it remotely [noise]\nSo I just want to know is there some kind of like a like an app or we can have our own home set up and be able to view it they're like a certain apps without having to go through other services [noise]\nWell if you're going to do it on an app over the Internet it's got to be stored somewhere [noise] um is there is is it a privacy concern or is it a costs concern\n[noise] all the above okay um I think you could trust nest they're not looking at the video I'm the\nAs far as costs a I think it's it's considerably more for we've already spent more money on this thing then you'll spend over you know five years on a mess up the picture is going to be better I just don't know the brand that she has a I'm not sure he again what you\nKnow name yeah sure what you're trying to do you say you you ... the guy says well if you could tell me the era message I can fix it and she can't see the message because she's not seeing the video is that the problem\nYeah Ali hook up to him because it has an H M I advocate\nFor allowing hook up aged because that's how she used to have it connected to her old TV she gave her old TV to me sell because that these are\nWithout work anymore with getting I Am at the edge but now she wants to see what the error was age she and my only connect it to her computer monitor and um you know displaced so I'm thinking that might be something wrong with by age ...\nKind of fight just throw this thing out believe you're going to spend\nMore money trying to figure out what's wrong and you're going to get a sub optimal solution anyway and it's going to break again um there are so many companies that do this my recommendation would be to look at ... dot com ring dot com or they don't have outdoor cameras at a wise came which is the least expensive\nBut I've got these wise camps everywhere they're so inexpensive\nI actually have one pointing out a window it can then it's indoor so that's okay but if she doesn't have a window I Would go to nest dot com get a ... they have outdoor nest cameras that worked fabulously\nOr you can see what's going on at all times you'll get alerts on your smartphone you don't have a DVR because they store the video is so much better uh all ... as long as she's got why it'll work just fine and Janine somewhere to plug it\nBut obviously she's got that for the old\nSystem or if you go to the wire cutter dot com and you look at their recommendations for the best outdoor security cameras\nThey also say ... outdoor hundred sixty five dollars for the camera hundred sixty five dollars from Amazon that's you know that's going to be less than ...\nThan fixing that DVR and you can get multiple cameras if you want to ... uh two hundred eighty dollars on Amazon and then she pays the nest service I Can't remember what it is it's not not horribly expensive and it's great because well I'll give\nYou an example we were um we were in Japan or last spring and I was just looking at the camera see what's going on in the front yard and I saw my mailbox I have one of those rural mailboxes had been knocked over I thought oh man so I go back\nAnd I was able to find exactly what happened at a car plowed into it did a little more research I have a doorbell camera from ring I was able to see the person coming getting out of the car wringing our doorbell Oh nice she wanted to get it fixed I figured out who it was it was the\nWoman delivering newspapers next door and she was rolling up newspapers and she wasn't paying attention she planning her mailbox\n\nTalk to her I said don't worry about it we wanted a new mailbox anyway but I have a complete record that I Can't tell you how useful it is I have several outdoor cameras a we have outdoor cameras here as well at the studio and it's and it's not expensive and it's so much better so all of these old systems where you had the big old thing that looks like a ... a camcorder\nAnd the wiring and it's going into a DVR which is recording and looping over and over again all of this is completely\nObsolete uh I think it's just nutty just to just to\nPut any more money into it because I can guarantee you it's going to cost you more\nThan a getting a a given that security camera hundred sixty five dollars a done you have to have wife by and you have to have power or you plug it in um it's it was pretty easy to install you know takes takes submitted to install comes with all the screws and stuff\nThe other one if you want lights the ring dot com they sell 'em\nThere and as I said they're spots of our podcast they sell a flood light camera that has a camera in slow like always work at night or the ring you have a microphone and the speaker and an alarm that you can bring you could talk to people if there's somebody outsiders store they because they get out of here you have kids and that scares the heck out of

number back to the phones we go and line one Daniel in Long Beach\nHi Daniel Daniel yeah I mean I'm like oh you're Daniel let's make that clear okay are you from are you familiar with Web design a yes I Am\nYou know to get what ... what are the minimum ... all the different languages like when\nYou want to become a Web designer Daniel is that your goal\nI'm thinking about it and yeah I something on the side so\nEarly days of the Web or a Web page and actually it's still true today when you actually look at the ... what they called the source code of the Web page a Web page\nIs composed of a couple of different things HTML which stands for hypertext markup language is the kind of the fundamental the route language of a website and it's it's markup language which means it's very simple it says this text should be bold this text should be a Talib size this texture be big\nThis is an image this image should linked to this when you click on this text you should go to this Web page that kind of thing that's HTML [noise]\nAh yes yes that was added later it stands for cascading style sheets and the idea was you could encapsulate information credible it in a way it's like a macro language you could say whenever I use this HTML tag what I mean is this ... this type size this kind of thing\nAnd see us that's been used it increasingly to style pages the whole idea nowadays a website is you want to separate the contents of the website from the display from the layout of the website and the early days we pushed it altogether you'd have\nYou know HTML tags followed by text followed by more tags and you could actually do that in a text editor we've gone way beyond that some modern websites almost always have a data back in which has the text the images the contents of the site\nAnd then information about how to display that which will include three different kinds of things HTML is still there\nA CSS the style sheets still there and then the third and nowadays most important part is job a script almost all Web pages today use of programming language called job a script to do the fancier sings animations sliding menus hidden things\nAre a lot of that is done in job a script\nNow in order to so really if you say what language should I learn to do Web design it's those three HTML CSS those are the fundamental things you need to know those\nAnd then job a script is the ... is a true programming language\nThat all Web browsers understand the job a script typically stored on the server as he's the HTML the CSS and the data and by the way the data's usually started a data base right that things like the text the links the images those are stored in a database so you need to understand databases a little bit\nAnd if you want to get into Web design today you're probably going to be learning something called frameworks these our Web frameworks that help you design a interactive pages the most one of the most popular\nWidely used ... came from Facebook it's called react that's a job a script framework so you'll be doing job a script\nBut you'll be using libraries from react Twitter has its own a Google has its own\nAnd there are many languages you can use in fact you know for instance when I write Web pages I generally don't write directly in job a script because for years job a script was a nightmare languages actually settled down quite a bit but for years it was just awful\nAnd so I Will use a tool that will be interpreted as a job a script something like closure you could do that with go or ... variety of other languages and then you don't have to write a java scripts but if you but you need to understand those fundamental tickets\nOh jeez so if you and your spare time you'd like to say yeah I think it would be by the way a great skill\nUh there's there's kind of three groups of things you need to do one is that programming thing java scripts CSS HTML you need to understand those\nThe other is the database you need to understand database design how you call databases how you interact with databases 'cause that's where the content is stored\nAnd the third part and often these are different people doing this but if you really if you want to do a Web design if you want to become a Web designer and I have a little shop you know people hire you\nThe third part is design you need to learn design you needed to learn how to make a Web page look good had to make it usable I mean design includes not only how it looks but how people use it and we\nSpent a court I'll give you an example here we spend a quarter of a million dollars for my pod cast website which you can go look at AT T W. I. T.\nDot TV the company that designed this is in Austin they're called for kitchens they had a designer was a graphic specialist he helped choose the Fox design the logos to lay out things like that they had a programmer actually that three or four programmers who did the job a script in the CSS [noise]\nThey have we have a database that is a back and written in a in a attire Lee different content management system you're going to hear this term a lot too and Web design C. M. S. called triple word presses is EMS Google's blog spot as a C. M. S. ...\n... stores all the data in my ... database delivers it it also offers a programmers interface which then the job of script can talk to to create a page\nThat the judge dodge job a script is living on a server uh called her Roku that's where a lot of uh pages written in angular which is another ... framework live a it's cashed on another server called red is\nWe use read his labs for that and the data itself is that a third server at black mash that's running group all and that's all to create one website\nSo you could see this can got very complex and very expensive uh and and big businesses are going to probably do this but it ... the other way to go if you're interested in like maybe I Want to help maybe I Want to charge a restaurant down the street or my my local dry cleaner I Want to make a site for them\nThe other way to go is to become an expert in something like WordPress dot com\nOr because you can then say well I have I Am a WordPress developer I Know exactly how WordPress works and I will create a site for you using WordPress you can do that with square space blog spot WordPress", "show_name": "Leo Laporte", "year": "2018", "city": "Newton", "day": "21"}
