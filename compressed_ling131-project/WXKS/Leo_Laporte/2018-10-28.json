Rhode Island nice to see you welcome [laughter] your memory sure it is [noise] remember I'm the guy who ... it's amazing that call with the phone dialing out came today while I'm sitting on hold\nIt's there before you get into it and and at first responders know how to do with the problem is there's so many different Android phones and the rules for how to do this very depending on which Android\nPhone you have I think that is a big deal [noise] um I don't know if there's a standard way to do it anymore they're used to be on handwriting or they're in the early days\n[noise] uh you know I'm One way to do it in in you and you and you\nThis will depend very much much Andrea they have Samsung's for instance have owner and owner info section\nThat when the phone is locked will scroll across the wrong and at least that would give them some information or you can also in a Samsung phone update your profile and the contacts happen you'll notice there's medical information in there\nAnd then you can also a set ice emergency contacts I think that there by default and stamps our phones\nSo you want to add that it's very important but but look at the locks screened message most if not all unfortunately many Android phones have a lock screen message and you could put information there if nothing\nElse put a a contact phone number because as I said the first responders that's the thing they tell me that they\nAnd if you're a first responder uh let me know if I'm wrong on this but I've talked to a couple and they said look what we really wanted that emergency contact number so at the very least you know put that in your lock screen message you could say ice in a\nPhone number and people will know what that means the first responders will know\nAnd if you don't have that feature the one last thing you can do and this is true on any\nPhone you know you have a lock screen image the thing that shows up\nYou can use it at a photo editor without lock screened image it puts them information they're now remember everybody will be able to everybody\nWill be able to see that [noise] but uh so you know consider that but uh almost ... almost ... screen image and the very least you could do you know in just if you do I see that in case of emergency people know what that means and then a\nPhone number that's getting Ninety percent of the way they're going to that person\nWas labs or I should just do my friends to get an iPhone\nYeah yeah this is something Apple's done really really well um [noise] I Wish every I don't you know handwriting problems Andrade is not unlike Iowa is not a unified ecosystem is lots of different Android phones and lots of different ways to do it [noise] so on the iPhone summer I've\nThis summer I was at amusement park and the older culture and my phone started ringing so when I when I got off I went and looked at it and it was a local call and I thought well maybe it is my hotel I better call it so I called and I get the police\nAnd they said we just had an emergency calls from this phone wow I said oh my God\nNo I just had it in my pocket you know I must\nHave done it I'm so sorry the rollercoaster hey [laughter] she goes are you on the intimidate or I go yes I Am she goes oh good our GPS [laughter]\nPay knew exactly where you were\nAnd you know there probably are going down the big hill it's scary\nEnough you could have had a heart attack on that thing I ... and maybe they maybe [laughter] maybe they knew yeah they are yeah I boy I'm you're exactly right tell everybody you know and everybody in your men's\nGroup that is a very especially as we get to a certain age that's a very important thing to have on there as you're in case of emergency information [noise]\nUh but unfortunately with Android phones there's no single way to do it as so Samsung phones do have a way and other phones if you at least in the lock screen put it in a large screen message or on the screen as a as a text\nWhy should it takes a lot\nMy pleasure I might look here's somebody saying [noise] uh I'm going to look on my pixel phone which is kind of the default\nI'm Android phone to me saying that they also have an ice entry under contacts some of the search for I see you know all I'm getting is ice cream stores [laughter]\nThat's not going to help by heart health [laughter] yeah it's really a great idea 'cause we all know how phones are in our pockets all the time I'm In\nA it's a good thing just remember if you do put it on the screen message or edit the photo but watching a photo with the phone

time trash for ... yeah\n[noise] so they they they mentioned in this uh in a scholarly paper that the number of an age funded studies investigating the use of E R for pain management has doubled\nOr this you know they're ... they're you know one of the techniques is biofeedback you know deep breathing with stuff that we know is already worked but using VR a or B R plus hypnosis VR plus breathing exercises\nSeem to have some some results I've also seen V. are used in treatment of Pete TST post traumatic stress disorder\nAnd that seems to also be a effective I you know I always would caution VR is the hottest thing in technology today and so I always caution a little bit uh you know when it's the the the flavor of the month that you know there's [noise]\nBut I does it is very interesting I I see the the uh the article that you're referring to 'em and it's certainly a lot better than opioids and opioid addiction but you're right the getting getting getting that are getting that software is an interesting a challenge and\nMy guess is that none of these techniques work without a doctor present\nYou know it's not something you could take home and and do 'em uh there's also an article on plus a scholarly article um the impact of virtual reality and chronic pain that could put that in the show to us as well so there's\nThere's a lot of studies on this and they sleep they seem to agree that it does help but you know almost anything helps [laughter] I think if I if\nIt's not just the flavor of the ... because they mention hunter Hofmann Lewis evidently a VR pioneer\nYeah orange to

... ... ... ... it's it's coming into regularly use including some other hospitals the\nPlots article or the impact of virtual reality on the chronic pain or comes from I'm not sure where but they talk about the software that they are used in this study\nThe VR application is called cool with an exclamation mark it's an interactive Journey Through a fully immersive three hundred and sixty

S. yes that has\nThe money on it and uh I Would like to tell you the story behind three of those pictures awesome you you might enjoy that so the first one uh I made a short cut shift you have to come such and zero one okay and\nIt's a photo off\nOf clouds at night over the ... which is kind of the central square the the markets and ... were you were there we spent the evening there we we walked around\nAnd then the Mona ... pretty much the last half hour we look back\nAnd that was his big white cloud over that space and even that big white cloud was lightning wow and it it it it was a flash every I don't know ten seconds it was really amazing kind of thing to see and\nI thought I have to\nKind of document this in some ways so I took the iPhone out and they shot the video of it but I also of course had my DSL are with me and I ended up well the ... trying to figure out how can I shoot this I didn't have a tripod I didn't have a [noise] um the anything to put the camera on so\nAnd it's dark right I mean it's nighttime\nAnd his nighttime so there were some lights down a lot on the ground but ... now do we capture that and the people wave enough light and without missing a\nCondition way what Helen genius or a milking at it right now and this guy's got a bright lightning bolts of them are but the people are on the ground that dark the city if you've got different exposed how did you do it well\nIt's one photo so it's not an a a montage of one single photo and\nI thought okay I how can I get this lightning and of course you get lightning by using the longer exposure [noise] um but then on the other hand how do you make the lightning but how do you make the exposure not so long that you cannot handle it anymore and I decided on a fifth of a second\nOh and a fifth of the second is kind of still\nHandhold ... with a wide angle lens that I use um which I knew would get some motion into the people which isn't the problem I it probably that's a bit of a flavor got a picture on my back and just keep shooting burst wow as in\n... to one of the ... second moment she'll get a lightning bolt I took ... uh no I took two hundred pictures how to get this one so I uh filled up part of my card [laughter] wow and when I\nCame when I came back I looked at the moment that was the one photo that worked out so that was that was just I'm so happy because that is the photo that does is it something that doesn't happen you know that doesn't happen it won't happen I won't see something like that again in the rest of my life I'm pretty sure about that so\nEvery photographer I think has that one shot that was just perfect timing and what's good thing to remember is you had to take a lot of pictures to get that one I think that's awesome oh yeah but I Love it very nice\nOkay the second one uh when I talk about his ... dot com slash zero to\nYeah and it's a picture of camels in the desert in the sunrise then it it's it's a it's a silhouette and to the sun is just raising behind them between defeat of one of the camels there's clouds in the sky and\nIt it's just is kind of a magical light and a magical moment [noise] and ah of course the things you up influence over in a shock like this is\nThe time when you're there so we knew we knew when the sunrise would be a you have influence over your location from where did you shoot it so you have to make sure to to uh shoot this from a low angle to to get a nice ... camels um you have influence over the focal length\nLike how many millimeters to shoot shot really wide angle 'cause I wanted that that big sky and there you have influence over the exposure in this case I made it a a ... a silhouette so I chose the according exposure\nThere's ... which you know the when the sun gets these little ... little star shape um you can do this by shooting with a very small aperture and the only thing you don't really have been twins overall camels people and where they are [laughter] or do you\n[laughter] what ...\nWhat did you tell them okay lead the camels this way I'm going to be there\nWill do that for you it's an easy thing to do it a couple of ways to do it one would be to get into uh the uh uh ... windows recovery menu so while you're booting up tap F eight in the recovery menu\nYou'll click on trouble shoot advanced options and get into the automatic repair menu and then there's a tool called boot wreck dot E.
