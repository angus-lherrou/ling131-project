Morgan's Wonderland in San Antonio his daughter has special needs\nAnd she was on vacation about Twenty years ago he is is a wealthy man he ... he retired and he was on vacation with his daughter and who has special needs and she was playing in a pool with some kids\nAnd when ... when her daughter tried to play catch with the with the kids they just dropped the ball and got out and he said he just couldn't take that look on her face of a disappointment\nSo he decided that there was no place in the world that had a place for people with special needs and and who don't want to come together so he treated this water park\nThirty six million dollars in San Antonio and it's twelve percent of the population has special needs and America that's born out of three ... oh yeah it's so now what hit the big the big thing was that you know for kids who are electric or in a wheelchair that powered by either electric battery or they have a breathing machine\nThey could never get it wet so they had to figure out how to create\nA wheelchair that was that ... wanted work wheelchair oh my God they did it and they did it like that but by using compressed air wow and now what were they need your help is they're trying to build a camp for for ... with us headline and their ... and there are there and they're having a hard time right now trying to figure out how they can\nDo is lined with kids in wheelchairs breathing apparatus that that is so cool but you got to watch a video of creating a post right\nNow I'm time magazine actually not time magazine time magazine named one of the world's greatest places\nBut New York times did an amazing video on it and I'll I'll I'll tweet it or put a check in the chat room but this guy is amazing he really the guy said brother or the United states but anyway um if anyone has any advice on that that would be great advice\nOh it I'd have to figure out how to get kids with wheelchairs up on a zip line\nOh his line oh that yeah well they're pretty they're pretty good because they figured out how to get them on a on a water slide wow as yeah line\nBut they don't need to take the wheelchair on a zip line or do you I think you do so you want to share with them yeah that's interesting\nVery huh so what are you going to try that out and it's such a neat idea Morgan's in wonderland in San Antonio Texas for ... magazine yeah\nThen you got to look at the New York Times' video but anyway um so then because we're so close to London six hour flight we came over here to see now at least family I said I can I can work anywhere I Am I'm fortunate\nI'm so he flew British Airways have nonstop flight six hours or like sixty five people on our triple seven ... I Love it because then you could spread out a fire in the face on roe [laughter] basically he did and um\n[noise] so anyway here's another website for you is is um if you want to be treated like a celebrity I don't know if you've ever seen celebrities go through airports by sea to all the time in LA\nWhen they department they transfer or when they arrive\nThey just get whisked through and so now I figured out how they do it a company approached me and they said try it out and then it's called um black lane pass blacks Elaine pass\nSo black when I talked about them before because they do a car service real good car service but now they have this past where they do in five hundred airports worldwide\nThey will scorched you so it was perfect for my mother in law 'cause my mother in law was meeting us in London but she was flying into Heathrow were planning to get wick and she's a little bit of a nervous traveler so I arranged for her to be for a hundred dollars\nSomeone was waiting to moments he stepped off the plane so he got a website leader but you don't have to sign up ahead of time no with no clear is different clears for um security in certain airports\nThis is so when she landed in London literally when they open up the door there was a there was a person they're holding a sign what's her name by say grab their bags they walk through they cut the line for on immigration so she'd have to wait an hour and immigration lines\nThat I think they got to deal with the costs they had to order exactly wow and then they get your bags\nAnd then they go through customs and then you get they put you in a car if you order a car you can order carpet black lane or wherever you whenever transportation you want you can take a bus but they'll put you on there and she was like when we arrived she's like that was the best thing ever 'cause I've been ... I'd never felt like this\nAnd again so it's perfect for people who are either nervous or business travelers who don't want to\nI Would do this for my mom does not want to fly since eighty five years old she doesn't want to fly in her real fears that confusion once you're on the plane it's fine it's the confusion getting on and off she's you know she's really getting lost or whatever so this will be a great\nThing what a couple of years ago I had my dad fly from LA he met me in Budapest and he had to go LA London Budapest\nAnd I wish this was available I knew about it because I was so worried about him getting long lunch and yeah and yeah I I had he not oh I get lost in Heathrow it's a nightmare [noise] yes and um so anyway this is a perfect thing for business travelers for families\nIt's each the price a difference but it's usually around a hundred dollars per person\nThey often have more features they uh they do things to improve your caught activity over time as they observe what you're doing all of these things make it a better wife I experience for most people\nThere is one downside Amish a plume started they started charging you a yearly subscription or a monthly fee\nAnd and the idea is well look we want to keep this up to date will want to keep developing it we want to keep improving it and we're not and that's the problem right when you bought a forty dollar links this route or links is just wipe their hand and said thanks good luck\nI followed by and so uh I think it's not inappropriate for router company to say look\nWe ... you know we have additional features you can pay for eroding our one of our sponsors does that as well and I pay for the euro plus\nSign up box and you get a lot of extra stuff including a password manager of VPN you get a filtering content filtering you get ... ad blocking and you get regular updates so that's something to be aware of mesh routers costs more basically both in initially and over time on the other hand they really do make a difference how big is this space\nAt the port in our house\nOkay so it's not a huge ... most space stations will cover that easily a single ...\nQuestion or the concern that I have though is a fight with the airport three of software that through networks one for this one for one for the size noticed comments I'm In San ... is from our systems is that while it's all black cast and you can ... separate network for bigger\nYeah the idea that ... the idea behind bashes\nWill do it you just take it from here and I have to say in most cases unless you really know what you're doing that the best way to do it at people and people can there's a lot of ... that people can think they go I'm going to choose the channel I'm going to choose the frequency I'm going to make it better and they screw things up so unless you're a network ...\nOr ... yeah I set up for it says you need to do it or you have to choose that\nWell the ring should automatically a good ... device and I will not all of them do this but will no no that that's the two point four it'd be on the two point four actually with the ... with the ... I don't think you're gonna have a problem with that um if you if you can sometimes be a problem with some poorly designed T stuff where they see two signals\nA five year hurts in a two point four and they choose the wrong one they can't handle it I've had that happen with a device and then you just have to reset the device and choose the other one but in a way that's more likely if you have to you know to routers a two ... two two brothers one route are two different frequencies you might choose the wrong one\nAnd so I wouldn't I use the ring with ear a he's a plumber ear I use it I have both swimming erode held I use the ring with the ear oh\nI'm In no problem but I didn't I didn't do anything special it just to automatically for it and then like\nA a a we know of flaws I think it's the last one I actually have a link was um I thought it was\nI I was there have been problems with ... in some way by a a router so you should always make sure that you choose a router that works best or works well with your ... devices and we always had problems I Can't remember with which ones I Would for the size place you have I think you know\nIt's nice now is some of the old school router companies like a Seuss and that gear or doing links is are doing they have you know in the case next year and links as they have\n... but they're doing even in their regular you know stand alone single wife ... points they have a lot of mesh features so um it's you know you might look at two hundred bucks\nFrom a Amazon the next year night hawk that's the wire cutters pick for ... three stream NATO to to live in a sea route or just a little it's a it's actually a one eighty five it's a little less than the old airport extreme but I Would say it's very comparable to it [noise]\nAnd uh I think they're going to keep that up to date if you want to mesh I Love your oh I Love the extra features of the euro plus\nPlume is is good in it for a certain things I use it for my generally for my eye of the devices are because erode is um is very good if it's kind of small focused why\nAnd then another really good choice or is this analogy Archie twenty six hundred I think is a is a really it's two hundred bucks is really nice rather than an allergy\nHas demonstrated that they will keep the software up to date they really they do that work attached storage devices as well and they really seem committed to keeping stuff up to date that's number that job one right now for rather rather is your first line of defense against the bad guys outside so uh since ... a ... year\nIf you want a mesh I Love the euro you couldn't do better than the euro I think uh\n[noise] ...

what would I Do without you\nKnow I Am about to branch off at bay okay and I have a question they claim that it's free why\nFor unlimited devices but then they said they throw in a like a hard line I'm ... and I don't quite get\nWhat the hard line for I Know I have another house and I think ... my router that helps all my wife I threw out the house I don't watch hardly or is it faster speeds do I really need it\nIt's just colder that you don't have to use it it it just comes with it so your your service comes into the wall with a hard line right [noise]\nWell that's what they have a a they have like what would be an outlet but for a\nYou know and it comes in that comes into the cable modem which turns the signal on the way\nWhat ... what what do you mean a cable\nModem who's your ... what kind of ... what kind of service do you have is it is it from a phone company for my cable company who's who's the Internet service provider\nThat much but I Need help with I don't know oil out of office\nAnd I see I don't know what I see so they the office the people who owned the buildings said and we're going to include why we're going to clued Internet\nCorrect I got it okay so so they're doing it OK okay\nAnd so you don't know who they are getting it from but they're getting it from a local provider of some kind of go in and then the reason they give you a hard line is because some people want to connect their computers directly\nThere's other benefits at that faster ... and some devices require not everything has what five okay so that's kind of normal to provide that\nOkay you have a Jack you have a Jack in what we call an ethernet Jack in the wall looks like a phone jak\nThat what I ... yes yes that's exactly right thank you for that\nYes okay that's called ethernet that's uh that's always nice you pay the landlord for this Internet access or they just throw it in with the rent\nThey throw in the ... act I don't I think I'm probably gonna have to get my own\nBoy a arrived in ... so that's the question as to landlord ... thank you for throwing it they'll jak which is connected to nothing [laughter] oh that was to you\nAsk them do you provide Internet access almost certainly they do it I mean it's possible white it's pretty typical though when you read office space that that's wired up for Internet access but that you then have to go to the Internet service provider that is wired ... the place up in in by Internet from it\nOK okay quick question about that do you think it's a possibility for me to transfer my I'm a start up company how do you think you'll be possible for me to transfer my Internet company from spectrum to a building twenty miles away like\nProbably not so that's another question for the landlord you have to ask the landlord what Internet is available in this building\nAnd you can't transfer it to your building unless spectrum is wired that building up they may have twenty miles away not germane one way or the other spectrum is in the neighborhood they may well have we in our building for it\nIt's the studio I'm In right now we have the local cable company wired up they have there's a closet with all of these connections\nIn part of the building and the cable companies there so it was a local a fiber optic Internet service provider called sonic that I think there's other companies as well and they're all in the closet and then you go to whichever company you want to use it has to be one of the ones in the closet and say this one is the one I'd like in my office\nSo you okay do I I think you're going to want to talk to the landlord and say tell me which one of my choices if it's spectrum you can add it to your existing spectrum service perhaps [noise] usually\nCable companies charge differently in charge a lot more for business connections that homo yeah oh yeah so uh but you and you want business Internet because there's you know that they're usually the qualities better et cetera et cetera\nUh so you should see what the choices are and then you might want to do some research by calling the different companies available to you just like when you buy a\nHouse or rent an apartment you ask the previous owners of the landlord well what kind of Internet you get here and uh and they'll tell you what stuff's been brought in from the curb and that's the same thing from a landlord was been what is available to me on that jak you put in my office and then\nI bet you unless for some reason they're the nicest landlords in the world and they just said you know what we're going to pay all the tendons Internet access\nMost likely they'll say okay you have these choices\nI Would do some research to see what business Internet cost and what you get what event happen\nIs they'll wired up they may or may not come into your office in wired up probably what they'll do is if you've got an eastern jak in your office they'll just what they do they call it light it up\nThey'll connected in that closet there's all those ethernet jacks go into that closet and they'll connect that line in your office to the one that's coming into the building into the closet they'll connect those now you're on that company's Internet\nAnd then what you're going to probably have to do is buy a why fire router\nBut that was gonna say Chili's we did that and and I found a company that was fired into their wives that would necessarily be the why I\nKnow that right oh they offer you free why fight\nFor unlimited device\nNice that I is it from who's it from say curiosities it from the company that the red sea the building or\nYou know why it at that company puts it in the contract it\nSo that might be all you need it depends on how fast it is there are things to be considering\nOkay we have an inside office so I'm not I'm On the outer", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Leo Laporte", "city": "Newton", "day": "14"}
