screaming twenty\nIn fact Tuesday is patch Tuesday [noise] last Tuesday Microsoft said All right they had a big event to show off new hardware new surface pros and surface laptops studios and so forth and at the event they said and today we're proud to say we will begin pushing out\nThe new feature update they call it Eighteen oh nine 'cause in September twenty teens accepts October but it's close enough so that's it you know nine last one was Eighteen of three\nBut it came out in may so eight five but I but any ... pay no attention to the numbers that's not the most important thing the most important thing is\nThe ... you know these they do these a couple of times a year and windows to remember they said when does tend to last version of windows were not going to a ship all windows eleven\nWe're just gonna keep updating keep improving windows tan and we're going to do that to three times a year it's turned out to be really two times a year with these big feature updates\nExcept that almost immediately people started saying well the feature up I stole the feature of the lead me all my documents one guy on the Microsoft support board said ... gigabytes of documents documents folders\nGal oh\nThat doesn't seem like a behavior but it also seems weird because Microsoft has tested this as they have in the past with millions of people the current you know eight nine has been tested for six months work their tests and the next one already with these people who volunteer ... maybe\nOne of them it's the windows insider program you'd think if this thing did that except maybe the installers the last piece of the puzzle right maybe they didn't they hadn't been really testing the installer so maybe they did you know forget to tested thoroughly I don't know any way Microsoft and they have pulled back to you know not\nSo uh\nYou won't be able to get a T into nine if you were all excited about it probably few people have ... the way it generally works it was assumed that they Microsoft wasn't going to start kind of\nSaying you know you know how they do that with pop ups hey there's a new version has one installed they until Tuesday till patch Tuesday so that people who got it or what Microsoft calls seekers\nI Am a seeker I'm a secret truth of wisdom end of windows updates and I got it because if you went to windows update and actively said what's that what's new anything new\nIt would say well yeah there's this new feature update you want it I installed it on at least three\nComputers by Lenovo that I have in front of me the ... for Seventy yes\nLast year

I Need to extend my wife fight so that I can get a\nFire sticks or something like that for the other TVs right and they can uh do it but I don't know what kind of range extender I Need or there's a better brand or\nMe [noise] [noise] yeah this is a ... ... am I saying are the most outdoor things be the wire the whole house by horse but who's going to do that nobody was on the addict yeah yeah yeah of course yeah I\nI keep I'm tempted to do that in my house and the crawl space underneath here in California we tend to be you have no basements but at least we have little crawl spaces are nice but then who wants to go into their that's even worse me addict [laughter] lighter so uh are worse or worse\nThe cable companies took advantage of the FCC when the FCC made over the television stations go digital some years ago and I remember there was a big thing about it and you had to get a digital Turner and stuff the cable companies pretended that this was a requirement for them to\nAnd took advantage of and they all went digital or you know there's advantages for them they can get more a signal down the line you know analog uses a lot more bandwidth than just getting digital packets on there so you get more challenges cetera et cetera et cetera\nBut of course at this point I'm ... everybody's looking for is to just do it over the top that's called when you use the Internet to get your television they call it over the top\nOr you're going over your going over and above your cable companies own offerings and TV saying I'm going to do it myself on a fire t._v. or Roku or an Apple TV or ... you know YouTube TV or whatever\nThey do that you need first of all good Internet I presume you're getting that at the router and then that Internet needs to get to all the other TVs in the house and that can sometimes be Alan\nExactly it's not terrible my daughter uses her laptop in the back room and streams some stuff but there's a lot of ...\nYeah what you'll notice on why fight the farther you get the less signal you get and throw that signal you get the less speed you get the direct correlation so\nWe want to boost the signal bell ah it depends on what you're using as a wife I access point if you're using a modern access point has they do to the Lebanese see are you\n[laughter] you're ...\nMike yeah but yeah how recently did you by your accent\nOr micro bites how recent with a\nDecent why why it's not DSL um [noise] it's just that uh they also have the the the lock I'm mad as well we're very rural so the only choice we had\nOh it's from the cable guy I got it yeah yeah that makes it more complicated now what I Would recommend it most cable companies will let you do this I don't know if yours will ... cable company but if if they do the best thing to do is to use their cable modem and provide your own wife fire wherever\nI did I did do that\nOkay good so you ... if they if they're cable modem has a wife by a part part of it you know a router part of it just disable bad or at least turn off the wife by radio\nIf you could turn off the wife by radio that all lemonade signal congestion and then you have to put the wife I rather than what we call rich boats they let the cable modem router because they're still around her and they decide what IP address as we all\nBut I'm going to use you for why find that usually works pretty well\nYour best way to do this is with the more modern mesh why fire routers um erode sponsor of ours is a big name but there are plenty of these or be from next year a veil up from is that links is I can never remember there's a there's a whole bunch of strange names for these things\nAnd these ... are designed for challenging why fire environments they have a base unit\nSometimes the same as all the other units sometimes different from all the audience and then they have sub units typically you buy a a a little sub unit for every Fifteen hundred square feet although you if you have a challenging environment with multi levels that kind of thing you might might buy more and and these these little extra units\nAre are like repeaters but they're better than so you can get a repeat or for your existing non mesh system\nBut what will happen is the repeaters takes half of the time talking to the route to the base station and the other half the time talking to you so we all wife I extenders\nCut wife I speed in half off at the\nNature of a wife I extend or because they can't operate in what we call full duplex smoke they can't they can't do two things at once they can only either talk to the route or talk to you so that's split in half\nThe ... have a back channel this is the ... the main difference have a back channel they use to communicate with the base station it doesn't slow down so the ... and this is why it's the best solution for somebody who's trying to expand their wife I footprint\nAnd plume is another one that's uh that's I use both plume an arrow in my house there lots of companies all you have to look for mash um the problem is the expense because you're not only buying a base unit you're going to buy one or two or three extra extenders in the end they usually start at three hundred\nDollars and uh they go up usually around a hundred hundred and fifty bucks per extender\nSo you haven't had what if they solve the problem really solve the problem and some of them are most of them have additional\nFeatures for instance the heroes or\nHave if you pay extra ... I think it's a hundred bucks a year euro plus which has filtering so it keeps your kids off of that site that has\nThings like you could say to your echo pause a juniors why fight in his will go off um and you can yours will continue they have lots of nice features guest they have guessed networks they really\nDo they mean like a timer they do we have whatever she will be on all night and\nI Do this with our teenager at ten pm on school nights the router goes off however\nIt only goes off for them mom and dad can stay up late 'cause we're Ross yeah that's cool so you get the joy\nThe password to get access to the phones because I've got so many of them and I I I just I I I'm In my brain doesn't work right I'm working on probably three brain cells\n[laughter] losing them all the time because of lack of oxygen into my brain so a lot to make an excuse for it\nNo you don't have to make excuses and by the way everybody forgets the ... six\nSix December and that's part of my problem to the older you get the more you have problems remembering things that's bad enough but I\nDon't don't don't apologize Robert I'm catching up with you so here's here's the deal or\nIs it the thing that the code you enter when you first this you know the turn on the phone you have to honor code to get into it right okay so on these older Android phones they're not quite as secure an iPhone you might be a little bit more a challenge because apple really locks these things down\nBut on an Android phone or if you don't mind doing it the easiest thing is to erase it and start over do you mind doing that though I don't mind that at all\nOkay so it's going to depend on the phone but almost you know what I Will say all Android phones have a way to get into recovery mode\nNow the easiest ways of course if your phone is unlocked you can do it right from the settings but your phone is locked so what you want to do is reset it without unlocking it and you can do that but you're going to have to figure out you know inject here's the first thing I'd try it works on most Android phones\nYou precedent hold the power button and the volume up button at the same time and that'll put you in recovery\nMode and that works on almost all Android phones\nIt can't promise it'll work on yours and what you might end up having to do is Google\nYour manufacturer and model and the word reset or factory reset and there may be a different command for say the al ... cells or whatever but what that what what the commander in in my case of pressing the power button\nAnd you have to kind of it might be a little tricky because you have to do it in there you know just kind of at the same time\nAnd volume up about and then you have to like you said volume up in power at the same time up yeah and you and your hold it and then once you ... at some point you might have to turn it off first and you could do that by even if it's locked by pressing and holding the power off button\nSo power power at all the way down then ... the power in volume button together and you'll see you should see and most of these phones they used a text based menu that's the recovery mode\nAnd I'll tell you how you navigate that you move the volume button up or down through the menu and then you press the power button to select and so you're going to select reset\nAnd a reset will just a race the phone pick it back as if you just bought it which actually isn't a bad thing to do once in a while\nI did just buy it at all I did was get it able to connect to my wife by that I haven't done anything else so I won't worry about losing any\nTray perfect perfect and then now some people are going to yell at me when I say this but I honestly think this is perfectly fine you don't have a lot of strangers coming and going in your house do you narrow zero so it's okay it's perfectly fine to write passwords down\nA ... the only issue would be if somebody could get access to the notebook to your writing it right but as long as people aren't going\nTo get past my three fifty seven first\nOkay that sounds pretty good and\nI won't be breaking in Robert ... actually a yeah you're in Florida so uh you you have you have a lot you have the stand and\nStanding cocker lawyers your great so [laughter] so what I Would do is get up and get a new book I I've actually I've actually seen these in I'm In like the targets and stuff they this is I don't know if that's a good idea but I see no books that they pass words\nOn the front of it in gold letters that's kind of an announcement to get this no book but\nMaybe don't have one that says passerby does get a new book that you know and you keep it in your desk drawer\nAnd any time you said a code a password\nWhatever just write it down okay that's your password fall\nWas a second issue with them is\nAlways want to keep updating just the apps that came with it\nRight and they only have eight eight ... gigabytes of hard drives space and only one giggle memory and I'm always getting low memory an out of space memory\nOr every time they do an update their updates or at least twenty to thirty gigabytes it's LED lights I'm Sorry yeah labs up over time when you're getting a little frequently yeah so\nBut you do want to let me tell you you do want those updates wherever you really do I know yeah I don't worry about the low memory a ... most of the time those updates update you know they'll downloaded first and that may be where you get that warning but as soon as the updates done to the lead it and they'll not occupy any more than they currently do\nMost of the time updates don't add to this about the size of these apps or the or the operating system but they are very important as long as you can run them as long as it happens it's okay [noise]\nIt does leave in downloaded folder of the ... the ... or the day that you download it and you can delete that okay\nYeah it will delete it by ... automatically oh oh okay yeah I Know when does or doesn't always do\nThat oh that's right windows does not it assumes you have a lot of room but Android understands in many cases the spaces scanned so it it will delete those don't you worry and if it does and you can't go in the downloads folder and and with impunity delete anything that's stuck there\nIt can handle up to a thirty two gigabytes card\nOh well that's another solution now the thing about cards to remember is when you install one of those cards most of the time apps and the operating system they don't live on the card\nBut what you can do I don't know if you're using it for music you can move music there you can move pictures there any media\nAny data files can be moved to the external card and that will free up space uh once you put in the card for instance the camera will say oh I see you have a card you want to put pictures there and you just say yes and that will free of space but it doesn't you can't put apps there\nRobert it's great to talk to you

way you can get great portraits\nOr with great depth of field you know the background kind of fades away and the and the end of portrait pops out so each lands has different features different attributes a lot of photographic a teacher's suggest however\nAnd you know the temptation is going to be the get the kit lands which usually the twenty wide goes wide just kind of somewhat telephoto twenty four to seven to your ... something like that\nUm [noise] that\nA nice all purpose lens a lot of teachers suggests starting with a single prime lands of fifty millimeter LEDs which approximate the guy and really teaches composition because\nInstead of just zooming in and out you actually have to think about it move closer move farther away really think about what you're getting that is going to be up to you and your daughter she's going to say no dad I don't want to have to do all that I just want one lens and and and then you're then you're kind of yeah you get one zoom lens the kit lands\nAnd then the question is well what do I need any other ... yeah yeah it does it all\nI liked the idea of having a good low light they they tend to be more expensive the the the the how much light gathering is determined by the what we call the aperture how big the opening and get and it's it's it's it's an inverse so the lower the F stop the wider the aperture so\nWhen you see a lens that can do F. one point a to F ... even at one point for\nThose are lenses that have a wider can go wider opening and capture more light which means they're great for not using flash for for getting a natural images they're great for torture they tend to be more expensive and you'll never see assume we call it a fast lands but I can do that you'll ever see assume that fast\nBecause it's just too expensive a fast zoom he's maybe two point four three point five something like that and okay so I\nThink about instead of getting the ... getting a body and then getting a nice say F. one point for fifty millimeter lands I think that would be a great teaching was but you got to talk to her and she's got to agree with you\nAs far as which body to get it this is an important decision because if you're getting an interchangeable lens camera you're buying into a system if you get a cannon or an icon and you're going to be going cannon or an icon lenses forever after you know because they have custom mounts each of them\nSo you're making a decision in that regard right now I'm a kind of a fan of the ... ah I was a cannon shooter for years and actually I currently shoot Sony's which are mirror lists\nUh but but for her first camera maybe an icon deep thirty five hundred [noise] uh this is a good ... camera it's all you know it starts at five hundred bucks\nOkay uh it is the sensors size is another thing that people often talk about\nThis is a P. S. C. censor which is a large censor but not for framed full frame gets very expensive ultimately that's what she's going to want but I think this the D. thirty five hundred is a very nice very high quality camera or you could buy a kit get the twenty four Seventy a lens that goes with the kid\nA it is here's what I Would do is the other thing you can look at is deep he reviewed dot com digital photography review dot com\nThey have a best camera for beginners buying guide that we'll talk about the pros and cons they liked the cat and the one you were looking at the ios rebel Estelle to okay ah that's another very nice went but did talk about the pros and cons of each\nAnd I'm going to throw in one third one that is to me are the most flexible solution which is an Olympic is oh MD now this is a smaller censor it some ... what we call micro\nFor third censor the micro for thirds cameras have one big advantage many companies make the lenses so you have many of whom literally hundreds of choices of lenses\nAnd that is kind of nice my wife shoots at oh empty a EM five\nI think more mark or I Can't remember ... ... am one mark five something like that\nAnyway it's a very the O M deserved compact they are interchangeable ends and you have a huge number of choices of lenses so I Would I go to deep you review read the beginner best camera for beginners buying guide they also have a best camera\nFor students guide a and that will give you some more information um the the three cameras I've mentioned here are absolutely top of the line cameras and it's a great project for her to be involved in it unless you want to do it as a Christmas gift\nYeah okay and I think she would like to be that you know what\nYour thoughts about any advantages of a picking up some specifically a brownie excuse me brand name a number or Amazon versus a local camera store\nAs a matter of doesn't matter how can I buy most of my cameras on Amazon oh okay okay good enough to support local cameras\nStores have you happen to have one but the prices are going to be a little higher there and you know our local cameras are disappearing even though I support them\nSo I Will report [noise]\nHey you've heard me talk a lot about ... printers you're about to hear me again because the ups and he could take forty seven fifty is downright revolutionary there's a wireless ... printer doesn't use ink cartridges that means no more last minute runs to the store late night freak outs because you've run out of ink\nHe could take forty seven fifty as easy to fill in tanks and get this they print up to eleven thousand color pages\nThat's how much you get in the box it's equivalent to thirty encourage sets\nThat's if you had to buy the it'd be about Fifteen hundred bucks\nIt saves you money saved your time and when they say all in one apps and means that the ups and he could take forty seven fifty as fast auto two sided printing it copies of scans effects as in more go to ... dot com\nSlash ...
