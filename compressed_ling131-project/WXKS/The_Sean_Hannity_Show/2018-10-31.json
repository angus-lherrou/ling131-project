Scott has this lot\nPolice the U.S attorney Scott Brady said Monday his office had up to a month to present a case to a federal grand jury well that result came much faster as shooter Robert Bowers was indicted today\nThe shooter hates Trump in large part because he's such a staunch supporter of Israel\nAnd yet that doesn't stop them\nFrom collectively losing their minds ramping up this hatred and rhetoric blaming Trump were the synagogue shooting\nBut yet the guy involved in the shooting hate the president in large part because he is so closely aligned with our closest ally Israel\n... in this country is white man most of it I'm radicalized ... up to the right and we have to start doing something about\nIf you stop seeming things about me I'll stop and citing angry lunatics\nSo you know whether the president knew what he was saying the alleged gunman certainly heard something that resonated for\nTrump is doing is stoking inciting for the purposes of political power the worst amongst us to take action in his named anybody who sits there and says that there is not causality between these uh vanish\n... ranch is dishonest as they are\nBlind I don't think you have to be a rocket scientist to rule the lines between these people and the rhetoric that has been ... by the president of the United states for the rich but for some I think that he's perfectly tolerant of racial violence in in just a matter of following\nIt is oh factually a lie because the guy hates Trump all the evidence is there why he hated Trump hated him because of his support for our closest ally Israel how many presidents promise to move to the capital of Israel from Tel Aviv\nTo Jerusalem where it belongs many none had the courage to do it except this president\nYou know it's amazing when you listen to the prime minister of Israel spanking the president no president has gone as far as to say we will destroy the enemies of Israel because there are closest ally just the opposite of what they are reporting and what they're trying to do look\nIt would've been dishonest and I said at the time when Bernie Sanders supporters went out there and shot the skull lease on the ball field in and shot up these other innocent people you know it it would have been it would have been wrong\nTo blame Bernie Sanders Bernie is not responsible for what one of his crazy supporters to he's just not isn't it's intellectually dishonest to suggest such a thing\nI said it at the time and I even had at the time this is not some accommodation or rational they would ever give it if it's a conservative just the opposite in this case you don't even have a Trump supporter and they're still blaming him\nI mean you know it's it is it is what it is\nThe biggest donors to the Democratic caused this election season is the media is universal almost at this point they hate Donald Trump every second every minute every hour every day it is hate destroy Trump at all costs\nYou know the whole lie about Russia collusion it's just what I've been saying they they don't care about Russia collusion unless the Trump\nHillary bought and paid for dont see a full of Russian wise use to disseminate propaganda and influence the American people in the lead up to twenty sixteen it was it was used to get fired warrants on verified uncorroborated Russian lies\nThat even the own\nEven the author of the\nOf the ... even stand by let me tell you something\nLet's remember when the media bashed Trump a lot of them were moving the embassy to Jerusalem\nAnd the president went against it in many ways what is a new alliance forming that could be maybe at some point God willing a path to peace in the middle east ones overall because of\nThe threat of a rainy in Germany in the region now

even it's inexplicable\nThat this guy has evolved into what I think is just he's he's lost any sense of reality all these people in the media they don't even see what blind hypocrites they are how they are guilty of the very thing they accused Trump up\nTheir rhetoric that they fame moral outrage about but there are guilty of\nHe's been he's been playing the race card I he said I'm a

we do about that\nI just I don't even know what to say you know and then their morning hosts suggesting that Trump and the synagogue shooter using the same language\nTerm messaging we'll start with the president so he seems to be a hero ing in on the two pillars of the media continuing the trail and attacks against\nAnd migrants continuing to ratchet up the language about them just and and frankly I mean I have to thank you things on the same language that the mass murder at the synagogue used in terms and invaders and\nInvasion for these tragedies working at cross purposes narrative

Indiana I Believe Dean Heller will hang on\nAnd and God help us of Christ in cinema wins in Arizona the woman who thinks it's okay to join the Taliban\nAmericans to join the Taliban after nine eleven and every other bizarre thing she said about the people of Arizona which he calls the meth lab of democracy and the people are crazy\nI'm so I'm just hoping it happens that way and then on the outside you got tester on the bubble even I'm Joe Manchin on a bubble in West Virginia and Bob Menendez on a bubble\nAnd it's interesting I Wonder if the different levels yeah Menendez on of carried on state where the Democrats should be safe because his personal\nAnd kills a when the Senate Ethics committee on a bipartisan unanimous majority find him guilty of a whole range of things in some very very unsavory ... were built around all of that now so he says he's now in such bad shape\nThey'll Kevin to pour millions of dollars that they'd like to put somewhere else they're not pulling it back in the New Jersey here's where he can I'm really really good candidates\nWho is a great their CEO of a pharmaceutical company understands healthcare can help develop and sound practical working alternative to government run health care and um she didn't even have may well\nBetween his only bringing people out to vote and the campaign conventions Democrats than there are so sick of\nMenendez and they just stay home that may actually saved three or four house seats in New Jersey that's the kind of dynamic where I frankly I Can't figure out of my own head when you go from state to state to state\nOr how these things are involving right now because they're they're very ... very much in the air and they're I think people now nobody listening should assume\nThat this was over or you can stay home and then they feel about run out and voted and if you end up not having voted by election day do not do anything else to a day to vote it's that serious\nLet me let me ask you this because it lets go with real clear\nPolitics than they have to wonder written for the number of house seats that they think are safe for the Democrats and about one Ninety nine for the Republicans\nOr where the Republicans having the majority all of those toss ups put them on defense than you did a forty five retirements for the Republicans that's a big number in any election year\nThe house is what I'm most worried about and you know the thought of Nancy Pelosi being speaker elect and then speaker of the house once again as a pretty frightening thought um where do you see the house going\nWhy not functionally [noise] ah I I my personal range\nIs reaching a bottom about about too old for him which would mean Pelosi was speaking of Anaheim around two twenty to thirty which would mean that Kevin McCarthy I think would end up is speaking [noise] um\nAnd I can't have them in all honesty you know I've always been candid about these things I Can't give you a more accurate number I Can't say to you\nYeah I Can't either when I really can't I mean and I think and and look the conventional wisdom is Republicans will hold the Senate pick up seats there and that they can see below sea would win the house um that's not a great case scenario but that would be sort of like a split decision by the American people also say one other thing is\nYou know some House Republicans have earned the wrath of their voters but it's really not about them it's about stopping an agenda that we know is going to be about impeachment endless investigation raising taxes they want their crumbs back a sanctuary cities open borders eliminating ice in keeping Obamacare\nKenya one who does not vote\nHas effectively voted for Nancy Pelosi the speaker no one should kids themselves if you do not want to have Nancy Pelosi\nAnd hard to have to house\nAnd people like congresswoman waters in charge of the financial services which which was just saying the phrase it tells you how crazy their party it's\nHow how could you then again she was smart lady because she's not somebody I Want to have watching over banks in our financial services to [noise] um she go down to less than you think of\nAnybody who says I'm tired of it all you don't like them or is it senator or I'm not going to vote not voting is in effect a half a vote for Nancy closer to be speaking [noise] um I think that's good\nI don't have to tell them if there were four hundred and thirty five members of Congress all of them are up for reelection\nAnd every race is important and the idea is no this is the either stay home or you vote for the Democrat you're pretty much voting for ... the same in the Senate races\nYou know you vote for John tester you vote for Claire McCaskill you vote for Christ in cinema you vote for Bill Nelson you both for reticent in Tennessee you're\nFor sure and I know that it's probably not the way these red state Democrats or the red state Republicans look at it but in truth and in reality that's how they're going to vote that's who they are going to vote to be their leader\nI just tell everybody he wanted to some of the claims you're a moderate Democrat and she doesn't really say I'm a moderate Democrat in the house will cost and went on from that she was you know and I would have to do that fine\nTo treat them throw level if they said you oh I'm really kind of a moderate Democrat email I got to vote for ... defeat them\nWho's sitting here and I think uh we have every evidence because his will change for good radical wing of the Democratic party in control of their quality that their leadership is just utterly unacceptable and that I think we have an obligation to uh\nIf I was in fact deeply viciously anti Trump is not a pro Trump put all kinds of suggest any parallels between the gym memberships and other little fall so\nThat's why you get to a drunk fake news or why you know of people believe that large elements of the news media on opposed to the survival Monica when which might be a better way to describe them and just being you know\nAgainst the people are they're not necessarily games with people but many of them frankly I Believe our enemies of the survival of America's meat known it and we don't have that debate and get out in the open I think the ... who's lost his mind I'm just completely missile understands the nature of not seeing some\nCompletely understands any comparison of President Trump to any of the great ... or ... you know Hitler\nJoseph Stalin mountains in London a mouser you're doing is just totally disgusting statement of a false

knows I mean you know how honest information\nHow much of these people are so deranged\nBut you can't reason with them they need psychological help\nWell I think it's obvious they need psychological

Hannity so no I Need you to go out and get your friend\nFDR ran for president did we had a democratic nominee for president when orange\nCounty and so the Democrats think we're vulnerable and that's why they hit zero zero in on us\nWell this is really interesting because most Republicans you don't think of California races being that important but\nNow it's become crucial in terms of\nYou know we've identified all of these races on our website Hannity dot com um that they're really focused in and which means that could be a very late night or early morning before we eventually get to know who controls 'cause the the house\nOr come next January and it could be Nancy Pelosi this is a real threat and I think a real possibility I Would say the fact that you have two hundred and four save democratic seats a hundred and Ninety nine safe Republican seats and all these thirty some odd toss ups\nAre are Republicans on defense that means they pretty much have to run the table and that's why they're spending all those money\nI'm can ... exactly yeah so\nTell us about you know what are the issues there and do you think the people in your district the forty fifth district of California are paying attention and are are being influenced by the money and the negative ads\n[noise] yeah it's a real clear choice in this race I mean you have\nUm a a district where do people want to continue to this America forward I mean we had the lowest unemployment in forty nine years as you know and in orange county it's the lowest unemployment it in Nineteen years people have more money in their paycheck uh people are able to get jobs\nConsumer confidence is that I mean we are really moving this country the right direction that the choices clear or do you want to continue living uh America forward or do you want to go back to the Obama era too where are you at overregulation where you had high taxes where you\nHad government in your life and I think it's a clear choice in what we're seeing right now on the early returns\nOr is that um the Republicans are just as energized as the Democrats are and in fact in my district\nWe had over ... fourteen point advantage on the after the the return over the Democrats so we aren't seeing this so called blue wave that you hear about we see that our voters are just as an energized\nWell I think it look if you look at the Senate Republicans have decided advantage and a lot of these races where they're red states that support Trump my big margins\nBut the houses just harder to figure and I don't know people fully completely understand that there are a lot of headwinds history runs against the party in power that forty five retirements that's the case for example Darrell ISIS seat\nUm and I you know I'm assuming with gerrymandering and and the legislature out there in California they do everything they could possibly do to maximize the number of democratic seats from the state\nAnd uh so it makes a particularly hard for people like yourself that have done a good job and want to do a good job with the people in your\nState and in your district but uh you know you're fighting against the state that has a Thirteen and a half percent income tax with a democratic governor of that are democratic lieutenant governor running for governor who wants to free health care for anybody whether you're a California resident or not whether you're a citizen or not\n[noise] it's a very challenging environment and to be from California and representing California either or for reasons why we need to make sure our voters get out the so that we don't lose any Republican seats we have fourteen members of Congress right now and the Democrats have thirty nine\nAnd sell it is really really important that we hold our seats we got to turn the state around and you're absolutely right I mean the liberal policies that cannot Sacramento Jerry Brown and now possibly gather news that uh it is getting more and more affordable to live in the state and we need to have it\nGet to the point where the pendulum swings back and I'm going to continue to fight for my constituents that can can you to fight for Californians until we\nGet one of the ... you will ever have\nSwinging back is people are so fed up with the regulations and hide taxation of states like California and New York Illinois and New Jersey is they are leaving and they're taking their money with them\nAnd you know my only fear is when they go to Texas or Florida or the Carolinas or maybe a lot of and a lot of cases Nevada or that they leave their liberal policies with them when they leave and and don't bring the failed policies that they voted for in their states\nBecause if you look at it it's become unsustainable for young people in California they can't afford to buy our first home they can't afford the high rate of taxes unless like you were in Silicon valley making crazy money\nYou're absolutely right and you know one one hope I have is that Supreme Court decision Janice versus asked me where you know if you're a member of the union you no longer have to pay your is that unions can troll Sacramento and if we're allowed to have a couple of election cycles\nWe may start to see that money go out of the hands of that and the unions that may give us a fighting chance at some point or in the future and the state of California well\nI got to tell you something there is a fighting chance I Wish you the best out there I Hope people are paying attention Southern California\nYou know have and this is the headline which I think it's pretty scary Michael Bloomberg spending millions for California Democrats in in tight races and one other article came out said literally spending ... million dollars just on Southern California so\nUh we wish you all the best is is Mimi Walters California's forty fifth district\nA and I wish you the best on election day and Dana Rohrabacher and all these other Republicans in Southern California these races all will tip the balance of power\nAnd if you vote for anybody that's a Democrat out there if you swayed by these ads you're pretty much voting for below sea hope the people in those districts to understand that so anyway thanks for being with us\nThank you so much\nOr I Hope it works out for you\nIt's not fun running for office who wants to run for office these days are All right let's get to our phones or we have so much going on today six days out of election day let's go to Mary is in upstate New York Mary Hi how are you glad you called\nWell New

I'm\nIn that business as well for me that's ridiculous I I was talking to you a few years ago and matter of fact it was five years ago today on health care a a situation because when they rolled out before the ... became affordable\nFor no one that I Know I've especially myself um I told you that and my husband had gotten kicked off my plan and\nUm I take extra and I'm getting less coverage and there's has that I've had 'em that are no longer covered and ah yesterday I had to sit down to do my two thousand Nineteen elections went up\nYet again and less coverage getting dang for tests and things that used to be covered and just I Want everybody to get out there and vote\nBecause we need to continue on our past\nAnd and and get rid of the Affordable CARE Act and uh you know overhaul of that\nUm and yeah I agree with you on that fracking point as well but I actually was calling to talk about the health care\nI've got to tell you right now uh it's everybody those now on the Democratic side they're running on oh we're going to fix health care\nWe're going to know I'm like you're the same idiots they gave us Obamacare keep your doctor keep her plans have less and fundamental it's been a failure and the fact that it was true none of it was true was one of the biggest lie is ever told them perpetrated on the American people\nUh but anyway Mary thank you I I Wish the people in
