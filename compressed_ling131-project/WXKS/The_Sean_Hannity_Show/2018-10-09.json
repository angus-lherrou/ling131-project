only play book\nAnd we have chronicled this now for years on this program\nBut the stakes couldn't be higher for weeks from tonight I'm you might hear the words Nancy Pelosi will be the next speaker of the house\nAnd committee chairman Maxine Waters and committee chairman Jerrold Nadler of New York I've worn you over and over again they don't have any vision to make your life better\nOr they do want to destroy Trump they want impeachment open borders ice eliminated keep their crumbs and Obamacare\nShort of that what else do they stand for\nSo if you got to start it's important to remember that you know it's an uphill battle in mid term elections the party that controls the presidency as only gain seats in the house of representatives three times in the last one hundred years yeah\nAlso on top of that you've got about forty retirements to deal with which means that the names on the ballot or new and different hopefully better in some cases but are you better off today than you or two years ago as a matter of America better off today than it was\nTwo years ago is America stronger than it was two years ago if the economy better off than it was two years ago is the president keeping his word is promises to you the American people we know that on the issue of the tax cuts\nWell at least kept his promise on the issue of ending burdensome regulation east kept his promise on building the wall he hasn't fully been able to do it because that hasn't been fully funded Kevin McCarthy introduced the ... bill today to fully fund the wall\nBut he has spent three point three and a half trillion dollars to fund the wall we now have record unemployment and fourteen states we now have the lowest unemployment rate in over fifty\nYears the last time it was this low was Nineteen sixty nine when the New York Mets shocked the world and won the world series that's how far back that goes\nHispanic American unemployment record lows African American unemployment record low women in the work force record low record low for Asian Americans also record\nLow for a veterans who have come back from war they're getting employed as well to\nPresidents kept his promises on ... dealing with rogue regimes like Iran and North Korea the sanctions in Iran are now paying off\nWe see the Iranian economy about the tank every day we see the whole issue with little rocket man we don't have a rocket being fired almost every other day that seems to be remaining on track the president hasn't given up anything in regards to that\nPresident has opened up an war we now have one of the largest oil reserves that was on available because of environmental extremism it's a vast wilderness and we just let it sit there\nAnd we haven't been able to tap into those resources or building the Dakota pipeline or the Keystone Pipeline that's all in the works now too\nIt's not a small deal is it that the president kept his promise and put to original is on the U.S Supreme Court they've now been confirmed he gave us the names of people that he would select from any selected from that list\nPromises made promises kept too short years and we see the benefits of the country\nAnd in twenty eight days for weeks from tomorrow from tonight you're going to tune in and we're going to find out what the results are\nThe good news is is that you have the power here a lot more power than you even think you know Nancy Pelosi's pick it up the drapes Maxine Waters is thinking impeachment Jerrold Nadler once endless investigation nobody's thinking about what they're going to do for you we the people\nWhat are they going to do they're going to now finally come out against Obamacare no they love Obamacare they gotta now say you know what these tax cuts are working and it's creating jobs they're not going to do that either\nYou know we've learned a lot in the last couple of days and we're really going to dig down deep do a Hannity investigation and the next hour\nIn a while we've been so busy in the last three weeks covering the the blood thinning of judge Kavanaugh leading up to his confirmation\nThere's been a lot of news that we have not been covering one of them is John Solomon Sarah quarter you know Byron York everybody Catherine heritage of all been breaking stories but\nYou know we have all the evidence now that things were far worse regarding the effort to literally on do\nAn election of the president first we know just to remind you can bring you back words a little bit\nRemember Hillary Clinton the single greatest obstruction of justice case slam dunk case in our history we know that Hillary Clinton obstructed justice once she deleted some painted emails and then use bleach pet and then busted up devices with cameras were had her age do it that's obstruction\nBut of course she had friends in the deep state they took the case away from the field agents and brought it in a house with the upper echelon of the FBI and that would be called me and struck in company and told me and struck in particular they wrote the exoneration Hillary in may\nOf twenty sixteen long before they ever interviewed Hillary or the main people involved in the whole thing and then all of a sudden they interview heard Peter Struck one of the interviewers\nA man that thinks that Hillary should win a hundred million to zero and a exonerate Hillary three days later and then they launched the Russia investigation\nAn exoneration before an investigation that means the fix was it if the field agents if they were allowed to do their job it never would have ended up that way because they would have followed the rule of law they would have they would have kept their pledge of equal application of our laws\nWell now the new evidence and remember then all everything goes back to the dossier that Hillary bought and paid for but\nWe now know that last week while we were covering the cabinet issue that the FBI general counsel James Baker remember he reported directly to James Cole me\nWell he told congressional investigators last week that an attorney remember the company Perkins Kuwait that's the company that Hillary's campaign and she was controlling the DNC money according to Don and Brazil or they will funneling money into Perkins Kuwait\nWhich is a law firms so it would show up on campaign finance report says illegal cost\nIt turns out they would hire fusion GPS in our research group that went out and hire the former ... six agent\nOr the name of Christopher Steele Christopher Steele uses Russian sources he himself doesn't even stand by any of his sources he doesn't believe his own dot CA when push came to shove and an inter August tore in Great Britain\nBut anyway this revelation is Baker telling the number two the the lead counsel for the FBI who is now gone twenty five pop representatives of the FBI and the DEA OJ or either resigned or fired or or stepped aside\nAnyways stunning revelation that he told congressional investigation gators that an attorney for ... law firm gave him the materials again this is what Hillary paid for\nAbout Russian election meddling during the twenty sixteen presidential campaign\nThat's studying in terms of what it reveals since it directly contradicts Justice Department and FBI officials sworn testimony\nSo in other words they lied under oath\nAnd Baker was telling Congress last week the ... lawyer Michael Sussman directly handed documents to him about Russia's attempts at meddling in the twenties sixteen election\nIn other words he was a cut out he was a go between for Hillary Clinton and the FBI knew it the question is why did the FBI knowing this then lie about\nThat in fact you know its application then for the size of warrant which we now know the bulk of information for that was the Clinton bought and paid for dot CA that even the guy that put it together doesn't stand by but anyway\nThe fights application was based on Hillary's bought and paid for dot CA but it was all to get warrants to spy on a Trump campaign associate\nAnd by the way it seems now that it was done at the direction of Donald Trump's opponent Hillary Clinton from the get go\nWhich by the way it would be entirely illegal for both the FBI and for Clinton what appears that they've done here how many times if I said this is the biggest abuse of power scandal in American history\nNow you've got numerous officials that the D. OJ and the FBI have told us under oath that nobody at the FBI ideal Jay knew anything about the Democratic party being behind all this Clinton dirt\nHouse intelligence committee chairman Devin Nunes us he was on with Maria berets aroma I think on Sunday said well now you have one of the top lawyers for the Democrats in the Clinton campaign feeding information directly to the top lawyer at the FBI\nSo it appears that the FBI and department of justice for doing the Clinton campaign's bidding and applying for the fight\nLauren this new ... Trump campaign communications\nAnd they did so by getting the ... of war to spy on Carter Page which means that with Hillary's without Hillary's embalming here\nThey wouldn't have been a fight the application to spy on the Trump campaign that wouldn't be fusion GPS or does see a on Trump we wouldn't be living through its second year of\nEndless Trump Russia investigation with no evidence whatsoever because Democrats cynically launched the whole thing to ruin Donald Trump's presidency and set 'em up for impeachment\nAnd pregnant moms and we raised or make when self defense from a violent boyfriend after she runs in my room and shoots him dead ... for the latest climate justice need that a crime online dot com his crime or body by\nTheir works relief customer said they experienced relief from muscle cramps distorted with their works relief fattening phone proven to prevent it really foot leg cramps their works relieve the pain relief I only your local pharmacy or third works relief dot com ask your pharmacist for their works really well this particular time the anti Christ\nThe Florida Panhandle Florida governor Rick Scott says the time to prepare is running out\nWorking Michael is a monster storm and the forecast skits keeps getting more dangerous we're now just hours away from seeing impacts in addition\nTo high winds Michael's expected to dump torrential rains bring deadly storm surge and spin off tornadoes evacuation orders issued for several counties in advance of the storm's arrival\nFox News [noise]\nAll\nTheir hobby is Glenn Beck can found illegal makes total sense to you know very late [noise] your and\nThis audience is going to be the\nOr no pressure can once you understand what you're really facing the game that is actually being played\nDisillusioned weekday mornings at night we were all my gosh I get off the conservative box will on [noise]\nTalks will\nLead I'm loving it mostly than he's got a little bit of cloud cover starting to filter in but temp there in the upper seventies smile that'll stick around we'll see it in the eighties\nThis report is brought you by positive coaching alliance\nGot issues with youth or high school sports positive coaching alliance can help VCA a national nonprofit offers more than a thousand free online resources for use in high school sports coaches parents fan in ministry visit the the ada\nZone dot or five times the most iconic brand and the booming cannabis industry just went public joined me I peeled now\nPie times investor dot com dome is your chance to be part of his Purina making visited high time investor dot com that lifetimes investor\nDot com high times over the course offerings will be made by means of offering circular which has been filed with unqualified by the U.S securities Exchange Commission the security's are highly speculative investing and shares kind of shocked by the time so the court develop significant risks the investment of suitable only for persons who can afford to lose their entire investment furthermore investors must understand at such best\nWe could be liquid for an indefinite period of time no public market currently exist but the securities and if a public park it develops following the offering it may not continue to get a copy of the offering circular which could change it from Asia about high times on the court the offering and other related topics including the risks of\nInvestment pleased with high times investor dot com that's high times investor dot com I media and the civilians are investors and our time's holding court but are not associated with his offer ... media and its affiliates in that responsible\nFor the information contained in his message being from Asian included the hypocenter veteran outcome or the information filed with the securities and Exchange Commission\nIs nothing small about your ... your passion your hours your reputation ...\nTheir partnership even bigger\nWith Dell small business technology advisor you'll get the tax and bank and one on one partnership to help your business ground because we're the reliable down these endemic or processors you can focus on what matters now getting business done\nA seven eleven by down to speak with an advisor to day\nEight seven seven by down [noise]\nHi Hi media presents Nick ... vive down that\n\nNever to blame space\nAnd Jeannette\nNumber one ... dream [noise]\n\n\nHear more from ... and similar artists [noise] now I'm ... ... ...

from ... at a time this is Sean Hannity show at twenty five 'til the top of the hour scary\nHurricane season continues and hurricane Michael now is headed straight for the Florida Panhandle looks like it could hit landed a category three\nA and there's a massive storm surge risk for the panhandle and and the entire area that would be destined for Walton Beach uh and surrounding communities and uh is hurricane warning storm surge warnings have all been issued along the Gulf Coast\nAs I understand that we have some evacuations now taking place and it looks like it's a really big threat to the panhandle thoughts and prayers go to our friends down in\nThe panhandle area we check in with both job of started the official weatherman other Sean Hannity show and of course he's with weather bell dot com and being I'm being told that the worst storm to hit the Florida Panhandle and like decade Tibet as\nWell so I think it's going to be the or maybe the worst on record it and I'm a city or that area particularly last major hurricane to hit coming in at this angle was a hurricane ... back in Nineteen Ninety five hurricane cage\nIt there in November believe it or not um Nineteen eighty five that was a major hurricane in the Gulf\nBut a week into a category too when it went through there so this is probably going to be the benchmark storm for that Panama City area now\nFortunate thing is if we want to cover the of sort of the silver lining here Pensacola and mobile are going to get north wins\nAnd mobile I don't think this is a big deal and mobile Pensacola go forty ... sixty maybe three four inches of rain but once you start moving east southeast would down the coast and especially in that Panama City area\nThis is going to be as bad as you see in that particular area\nThan weather pattern you remember of Florence was off its peak when it hit the north Carolina coast this one because of the weather pattern is intensifying as it comes to the coast\nAnd I don't expect anything to stop it from being a at least that strong category three perhaps even a a borderline category for upon landfall very well telegraph in this pattern you remember showing last time I was on with you I said I'll probably see for a week in October\nWhy why why is this now getting stronger the way you're describing and ... what does it mean to look the average person including me\nHas no idea why the actual angle of the ... when it reaches land matters so much why does the angle of the storm ...\nIt's also the overall pattern when Florence was coming into powder in the uh western Atlantic was a weakening as far as tropical cyclones on September twentieth believe it or not Japanese meter optical agency it's maps came out and said look out October fifth\nThrough about the nineteenth and the Atlantic basic you notice all the typhoons have shut down in the western Pacific completely and he said well what is it has to do with us well when the action stops there like\nA good last year it shifted into the Atlantic basin and that's what you see going on folks as you can watch this stuff\nComing to three weeks away now I Can't tell you well is it going to New Orleans or is it going to camp I owe or whatever I could say this general area has got to look out during this time that's what we saw and once we got so last Thursday and friday you know then showing knows I emailed him down all this stuff to get him ready about this\nYou could see this coming right up into the Gulf of Mexico so that area has not been touched remember we hit Louisiana and Mississippi with Gordon Alberto\nWe hit it off to the east over there with sports this is going right in between and instead of coming western northwest it's heading it's heading into classical faction from the southwest and it's going to race through the Carolinas so you folks in the Carolinas you're going to have a fast moving tropical storm go through there and unfortunately\nA lot of these areas that were hit by Florence is gonna be another three to six locally ten inches of rain coming Thursday night into friday morning friday the storm will be between Cape Hatteras in Norfolk go right after the to the south of New England no problem in the north east from it\nBut it is going to be a big problem even in the Carolinas or because of the fact that there's more rain coming\nSo you're going to you're basically saying this is going to come up through the Florida Panhandle it's going to sort of veer right hit the Carolinas hard and then go out to sea\nYeah won't ... you'll see forty to sixty mile an hour winds maybe guts to hurricane force along the outer banks and forty or sixty mile an hour winds Charleston Columbia uh Augusta places like that as it moves so but it's going to accelerate through there\nThe security that we are now obtaining the better trade deals that we are now also locking down it's all good for the American people\nI don't know why people you know there are

couldn't get it right away like all the other tech ... we had to wait until the final\nReport right our to Sean Hannity show toll free number is eight hundred number one\nAnd if you want to be a part of the program what we played their Rod Rosenstein you know for people that did wrong in the deal Jay face consequences\nRegarding vice I Believe signed the final buys a warrant himself and then when he's talking about the rule of law and speaking up for truth and Jim Jordan blasting Rod Rosenstein uh conduct now the president met yesterday on air force one apparently had a meeting not a lot of details about what went on in the meeting\nWith Rod Rosenstein there was talk about well he might be fired after it had been discovered that he was talking about well you want me to wear a wire\nAround the president and his answer was you know at least has the spin was well I was just saying that you wouldn't want me to wear a wire around the president and it was all in the tone and the cadence of what he said we have three articles in front of me right now one by Katherine heritage at Fox one by Sarah Carter won by John Solomon\nA Solomon's article goes on former FBI lawyer plot to record removed Trump was not a joke and John Solomon let me read from the article don't tell for FBI general council member James Baker he was one of those that resigned that those infamous discussions\nAbout secretly recording president Donald Trump and using the tapes to remove him for office where a joke he apparently doesn't believe it and he yelled quite the vantage point as he was on the inside of the FBI bureaus leadership and may have\nTwenty Seventeen when the discussions occurred and Baker told Congress last week\nThat his boss then acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe remember became and Lisa Page both took notes of the meaty and McCabe was saying yeah Rod Rosenstein had in fact said this anyway now James Baker is saying\nAnd Andrew McCabe is saying that in fact they were dead serious about about the idea\nOf Sarah surreptitiously recording the forty fifth president using the evidence to make the case\nThat Trump should be removed from office according to every source now in all three articles and Baker told lawmakers that he wasn't in the meeting that McCabe had with the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein in which the subject came up but he had first hand conversations with Medicaid\nAnd the FBI lawyer that was assigned to a ... page about the issue so Baker talk to both of the un quote as far as Baker was concerns are real plan being discussed set a source directly familiar with the congressional investigation it was no laughing matter to the FBI\nOr member then you can go back to what was the insurance policy to remove Trump\nIs five months now into his presidency is this just before the appointment of the special counsel\nThis is Justin ... at that time frame around the media elite strategy that was occurring anyway so it goes on word of bakers testimony now is surface just days before Rosenstein said to be interviewed them private by the\nHouse Judiciary committee lawmakers that's supposed to happen Thursday of this week and the New York times first reported allegations that Rosenstein the number two at the department of justice has tried to downplay his role in all of this in his office suggested that\nHe thought the discussion was a joke that Rosenstein never gave in order to carry out any such plot\nAnd he doesn't believe the Trump should be removed from office but making those statements through a spokesperson is a bit different than having Rosenstein himself face Congress answer the questions under the penalty of a felony if lawmakers think he's lying and bakers account lawmakers this month clearly complicates on already complicated picture\nAs it relates to Rod Rosenstein before Congress assuming he shows up for Thursday's interview but even more so Baker story lays ... extraordinary conversation and we go on from there and now we're going to really take our time with this issue today and\nWe're going to now begin to put the pieces of the puzzle together because what this is we're laying out here are the top people the the upper echelon remember twenty five people have either been demoted fired or have left the FBI the OJ their\nUpper ranks here and James Baker is one of them and Andrew McCabe at least a page of both corroborating what apparently now James Baker is set about Rod Rosenstein anyway John Solomon ease but investigative reporter is what the hell\nRag Jarrett Fox News legal analyst\nAnd of course the seller of the number one book the Russia hoax thank you all for being with us I'm John let's just I Want to also put this in context where people because it gets complicated\nWe got a first start with the timeline the timeline is may have twenty Seventeen or that's when Robert Mueller is getting appointed by Rod Rosenstein just before that we had people like ... at least a page in and Peter Struck talking about uh media elite strategy that had to do with the dusty a\nWhile it now appears that that was all being league for the purposes\nAnd again ... all it was was the dot CA recycled and different news outlets for the purpose of initiating the special counsel so would get appointed that we're discovering that they're even talking about surreptitiously taping the president of the United states so that they can remove him from office this sounds like a cool to me\nIf there was one other event that occurs in that timeframe that really I think it's the shock wave for this conversation and that was the termination of James\nComey's the FBI Director of it allowed all this Russia investigation to go on and we know now from ... just after market may they still have that where you're from a proving any form of collusion with Russia so they've been nine months out of James Kobe's let this go on for nine months\nHe's let two agents who have an anti Trump a virus read that investigation he gets fired and what's the natural reaction of all those who've been supporting James Comey that rose to see a a Medicaid and a stroke page it's hey maybe we can remove this guy rather can't prove that he did something wrong with Russia\nMaybe we can prove he's confident and will will record him and uh and maybe try to take 'em out through the recording and the twenty Fifth Amendment\nThis is not what the FBI with hot in the theater I'm sure I could talk about history it lays out a real possibility that this was a softer right look at this we have had access to eating a crime here that in fact they can't find a crime by a page\nAs well at least a pages testimony just to be clear she said they um they had found nothing and nine months leading up to the point\nThat's right so they switch gears right maybe we can remove him other than me and and this conversation is so extraordinary ...\nThat says that job at the FBI or twenty Fifth Amendment never envision the FBI being involved in it\nShe got the FBI and the deputy attorney general or allegedly our conversation he says it's a joke they say they're dead serious about it and they believe he was dead serious about it and no matter which way it comes down is just another example of how far down the road with the FBI\nWas beyond its core mission which is to investigate crimes stop counter intelligence\nAnd and again this has nothing to do with rank and file agents that all this this is just a group of rogue power hungry upper echelon management types and if anything they took the the cases away from the field officers purposely so that they can involved themselves in these nefarious activities that's why\nIt really does explain a Greg Jarrett why every FBI guy I Know is so angry about this because they know was ripped out of their hands\nAnd this and all of them say that if this was them they know they get fired\nThat's right and in fact I interviewed former top officials and the FBI who are angry at people like James Comey Andrew McCabe James Baker Lisa Page\nPeters struck for ruining the reputation the good name of the FBI I wrote a column recently that said Rosenstein actions\nIn an attempt to ... the sitting president United States\nIs the equivalent of an attempted coup not a bloody violent coups\nWhat's known and John refer to it a moment ago as a soft coup ah using and misusing their power in the law to remove a sitting president and so here we now have not just James Baker\nWho was told this was serious but the people

that they could use and then both the twenty Fifth Amendment and remove him from power Andrew McCabe telling that in and confirming that along with Lisa Page\nAnd go into the office of the general

that's led to the last ten years of\nInsurance premiums that have doubled or tripled ... we need to do is insured less which is how every other insurance product works the key to that is means doctors have to make more of the services they provide affordable\nAnd they can if they cut out the middleman and streamline than a simple\nMath and how big is your practice how many patients do you have in your facility in atlas empty and Wichita\nIn Wichita we have five doctors in over thirty two hundred patients\nUnbelievable and your age you give concierge care at all I could pick up a phone and I'm getting a doctor at three in the morning that it's going to answer my call\nYou do you have and I could go down and see somebody at three AM in the morning\nIf you need stitches ... it's an emergency you know a lot of the tree and phone calls or chest pain which we might send to the yard but a lot of times the kid who's sick and a mom who's worried and\nUm you of if you can avoid the yard or you can avoid a thousand or two thousand dollar bill that's how you get health care health insurance is a card in your wallet healthcare is access to your doctor yeah\nAll right and it happened and how many other practices around the country have you been able to to provide your model that they've duplicated how you you been out and about on a champion of this for a long time\nYet we've helped over five hundred and fifty doctors convert to this model in the last few years but there's about a thousand total there forty eight states every state except north and south\nA Dakota right now but we have one about to launch in North Dakota [noise] um and then it's even gotten a little bit international so um this is a a sound tried and true model\nYou know and what do you do Dr grows in terms of your president of duck ah docks where a patient care foundation you know now that we have alternatives that are working real life experiences seems to me that we ought to be able to duplicate it a lot more than we are\nAbsolutely a so doctor patient care foundation has er physician run house policy because doctors never seemed to be at the table whenever we're having these important conversations about health care\nSo we put traditions are back and back to the table to have these conversations\nPersonally I I also have a primary care practice much like that lets them here in southwest Florida a practice any health are plus when he was you know why are we using insurance to pay for health are for basic primary care services\nAll it does is create ... ... ... ... ... points as Dr Josh and we're seeing patients come to us from all over the state of Florida and even from outside of the country\nWas ... medical tourism are and what we're finding is that you know not not the same thing about health insurance we're using it wrong and you know when somebody is you know place twice the amount of money for a service because they just are helping shots\nOne ensuring is using insurance drives up the cost of the product so an MRI cash price Ross is two hundred and twenty dollars while using your your commercial insurance you know we go through all the hoops ticket it authorized\nYour co pay five hundred dollars or so we we see this time and again the more people are are coming out of pocket to pay for health health or I'll let you signed up to ... more insurance seems to be becoming an optical\nI'm ... solution so you know I'm pleased to see the worst shifting the conversation from our coverage for everyone I'm Talking about reducing the cost of health care\nI think that the real close enough I was about to testify on us some help committee on the ... topic\nWould it be a better idea that me and I'm watching for example they have this race out in California everybody's shock to gather news and who is now offering free health care for everybody\nWhether you're a taxpayer whether you're in the ... the state legally or illegally everybody's got to get free health care well I basically put a sign that says come to California but you get sick\nUm but there's people are going to go there now what's interesting to me is that a Republican is within striking distance in that gubernatorial race out in California because instinctively people no we can't afford to pay\nFor every illegal immigrant in the country but the reality is is that if I Lived in Wichita, Kansas I Would be a part of atlas empty and I would be your patient\nAdopt ... because I I think it's the best deal I liked the idea of being able to call my doctor whenever I'm sick or if I have a kid that sick every parent wants the ability to do that and your preserved for service provides it for fifty bucks a month now how much is the average in Wichita, Kansas catastrophic plan of it for the big things heart attack\nOr accident or cancer how much we're one of those plans cost\nAbout five hundred dollars a family five hundred dollars for a year or a month a month\nSo and the current rates closer to you know a thousand twelve hundred a across the nation people are paying more for health insurance each month and they're paying for their mortgage if the Trump tax cuts only put a hundred dollars\nPer household per month in and they're being credited with the economic boom of your four point two percent GDP\nIf we fix health insurance we could put five hundred dollars back in the pocket of every household or the the real ... and the the politician there has in California is to send them on a ridge analogy just throwing more money at the problem has never fixed it\nThe what we're doing is Dr Lee and ourselves and and a thousand other physicians is is innovating and saying how do we get ... cheaper how do we make it so patients don't have co pays how do we provide stitches for no cost because they're so affordable\nUm you actually looking at ways it's fundamentally fixing the system that's what we need not just promises of more spending\nWay and if I could add add to that just a a ... you know as far as the cost of care is you know the biggest thing that people ask us as well how can I just get major medical you know we\nWe can afford what what services the primary care practice is providing but we just need something catastrophic well Obama Care made that illegal\nUh so it's something a little stretching just brought by ... get access to these major medical plans called ... short term medical plans and you know some would argue that these are actually true insurance they don't cover anything except the major medical expenses there's Seventy five dollars a month or\nWhat it is this going to be implemented easily city by city town by town we can duplicate the model it already does take care of individuals with preexisting
