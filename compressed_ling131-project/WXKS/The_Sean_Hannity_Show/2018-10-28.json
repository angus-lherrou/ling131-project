with that and but most people age don't know how to defend themselves and be they're going to react like past just caught then they're going to get past and somebody's going to get hurt\nAnd I couldn't agree more and it is a danger for people in the public square and especially people who hold themselves out as Christians whether you're a pastor or you have a Christian themed blackout you really gotta be careful\nAt it but we do anyway we need to be civil and and when some people on Twitter ... and our other interactions but I don't think that means we don't fight I don't think I mean\nWe don't uh communicate our ideas as passionately and as intensely as the ... that that just means we don't have to get his dirty as they did\nWell I look I don't know I I we just had Newt Gingrich on and pass to what he was saying is between Cavanaugh I mean all these American\nValues that have have served do so well due process presumption of innocence and then you see that there was no core operation any of these charges\nIf the Democrats really cared about the issue they'd be going after Keith Ellison right now demanding an FBI investigation of an Cory Booker will be having an FBI investigation and Claire McCaskill's husband will be having an FBI investigation\nAnd Bill Clinton would be in jail for the rest of his life\nBut they're obviously playing politics with with very important issue so the hypocrisy is there but between Kavanaugh the mobs the caravan that's happening and the fact that we've had on paralleled economic success\nFourteen state record for states record low unemployment record low unemployment for African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workplace are vets record low unemployment youth unemployment lowest ever I I'm hoping that people factor that in in fourteen days when they vote or if they vote early\nI think the man on the street will factor then I don't think the people on the street are stupid Democrat or Republican\nThen that stupid the party leaders are stupid but the man on the street they're able to see this process it they know that Kavanaugh was that whole cabinet issue was a sham they see the hypocrisy of the left on full display they know that this a caravan is not simply a random occurrence\nThat you know a a all these unconnected people just randomly deciding to all walk thousands of miles to America to look for better jobs they can see the orchestrated now some people are going to vote the party regarding this but the others say listen I'm tired of this because all of the nonsense seems to be coming from the left\nAnd the very behavior that they pretended to criticize they've put it on steroids and I am ... so you know they said well we don't like the some of the ... the president during the campaign but you say that I have it to another level and you're you're ...\nYou're you're out of Cleveland, Ohio okay you're a an African American conservative you took a lot of heat for supporting Donald Trump house at the results are in\nAnd we're seeing all of these jobs being created for the people look at that picture over there that's the forgotten men and women of America that's what that's what twenty six team was about for me the Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps the eight million more in poverty after Obama's eight years\nNow we've got four million jobs created eight million fewer people in poverty and on food stamps we have four hundred thousand manufacturing jobs that Obama sober never coming back\nWhile the president didn't get credit when you break down boats demographically with the black community because they're never doing better they've never done better\nThank God he's going to get the votes you know a ... in the Bible nicotine was came to Jesus button night and there are a lot of ... diem is and they say listen we see what Trump is doing we embrace with Trump is going is not what they told us that waking up and you know if they say is thirty six percent approval rating\nAt twenty or thirty percent of that fifty six six six percent believe me his message is rent cream tell him as a message to let them moving the black community I come\nFrom a traditional democratic family years voted party forever blacked it in my family and our fear are now so ... to it that they're either going to not vote at all which is which is really up for\nWhat we're doing with the conservative movement or\nThey're going to vote with us because they're starting to see that this is a charade here you know the media constantly but right and President Trump for no reason they've been doing it all day today CNN blacks used to go and get their news from CNN their politics from CNN and MSNBC they're starting to see\nWe got to get in the trenches we got to figure this out so we're getting a bunch of calls from people saying hey what's going on houses going how's Trump doing this how can we help on this particular side he's going to get on the ... the black vote than any other Republican president I'll throw this day but if if we all\nBelieve in in ... the father Jesus is okay and I think all of us here do if we believe that that we all believe one thing and that predicated on that he created every man woman and child on this earth we agree with that right on okay yeah so in that sense where\nBrothers and sisters we're all Americans to right and\nIf we really believe that in every human soul God put some talent some ability\nAnd our goal is to create an environment where that that talent that natural talent flourishes ... they work for education from the Latin isn't due to bring forth from within\nThat tells you that God put it there our job is to put enough sunlight and water on something make it grow and help people and that's what I see Trump's doing and it's and it's now hitting the forgotten men and women David that's a great story of the two years of Trump so far\n[noise] yeah yes and and we want to get that what Trump is trying to do when he says I Want to make America great again he needs to restore its founding principles is Judeo Christian founding principles which is based on the idea that we're all created in God's image and that's why we had an alien Abul lights it flows from that\nBut I think the left as authoritarian by nature their economic coercion can lead to political coercion and that's where they are and I I think the left as losing it because they don't have any ideas that worked and I don't have any proposal so they're frustrated and they resort\nTo identity politics and changing the rules and this identity politics\nDividing people on the basis of race and gender is\nEvery four to them for years at the same thing rich first for versus young black versus

only did they tell Mitch McConnell to leave the country\nBut then they're talking about the guy smashed literally ripped\nIs leftovers I guess just maybe it's taken a meal home to somebody else\nAnd throws it outside the restaurant door banging on the guy's table somebody's going to get killed here you watch somebody is or hurt severely it it's going to happen then nobody on the left ever\nCan critique their own side for the rhetoric they're using Anthony Scaramucci is with us I just finished cover to cover his ... brand new book uh and it's phenomenal and it's the Inside Story about Donald Trump called Trump the blue collar president\nAnd held billionaire living on Fifth Avenue identified the struggle a blue collar Americans that won the presidency and all those are the forgotten men and the forgotten women in this country and I don't think they're liking this mob mentality I don't think they like to weigh judge Kavanaugh was treated much\nAnd I don't think they like watching this caravan of thousands marching towards our border\nI mean they they literally are mishandling everything and so what was what's happening is uh the the president has almost like this light showing like you know you and I were out on Long Island in the summer or parents would hang up that insect light well the president has that the Trump Twitter insect light and they're all going towards\nAnd they're vaporizing Senator Warren she's got to get a DNA test\nShe's less of a Native American than you or me into the vapors ... big caravan issue the way they're handling the care of an issue it's the galvanizing his base that Kavanaugh's thing was absolutely ridiculous they were making up one story after the next they figured okay me too movement seems to work there is no due process in the meat you meant\nLet's take this guy that's a very well credentialed judge\nHe's got an impeccable adult life let's try to destroy him\nGoing back to Nineteen eighty one in Nineteen eighty two and so again right into the Trump Twitter insect vaporized or so so for me I'm enjoying this the polls are tightening of and the president's base is actually going to turn out in much higher percentages and people predicted and so\nOnce again he's going to defy logic here I think we are very good chance to possibly ah keep the house we're certainly going to gain seats in the Senate and it couldn't happen\nWithout the energy and the for tutors for a President Trump\nWell if they do it when I'll say this he's carrying a lot of these people on his back but you know what I feel like Nancy Pelosi the dangers are what we're going to have endless investigation higher taxes keep Obamacare open borders\nAnd the president is is battling back on all these ... and Guatemala Honduras El Salvador he says there or not we're not able to do the job of\nStopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to the U.S now we will begin cutting off substantially reducing the massive foreign aid we routinely give them and Trump tweeted out every time you see a caravan of people the illegally coming are attempting to come into our country illegally\nThinking blame the Democrats are not giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws\nRemember the midterms it's so unfair to those who come in legally and he's right um well and and we don't know anything about the people that are coming here we don't know when when one thing about them and I know the media can be sympathetic 'cause they want but you know who might mix in with the people that maybe just want a job is a big problem for us\nBut but it's but you but here's the other thing okay the American people intuitively know Sean that it's not just all it is is he or she is recognizing with the legendary Milton Friedman one set about any country\nIf you have a welfare state in the United states does have one you need to protect your Puerto Rico's free market forces dictate that people will cross over that border\nTo participate in your welfare state and so\nEvery country has a strong border and so should the United states so I don't get\nA you know I'm I'm I'm I'm promoting my my uh my vote today in the last couple of days model a lotta left leaning shows and they go they go nuts so crazy on the president's response all you want to illegal immigration you have democratic and Republican presidents\nAnd democratic elected officials that of voters it was I don't understand why just enforcing those laws\nHave everybody saw ... ... ... well could there anthropology\nSo why don't they well it's a lot of things are we better off economically than we were two years ago by\nEvery single objective measure the answer is yes the growth of the economy consumer confidence jobs created the number of people leaving food stamps or out of poverty eight million Americans so you know by every measure and more bottom\nThe bottom ... percent of the society shot the wages of five and a half percent according to the wall Street Journal over the last Eighteen months but as a direct result of the president's policies but also the fact that he cut the slack at the border\nAnd so he made it tightened up the labor supply and it's giving lower middle class families shot now have real living wages\nWell that's the story that you actually tell in the book by the way Anthony Scaramucci is with us author of the brand new book it's out today we put it up on Hannity dot comments on Amazon dot com and bookstores everywhere it's called Trump the blue collar president I first heard that term from one of his sons of his either Erica Don I don't remember those Donnie\n... get hit and he called them the blue collar billionaire yeah and I said ... Don if you don't mind going to hijack the nickname and just switch out billionaire and put it in President because at the end of the day he resonates with these people for a reason\nYeah look I I I think it is and you talk a lot about his background you you talk a little bit about your family background it's similar to my background and and it's amazing because the only thing that I really care about what motivates me it's not politics itself it's not a game to me\nBecause the policies that we have in a country as we do now greatly impact whether or not people are on food stamps or whether or not there are jobs we now in two years\nHave us a scenario that is not unfolded in this country since Nineteen sixty nine and that is we have a million more jobs than we have people on unemployment you know that I identify with that that's what you identify with you you did not have any kids that are in your mouth\nAnd you know I saw it as a dishwasher at twelve and and look what you started I you know\nSean Sean listen I mean I think that's the message and I think that's the reason why you're so incredibly popular at the end of the gay America is about aspiration in America is about passing the ... the the baton to a next generation of Americans that\nCan do better than ourselves and that's what our grandparents did for our parents and our parents did for you and I and and the cat that the right policy shift of white free market based motivating market incentive policies on because what we both know is that you cannot system ties\nOr through a political system created equal outcomes never happens black markets crop up\nAnd then there's a thin layer at the tippy top that are living better than everybody else and everyone else has devastated whether it's Cuba or Venezuela place like that\nYou know the real danger so I don't know how this is all going to play out but we we see all weekend long these mobs you know really making and get an unsafe environment for anybody to even go get a bite to eat if you're a public figure which was really sad I mean when you're doing it in front of people's wives\nIt's not only sad it's pathetic when you're going after Pam Bondi Sarah Sanders and our kids and\nSecretary Nielsen and all she does all they're doing is trying to sit in a restaurant and have something to eat telling you know one group of Americans they're not want it here in any way what are you doing here get out of this you know they're going after in uh Ninety year old guy Henry Kissinger now who served his country with honor and distinction\nIs that it seems like there's no limits here but there's no moderation left either ... and the Democratic party ... used to I used to think Democrats at least they on paper they said they cared about the American working men and women but apparently they don't\nHave to losing the argument then you have to suppress the other side's argument in other words if you're wrong on the facts and your ideology is going to create\nUnequal outcome so you know bad society uh even though it sounds great on paper all of your ideas when they meet contact with reality or disaster for a country a person a citizen then you've got to suppress the voices of the other people it's happened to me it's happened to me on a college campuses\nIt's happened to me I'm Around the country when I'm traveling\nI'm cool with it I'm up for the fight of it are both the you know when you know what's great about the people just want you to think of as it's Ninety five percent\nOf these professor Sean or liberal but about forty five fifty percent of the kids are conservative so they're not buying into the Malone\nYeah All right stay right there by the way the books phenomenal I read it cover to cover Anthony Scaramucci is with us Trump the blue collar president\nUh you know it's interesting you look at the jobs created who's benefitting when we create manufacturing jobs in factory jobs\nAre and we bring an industry back to America and we incentivize businesses to invest here well that's the forgotten men and women the Thirteen million under Obama\nThe additional Thirteen million that were on food stamps and after eight years of his presidency and the eight million more Americans that were in poverty after eight years of his presidency well now we have for a million new jobs in eight million fewer people in poverty and on food stamps and so dramatic turn around\nAnd they're back happily working and some are getting career jobs and opportunities that we were told was never coming back\nQuick break right back well continue more the mood Scaramucci on the other side she is the Senate candidate\nAmerican War hero Martha mix Sally from Arizona will join us immigration obviously a big issue out there and we'll talk to her and much more straight ahead [noise]\nAmerica will do\nWhat we can now\nFor the freedom of bad [noise]\nGetting fire the museum at the John F.
