I walked off the CNN uh they they stuck branded in the middle of a broadcast they said that he was going to talk about the device that was ... which I thought was a good idea the general public some insight as to profiling\nPackaging whatever the case may be\nUm and then he got on for a ten minute blast of the president\nI just think it's bizarre I think it's way over the top I said\nThey're going to get what happened in Bernie you if you're sitting on the set of CNN explaining in detail than you left in they'd send cameras following him for ten minutes\nI ... what happened I was on the sec we were already introduced to do a segment on on the devices and the investigation and then they interrupted and said that was going to speak about specific device being sent that was sent to CNN and his name um but then he got on\nAnd he went on this ten minute tirade against the president's\nYou know I didn't have any objection to him being on I thought this was a guy that has credibility in the agency that could talk about profiling could talk about targeting could talk about packaging could talk about what to look for give the general public some real insight as well but\nBrandon is referred to the president as a traitor and Britain is up to his eyeballs and all the corruption involving the deep state\nAnd he went on a tirade against the president so I took the ear piece off I took the bike off and I walked off and the producers chased me down the block trying to get me to come back they were calling me\nBut you know what enough is enough already listen this is a time you

cabinet hearings say we'd better clear the halls of Congress\nSomebody's gonna get hurt somebody's gonna get killed and no one will hold you know the rhetoric gets ratcheted up and then those people that were silent when it's a Republican\nNow or oh this is outrageous we can't have this kind of rhetoric this is this is horrible he can't fake news they are fake news\nThough they are and we need to keep using that phrase and I'd also like to congratulate the commission of just doing what he did yesterday that was a cabin or moment whether you stood up the truth I I just like one person on the

a day go twenty five now till the top of the hour only twelve days until the important mid term elections\nYou know it had been and even I fall into this even though I tell you don't fall into this I had been reading the polls and I kept seeing a mansion is up by ten I don't see the seat and play and\nObviously an election year conversion he votes for Kavanaugh which was a good bowl with the right thing to do um but with that said um now it is a to point raised two polls I've looked at\nOne with mansion up and the other with his opponent the attorney general of West Virginia Patrick Morrisey up and that means that West Virginia is now in play that means that Joe Manchin can be replaced\nA joining us now is the attorney general\nThe great state of West Virginia Patrick Morrisey sir congratulations there seems to be a very big comeback I'm early polls didn't look good in the beginning but I guess maybe we're getting more accurate polling as we get closer to a election day\nWell Shawn thanks so much for having me on and\nI think what you're seeing in West Virginia is that voters are really focusing on the differences between the candidates as you can see from my ads I'm a conservative fighter will help advance the Trump jobs agenda and mansions or dishonest Washington liberal\nThe more and more people drilled down on mansions record he's starting to lose support so we feel very good and we're going to win on election day we just have to keep out working on the way we out\nYou know I was really worried during the Obama years about our friends in West Virginia because of the the burdensome regulation driving coal miners out of business you know it's one of our our best resources and we have clean coal and we have\nYou know people brave enough to go in the minds I have great admiration for anybody that does that because frankly you know you go so deep into the ground and it's dangerous work\nBut it's but energy in the life a lot of our economy and once Donald Trump got elected which by the way would have never happened and Joe Manchin on his way 'cause he supported Hillary Clinton um you know look at what happened at the state of West Virginia all those coal mining jobs are coming back thank God\nFor well thank goodness for President Trump and I have to tell you I spent a lot of the last six years suing the Obama administration uh Shaun we were the office that took the lead nationally to go against the Obama power plant one that very big victory at the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd you look at Joe mansion Joe Manchin supported Hillary Clinton even after she said we're going to put a lot of coal miners in coal companies out of work so on the issue of coal on the issue of life on the second amendment\nThere couldn't be a bigger contrast in America between two candidates and the more people are hearing about that the better off we are and I basically have help serve as a rage to President Trump's really\nStrong policies that West Virginians really appreciate and so that's one of the president's coming very strongly behind me he knows I'm going to be a staunch advocate for his agenda because it's good for West Virginia\nYou would know better than I probably should have looked at before having you on today uh I meant to actually at one point what percentage of the time those Joe Manchin boat with Chuck Schumer and the Democratic party\nObjection plump founding board member of the essence project and my new podcast is wrongful conviction available on our heart radio on wrongful conviction I interview a different exonerate every weekend and help them to tell their incredible stories of tragedy and triumph against impossible I mean you've got to hear to believe in\nWrongful conviction from my heart

similar artist now on a Del Rio\nDe Janeiro all the\nVoice of freedom and the links\nShock twelve hundred Boston dot com\nAnd as we continue more of the Sean Hannity show eight hundred nine four one Sean is our number Paul is in Ohio Paul you're on the Sean Hannity show glad you called sir\nYes sir thank you for taking my call what's going on how are you\nA good good I at first of all want to thank you for your exposure of the left and liberal for you know who they really are and\nUm the the reason I'm calling today is concerning a repeal and replace\nObamacare oh I Know other stories or you know kind of taking the lead now but we really don't share a whole bunch about a repeal and replace much anymore it was just wondering if you could give us an update about what Republicans are doing if\nIf we in two weeks you have a ... a more Republican senators which I think is very very possible and west\nVirginia being and plays huge if we can hold on to the house you know it doesn't matter what the margin of we hold on which is far more difficult I'm worried more about the house races than the Senate races\nIf we can get those two victories I guarantee you that Obamacare will be repealed and replaced and then we're going to have by the way preexisting conditions a big lie that's being told all over the country or the Republican bill dealt with pre existing conditions nobody's going to be denied coverage because they have a preexisting condition but\nYou know innovative solutions like we've been talking about\nBeen able to get Dr Josh ... outlets Seventy\nIn front of a lot of politicians that all love the\nParadigm he's created in Wichita he's duplicated in and close to five hundred cities now and that is fifty bucks a month the unlimited concierge care for adults Ninety five percent productions in in pharmaceuticals\nOr even breast cancer medicine certain medicines he's getting for six bucks a treatment for people and you couple that with catastrophic care which is very inexpensive in case you have a heart attack a cancer or a bad car accident\nAnd you have the best concierge charity ever dreamed up twenty four hour access to a doctor\nOr your primary care doctor you get your check ups every year you got great reduction and pharmaceuticals and if something really really bad happens you have the hospital care at a very reduced rate because it's it's catastrophic it's only for the worst case scenario\nAnd it's much less expensive so I think all of that health savings accounts there all the table and I'd love to see that for every American imagine\nConcierge blue ... medical treatment for every American we can do that but it's not going to happen top down from the government you know or if you block grant the money to the states where you have you know fifty states have been a base\nAnd let me tell you what's going to rise to the top those they're going to want to turn over every nickel in those states to make it work for the people of those states or they're not going to be in power and I think that is far more economically efficient so there are a lot of good ideas I was disappointed with the Republicans last time we know John McCain had a chance to to fix this and decided against it last minute\nBut does the president's not done the individual mandate is done thankfully things to the tax bill that was passed\nUm but we've got a lot more work to do on it absolutely just like you need to fund the border wall that's also something that'll get done if we hold the house and Senate in in twelve days are but I'm focused on these house races all say it again\nEvery single house race matters some more important than others we put up the most important on my website Hannity dot com\nAnd the top races that are going to tip the balance of power in the house of representatives but you know if you don't get out and vote in every ... we have four hundred and thirty five house races in play here even if you think your guy said go vote even if your guys behind go vote\nDon't take don't leave it to chance Democrats are going to come out as soon as we have history working against us\nBut I Do believe that we can pick up the Senate seats look I think we can win Florida real little behind them Florida with Nelson and with the Centers for governor Marsha Blackburn who's going to join us later she can and should win Tennessee Claire McCaskill should lose to Josh Hawley\nA Dean Heller needs to hang on in Nevada uh we definitely need more than ... Sally war hero against this radical Christian seminars nope no problems with Americans joining\nJihad to use and and joining the Taliban and then of course we've got Montana tests or has a lead at this point but that's still in play a Heidi Heitkamp is down by double digits\nA and Joe Donnelly is case he should be removed\nAnd we've got a good candidate brought against him but people can't waste their vote on the libertarian candidate in Indiana or else that's going to be a problem Bob Menendez can be beaten in New Jersey he's only up to three\nBob Menendez could be the big surprise of the night second big surprises a night is Joe Manchin losing in West Virginia you know the state uh most worried about to be very honest as Florida\nBecause this guy Gillum is a radical socialist leftist if elected governor is going to ruin this great state [noise]\nAnd you see all the prosperity and all the money that has been flowing into Florida\nStart dissipating almost immediately and you're going to businesses packing up and leaving in anticipation of what Gillum would do to the state not a good idea I we got to take a break we'll come back eight hundred nine four one Shawn Otto

Republicans on these mobs and most of the Democrats have been silent\nWell you're right but they always go at things with a double standard and it doesn't matter what the issue is whether it's something the legislative slaves that were working on or something that is political and Sean what they want to do is say look our\nOur outcome our ends justifies the means that we're using to go

embarrassed whether they were not but of course you know and then they start saying\nWell it ... it was our campaign my campaign that put somebody in there which is not this was a project maritime project they started saying well all these other excuses but the polling as they got caught and they got caught saying we made this decision\nBecause we want to go fool people about where he is don't
