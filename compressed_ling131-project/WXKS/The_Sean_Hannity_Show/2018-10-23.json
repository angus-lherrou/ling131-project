the world would vote for Democrats why would you vote for anybody\nThat is promising to wipe out all the progress why would you vote for any party that wants to literally shut down the progress and here's what the more ... had to say it's\nBecause of the media probably shot I mean I think that could be one of the main reason that most people predicted that the house and so forth goes to the other side but the president is demonstrating that he can get the voter turnout\nEven in a midterm election and so I think can be very close I mean you're not going to be surprised to our friends are

who attracted as many people to as many different rallies as Trump has this year\nI was just an astonishing achievement and I think it bodes very well ah for the impact that he's going to have on both this year's election and on two on two thousand twenty\nWell let's talk about what do we do about this caravan [noise] you know they're ... by foot they make it in what three weeks three and a half weeks but\nOne thing that I think we both agree on is that I don't want a crisis precipitated at the border but goes Mexico is allowing this caravan to march through their entire country\nAnd we have no choice but to guard our borders because it's our sovereign land I wear a nation of laws and I do and in the process\nThe people on that side of the border that are not respecting our laws could they could precipitate a crisis where innocent people get hurt and I don't want that to happen right is that better\nSo so now you understand psychologically what Abraham Lincoln and went through between Eighteen fifty eight\nAnd a the spring of Eighteen sixty one and he says again and again you know we do not have to fight as soon as this this was you know you aren't going to choose\nSaid I'm not going to choose on I'm going to defend the constitution and do my duty but I'm not choosing to fight\nBut if you give me no choice I won't have no choice and I think this this is I think\nOne of the great chest that President Trump is going to face because\nHe he when he talks about a person the other day he doesn't want anyone hurt he feels this very deeply\nOn the other hand he has sworn to protect the United states he has sworn to uphold our borders and and I tweeted this morning to manage money if if the president is serious\nThe Mexicans only have two choices then you can deal with the caravans now in southern Mexico for when the president blocks them from entering the United states\nThey can deal with them in northern Mexico and if you ask yourself this simple question if they literally can't get across the border they're stuck in northern Mexico\nWell and I think our our position ought to be that Mexico this decide whether I Want us to deal with them now he wants to deal with them when they were turned back the border but under no circumstances\nShould we accept them in a City College done some brilliant legal work on the fact that the president has the authority\nTo block aliens that he'd dean should the national threatened always got to say it doesn't have to defend this decision as to say I did this to be unacceptable for national security reasons and that

defend themselves and be they're going to react like that just caught then they're going to get past and somebody's gonna get hurt\nAnd I couldn't agree more and it is a danger for people in the public square and especially people who hold themselves out as Christians whether you're a pastor or you have a Christian themed blackout you really gotta be careful at it but we do anyway we need to be settled and and when some people on Twitter ... and our other interactions\nBut I don't think that means we don't fight I don't think it means we don't uh communicate our ideas as passionately and as intensely as the ... that we don't have to get his dirty as they do\nWell I look I don't know I I we just had Newt Gingrich on and past and what he was saying is between Cavanaugh I mean all these American\nValues that have have served us so well due process presumption of innocence and then you see that there was no core operation any of these charges\nIf the Democrats really cared about the issue they'd be going after Keith Ellison right now demanding an FBI investigation of and Cory Booker would be having an FBI investigation and Claire McCaskill's husband would be having an FBI investigation\nAnd Bill Clinton would be in jail for the rest of his life but\nThey're obviously playing politics with with very important issue so the hypocrisy is there but between Kavanaugh the mobs the caravan that's happening and the fact that we've had on parallel economic success\nFourteen state record for states record low unemployment record low unemployment for African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workplace are vets record low unemployment youth unemployment lowest ever I I'm hoping that people factor that in in fourteen days when they vote or if they vote early\nI think the man on the street will factor then I don't think the people on the street are stupid Democrat or Republican then that stupid the party leaders are stupid you know but the man on the street they're able to see this process that they know that Kavanaugh was that whole cabinet issue was a sham they see the hypocrisy of the left on full display\nThey know that this a caravan is not simply a random\nOccurrence that you know a a all these unconnected people just randomly deciding to all walk thousands of miles to America to look for better jobs they can see the orchestrated now some people are going to vote the party regarding this but the others they say listen I'm tired of this because all of the nonsense seems to be coming from the left\nAnd the very behavior that they pretended to criticize they've put it on steroids and I ... so you know they said well we don't like the some of the behavior the president during the campaign but you say that I have it to another level and you're you're ...\nYou're you're out of Cleveland, Ohio okay you're a an African American conservative you took a lot of heat for supporting Donald Trump out at the results are in and we're seeing all of these jobs being created for the people look at that picture over there that's the forgotten men and women of America\nThat's what that's what twenty six team was about for me the Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps the eight million more in poverty after Obama's eight years\nNow we've got four million jobs created eight\nMillion fewer people in poverty and on food stamps we have four hundred thousand manufacturing jobs that Obama sober never coming back while the president didn't get credit when you break down votes demographically with the black community because they're never doing better they've never done better\nThank God he's going to get the votes you know a ... in the Bible nicotine was came to Jesus button night and there are a lot of ... diem is and they say listen we see what Trump is doing we embrace Trump is doing is not what they told us that waking up and you know if they say is thirty six percent approval rating\nAt twenty or thirty percent to the fifty six sixty six percent believe me his message is recording tell him his message was moving the black community I\nCome from a traditional democratic family years voted party forever blacked it in my family and our fear are now so ... that they're either going to not vote at all which is which is really good for would do it with the conservative movement or\nThey're going to vote with us because they're starting to see that this is a charade here you know the media constantly but right and President Trump for no reason they've been doing it all day today CNN blacks used to go and get their news from CNN their politics from CNN and MSNBC they're starting to see\nWe got to get in the trenches we got to figure this out so we're getting a bunch of calls from people saying hey what's going on houses going how's Trump doing this how can we help on this particular side he's going to get off the black vote than any other Republican president I'll throw this day but if if we all\nBelieve in in God the father Jesus is okay and I think all of us here do if we believe that we all believe one thing and that predicated on that he created every man woman and child on this earth we agree with that right okay yeah so in that sense where\nBrothers and sisters we're all Americans to right and if we really believe that in every human soul God put some talent some ability\nAnd our goal is to to create an environment where that that talent that natural talent flourishes the word or education from the Latin is in today to bring forth from within\nThat tells you the God put their our job is to put enough sunlight and water on something make it grow and help people and that's what I see Trump's doing and it's and it's now hitting the forgotten men and women David that's the great story of the two years of Trump so far\n[noise] yeah yes and and we want to get back what Trump is trying to do when he says I Want to make America great again it means to restore its founding principles is Judeo Christian founding principles which is based on the idea that we're all created in God's image and that's why we had an alien Abul lights it flows from that\nBut I think the leftist authoritarian by nature their economic coercion can lead to political coercion and that's where they are and I I think the left is losing it because they don't have any ideas that worked and I don't have any proposal so they're frustrated and they resort\nTo identity politics and changing the rules and this identity politics dividing people on the basis of
