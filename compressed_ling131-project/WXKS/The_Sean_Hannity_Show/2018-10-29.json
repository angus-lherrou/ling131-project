something or yeah or like making people go she does support the wall and the other day I don't know but as though I don't say that she doesn't\nReally want them to kind of people don't really

do and\n\nElse going\nOn\nAnd tell me what\nThey do they want to be like\nYou know the amazing\nThis is now number three British send the phony fake bony fraud wire hypocrite from Tennessee you got Claire McCaskill the pony lying hypocrite manipulate trying to manipulate the voters in Missouri and Heidi Heitkamp will be a super liberal but she's not going to tell you that until after the election\nAnyway project beret toss it CEO founder James O'Keefe strikes again how are\nYou [noise] hey Sean great to be with you and yeah this is number three it's it's more of the same this Heidi Heitkamp director in\nWashington DC campaign office uh speaking candidly about when she gets elected she's going to go really hard left she'll be quote super liberal unquote at that point so he's describing the bait and switch that once again the red state Democrats have to do in these battleground states to get elected\nWhat's so amazing is the consistency here is that is that they are telling their staff one thing they're saying things privately that they'll never say publicly\nIn the hopes that they came basically lie to bamboozled whatever term you want to use the voters in their state in the case of Brett is an even calling the people of Tennessee ignorant in the hopes that they'll get that seat and then they'll they'll be a a basically a Chuck Schumer senator for that state\nYeah just so that your listeners if you haven't seen every video\nA there's a video in Missouri we did where where they were talking about Obama's using Claire McCaskill's views and the staffer says Obama and the ... will have the same user and everything but quote people just can't know that well in this video this video released last night on your show Sean there's this another guy Gordon is his name he's the staffer\nIn and Heidi Heitkamp Fargo North Dakota campaign office\nAnd we and we see an Obama poster in the office there's a big one of those are the Obama looks like the messiah on the wall this big poster but then they took it down right before the press came so we asked why did you take your mom poster down and the staffer says well because the presses here\nAnd and we take it down when the press calms is what Heidi Heitkamp staff saying\nSo it's more it's basically the same thing in each of these red states\nThey have to mislead they have to want to moderate voters in play to the progressive base well we just have them on tape saying it we all know that Heidi is is liberal but\nShe's going to be selling liberate once you get selected that her staffers are emphasizing it here and they also say that she's not going to run again so because this what Jesse over and says in the studio quote she doesn't want to run again so she'll just do good work while she can which means that she'll do the things that she can't talk about right now\nIt's just so revealing but I I think this is really this is not an accident that you're getting very similar responses and every place you have now gone\nI mean these are three big huge massive Senate races and you have caught three major Senate candidates all admitting that they ... they're lying to the people of their state to get elected\nBut I Would argue that it ... represents the entirety of the Democratic party we now know what goes Maxine Waters told us that are parties pulled or they don't want me to say it they want me to stop saying it but I'm not going to stop saying it impeach forty five ... well that's it yeah but\nIt's ... it's particularly true in these red states there's a there's a kind of a story here that we found that were confirming suspicions that well that's what we do it very possibly confirms suspicions and we've always known to be true but my point is just have integrity\nDoes it it's not really a left or right thing\nI was at this first them and conference with all these big hon chosen media\nWho were you know very cheering and and hearing it may I suggest have integrity this is about just doing what you say you're going to I think it's more pronounced in the red states with these Democrats running because they have to lie to the moderates they have to work with the moderates and they and they could only make one choice\nOnce but if you're not really a choice it's lying is this a purposeful misinformation and propaganda campaign 'cause they have no intention of doing what they say they're going to do\nThey have a very different agenda the people working for them know that they have a very different agenda and so they're really just lying manipulating I mean it is the worst of the worst in terms of politics\nBecause there's an open contempt hatred and a feeling of superiority that Claire McCaskill has that bill Brett isn't hasn't Heidi Heitkamp as towards the people of their state Penn well they\nDo it's so hateful showing that Claire McCaskill has asked for a special prosecutor to look into me he asked her opponent Josh Hawley who's the attorney general I've never met Josh I yeah I don't I don't he doesn't work for me I never talk to anybody and his staff but McCaskill ask to be a special prosecutor to investigate project ferret tossed\nTo investigate hair on camera speaking her own words or are there any restrictions in the state of Missouri about so many people\nKnow I Know and it it it's in a hurry to the attorney general asking for me to be investigated his like someone telling you not to go on the radio in talk it's it's it's\nIt's it's perfectly legal for me to do what I Do in Missouri there ...

if you find yourself in a building with an active shooter\nWould you prefer that there are that you know that there are trained professionals in that building with firearms as a first line of defense especially knowing that most of these shootings are over ... seconds\nAnd even when you get the best response times from the greatest police departments it's usually by the time they get there it's ... it's they're just counting the casualties and and trying to protect and in an orderly fashion those who either or injured or weren't injured\nSo it's a thought um it's been used before but that's not our big story of the day the saddest thing I watched all we got to watch very closely\nAnd even hearing my name brought up a number of times and you know I'm just shaking my head because people

senator what's that guy's name from Connecticut again Blumenthal\nWhen I was coming out there was it was in the middle of the Capitol hearing you know I don't I don't understand being rude to somebody just because you have a political disagreement\nWe had a very pleasant conversation I invited him on my show I don't know what came of it but\nNothing obviously but I don't know if we're thinking about it what is the point of being rude to people are getting in people's faces says Cory Booker Spartacus says why is there this anger out there that we have you know all these bombs that are sent out\nThe first one went to George Soros and I said that day I said this this has got to stop\nAnd George Soros is no fan of Sean Hannity's funds groups that wants me to be silenced and go away but that's not what we do in this country we protect people you're allowed to have political views and spend your money the way you you see fit in life\nAnd even if it's being spent is islands me you know what I still believe in freedom\nOr the ... you know I don't want to see any politician hurt and I have consistent consistently over the years said that when President Obama and people you know threatening him and people race how do we let how does somebody get into the White House says that happened\nWe've got to protect our elected officials we have one president at the time we got it that represents the United states and that represents all of us\nAnd at the end of the day the powers in the ballot box but you know you watch something like what happened this weekend and you watch the Democratic party their lap dogs in the media wasted no time you know trying to politicize this terrible shooting over the weekend pin blame the massacre\nOn President Trump look if the\nPresident says fake news is not serving the people of this country you can chronicle it you can watch it they don't see it which is sad their abuse and they're biased and they're abusive a platform\nBut the reality is they lie and they have an agenda and it's constantly on display at is not in any way shape or form of calls for violence\nSocial media Pittsburgh shooter guy Rodney ... hours by the way he hated President Trump which is barely getting any play they're making you assume that he was must have been a Trump supporter\nNot only attacking people of the Jewish faith but President Trump for his closeness he hid this shooter hated the fact\nThat President Trump and I think he can make an argument after so many presidents had promised to make Jerusalem the capital of Israel\nThat this president has has aligned with Israel more than any other president in modern times you know Trump surrounded by a slur for Jewish people\nAnd then he the this killer lamenting there's there's no maggot as long as there's a you know bad word of a quote infants to infestation\nBut despite those facts you have people\nYou know pretty close to blaming the president and conservatives for the

defender and rightly so of Israel\nAnd Jewish civil rights anyway drew linked this morning and pointed out something the very few are willing to say and he said a day after a man killed eleven people in Pittsburgh synagogue he criticized presidents Obama and Clinton as well as Keith Ellison\nThis is Alan Dershowitz\nAnd he went on Fox and friends this morning there can't be any tolerance for anti Semitism we have to have zero tolerance President Obama meets with Eric ... they hit the picture for eight years\nShame on him now we have the picture President Clinton sits on the same platform with ... shame on him\nKeith Ellison joins with Farrakhan Farrakhan one of the greatest purveyor of anti Semitic hate just because he's black doesn't give him a pass on anti Semitism and any liberal who has any positive association with Farrakhan as part of the problem not the solution\nThe Pittsburgh master comes just two weeks after ... you know called Jewish Americans termites and that's mild compared to the the anti Semitism anti Semitism in the past and is that racism as well\nYou know there's there's rarely bashing Trump painter Linder SARS sore after the ... massacre in Pittsburgh where hearing where new calls\nTo have a national conversation well as long as we don't overlooked some of the obvious suspect\nYou know if you look at some of the ... the history now with the

paper those for federal country illegally and those who employ them disrespect the rule of law and they are showing disregard for those who are following the law\nWe simply cannot allow people to pour

responsible pathway to earn citizenship\nAll right no news roundup information overload our eight hundred number one show and if you want to be a part of the programs amazing the criticism that has been out there or what should be good coverage of the president President now sending up to five thousand troops to the border\nOr a significant display of solidarity for our sovereignty our borders the rule of law as he should\nWe saw about a week ago when at the Guatemala and Mexican border that\nLet people got to the border knock down the fence charged over the police and walk right through Mexico and we now have estimates as high as fourteen thousand people maybe less somewhere in there in around that area that are trying\nTo make it to the southern border the United states and the president and the secretary of homeland security of made it perfectly clear the vice president made it perfectly clear\nThat that's not going to be allowed to happen and we're a nation of laws to turn around\nThat to do with the right way to do with the legal way and in spite of that the marchers keep coming although the president of Mexico did make an offer for\nSome of the migrants if they wanted would be given special consideration to work in southern Mexico a but not many takers apparently according to what I read this weekend you know a lot of people have been asking well okay how did they get so organized to organize them and who's financing all of this\nUm there's been a lot of conspiracy theories that I've never believed that the only one that made any and it's not a conspiracy I'd I'd when the vice president said last week\nThat he felt that some of the leadership\nIn Honduras was responsible for promoting the caravan and some countries are from South America Venezuela particular we're we're helping a finance some of this\nThat's the only bit of information that I found that was somewhat viable as a potential truth um anyway Sam Faddis is with us Sam Faddis he's a senior partner uh and former CIA operative with Thirty years of experience in conducting intelligence operations in the middle east South Asia Europe\nAnd he's worked against the most dangerous of terrorist organizations the planet has ever seen as extensive first hand experience with their methodology and tactics and a welcome to the program so glad you're with us thanks for serving your country\nThank you for having me pleasure\nWhat so you're you wrote a column and night but I haven't read the whole column ... my read a bit is as you think that the vice president was probably right on the mark\nWithout question what on the mark I mean there was actually good actually a great mystery here I mean the guys that organized this or folks somebody party called ... which is a Honduran Marxist Party\nA number of years ago supportive of of of the president who basically tried to overthrow the constitutional make himself all presidents for life they are in bed with the Venezuelan\nAnd laid out in front of God and everybody all over the Internet that our world and organizing a posting videos and pictures from the marks so again no great great mystery this is the work of guys allied with Venezuela Marxist and it is\nIn effect a giant covert action campaign designed to make the American\nGovernment or bad and our allies look that\nWell I mean look the America doesn't have much of a of a choice and and this has to be obvious to people ... and I'm listening and watching the comments and some people sort of\nAssociating this with ... with anti immigrant sentiment or Xena phobia or whatever the the charges it's not true all conservatives are saying we don't care where immigrants come from the president talked about a border wall\nWith a big door and that people should respect our laws are constitutional republic American sovereignty and come in and if you want to come in we just need to check out make sure that you don't come here with radical ideas that you have the ability to sustain yourself\nAnd don't need our help and then we can let you in and you could become a part of our family to the extent that you want to go through the process of maybe become a citizen I don't think that's too much to ask that's called the legal way\nWithout question this doesn't have anything to do with a Smith ethnicity doesn't have anything to do with race\nThis is yeah we're a nation of immigrants were also a nation of laws and according to legal immigration procedures period which don't simply get to walk across the border I have always wondered\nBy the way those folks that are actively don't want to control the border why is it that the only people who can walk here should be allowed to get him just added stuff if that's the principal well\nWhat I'm married I was I don't want anybody to get hurt because America the president means what he ... and\nPeople rush across our border beat at a port of entry or along the border that has not fence and that our military is on the border the military is going to be given the order to stop them now we don't want anybody hurt I don't want and I'm assuming Ninety nine point eight percent of the people coming here\nAre coming here because they come from impoverished countries and they want a better life for themselves and their family that's my guess\nBut nobody can vouch for every single person in that caravan\nAnd for the sake and safety of the American people we can't let that number of people rush across the border have no vetting of the people and sadly maybe amongst the fourteen thousand there's one or five people that come here with intentions to bring us harm\nI agree with the sun shine we don't want to hurt and also it is undoubtedly true\nThat most of these people are simply on being utilized by folks hostile to the U.S government probably been lied to the gun\nI'm told that when they get to the border will be allowed to cross on so they are being put in the in the middle of this I'm simply used as human shields on Conan harder on the behalf of\nFolks hostile to the United states that is a horrible tragedy because these are mostly just average people will be used\nNow look I Will tell you that you know what I really feel sorry for people I've taken the time I think more than any other person and media in this country and I've been down to the border Thirteen times\nAnd horseback all terrain vehicle boats helicopters I've been there I've seen gang members arrested I've seen drug warehouses I've seen tunnels built um I've I've been on the border spot one place in particular did have a wall on and fencing and I can look across the fence\nAnd on the other side and Mexico I saw nothing but poverty\nI saw ... what we would almost describe homes built surrounding will look like what we would describe as a junk yard even and then on the other side of the fence or ... million dollar half million dollar homes in San Diego\nAnd if I'm On that one side and all I see is poverty and and and ... I think I'd want to look across to the other side and I want to go over there is things looked dramatically different and better over here and I don't think Americans you know there were very open people\nBut we can't take in the world's population and we have to have the ability to control our borders and what we're asking is that people do it the right way\nAnd it really just keeps you know what's in our circular argument it's just what we have to do for our own safety\nWithout question of what you've just described is most of the world all of sub Saharan Africa most of South Asia most of Latin America is the argument here on the people who control the ... that we are supposed to allow three to four billion people move here because that is what you were actually talking about\nIf you're going to carry this to its ultimate logical conclusion obviously cannot do that we have to maintain control of horrible\nYeah All right we'll really really appreciate it Sam thank you eight

five races that they believe will be the tipping point it's actually thirty races kind of like what we have but\nThey are that they have a fight the race they've got the Republicans locked in a two hundred seats they got the Democrats locked into two hundred and five seats\nAnd the remaining seats are up for grabs in other words there are toss ups in other words if we win the speech and that means that Republicans will retain the house control the house of representatives now that would be the super when you want to go for the Senate is looking better but don't take anything for granted I think will pick up\nThe whole Tennessee with Marsha Blackburn I think we can beat Claire McCaskill Heidi Heitkamp I think Joe Donnelly can be beaten these down in the polls I Believe that Christians

a lot of motivation out there right now I think people are starting to pay attention they understand what's at stake and they went to the Democrats in November six\nWell look the issue to me are simple but we have is we know what the Democrats agenda is to impeach trumpet don't say it open borders sanctuary cities sanctuary states but don't say it people by matured but don't say that either just say work for great health care for all of making some wonderful just like\nYou know keep your doctor your plan and pay less that their agenda and they want their crumbs back\nBeyond that it's let's hide and not tell people what we really stand for because when we do we know we lose which is why all these we have now another Senate candidate will be exposing tonight we've got Brett ascend in Tennessee we've got Claire McCaskill we've got Heidi Heitkamp will unveil another senator tonight all caught on tape all three campaigns\nSaying that they purposely running as moderates but they

come out contrast that the two thousand eight where it was best case Obama and then look what happened to two thousand ten to ... mid term stink about that the voters corrected their mistake Obama last sixty three house seats and what's there to correct now\nWhat part of the Trump success story to the voters want to change\nGive the crumbs back increase to regulate its watched jobs go back
