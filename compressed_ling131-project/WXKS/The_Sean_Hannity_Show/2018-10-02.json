other one has no idea who she is and the other two people never got back to us so they can't corroborate any of this but they say they can and the lawyer keeps saying they can but she ... tracks on a

proper response you supposed to go there and the guys I just didn't do that\nYeah Pete in ...\nWho were falsely accused react exactly the way that Brett Kavanaugh did\nAh when you're graciously wrong you're angry and he expressed the appropriate to righteous indignation of an innocent man uh but the most important thing he said was I don't question\nThat ah Christine Blasey Ford was it some time and at some place sexually assaulted it just wasn't me\nSo he's he's not calling her a liar or what is essentially doing is saying she is mistaken\nFor a variety of reasons she may have conflated to different\nUh individuals or she may be projecting based on you know some uh for some reason that we don't understand a but this was a man who sounded like he was being falsely accused into can damn him for being angry\nIs to ignore human emotion\n... got\nA ... and contrast that with his response on the mark from a column interview and I was watching that very concerned I thought he was a flat aspect he was a very much to restrain and I said to myself\nAnd robotic if he doesn't quit holding himself that nobody's gonna blade and then I'm telling you nobody would've believed him if he had done that same thing but he finally somebody a coach them by ... somebody told him quit holding back or he called himself and he was masterful because no matter how many people said\nWhy she was ... she was initially blade all she was credible\nThey they believe that a ... in multiples when he testified in he totally indicated itself it was a mashable ... because I think it was thought that it\nBut what ... where does it go from here because um I have no I mean Jeff snowflake is Jeff snowflake who knows what he's running for president now and and headed up the Massachusetts New Hampshire I guess he thinks he's going to beat Donald Trump I I don't think this guy could get Fifteen votes at this point\nThen you have what Susan Collins we have no idea where she's coming down on this although she rightly said with Diane Feinstein did is unfair to everybody in the process\nAnd then you've got Lisa Murkowski I mean she was a a no vote when she was needed on numerous occasions you know I to me there's only one answer and the answers thirty five days from now and that's when\nThe American people have an opportunity to add more senators from West Virginia from Indiana from North Dakota from Missouri from Florida I'm from Arizona Nevada and but until then you know I don't know what happens I have no faith\nThat anybody really gives a rip that this man's life as been bludgeoned this family has been bludgeoned and there's there's no corroborating evidence for any of it\nBut I think we have to wait to see what happens or in the FBI's report if the investigation finds nope plausible evidence against Kavanaugh this will not only helped to restore his reputation and solidify the integrity of the United States Supreme court at large\nBut it will also give a valid reason to senators like Murkowski and Collins a and Jeff Flake and somebody like Joe mansion and and perhaps a couple of others are who are Democrats to vote in favor of Kavanaugh but I find it amazing to me\nOr that we're holding Kavanaugh to an unfair\nA standard of his behavior in high school and college as alleged I doubt very many Democrats in the United States Senate could could meet\nThat standard in some of these allegations Julie sweat Nick are preposterous on their faces you point out she's now backtracking NBC issued a statement\nSaying that uh we can't confirm any of what she's saying and in fact she's deviated now from her sworn affidavit or in her most recent interview with NBC News so you know that a claim\nWhat do you think of the view which again this statement only come out a week prior and multiple mold I mean she backtrack dramatically on very key points\nAnd when you think of the seriousness of drugging girls in gang raping them and now she while he was near the punch bowl and well he wasn't lined up for the I saw him in the hall and nobody else\nI mean she was saying this was done as a matter of course on weekends at the time or we believe that no girl that was raped no boys that saw the drug gang of girls ever told the teacher a parent a law enforcement officer\nNobody told them\nI find that go ahead Greg answer that you're still no no go ahead David\nWell I I I find that again absurd on its face as you said this is I Do uh the the sweating like\nWhile the other sweating allegations that just doesn't hold true and I think following up on what you said and it doesn't comport with human nature just wouldn't have happened that way but it was truly right there would have been held up eight after one and it for sure after multiple times

I don't know yet but uh I think that's correct as so here with the agreement or with our colleagues and Chris Coons was never part of the agreement he's a Democrat from Delaware a light Chris but he was never part of this agreement what compromise has been reached for Chris Coons he is voting no\nHe's asking for the investigation to continue our around whether or not he's been honest about it as drinking habits so Chris Coons is a non factor here Lisa Murkowski Susan Collins and Jeff Flake expressed a desire for the FBI\nTo talk to the witnesses around the Ford allegation and ... and the fall and incredibly\nIncredible lead within a week I think the FBI is about finished everybody can look that report for themselves and faith has changed anything I Hope we don't move the goalpost Geoff oh did you sing committee with the understanding that he wanted to see what the FBI found about these accusations and hopefully get this done this week\nAll right let's talk about this agreement because it was supposed to be limited in scope and now it is expanded out further we now see the ... ah your your colleague on the Senate Judiciary committee the great senator from the state of Hawaii he wants men by the way to sit down and shut up yeah which was\nPretty outrageous statement but anyway a senator Hirono now is saying she wants to know the FBI investigation into the quote I throwing report yeah\nYeah that's where we're our so my dad owns a bar\nAnd so are throwing I says like a good day in a bar so a bottom line is that solve a bunch of BS and she's not part of the agreement she voted and she's the one that said the goal was to delay\nOr the hearing long enough to get into the mid term soon and I have a Democrat replace a Justice Kennedy in twenty twenty she said that not one media outlet fed ask her what did you mean but they're agreement I just outlined it was a the three witnesses that Dr Ford named\nMess for ... isn't there any a credible leads within that world of FBI will follow 'em and that's it and we're going to vote this week\nOkay let's talk a little bit about your on the program last night on on Hannity and I thought you dropped a huge bomb shell and I was asking you look I have no idea how Jeff lakes going to end up voting in this\nI have no idea what Lisa Murkowski is going to do I have no idea what Susan Collins is going to do or they are your colleagues maybe you up some more insight than I have but to me they're the ones that met privately with Joe Manchin and they decided on this course now that it's an FBI investigation but\n... was to be limited in scope is now expanded out into other allegations but if you fall one vote short you came up with a pretty interesting and thoughtful idea that I kind of like\n[noise] well I think we've got the votes and then some but here's the question does the Republican Party abandon Brett Kavanaugh do we legitimize\nThe way he was treated at the Senate is it forty nine what I Would like to see happen is to appeal the verdict of the Senate and the November election\nAnd take it to some of these states and see if the people in those states agree with senator about Brett Kavanaugh the swap\nWould abandon Kavanaugh the traditional way of doing business is if he fell one vote short just pull the plug\nHe's never quit I don't want to quit on him so I think Trump might be different I think Trump would say listen this man it's been abused are not given up on hand less having an election to see if the vote in the Senate really represented the Trump states were Democrats a rain\nWell I mean this is the thing I mean we have people like Joe Donnelly ... he's a no he said already Claire McCaskill's know already as a matter of fact that most Democrats wouldn't know no matter who Donald Trump ... they've already against score sick yeah All right so now what's gonna happen to Bill Nelson of Florida and Joe Manchin and\nHeidi Heitkamp and Joe Donnelly and\nWell a smart question Martha ... is a great candidate for the Republicans in Arizona most served their country with honor and distinction I Hope she wins um we certainly could use a win out in Nevada or do you think this impacts the race and do you actually think you're going to get the votes and why do you think you'd get the votes\nWell number one I think we're going to get the votes because Jeff voted in committee yes I don't believe the FBI is going to find anything a relevant to this limited investigation that would show that\nThat are ... for its claims are more credible and that there's anything new about Brett Kavanaugh in terms of the investigation I Would hope they would stay consistent with this vote I think the other two Collins and Murkowski or friends they wanting the FBI to check the committee's homework I get that\nThat will be done here shortly but you're asking the hypothetical\nI Can't imagine how we would explain to the Republican Party that we gave up on Brett Kavanaugh because for one vote short when a lot of the states that led to that vote being short Trump won I Do not believe North Dakota once a highly had camp to vote no\nI agree with you\nI Am so this is why you have an election appeal the verdict of the Senate if we have to to the people of of the country in November\nLet me ask you if you've spoken to the red state Trump state Democrats that are up for reelection if you talk to any of\nThem doing it right now uh [laughter]\nSo you mean you're you're communicating Hannah though I'm not sure if they're all Hannity listeners and viewers are beyond that\nI doubt if they're lifting I think we're fine but here's the dilemma that you that this process has put us in this is about the teacher the judiciary\nThe states couldn't be higher is about the reputation of one of the finest man I Know it's about who would come forward after this debacle is about setting the tone and the standard that will destroy the ...\nAnd eat the Senate alive\nSo I Know President Trump pretty well I think we've got the votes and then some but I think he's a different kind of politician that he wouldn't let the system get off the hook that if we had to as a last resort where one vote short let's say hypothetically we would take this issue to the ballot box in about thirty something days\nThirty five we can I find that extra vote that way we would have a good nominee or have a light salvaged have a process uh saved and the people finally get to speak up here I think we're fine but you asked me a question and I thought about this yesterday\nAnd said if Brett Kavanaugh is on the ballot in some of the states I think it changes the election you see in North Dakota there's a poll out today the number one issue in North Dakota is I'm Brett Kavanaugh's nomination as far ahead of anything else sixty to twenty eight people in North Dakota North Dakota support Brett Kavanaugh\nWell it's fascinating to me that the Democratic leadership is showing no support or comprehension or understanding of what their colleagues from states that are not New York and California have to go through in terms of reelection but the reality is\nThat I Would even argue that if they do vote for Kavanaugh it's only an election year conversion and they're only doing it because if they don't the people in their state will throw him out but they'll probably go right back to to being a party line vote would Schumer at the end of the\n[laughter] well you know I'm I'm not a psychologist or political scientist I don't care as like you know I'm a bad this I don't care how you found Jesus as long as you do you know if you can figure out that Brett Kavanaugh was highly qualified and these accusations have crumbled\nAre good for you and now here's the point\nThis has become the most despicable thing I've seen in Washington and that's saying a lot it changed the face of the judiciary forever if we condone it so it's just not a complicated issue for me if we follow vote short\nA less take this to the ballot box and see what happens\nLet me ask you about this whole process now we've gone through and and I do think the Republicans and you know I'm pretty honest broker I'm pretty critical of Republicans when they're wrong I Do think that they they have handled this with the seriousness the charge deserves\nI think ... [noise] yes no I think they handled it properly because these are serious allegations but she identified in and look I won't go through the ... the entire\nWe don't need to we don't need to reach try this case I made I don't mind you've made up your mind there five accusations that have are are are not verified or just made up not true outrageous so it's not about Cabot all\nBut ... is that this is the environment we live in senator and I warn those arguments on radio and TV every two and four years\nIf you're a Republican or a conservative and you're running for office you're going to be called a racist or sexist appoint a massage it has to homophobic Xena pope Islamophobia you're going to be accused of wanting dirty air and water you're going to be accused of wanting to kill children and it's going to be all look alike of youth throwing a grandma over a cliff\nIs as predictable as the day is long and now with Supreme Court nominees\nThis slander has been taken to a whole new level you have a nice throwing incident when you were nine I mean it's ridiculous\nJudging by the think he's really good at the clinic I'd say we're doing the right thing with our retirement to ... we volunteered our community free health clinic we don't just wearing the shirt\nWe live in gift advocate volunteer living on ... by United Way as counsel\nOffices radio I'm rich Dennison Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer rejecting claims by Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell that his party is moving the goalpost when it comes to delays in the confirmation of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh coming\nFrom the same man who delayed the nomination of Supreme Court justice Merrick Garland for over three hundred days without a shrugged his shoulders give me a break a\nConfirmation vote on Kavanaugh is expected to take place after an FBI investigation into sexual misconduct allegations Kevin I'll denies those accusations President Trump telling his tentative trade deal with Mexico and Canada while in Philadelphia today NAFTA was one of the worst trade deals ever\nMade in any country at any time\nThe Dow today hitting a record high for the fourteenth time this year\nFox News [noise] we were forced to decide [noise]\n[noise]\nKnow and one thousand dollars now\nWord when two hundred two hundred\nYou'll get attacked confirming in free plus\nI hard radio info state or data and Mrs ... when I said two hundred two hundred\nNever refill final straw I don't use ...
