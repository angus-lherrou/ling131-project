targeting protection from the guy was flat out why or what do you mean the target of attacks\nFrom Trump Trump didn't attack anybody told everybody who the guy is\nAnd here is Sarah Sanders from the press briefing just now exactly as I said she got a question from John Roberts and it was all about\nDo you think that maybe the president should have done it marking her like that because it gets Collins and Murkowski it'd be the way they bowed horrible you'd think the president for maybe should have not done it\nThe president was dating the facts and frankly facts that were included in special prosecutor Rachel Mitchell's report\nHe was skating facts that were given during Dr ... testimony innocent it has to make a decision based on those facts and whether or not they see judge Kavanaugh to be qualified to hold the position on the Supreme Court every single word judge Kavanaugh has said it's been\nPicked apart every single word second my second of his testimony has been picked apart yet if anybody says anything about\nThe accusations that have been thrown against them that's totally off limits an outrageous\nExactly right young cat challenge her so Trump did for everybody else who doesn't have to go ... to do it Trump did it in yeah he's providing the little shade for some of these people hide under\n[noise] and I'll guarantee they may be publicly saying I Wish you hadn't done a Dutch outrageous what prompted their thinking everybody did it privately\nSomebody has to say it it's the freaking truth\nOkay not back to the phones and we go to Tom's river New Jersey ... is next and he is Fifteen Years old from I'm Glad you waited you're next on the program thank you for calling\nHey rushed great to speak to you again a great to have your back\nYeah it's great\nTo be on again anyways so I'm watching this whole thing on me too movement watching the Kavanaugh hearings I'm I'm Fifteen I'm just regular straight guy\nThat's into normal but I think that I really cannot believe any of these women that pop up on TV anymore you can't believe any of them were coming old guy raped me the guy did this to me did that to me you know you had to draw on CNN while the other like a couple of months ago saying that a guy raped or because he asked her for her phone number [noise]\nCan't believe any of them and I think that what this this whole me\nTo kind of white ... ... ... ... that that is my exact point I Believe that woman I Believe\nShe thinks she was raped when somebody asked her for her number that's how she's been conditioned\nWomen's studies on campus the the outright hatred for men you know I keep talking about it but it's relevant Catherine McKenna and this was back in the nineties\nShe was a professor of women's studies at Michigan She taught women in her class the oral sex is rape even the sex of marriage the women were lapping up\nAnd women have been taught for two generations now that men are basically predators and that their own kids are not safe from their fathers\nAnd it's not random it's widespread it is part and parcel of higher education today so you have a woman and she could be acting I mean she could be making this up could be a political activist but it's entirely possible at the same time after him that the cause of what she's been taught\nAnd heard on the news and talking to her she made all literally believe that men don't have no right to ask her phone number is the same thing as bullying her raping her\nThat's my point she may really believed it\nTells what rush of you know the same woman that are screaming about how they've been raped or off the ones who want to have the right to having abortions it so they could have unlimited sex\nOr have you\nEver um ah you're right sex without consequences but you better not\nThey claimed that all men are predators but then they run\nTo run up and then they want to have abortions are free\nWhether it's their idea then everything's fine yeah\nThe hook if not better right by the way here's this you're\nAlso right of it's not all women but it's been made to look like that isn't it the me too movement supposedly include women women on across America\nWho do not think this way are being lumped into this movement\nAgainst their will\nIt's just an assumption that the Democrats and the drive by media or making I think every time

I'm sure they were it was easy to find people because they already had been interviewed\nBy the Senate Judiciary committee look the the the goalpost are moving faster than the speed of light here it's it's very difficult to that to believe that any of these people\nUm it it can take themselves seriously they said it's going to be four days a week and now they're going to have an artificial that time you know they were saying the FBI the gold standard there impartial\nThere you know she said that every Democrat that now they're going up but Trump is evil puppet master controlling the FBI they're actually going to be as horrible part is an organization\nYou know it it it it is and it would be laughable if it wasn't a man's lifelong reputation here on the line [noise]\nTake your mind that are doing two weeks ago as far as everybody else knew Brett Kavanaugh had an impeccable reputation that is now that's gone forever you know re Donovan famously one said after being investigated for a year and a half where do I go to get my good name back mhm well and this case\nI I don't think Brett Kavanaugh ever gets back in many many ways\nI mean Clarence Thomas will ever be remembered because of the last minute accusations of Anita Hill\nYeah it it it's very discouraging although I have to say I I Do get some on that you know someone who clerked for Justice Thomas and knows the why he he you know there are certain ... ... people who are going to just simply use that as their excuse is counted but they would discourage them because they disagree with them anyway [noise] um\nAnd he is someone who it does ... incredible amount of respect on the bench judge Kavanaugh is it kind of person where even when he was on the DC circuit as the lower court judge the Supreme Court\nSaid it saw him as someone to really take seriously you know more than a dozen times they spoke to fourteen different times he found out they vindicated his opinion they had a huge amount of respect for him I don't think that's going to change I think um they are not going to be watching this\nWith the same knee jerk or part is in response as I Hope that that that we're seeing some some of these people are ... but I but it\nUp you know the parents to do on a reputation now\nIf you read James ... New York times piece that he came out with the ... to me it's absolutely stunning\nAnd the things that he's saying because while the FBI's pack it in the middle of it when we handled the Hillary Clinton email investigation while he was running an exoneration himself prior to the real investigation which didn't happen until three days before he publicly exonerated her\nUm but then he goes on to trash the president at length\nAnd then he talks about FBI agents are experts which they are interviewing people and quickly dispatching leads to their colleagues around the world to follow up with additional interviews\nAnd they will confront people with testimony and other towns and you know yes the alleged incident occurred thirty six years ago but it'll be ages no time has little to do with memory um which I found a little strange\nUm and then you know for example everybody remembers if it rained on their wedding day\nUh I don't think that's a political in that particular sense maybe to somebody who is traumatized I could see that but for somebody that's not traumatized maybe not um once they start interviewing every witness knows the consequences he says\nIs one thing to have your lawyers submitted statement on your habit very different thing to sit across from two FBI special agents and answer their relentless questions\nOf course the bureau won't have subpoena power only the ability to knock on doors and ask questions most people will speak to them then there's what he says refusal to do so is its own kind of statement\nNow I Want to just address that because my FBI friends my friends in the in the bureau special agents have all said to me never ever\nTalk to the FBI unless you have a lawyer ever and I'm like why I'm somebody who loves the FBI don't love the upper brass on the call me and the cave and struck and page but the FBI is is the ... the FBI people I Know the fault of the earth people and I sort of course I'd want to help him he goes no\nAnd then they say look what happened to General Flynn General Flynn is accused of lying to the FBI and the up here I didn't think he was willing to them and it's just it's dumb to ever talk to any law enforcement without a lawyer that's what all my law enforcement people friends say because it's a crime if you lie to the FBI let's say you said\nSomething in the Senate Judiciary investigation and it doesn't exactly match up you could be charged with a crime of lying to the FBI it's ridiculous\nAnd you know the the irony that says hey look he he told me coming ammo right now is just to try to destroy Trump with everything he can and it's just another another section in that play book but\nThe irony is the exact same federal law provision that says it's a crime to to lie the FBI is the one that says it's a crime\nTo lie to the Senate as their with their investigators it's not just you know a similar penalty is exactly the same statutory violation so that's just not they've been kind of pretending there's that that I guess playing a little bit on people's images maybe from the movies\nWhat the FBI does to say that that that somehow it's going to be a separate different thing what they're really doing here is there going down the same list to people\nThe Senate Judiciary committee has already talks to they're getting the same statement in some cases they might get exactly the same state 'cause the FBI can't as it is how much they can't force them to talk to them\nEspecially if all you know as I don't remember that I wasn't there they they could be dealing with taking the same exact statement from the same lawyers for the same the same individuals that that's ... that that is all we can no ... just because of the nature of this old investigation so the FBI isn't going to find anything new here that there there's my prediction\nUndemocratic IRA and that they don't have any other thing\nThey've already moved on I guess the ... and and that's the one that came out in the New Yorker piece and you know ... that's the one we're even the New York times that said they attempted\nTo interview over the course of a week several dozen people they couldn't find a link a one to corroborate her story and then saying the mist Ramirez\nContacted former yo classmates asking them if they were called the incident and told some of them that she could not be certain Mr cabinet was the one who exposed themselves which at that point tells me you know what are they investigating here if she's asking other ... she's telling other people she doesn't know what do they investigated\nThe more shocking thing is even right and it's you know right before\nThis whole um ... most recent face exploded I think it was the morning on of the vote she actually her lawyer telling people she's not even still share it with him she said well how did he was in the room\n[laughter] I'm positive he adjusted his hands whatever that means that so but I but I Can't say for certain get hit it sounds so it's even after talking to her lawyers for six days to kind of work up\nA her memory that she didn't have when she initially talked to the to the New Yorker 'cause they also said she couldn't say for sure he was there when they initially talked to her I I I'm I'm impressed there even count as a credible allegations but you know what go\nFor the FBI could talk to her um they'll they'll get their statement and I think if you look at the people if they're\nOnly getting a whole new wins and they don't make any recommendations they'll just going to give very handover the information\nThat's it the the three ... and and maybe we'll get those thrilled to we've been waiting for thrilled to forever as it relates to Bruce or and and Christopher Steele and and what was said and those conversations are Carrie Severino is where those chief counsel policy director Judicial Crisis network thank you for being ...\nThose scary we appreciate your time we're in Washington

I don't know yet but uh I think that's correct so here with the agreement or with our colleagues and Chris Coons was never part of the agreement he's a Democrat from Delaware like risk but he was never part of the ... what compromise has been reached for Chris Coons he is voting no\nHe's asking for the investigation to continue around whether or not it's been honest about his drinking habits to Chris Coons is a non factor here Lisa Murkowski Susan Collins and Jeff Flake expressed a desire for the FBI to talk to the witness\nSays around the Ford allegation and mystery Maris and the fall and incredibly incredible lead within a week\nI think the FBI's about finished everybody can look that report for themselves and see if it's changed anything I Hope we don't move the goalposts Jeff voted yes in committee when the understanding that he wanted to see what the FBI found about these accusations and hopefully get this done this week\nAll right let's talk about this agreement because it was supposed to be limited and the scope and now it is expanded out further we now see the ... ah your your colleague on the Senate Judiciary committee the great senator from the state of Hawaii who wants men by the way to sit down and shut up\nYeah which was pretty outrageous statement but anyway a senator her own out now is saying she wants in an F. FBI investigation into the quote I throwing report yeah\nYeah that's where we're our so my dad owns a bar and so are throwing I says like a good day in a bar so uh the bottom line is that solve a bunch of BS and she's not part of the agreement she voted and she's the one that the goal was to lay\nA the hearing long enough to get into the mid term soon and I have a Democrat replace a Justice Kennedy in twenty twenty she said that not one media outlets fed ask her what did you mean but they're agreement I just outlined it was a the three witnesses that Dr Ford named mess for marriage as isn't there any\nA credible leads within that world of FBI will follow 'em and that's it and we're going to vote this week\nOkay let's talk a little bit about your on the program last night on on Hannity and I thought you dropped\nA huge bomb shell and I was asking you look I have no idea how Jeff Flake is going to end up voting in this\nI have no idea what Lisa Murkowski is going to do I have no idea what Susan Collins is going to do or they are your colleagues maybe you up some more insight than I Am but to me they're the ones that met privately with Joe mansion and they decided on this course now that it's an FBI investigation but\nWe're supposed to be limited in scope is now expanded out into other allegations but if you fall one vote short you came up with a pretty\nInteresting and thoughtful idea that I kind of like\n[noise] well I think we've got the votes and in some but here's the question does the Republican Party abandon Brett Kavanaugh do we legitimize the\nWay he was treated at the Senate is it forty nine what I Would like to see happen is to appeal the verdict of the Senate and the November election and take it to some of the states and see if the people in those states agree with our senator about Brett Kavanaugh the swap\nWould abandon Kavanaugh the traditional way of doing business is if he fell one vote short just pull the plug\nHe's never quit I don't want to quit on him so I think Trump might be different I think Trump would say listen this man it's been abused I'm not given up on hand less have an election to see if the vote in the Senate really represented the Trump states or were Democrats a rain\nWell I mean this is the thing I mean we have people like Joe Donnelly he's a no he said already Claire McCaskill's know already as a matter of fact yeah most Democrats wouldn't know no matter who Donald\nTrump ... they've already against score sick\nYeah All right so now what is going to happen to Bill Nelson of Florida and Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Donnelly and well a smart question\nMartha ... is a great candidate for the Republicans in Arizona most served their country with honor and distinction I Hope she wins um we certainly could use a win out in Nevada or do you think this impacts the race and do you actually think you're going to get the votes and why do you think you'd get the votes\nWell number one I think we're going to get the votes because Jeff voted in committee yes I don't believe the FBI is going to find anything a relevant to this limited investigation that would show that\nThat are ... force planes are more credible and that there's anything new about Brett Kavanaugh in terms of the investigation I Would hope they would stay consistent with this vote I think the other two Collins and Murkowski or friends they're warning death vi to check the committee's homework I get that\nThat will be done here shortly but you're asking me a hypothetical\nI Can't imagine how we would explain to the Republican Party that we gave up on Brett Kavanaugh because for one vote short when a lot of the states that led to that vote being short Trump won I Do not believe North Dakota once a highly had camp to vote no\nI don't agree with you\nI Am so this is why you have an election appeal the verdict of the Senate if we have to to the people of of the country and November\nLet me ask you if you've spoken to the red state ... state Democrats that are up for reelection if you talk to any of\nThem doing it right now uh [laughter] so you mean you're you're communicating Hannah I'm not sure if they're all Hannity listeners and viewers are beyond that\nI doubt if they're lifting I think we're fine but here's the dilemma that you that this process has put us in this is about the teacher the judiciary\nThe states couldn't be higher is about the reputation of one of the finest man I Know it's about who would come forward after this debacle is about setting the tone and the standard that will destroy the ...\nAnd eat the Senate alive\nSo I Know President Trump pretty well I think we've got the votes and then some but I think he's a different kind of politician that he wouldn't let the system get off the hook that if we had to as a last resort where one vote short let's say hypothetically we would take this issue to the ballot box in about thirty something days\nThirty five we can I find that extra vote that way we would have a good nominee or have a light salvaged have a process uh saved and the people finally get to speak up here I think we're fine but you asked me a question and I thought about this yesterday\nSaid if Brett Kavanaugh is on the ballot in some of the states I think it changes the election you see in North Dakota there's a poll out today the number one issue in North Dakota is I'm Brett Kavanaugh's nomination as far ahead of anything else sixty to twenty eight the people in North Dakota North Dakota support Brett Kavanaugh\nWell it's fascinating to me that the Democratic leadership is showing no support or comprehension or understanding of what their colleagues from states that are not New York and California have to go through in terms of reelection but the reality is\nThat I Would even argue that if they do vote for Kavanaugh it's only an election year conversion and they're only doing it because if they don't the people in their state will throw him out but they'll probably go right back\nTo to be in a party line vote would Schumer at the end of the\nDay [laughter] well you know I'm I'm not a psychologist or political scientist\nI don't care is like you know I'm a ... I don't care how you found Jesus as long as you do you know if you can figure out that Brett Kavanaugh as highly qualified and these accusations have crumbled\nAre good for you and now here's the point\nThis has become the most despicable thing I've seen in Washington and as saying a lot it would change the face of the judiciary forever if we condone it so it's not a complicated issue for me if we follow vote short\nA less take this to the ballot box and see what happens\nLet me ask you about this whole process now we've gone through and and I do think the Republicans and you know I'm pretty honest broker I'm pretty critical of Republicans when they're wrong I Do think that they they have handled this with\nThe seriousness the charge deserves I think ... [noise] yes\nNo I think they handled it properly because these are serious allegations but she identified and and look I won't go through the ... the entire\nNeed to we don't need to re try this case I made I don't and you made up your mind there five accusations that have are are are not verified or just made up not true outrageous\n[noise] this was\nA ... year the U.S Senate has confirmed judge Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court the votes fifty to forty eight some protesters interrupted the process as it began President Trump speaking before leaving for a rally in Kansas\nAnytime you

if allegations destroy you\nA pin the whole process\nOf the rule of law collapses over totally and it's sad to watch something like that you know I think could have been a positive constructive force and who's now frankly are becoming almost a caricature of himself\nIs certainly a lot at stake and then the next\nThirty three days and you know there's other good economic those that have come out today I mean on top of record low unemployment and fourteen states African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workforce\nA youth unemployment fifty some odd year low a we have consumer confidence all time high for a million new jobs created four million fewer people on on food stamps\nOr you see what the president's accomplish with NAFTA the new NAFTA the the new trade agreement with Mexico and and with Canada you see that he is eliminated burdensome regulation we can now drilling than war in the forty eight states uh he is literally singlehandedly save coal mining in America\nAnd of course natural gas production will now be at an all time high and we have a Wall Street journal piece today showing more Americans getting pay raises than ever before\nAnd that's the forgotten men and women that mattered in twenty sixteen the question is will they all go out and vote to protect the progress that has been made in the last two years even maybe if they don't particularly like their individual Republican congressmen or maybe think they're weak or maybe don't even know their name is\nWhy do you just put your finger on the key question of the selection I've as you know I've been involved in many many campaigns are actually going all the way back to Nineteen sixty and\nOne of the ... one of the lessons I learned was I I don't care about the polls show me the three sinks I Want to see the first real votes I Want to see who cares enough to show up and vote\nBecause that changes everything is you know we just won a\nA sixty three percent Hispanic district in a special election for the state Senate in Texas right down along the border and this we had a candidate who got lost by twenty points four years ago came back to the special in one um\nAnd is the first Hispanic Republican state senator uh in Texas and that's because people were energized enough to turn out so I Would say to everybody in our audience who this is going to come down to isn't holding\nIt isn't conversation at the coffee shop who cares enough to get an absentee ballot who cares enough to show up and vote and if our side does show up in both\nI think this could be one of the most historic elections\nThat you and I've ever covered living together for lots of elections I have a hunch this one could turn into something that we would throw us\nBehind the scenes I got to give you a lot of credit because I remember speaking with you you probably forget it the day before\nYou became speaker of the houses in Nineteen Ninety four and I remember talking to you that day and the day of the election and and you are surrounded by a group of people in Joe Gaylord and you actually shared with me the information you had and you said it was absolutely true that for the first time in forty years Republicans would take over the house\nI think you and I were two of the few people willing to go out on a limb and said yeah Donald Trump as a real shot of winning this election and\nAnd people laughed at us at the time and I I Believe that them and and we proved out to be right we also the ... both of us predicted Obama would be in a dismal failure as president based on a very rigid ideology that he seemed to be indoctrinated into\nAnd I I agree with you I think there is an opportunity here to shock the world again\nAnd it the for the people listening to this audience they're going to tune in thirty three nights from now watch election results come in and they're either going to seek ... happy liberal newscasters announcing Nancy Pelosi as speaker and\nChuck Schumer is the Senate majority leader and Maxine Waters will be the chairman of this committee or that committee and that the impeachment of Trump will go forward taxes will go up open borders will remain\nAn Obamacare stays all this or are they going to shock the world and all these people are going to do what they did in twenty sixteen and being the shock of their life\nWell that's right and I look I mean I think what would I Would say to everybody who's listening to us everybody cares what's countries richer make sure you vote makes sure your friends votes make sure everybody you know who favors\nA solid productive work oriented results oriented system make sure they go out and vote if that happens my I'm I'm not quite ready yet to predict what am I going to tell you that because of the intensity of anger\nAbout the way the liberal smear Kavanaugh the characterization the dishonesty\nI Believe we have seen and I've been looking at data for three days I Believe that we've seen a substantial shift towards Republicans now I think that they were almost certainly now going to keep the Senate and probably going to increase our ah or the total number of senators by significant margins\nHeidi Heitkamp of North Dakota who's down eleven is no on Kavanaugh to me what a fork in that race it's over\nAgain I think Kramer and it was a great great guy and I've known for twenty four years and he's got to get out there and keep campaigning I mean one one of the lessons you know I I had very close races including couple recounts and had very big raise my experiences\nAnd I say this every candidate do not quit until the polls closed and do not relax until the recount is a this is a business where big things can happen very fast the American people are in charge not Bloomberg hundred million dollars\nIt also recommend making sure to send an agenda in advance having don't it doesn't hurt either [noise]\nHuman [noise] this is\nA Fox News or I'm Joe
