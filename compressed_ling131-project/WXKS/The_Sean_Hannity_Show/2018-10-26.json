Want to remind\nYou because you know I've lived through some of this myself at all explain that in a minute but\nYou don't remember when Bernie Sanders it one of his supporters shot Steve ... shut up all these Republicans at a ball field a nearly killed Steve Scully so the fact that he's a walking miracle and I know because I knew what was what he was really going through at the time was far worse than was reported\nAnd people wanted to blame Bernie Sanders says you can't blame Bernie Sanders for what one does listen now I\nAm I'm not going to do what the left does here\nBernie Sanders is not responsible for what one of his stupid supporters have to say but this most Bernie Sanders supporters are not violent and not out there trying to kill Republicans and Bernie said he was sick and by the entire\nYou know anti GOP massacre here All right and I believe him and I said that\nAnd just like I said in the years gone by remember when the one guy broke into the White House\nWhen Obama was president and there's a there came up a number of times I have a number of tape saying that we've got to protect our politicians I'm no fan of Obama's policies but\nProtecting our elected president is is job one for all of us\nAs Americans he is our elected leader whether you like it or not and here's what I said Mr Speaker you're gonna have strong feelings about this we've now learned that this guy that broke into the White House not only did he get in the door\nBut he knocked down the secret service agent went into the three different rooms or the White House and pass the stairs that would have gone right up to the the residents of of the Obamas\nThat is extraordinarily chilling to me huh yeah I mean what ... ... you're talking about protecting the president of the United states of America and it's just there's no room for error you've got to protect our president that that represents the free world\nSo they've got a very difficult job they've got to almost be perfect and any time any incident happens ah lately has become a pretty high profile and and if we're not protecting our president we're not protecting our leaders we've got a big problem the rest of the world is watching this\nSo I said that many many times you know and I say this only because um there's this idiot\nOn fake news CNN is named my ... what's his name John Adams lawn somebody who's taken cheap

of things I found was that October Fifteen Sean Hannity was doing a whole segment blessing deniro for things he said on the Alec Baldwin show of all things and what she said that Trump allies will regret it because they made a deal with the devil so that all of a sudden becomes ... or the Robert De Niro calling the president devil and us devil worshippers it affect you know\nI'm used to play

investigations of President Trump that he won't get anything done in the last two years and you know that talk about they'll go\nThey'll go check his taxes illegal this stuff and it'll drive economy down one of the things that that you know us pollsters we get calls before the elections from hedge fund guys in for major Wall Street guys\nWhat are you seeing in the in the election well you want to know why the market's been going down the last month because they're seen that the Democrats could take the house and they know what that means the economy the economy will stall out\nWhat do you think don't shown to you in the same marry you said is getting very tight also\nI think John's analysis is exactly right I think the Democrats I actually wouldn't might even be a little bit more cautious I see between twenty five and thirty see I think that um\nAnd if they get twenty three seats that means they win the house\nThat that is correct time projecting a\nVery interesting are saying the Democrats could win by little as two seats\nYeah I Am saying that I said on your air or the other night it would be two to four I'm In the same range I think John's analysis is very very rare\nAnd I think he's right to say that the Democrats are mobilized can focus on the um on the house to the exclusion of the Senate but the amount of money that's being spent on really the thirty races I think Sean butter on your website cannot be underestimated and\nYou know mid term elections tend to be referenda on the president and the incumbent party and there's one little dirty secret it's not so much Donald Trump said as a risk it's the Republicans in the house and Senate much lower ratings than the president and it is that is the soft underbelly of the Republican Party\nIf either one of the weaknesses as it relates to also to the Republican House is there's so many retirements what are their forty five separate retirements incumbents and name recognition for a lot of people and a lot of these races is negligible zero it takes years to build up name recognition in a district John\nAbsolutely and by the way that that top thirty most important races that you put on your website [noise]\nThose are critical seats that the Republicans really need to win and and the dog is it is I mean granted the Democrats should be listening to him but fortunately for us they don't listen to him too much for one Democrat that does listen to them is former Mayor Bloomberg in New York City\nWas a big superPAC and it's putting the resources into electing Democrats in the house now that he's gone back to being a registered Democrat and the Democrats really\nDug understands it they they\nThey're very smart they're really understand how to how to win races and how to take power and the Republicans need to wake up I mean those of us who are older I remembered delivering a survey that Haley Barbour helped pay for Nineteen Ninety four in September that have we have the generic Republicans\nUp seven and that was to house leadership and there was a soon to be Speaker Gingrich with\nBob Michel was presenting the numbers to him saying you're going to be the next speaker and\nWe just need to not compromise on Clinton care well Haley Barbour\nBarred ten million dollars to help when more seats him win that election the Republicans are raising record some say the orange she has out raised a has out raise the uh Democrats their National Committee two to one of the ... that money needs to find his way into the into\nThese top thirty races that you've outlined where the Democrats are spending has virtually two to one and all those races this week and you've got to be able to put money into those races weather's digital LEDs a\nTV ads even nationally and saying stop polo see we've got to have an equal voice with the Democrats and uh uh ... they really they really are focused on trying to take over the house and it's and it's their their shot at power\nWell fish out of power but remember you know as those that have been saying the investigations into the deep state in I don't believe that's true because we have Senate committees that are just as capable of doing that as well and similarly if the Republicans were able to build their majority in the Senate any legislation that Nancy Pelosi and company want to pass\nThat is going to be against what the Republicans want in the Senate is never going to get through it'll die there and we'll have divided government but I think you're most right and the fact that it's going to be\nBasically two more years like we've had and that is endless you know ridiculous absurd obscene investigations showed trials by Adam Schiff Maxine Waters you know Gerald Gerald Nadler and company and\nIn other words the progress will will slow down dramatically now there is also the hope that Republicans in the lame duck session could actually get in there and pass the funding for the border wall and maybe repeal and replace Obamacare in the meantime\nLuck I think Sean that if that is John and I think folks that are suggesting that more likely than not the Democrats win the house what we are looking at with almost great certainty is ... ... good luck for two years\nI make a slightly different on a book on the way to work before I'm a Democrat I Know John is certainly knew Shaun I just hope we stop demonizing of doing what Maxine Waters that say\nPrompts responsible for their school work for a set of uh uh sending that the ten or twelve arms around or vice versa blame the Democrats can we focus on our national or it our borders and our future\nIf we had that I Know you've got to admit that we had the wall we didn't have to worry about the the migrant caravan worry\n... building the wall and having a pathway to ... ...\nOkay so that I Am sort of old trucker offered that deal to the Democrats that do have a dream it\nIn a heartbeat why didn't I was ... because I was pulled off the table pretty quickly when some of the Democrats said yes but goodness gracious I Would do that no heartbeat I think it makes sense or Don Lenny in Indiana is saying that and I think he's right\nO'Donnell is now down by four to broaden the libertarian candidate thankfully is falling off a little bit in Indiana anyone votes for the libertarian in Indiana you're just basically a giving a have a vote to Joe Donnelly but Joe Donnelly is in trouble I think the biggest polling surprised that we saw in the last week was Joe Manchin down by two\nPatrick Morrisey was on this program yesterday that seems like a potentially winnable race or class or the onion a mansion where\nWhen that will win that race\nFelt the same thing or two but I Will tell you mentioned didn't vote for the tax cuts mentioned didn't vote for Gorsuch it appears that mansion had an election year can conversion by voting for Kavanaugh because he knows his career would be over and more importantly the economy was saved in West Virginia coal mining industry by Donald Trump not by mansion\nAnd I think ranch and did have an election near a conversion and that's all of the good\nElection you're going to hunters and mean lets be a phony for for a couple of months they will go back to being the liberal we really are\nThat he's not really a liberal he's the most conservative Democrat\nNow Larry live on in this environment that

these devices that never detonated you know I call them I guess suspicious device is because we don't really know if they were actually bombs but it got\nMe to make sure that that's been confirmed as they when they said they had powder I'm assuming that was some type of gun powder\nOr some type of explosive powder and then had shrapnel in it like a lot of charging a glass and you know we've got to get to know a little bit more about this guy short of the van that had a CNN sucks picture on it in a picture of Donald Trump it doesn't mean a thing and\nYou know by the way I remember when I when Bernie Sanders when one of his supporters shot up that baseball field I said at the time boy if this I'm not blaming Bernie nobody should blame Bernie Sanders he's not responsible for what one does and I said but boy if it was some supporter of Trump or any Republican oh they'd blame everybody\nWe know what I mean I'm not going to do what the left does here\nBernie Sanders is not responsible for what one of his stupid supporters have to say but his most Bernie Sanders supporters are not violent and not out there trying to kill Republicans and Bernie said he was sick and by the entire\nYou know anti GOP massacre here All right and I believe him well\nIt's a different tact than you hearing from the media today right\nRight and you know what what concerns me and thank you for correcting me about the update on me I'm that bomb threats what I'm concerned about as\n... as he mentioned the van with all this stickers okay perhaps it is somebody from the far right but I'm noticing what I'm hearing is the the stick to the jury as far as how they were placed how they with no\nYou know issue with the ... south but the other thing I thought about was William Clyde ... who\nThreaten people with rice and a couple of weeks ago and he was arrested and I'm starting to question could there be a connection between those little vigilance could there be more than one person involved in this whole\nScenario that's been going on for as you well know months because the term family was threatened as well\nAs an I've gone through a lot of this it's not fun and I don't talk about it a lot of it's I've I've shared about one percent of the things that I've dealt with throughout my career and frankly I don't think anybody wants to hear it and it sadly is a part of being in the public eye and having strong political views it's on it really is unfortunate\nUm but that's why I was I think\nWhat we should be able to already should be able to do so you know without fear of any type of retribution and\nApparently that's not how it's going to work but you know look it's let's wait and see I Am getting mixed messages all over the place\nOn this man this guy this background we have to find out if there were accomplices here we were just beginning to put it together uh people can assume what they want but as we have always done is we're not going to rush to judgment at all in this program and we're going to wait and see and when we know the truth will pass it on to you\nOr we can yeah we ... we don't know\nYeah the truth matters in China I Wonder if they wanna that thing to do with respect to the invasion what concerns me about that and it's not really getting recorded much it's how many people\nAre sick and we have children dying from early on like illness is now so what talk in the brain and that's another\nIssue I you know I'm concerned about\nYou know well look we gotta we always got to stay on top of all these diseases and stay ahead of it and thank God we have
