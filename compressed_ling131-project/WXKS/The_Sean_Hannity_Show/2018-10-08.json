I think it was a great Senate candidate for Arizona surgery or country with incredible honor and distinction and\nAnd Dean Heller in Nevada and Rick Scott in Florida but these numbers today are interesting is President Trump's approval rating is now matched his all time high at fifty percent\nAnd more importantly we've got a raspy I suppose that says well the latest survey fifty six percent of likely voters agree with judge Kavanaugh statement to the Senate Judiciary committee friday of last week that his confirmation hearings had become a quote national disgrace\nWell that raises questions about what impact this might have on the midterm elections in thirty three\nBecause mid term election polling is getting more definitive the enthusiasm gap is as close to almost two dead even hold and you see Republicans and important Senate races now a dead heat in all of the states that are red states where we're Democrats where Trump is won by fairly big margins\nI'm like I'm going to do stage further I think when we see that moment when judge Kavanaugh becomes justice capping off and we see that first time when he is sitting in the Supreme Court\nI think a large part of the left is just going to collapse and morale they have done everything they could they went all out they lied they meet your it everything you can imagine\nAnd they lost and I think that the morale effect on the left is going to be substantial Chuck Schumer strategy failed and the fact is that he and the process\nHe may well have crippled his party or a generation a good friend of mine called and said you know there's one team out there trying to build things they're called Republicans and there's one team out there trying to destroy things they're called Democrats and he said to me\nI just don't think people are Americans\nAre going to vote for the destroyers and I thought that was a pretty good way to capture what we're living through\nI've often said and then we've been friends going back since Nineteen Ninety maybe even a little before that and I've often said you can predict is with certainty every two and four years that identity politics you know it's rich\nVersus poor old versus young\nBlack versus white whatever a division of nature of politics they could bring up comes up every election year but they have now sunk to a new low you know I knew this was not going to be a difficult job for the FBI and the case a professor for there was no place there was no time there was no location there's no place for the FBI to visit\nIt took to look for anything for ... that might exist\nAnd the only for people that they could really talked to the poor people professor Ford mentioned\nThat she remembered being at this this so called party when the alleged event happened and she identified one person that was supposed to be a I Witness to the assault and the eye witness said that did not happen\nAnd the other people do not remember any such party is this and then the question is do we believe in the presumption of innocence or we just got a jump the gun and say guilt by association Cory Booker said something spectacular yesterday and he goes well there's enough allegations out there I mean you just you got to kind of believe it and they're not qualified based on allegations\nWell look I must be clear Cory Booker sadly somebody who I used to think that a real future as a reformer or it's just sort of the Cade I mean I don't know whether it's because he wants to run for president\nOr what but he just kind of decayed into almost making a mockery of himself me he talks about any of Spartacus moment which is a sign of such stunning historical ignorance that has a history teacher I found it painful um he he makes comments like that\nI mean here people should know that if allegations destroy a thin the whole process\nOf the rule of law collapses over totally and it's sad to watch something like that you know I think could have been a positive constructive force and who's now frankly are becoming almost a caricature of himself\nIs certainly a lot at stake and then the next\nThirty three days and you know there's other good economic those that have come out today I mean on top of record low unemployment and fourteen states African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workforce\nA youth unemployment fifty some odd year low a we have consumer confidence all time high for a million new jobs created for a million fewer people on on food stamps\nOr you see what the president's accomplish with NAFTA the new NAFTA the\nThe new trade agreement with Mexico and and with Canada you see that he is eliminated burdensome regulation we can now drilling and war and the forty eight states uh he is literally singlehandedly save coal mining in America and of course natural gas production will now be at an all time high\nAnd we have a Wall Street journal piece today showing more Americans getting pay raises than ever before\nAnd that's the forgotten men and women that mattered in twenty sixteen the question is will\nThey all go out and vote to protect the progress that has been made in the last two years even maybe if they don't particularly like their individual Republican congressmen or maybe think they're weak or maybe you don't even know their name is\nWell he has put your finger on the key question of the selection I've as you know I've been involved in many many campaigns are actually going all the way back to Nineteen sixty and\nOne of the ... one of the lessons I learned was I I don't care about the polls show me the three sinks I Want to see the first real votes I Want to see who cares enough to show up and vote because that changes everything is you know we just won a\nA sixty three percent Hispanic district in a special election for the state Senate in Texas right down along the border and this we had a candidate who got lost by twenty points four years ago came back to the special in one um\nAnd is the first Hispanic Republican state senator uh in Texas and that's because people were energized enough to turn out so I Would say to everybody in our audience who this is going to come down to isn't holding\nIt isn't conversation at the coffee shop who cares enough to get an absentee ballot who cares enough to show up and vote\nAnd if our side does show up in both I think this could be one of the most historic elections that you and I've ever covered living together for lots of elections I have a hunch this one could turn into something that we would throw us\nBehind the scenes I got to give you a lot of credit because I remember speaking with you you probably forget it the day before you became speaker of the houses in Nineteen Ninety four and I remember talking to you that day and the day of the election and\nAnd you are surrounded by a group of people in Joe Gaylord and you actually shared with me the information you had and you said it was absolutely true that for the first time in forty years Republicans would take over the house\nI think you and I were two of the few people willing to go out on a limb and said yeah Donald Trump as a real shot of winning this election and\nAnd people laughed at us at the time and I I Believe that then and and we proved out to be right we also the ... both of us predicted Obama would be in a dismal failure as president based on a very rigid ideology that he seemed to be indoctrinated into\nAnd I I agree with you I think there is an opportunity here to shock the world again\nAnd it the for the people listening to this audience they're going to tune in thirty three nights from now watch election results come in and they are either going to seek hippie happy liberal newscasters announcing Nancy Pelosi as speaker and\nChuck Schumer is the Senate majority leader and Maxine Waters will be the chairman of this committee or that committee and that the impeachment of Trump will go forward taxes go up open borders will remain\nAn Obamacare stays all this or are they going to shock the world and all these people are going to do what they did in twenty sixteen and being the shock of their life\nWell that's right and I look I mean I think what what I Would say to everybody who's listening to us everybody cares what's countries richer make sure you vote make sure your friends votes make sure everybody you know who favors\nA solid productive work oriented results oriented system make sure they go out and vote if that happens my I'm I'm not quite ready yet to predict what\nAm I going to tell you that because of the intensity of anger about the way the liberals smear cab and all the characterization the dishonesty I Believe we have seen and I've been looking at data for three days I Believe that we've seen a substantial shift\nTowards Republicans now I think that they were almost certainly now going to keep the Senate and probably going to increase our ah or the total number of senators by significant margins\nHeidi Heitkamp of North Dakota who's down eleven is no on Kavanaugh to me\nSix yards and still ...\nThanks boys and girls you can listen to the new an archived

Idaho I ... I saw him given rent solo cups quite a few girls during that time frame I saw him around the punch\nI won't say bowl or the punch container is I don't know what he did\nBut I saw him by them or their friends who remember these parties to remember how I think everybody in the county remembers the parties and we have we haven't heard furloughs friends so I'm asking you know are there are people that live in today I ... I yeah I had I had a party so yeah there are people that know about that part of this\nThanks sweating it provided for names of ... she says went to the parties with her one of them said he has not

would corroborate the story to actually corroborate the story and you don't have it and you see a pattern of of backtracking and shifting and changing not\nNot in significant facts but the most significant facts\nRemember the story was about almost on a weekend basis and I've been to ten of these parties myself where young girls were drugged and boys lined up the hall you ... so they could gang rape them\nWell I'm Me gave out red solo cups and I saw him at a party you don't know if he did anything to the punch this is so reckless irresponsible NBC how they would ever dare run this is beyond any comprehension I have now if they had come from a nation\nIf they had witnesses\nIf there wasn't a changing shifting\nStory if there wasn't traumatic backtracking they might then have some legitimate reason to air this but because\nThey want what the Democrats want which is the smearing of judge Kavanaugh to continue well they had to air it but even they airing of it made them look really really pathetic\nIt's not fair there are ... and I'll tell you the other thing there are victims people I Know in my life of sexual abuse I Know there's evil in the world I wrote a whole book about evil people that would ever drug rape or girl are evil\nThese people are predators they need to get off our streets but you gotta\nHave some collaboration to these things\nAnd it just comes out of Seventeen Days ago just on the eve of the confirmation vote for judge Kavanaugh and if you go issue by issue case by case you know it it comes down to do we believe in the presumption of innocence due process and simple common sense or do we believe in guilt by accusations\nBecause in each case there hasn't been any corroborating evidence at all in each case what you see is a lot of smearing a

I found out about the you know the hacking of my emails and wiretapping of my uh\nEndless of first happened in August so you found out pretty early\nYeah and actually I I first started getting the phone calls I didn't know about the intelligence operation I just got a call ... ...\nThat they had this buys a warrant against you in the media knew about it or you believe they knew about it\nWell the first news report or I think came out with his a lady Louise mensch in October of twenty sixteen ... within a ... just a couple of days of oil and the uh first Pfizer weren't with I think first\nRan with the story in March of Seventy yes and that's what we said wait a minute there is a Pfizer Warren on the Trump campaign or were you aware of our reporting at the time\n... it's funny Sean right interesting story I haven't talked about it in the media before but in March twenty Seventeen that's what's been leaked in the Washington Post that I was having all these meetings with the FBI\nI remember you know and these long series of ten hours plus meetings one of the meetings I'm walking out I mentioned\nThat well I had a long interview in detail with Catherine heritage and it's going to be airing tonight on the on the evening shows on Fox and what they say they were quite a you know they they gave me a bit of luck let's just put it that way but they again because it's all about you know media perception what are they asking\nYou at the time what do they want to know their spying on you and then they're bringing you win simultaneously you've never been charged with anything there's no indication you're ever going to be charged with anything at all you don't fear that that in any way you're going to be charged\nRight absolutely well I Know I've never done anything wrong right and\nAgain the primary focus of those conversations was about the ... right at the same false allegations that the DNC paid for going back to the ... you're right about that did they ask you specifics about that dossier absolutely yeah basically everything I've done and kind of all sort of\nRevolving around that also you know as you were alluding to I've been a source\nFor the intel community previously and you know I helped or the year prior there\nIs a an indictment of or or you know someone pleaded guilty in the southern district of New York and I was a witness on that case so you know we were talking a bit about that too\nAll right let's talk a little bit about what now now that your life had been up and that um you I I Know you're fighting to get your good name back I Know media organizations have pulled lies about you or I Would say that the\nThere was absolutely reckless disregard for the truth that a lot of these cases um what are your plans what are you going to do what are you going to do to the government that ends up you know using on verified information to literally take away all of your civil liberties has got to be some records for you\nWell I'd definitely working on a few strategies Sean to me the biggest concern is just the damage that this has done to our country and the roads blocked that it's created for the Trump Administration in the first couple of years in office so\nMight the biggest thing and it goes back to the first thing you were talking about in your segment a with chairman Goodlatte is just getting the truth out there and so I'm doing everything possible to help facilitate that you should write a book\nWhat it's like to be spied on by your government you know something to that if I'm Serious that would be you know a at a movie certainly that could be put on the screen as as well but I mean what does it feel like ...

how\nThe uh the the OJ last Thursday indicted a seven Russian hackers for hacking or any doping agencies and Westinghouse here in the United states well watch places in Europe and I was wondering if you had any take on that because three of those guys\nThese were named Mueller's indictment so I'm Wondering how it is they could have been doing I don't think there's any doubt that there's no\nDoubt at all that the ...\nIn the hospital regime of Russia be him being a hostile act or that he is that they are constantly trying to\nYou know create chaos in the United states and they're constantly sly\nCyberwarfare now has been going on for many many years but I'm going to tell you something that very few people will tell you and that is at some point we've got to take responsibility for the fact that this is happening not only by the Russians by the Chinese and North Korea and the Iranians even some of our so called allies are hacking into stuff\nAnd how much intellectual property is stolen that's billions and billions of dollars from America's\nSame ... you know if you look at Julian Assange whose name is probably I guess the most known well Julian Assange is wanted his mid forties somewhere in there okay but he was sixteen years old and the guy hacked into NASA and the D O D that's how long this has been going on\nNow the the fact allegedly by the way\nThe fact that we have not created cyber defenses to prevent all hackers and we have and hire the best people to design the best systems to protect our intellectual property\nYou know at some point we can't blame others at some point we got to look inward and say ah maybe we're the ones responsible that's what I'm thinking what do you think\nRight I I think you're right about that one one question that I come up with with with this uh\nThe OJ indictment is they were very specific these Russians were targeting things very very specifically I Want to know how come it is to follow her can't find anything that specifically points to exactly what they were trying to do\nYou know the the the OJ has very detailed information um I Hope somebody will get you the indictment if you if you have time to look at over it's pretty it's pretty\n... it's damning and you're right you know understand another thing is that not one of these people the mother ever indicted from Russia especially the equivalent of their CIA agents are ever going to be brought to the United states and never pays the trial\nI I don't doubt this is happening as a matter of fact it was Devon newness warned everybody would have happened in twenty sixteen\nEvery other studies have shown that it has an impact the election in any way but that's not the point the fact that we continue to have this vulnerability\nIs at some point it becomes
