I Would I ran into\nUm what's his name Blumenthal the Connecticut Senator\nAnd when I was in Washington went during the Kavanaugh hearings and he was a total jackass during those hearings yeah it was coming out of where I was going in\nAnd I said center Sean Hannity how are you we had a very cordial conversation if he was sitting at a table I Would never I might go over and say you know send a drink over you know I might just because I disagreed vehemently with them I don't feel I have a right to tell them you don't belong here\nHe has a different point of view than I Do what we get to settle out at the ballot box\nI have I have a fear and when I say fear with him regarding myself [noise] but one of these people might walk up to me in a restaurant my fear is that my response will go viral\n[laughter]\nThat's my fear I mean I've asked myself what I had always said though man of the ... that's why I say I have a fear I'm like yeah I'm going to stand up for that only me the old me would come out and then if I'm with my wife told me would come out and then it will go by what my response will go by what but I think they pick and choose the targets does exactly\nWell maybe but you know I listen I train five days a week an hour and a half maybe they learn the largest and they know this well it's a it's not going to stop crazy people but I got to tell you something I Will walk away I Will do everything I can do to walk like I Do part of martial arts all the arts that I practice\nWe ... we bow out if we're doing weapons training we show great respect they were doing grappling or or\nOutright full contact we do it with respect we respect the tap we were ... you know we're not there to kill each other we're there to make each other better\nI'm so there's a certain discipline David associated with that and but most people age don't know how to defend themselves and be they're going to react like past just caught then they're going to get past and somebody's going to get hurt\nAnd I couldn't agree more and it is a danger for people in the public square and especially people who hold themselves out as Christians whether you're a pastor or you have a Christian themed blackout you really gotta be careful at it but we do anyway we need to be civil and and when some people on Twitter ... and our other interactions\nBut I don't think that means we don't fight I don't think I mean we don't uh communicate our ideas as passionately and as intensely as the left now that just means we don't have to get his dirty as they did\nWell I look I don't know I I we just had Newt Gingrich on and pastor what he was saying is between Cavanaugh I mean all these American\nValues that have have served do so well due process presumption of innocence and then you see that there was no core operation any of these charges\nIf the Democrats really cared about the issue they'd be going after Keith Ellison right now demanding an FBI investigation of an Cory Booker would be having an FBI investigation and Claire McCaskill's husband would be having an FBI investigation\nAnd Bill Clinton would be in jail for the rest of his life\nBut they're obviously playing politics with with very important issue so the hypocrisy is there but between Kavanaugh the mobs\nThe caravan that's happening and the fact that we've had on parallel economic success\nFourteen state record for states record low unemployment record low unemployment for African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workplace are vets record low unemployment youth unemployment lowest ever I I'm hoping that people factor that in in fourteen days when they vote or if they vote early\nI think the man on the street will factor then I don't think the people on the street are stupid Democrat or Republican then stupid the party leaders are stupid but the man on the street they're able to see this process that they know that Kavanaugh was that whole cabinet issue was a sham they see the hypocrisy of the left on full display\nThey know that this a caravan is not simply a random\nOccurrence that you know a a all these unconnected people just randomly deciding to all walk thousands of miles to America to look for better jobs they can see the orchestrated now some people are going to vote the party regardless but others say listen I'm tired of this because all of the nonsense seems to be coming from the left\nAnd the very behavior that they pretended to criticize they've put it on steroids and I am the lady so do you know they said well we don't like the some of the behavior the president during the campaign but you say they have it to another level and you'll you'll propagating\nYou're out of Cleveland, Ohio okay you're a an African American conservative you took a lot of heat for supporting Donald Trump houses the results are in\nAnd we're seeing all of these jobs being created for the people look at that picture over there that's the forgotten men and women of America that's what that's what twenty sixty one was about for me the Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps the eight million more in poverty after Obama's eight years now we've got four million jobs created\nMillion fewer people in poverty and on food stamps we have four hundred thousand manufacturing jobs that Obama said we're never coming back while the president didn't get credit when you break down boats demographically with the black community because they're never doing better they've never done better\nThank God he's going to get the votes you know a ... in the Bible nicotine was came to Jesus button night and there are a lot of ... diem is and they say listen we see what Trump is doing we embrace with Trump is doing is not what they told us that waking up and you know if they say is thirty six percent approval rating\nAt twenty or thirty percent to the fifty six sixty six percent believe me his message just rent cream tell him as a message to let them in the black community I\nCome from a traditional democratic family years voted party forever blacked it in my family and our sphere are now so ... to it that they're either going to not vote at all which is which is really up for what we're doing with the conservative movement or\nThey're going to vote with us because they're starting to see that this is a charade here you know the media constantly but right and President Trump for no reason they've been doing it all day today CNN blacks used to go and get their news from CNN the politics of CNN and MSNBC they're starting to see\nWe got to get in the trenches we've got to figure this out so we're getting a bunch of calls from people saying hey what's going on houses going how's Trump doing this how can we help on this particular side he's going to get on the all the black vote than any other Republican president I'll throw this day but if if we all\nBelieve in in ... the father Jesus is okay and I think all of us here do if we believe that that we all believe one thing and that predicated on that he created every man woman and child on this earth we agree with that right okay yeah so in that sense where\nBrothers and sisters we're all Americans to right and if we really believe that in every human soul God put some talent some ability\nAnd our goal is to to create an environment where that that talent that natural talent flourishes the the word or education from the Latin is ... to bring forth from within\nThat tells you that God put it there our job is to put enough sunlight and water on something make it grow and help people and that's what I see Trump's doing and it and it's now hitting the forgotten men and women David that's the great story of the two years at Trump so far\n[noise] yeah yes and and we want to get that what Trump is trying to do when he says I Want to make America great again it means to restore its founding principles is Judeo Christian founding principles which is based on the idea that we're all created in God's image and that's why we had an alien Abul lights it flows from that\nBut I think the leftist authoritarian by nature their economic coercion can lead to political coercion and that's where they are and I I think the left is losing it because they don't have any ideas that worked and I don't have any proposal so they're frustrated and they resort\nTo identity politics and changing the rules and this identity politics dividing people on the basis of race and gender\nIs every four to four years at the same thing rich versus poor versus young black versus white or read that book is a racist sexist massage in this Tacoma ...

thanks for having me on they have out this week that they wanted to flip as many seats in Pennsylvania as they can\nAnd they drew the district to make it or to make it much more difficult for somebody especially somebody like me who's the Freedom Caucus member a to win and not just the you know you've kind of highlighted some of the things are doing the course of the big thing they're doing which they're not just doing it to me you know in talking to all your friends whether Jim mark Louis Gates' whoever\nUh that's the same playbook which is which actually is kind of absurd when you think about it\nAnd that's this this whole thing about pre existing conditions and healthcare a showing you know they're the ones that screwed up our health care system and and passed Obamacare and uh you know you know a twenty five you're going to say twenty five hundred dollars keep your plan keep your doctor all that stuff all lives right\nAnd now they're blaming us for messing it up um we tried to repeal it of course you know what happened with John McCain put wet thumbs down but you know Sean when we fought the British you know the Freedom Caucus in particular fought that original a bill\nOut of a you know the ... the replacement bill for Obamacare because if you remember we're gonna vote to repeal Obamacare and immediately repay replace it the original bill didn't deal with pre existing

[noise]\nYou're evil I'm Joe Shapiro Fox News that's what President Trump is calling a mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue they killed a number of people you wouldn't\nThink this would be possible in this day and age but we just don't seem to learn from the past\nYou know you get a crowd and you follow these people into a grocery stores in department stores and gas stations and you tell them we don't want them here anywhere anymore you know telling Henry Kissinger to leave the country Mitch McConnell not only did they tell Mitch McConnell to leave the country\nBut then they're talking about the guy smashed literally ripped\nIs leftovers I guess just maybe it's taken a meal home to somebody else\nAnd throws it outside the restaurant door banging on the guy's table somebody's going to get killed here you watch somebody is or hurts severely it it's going to happen then nobody on the left ever\nCan critique their own side for the rhetoric they're using Anthony Scaramucci is with us I just finished cover to cover is bad brand new book uh and it's but nominal and it's the Inside Story about Donald Trump it's called Trump the blue collar president\nAnd held billionaire living on Fifth Avenue identify the struggle of blue collar Americans had won the presidency and all those are the forgotten men and the forgotten women in this country and I don't think they're liking this mob mentality\nLike they like the way judge Kavanaugh was treated ... and I don't think they like watching this caravan of thousands marching towards our border\nI mean they they literally are mishandling everything and so we're with what's happening is uh the the president has almost like this light show on like you know you and I were out on Long Island in the summer or parents would hang up that infect light\nWell the president has that the Trump Twitter\nInsect light and they're all going towards the light in their vaporizing a Senator Warren she's got to get a DNA test she's less of a Native American than you or me into the vapors Asian big caravan issue the way they're handling the care of an issue it's the galvanizing his base that\nKavanaugh's thing was absolutely ridiculous they were making up one story after the next they figured okay me too movement seems to work there's no due process and the meat you vote Mitt\nLet's take this guy that's a very well credential judge\nOr he's got an impeccable adult life let's try to destroy him\nGoing back to Nineteen eighty one in Nineteen eighty two and so again right into the Trump Twitter\nInsect vaporized or so so for me I'm enjoying this the polls are tightening of and the president's base is actually going to turn out much higher percentages than people predicted and so\nOnce again he's going to defy logic here I think we are very good chance to possibly ah keep the house we're certainly going to gain seats in the Senate and it couldn't happen without the energy and the for tutors for a President Trump\nWell if they do it when I'll say this he's carrying a lot of these people on his back but you know what if you like Nancy Pelosi the dangers are what we're gonna have endless investigation higher taxes keep Obamacare open borders\nNow the president is is battling back on all these ... in Guatemala Honduras El Salvador he says they're not we're not able to do the job of stopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to the U.S\nNow we will begin cutting off substantially reducing the massive foreign aid we routinely give them and Trump tweeted out every time you see a caravan of people the illegally coming are attempting to come into our country illegally\nThinking blame the Democrats are not giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws\nRemember the midterms it's so unfair to those who come in legally and he's right um well and and we don't know anything about the people that are coming here we don't know when when one thing about them and I know the media can be sympathetic because they want but you know who might mix it with the people that maybe just want a job is a big problem for us\nBut but it's but you but here's the other thing okay the American people intuitively know Sean that it's just all it is is he or she is recognizing with the legendary Milton Friedman one set about any country\nIf you have a welfare state in the United states does have one you need to protect your Puerto Rico's free market forces dictate that people will cross over that border\nTo participate in your welfare state and so\nEvery country has a strong border and so should the United states so I don't get a you know ... on on on promoting my my uh my book that today in the last couple of days mom a lot a left leaning shows where they go they go nuts so crazy on the president's response all\nYou want to illegal immigration you have democratic and Republican presidents and democratic elected officials that have voted in laws I don't understand why just enforcing those laws\nOf everybody so upset Sean ... will cut their answer possible\nWhy don't they well it's a lot of things are we better off economically than we were two years ago by\nEvery single objective measure the answer is yes the growth of the economy consumer confidence jobs created the number of people leaving food stamps or out of poverty eight million Americans so you know by every measure and more job out of\nThe bottom ... percent of the society showing the wages of five and a half percent according to the wall Street Journal over the last Eighteen months but as a direct result of the president's policies\nBut also the fact that he cut the slack at the border and so he made it tightened up the labor supply and it's giving lower middle class families shot now have real living wages\nWell that's the story that you actually tell in the book by the way Anthony Scaramucci is with us all through the brand new book it's out today we put it up on Hannity dot com it's on Amazon dot com and bookstores everywhere it's called Trump the blue collar president I first heard that term from one of his sons was either Erica Don I don't remember those Donnie\n... get ahead on e call them the blue collar billionaire yeah and they said ... Don if you don't mind going to hijack the nickname and just switch out billionaire and put in President is it the other day he resonates with these people for a reason\nYeah look I I I think it is and you talk a lot about his background you you talk a little bit about your family background it's similar to my background and and it's amazing because the only thing that I really care about what motivates me it's not politics itself it's not a game to me\nBecause the policies that we have in a country as we do now greatly impact whether or not people are on food stamps or whether or not there are jobs we now in two years\nHave us a scenario that is not unfolded in this country since Nineteen sixty nine and that is we have a million more jobs than we have people on unemployment you know that I identify with that that's what you identify with you you did not have any better when in your mouth\nAnd you know I saw it as a dishwasher at twelve and and look where you started died you know\nSean Sean listen I mean I think that's the message and I think that's the reason why you're so incredibly popular at the end of the gay America is about aspirations in America is about passing the ... the the baton to a next generation of Americans\nThat can do better than ourselves and that's what our grandparents did for our parents and our parents did for you and I and and the cat that the right policy shift of white free market based motivating market incentive policies because what we both know is that you cannot system the ties\nOr through a political system created equal outcome it never happens black markets crop up\nAnd then there's a thin layer at the tippy top that are living better than everybody else and everyone else has devastated whether it's Cuba or Venezuela place like that\nYou know the real danger so I don't know how this is all going to play out but we we see all weekend long these mobs you know really making ... an unsafe environment for anybody to even go get a bite to eat if you're a public figure which is really sad I mean when you're doing it in front of people's wives\nIt's not only sad it's pathetic when you're going after Pam Bondi Sarah Sanders and her kids and\nSecretary Nielsen and all she do all they're doing is trying to sit in a restaurant and have something to eat telling you know one group of Americans they're not wanted here in any way what are you doing here get out of this you know they're going after an a Ninety year old guy Henry Kissinger now who served his country with honor and distinction is that it seems like there's no limits here\nBut there's no moderation left either ... the Democratic party it used to be I I used to think Democrats at least they on paper they said they cared about the American working men and women but apparently they don't\nIf you're losing the argument then you have to suppress the other side's argument in other words if you're wrong on the facts and your ideology is going to create\nUnequal outcome so you know bad society uh even though it sounds great on paper all of your ideas when they meet contact with reality or disaster for a country a person a citizen then you've got to suppress the voices of the other people it's happened to me it's happened to me on a college campuses\nIt's happened to me I'm Around the country when I'm traveling\nI'm cool with it I'm up for the fight of it are both the you know when you know what's great about the people just want you to think about Ninety five percent\nOf these professors Sean or liberal but about forty five fifty percent of the kids are conservative so they're not buying into the ...\nAll right stay right there by the way the books phenomenal I read it cover to cover Anthony Scaramucci is whether Trump the blue collar president\nUh you know it's interesting you look at the jobs created who's benefitting when we create manufacturing jobs in factory jobs\nAre and we bring an industry back to America and we incentivize businesses to invest here well that's the forgotten men and women the Thirteen million under Obama\nThe additional Thirteen million that were on food stamps and after eight years of his presidency and the eight million more Americans that were in poverty after eight years of his presidency well now we have for a million new jobs in eight million fewer people in poverty and on food stamps and so dramatic turnaround\nReally the best way to know what amazing shelter pet like Nico was to meet one was it the shelter pet project done or today adopt ... by my son to the humane society

joining the Palo bond\nMartha mix Sally confronted her in the recent debate and said well you apologize you would not apologize and accusing troops to torture and that's only part of it and then on

in ... I Would imagine that your polls are going to go higher\nShon well it it's unbelievable every single day a new part of her radical passed and her mocking\nArizona and their extremism on so many issues is being on earth but the Arizona local media is protecting her a and making excuses for her and so the only way that filters down his shows like yours are us turning it into a TV ad uh the fact that she's still hanging in there is\nReally ridiculous so out of step with Arizona values and American values you rattled off a number of uh a number of things that would have a Senate candidate B. disqualifying in the past\nBut here we are way down to the wire over eighty percent or around eighty percent of people will vote early over half have already voted and so we need to make sure that the messages out about her radical out of step past\nThis qualifying statement you know compared to nice to have been twenty six years in the military and defending our freedoms that are way of life\nWhat did you do in the military I Know well you served abroad post nine eleven correct\nYes sir I was a a ten pilot I was just fortunate to be the first woman in us history to fly a fighter jet in combat\nUh and then the first to command a fighter squadron in combat I've had six deployments to the middle east and Afghanistan a hundred and twenty five combat hours in a tan ward hog again saving American lives on the ground and defending our way of life it was an absolute honor of my life to be able to serve\nYou know when you hear ... cinemas ill it's OK at that point what I Believe it was two thousand and three that oh it's okay if Americans want to join our enemies the follow up on a nearly died\nA Sean when I when we heard this I I couldn't believe it I mean I was deployed on nine eleven uh the Taliban harbored al ... who can and killed three thousand Americans since then with them and their affiliates they've killed thousands of American troops\nTo include you know truthful I was deployed over there I've told this story before but we would at Bagram Air force base when I was a commander\nA we would you know we would get out there as soon as we heard a firefight was going on and we'd be overhead to protect them in our eight ten but often times uh you know the the the firefights happened before we could get there and Americans lost their lives\nAnd as we would we would line up on a taxi way as the cat the flag draped casket would come through and there was ... it was a silence there and everyone is saluting giving our final salute to these American heroes\nWho perished over there fighting the Taliban and their affiliates\nAnd for her to be able to say that she's OK with an American going to join the Taliban to fight against us I mean that in and of itself should have had her suspend her campaign and Arizona and should make a different choice to not vote for years and said this is really personal\nOn finding out that this is a [noise]\nOn the Hannity watches [noise]\n\nHey what was the last time you and your family ever gathered around the table to play the game maybe it sounds old fashioned but you've got to listen to me the new board games are amazing and there's one you've got to try it's the witch and waitress party game it's so simple to learn you can play with anybody any age the entire family\nAnd there'll be no other game out there that brings your family together like which in wages\nGo to your local target I highly recommend you get it with and wages with and wages available\n...

pony lying hypocrite manipulate ... trying to manipulate the voters in Missouri and Heidi Heitkamp will be a super liberal but she's not going to tell you that until after the election\nAnyway project beret toss it CEO founder James O'Keefe strikes again how are\nYou [noise] Haitian great to be with you and yeah this is number three it's it's more of the same this Heidi Heitkamp director and her Washington DC campaign office\nUh speaking candidly about when she gets elected she is going to go really hard left she'll be quote super liberal unquote at that point so he's describing the bait and switch that once again the red state Democrats have to do in these battleground states to get elected\nSo amazing is the consistency here is that is that they are telling their staff one thing they're saying things privately that they'll never say publicly\nIn the hopes that they came basically lie to bamboozled whatever term you want to use the voters in their state in the case of brothers and even calling the people of Tennessee ignorant in the hopes that they'll get that seat and then they'll they'll be a a basically a Chuck Schumer senator for that state\nYeah just so that your listeners if you haven't seen every video\nA there's a video in Missouri we did where were they were talking about Obama's using Claire McCaskill's views and the staffer says Obama and the ... will have the same views and everything but quote people just can't know that well in this video this video released last night on your show Sean there's this another guy Gordon is his name he's the staffer\nIn and Heidi Heitkamp Fargo North Dakota campaign office\nAnd we and we see an Obama poster in the office there's a big one of those are the bottom it looks like the messiah on the wall this big poster but then they took it down right before the press came so we asked why did you take your bar poster down and the staffer says well because the presses here\nAnd and we take it down when the press comes is what Heidi Heitkamp staff is saying so it's more it's basically the same thing in each of these red states\nThey have to mislead they have to move the moderate voters and play the progressive base well we just have them on tape saying it we all know that Heidi is is liberal but\nShe's going to be several liberate once you get selected that her staffers they're emphasizing it here and they also say that she's not going to run again so because this what Jesse Overton says in the studio quote she doesn't want to run again so she'll just do good work while she can which means that she'll do the things that she can't talk about right now\nIt's just so revealing but I I think this is really this is not an accident that your responses and every place you have now gone\nI mean these are three big huge massive Senate races and you have caught three major Senate candidates all admitting that they ... they're lying to the people of their state to get elected\nBut I Would argue that it ... represents the entirety of the Democratic party we now know Maxine Waters told us that are parties pulled or they don't want me to say it they want me to stop saying it but I'm not going to stop saying it impeach forty five ... well that's it yeah but\nIt's ... it's particularly true in these red states there's a there's a kind of a story here that we found that were confirming suspicions that well that's what we do it very possibly confirms suspicions and we've always known this to be true but my point is just have integrity\nDoes it it's not really a left or right thing\nI was at this first them and conference with all these big hon chosen media\nWho were ... you know very cheering and and hearing it may I suggest have integrity this is about just doing what you say you're going to I think it's more pronounced in the red states with these Democrats running because they have to lie to the moderates they have to move the moderates and they and they can only make one choice\nOnce but if you're not a good choice flying is this a purposeful misinformation and propaganda campaign 'cause they have no intention of doing what they say they're going to do\nThey have a very different agenda the people working for them know that they have a very different agenda and so they're really just lying manipulating I mean it is the worst of the worst in terms of politics\nBecause there's an open contempt hatred and a feeling of superiority that Claire McCaskill has that bill Brett isn't hasn't Heidi Heitkamp as towards the people of their state Penn well they\nDo it's so hateful Sean that Claire McCaskill has asked for a special prosecutor to look into me he asked her opponent Josh Hawley who's the attorney general I'd never met Josh I yeah I don't I don't he doesn't work for me I never talked to anybody in his staff but McCaskill ask to be a special prosecutor to investigate project Vera tossed\nTo investigate hair on camera speaking her own
