[noise] uh Kathy Akron, Ohio your next Hi Cathy Lee a report the guy\nTaking my call thank you it's my pleasure\nThanks for calling [noise] I've been wanting to attack you for a while I had a small private hobby where I collect a landscape photos and um I Would really like find a way to is like holidays as might get you don't say oh how nice digital trains are usually kind of small like yeah let's have\nIt on the big three ... but I don't know how to do that\nYou know it's funny because almost all now these uh Internet connected TV devices like the Roku and the Apple TV have screens savers that are often landscapes Apple TV as a beautiful uh one of the slow motion landscapes so they're moving 'cause their screen saver\nAnd I saw that on a TV yesterday horse yeah location that I figured it was probably felt the television\nThere comes to the Apple TV it's awesome so that would be one way to do it is to get one of these devices\nAll of them have a photo capability so for instance the Apple TV if you use a Macintosh you upload your landscape pictures to your you put them on your apple photos and you could actually have have a particular folded let's call it my special landscape collection\nAnd you say to your Apple TV that's my screen saver\nHow does it get from my ... its magic\nYou know through the through iCloud it's through the Internet and that's the whole point is that you are now now this is not the only way to do it I'm gonna tell you some other way but that's one way to do it and the advantage of that as you could update it without having to do anything and just put new photos in the folder on your computer\nAnd the way it works is you've you using the iCloud photo library So Apple the Mac is uploading all your photos to iCloud its its cloud storage\nThat yeah yeah yeah I can I download\nAn Apple TV it's called the Apple TV [noise] and so the idea is that this is one way I'm going to finish until you some other ways but it's only because it's got costs you money because Apple TV is a couple of hundred bucks but then the Apple TV let you watch movies and TV\nAnd and other stuff you know it's the idea is that it makes an Internet connected T. V. C. connect the Apple TV to the Internet now you TVs connect the Apple TV and you've added Internet capability to your TV [noise] many TV's already have this uh does your TV have Netflix Ani\nDo yeah I Do like we we can get on you know like ... ... ...\nOkay so it does already have Internet you might investigate if your television look in the menu and see what apps it offers you might already have a photo lab in which case you'd have to just figure out how to get photos to that photo op lots of TVs have\nSlots for photo cards for S. D. card so that'd be another way to do it requiring no Internet you copy the photos you want onto an S. D. card a little memory card on Iraq\nSlotted end of the TV you can buy if your TV doesn't have that you can buy little ad on devices that do that the only\nAdd on edge state yeah\nThat's the card reader onto your TV and and a USB flash drive it really depends on the television and the capabilities of the TV but many TV's can do a slide show if you put a photo folder in that's S. D. card slaughter on the USB port again you'd have to check to make sure you do that [noise]\nA nice thing about the Apple TV that will work with any TV that has an H I poured\nRoku will do the same thing but it doesn't use apples a photo sharing service that you know you'd use some other one Amazon has at those Amazon Fire TVs use Amazon photos and you could put Amazon photos in your back and put the photos in that and then have them up on your Amazon TV as well lots of ways this\nAh because what you want to do is very common I see my family photos as a screen saver for instance on my\nToes yeah yeah it would be great tip [noise]\nSo you could do that with Roku with Apple TV probably your own existing TV capabilities are there lots of ways to do it and it's in your right it'd be great way to use those landscape photos\nExcellent thank you so much pleasure\nAnd if you have an Apple TV I stopped putting my family photos on there because the a normal a default screen saver which they called Ariel is studying\nHey have aerial photography in super slow mo ah and it just rotates through everything from the urban landscapes of Dubai to ... overhead for LAX to the lush jungles of Hawaii\nIt's kind of liked that opening shot of Jurassic Park you know I almost want to play the ethic bark thing as they zoom down that valley but they do it very slowly because it's a screen saver and they want to change it but then I Want to change dramatically or drowsy I so it's just beautiful and if you have your Apple TV set up with a nice big screen that's gorgeous\nHey we're at a time I um I hate it when that happens when you come back next week we have lots more to talk about by then I'll have a new Google phone I can talk about that next to Michael ...

O. J. face consequences regarding fights that while he signed the final buys a warrant himself and\nIs that what he's talking about the rule of law speaking up for truth and Jim Jordan blasting Rod Rosenstein uh conduct now the president met yesterday on air force one apparently had a meeting not a lot of details about what went on in the meeting\nWith Rod Rosenstein there was talk about well he might be fired after it had been discovered that he was talking about well you want me to wear a wire\nAround the president and his answer was you know at least has the spin was well I was just saying that you wouldn't want me to wear a wire around the president and it was all in the tone and the cadence of what he said we have three articles in front of me right now one by Katherine heritage at Fox one by Sarah Carter won by John Solomon\nA Solomon's article goes on former FBI lawyer plot to record removed Trump was not a joke and John Solomon let me read from the article don't tell for FBI general council member James Baker he was one of those that resigned that those infamous discussions\nAbout secretly recording president Donald Trump and using the tapes to remove him for office where a joke he apparently doesn't believe it and he yelled quite the vantage point as he was on the inside of the FBI bureaus leadership and may have twenty Seventeen when the discussions occurred and Baker told Congress last week\nThat his boss than acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe remember ...\nAnd Lisa Page both took notes of the meaty and McCabe was saying yeah Rod Rosenstein had in fact said this\nAnyway now James Baker is saying and Andrew McCabe is saying that in fact they were dead serious about about the idea\nOf Sarah surreptitiously recording the forty fifth president\nUsing the evidence to make the case\nThat Trump should be removed from office according to every source now in all three articles and Baker told lawmakers that he wasn't\nIn the meeting that McCain had with the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein in which the subject came up but he had\nFirst hand conversations with Medicaid and the FBI lawyer that was assigned to a ... page about the issue\nSo Baker talk to both of the un quote as far as Baker was concerned this was the real plan being discussed set a source directly familiar with the congressional investigation it was no laughing matter to the FBI or member then you can go back to what was the insurance policy to remove Trump\nIs five months now into his presidency this is just before the appointment of the special counsel\nAs soon as Justin ... at that time frame around the media elite strategy that was occurring anyway so it goes on word of bakers testimony now is surface just days before Rosenstein said to be interviewed him private by the\nHouse Judiciary committee lawmakers that's supposed to happen Thursday of this week and the New York times first reported allegations that Rosenstein the number two at the department of justice has tried to downplay his role in all of this in his office suggested that\nHe thought the discussion was a joke that Rosenstein never gave in order to carry out any such plot and he doesn't believe the Trump should be removed from office\nBut making those statements throw spokes person is a bit different than having Rosenstein himself face Congress answer the questions under the penalty of a felony if lawmakers think he's lying and bakers account lawmakers this month clearly complicates that already complicated picture\nAs it relates to Rod Rosenstein before Congress assuming he shows up for Thursday's interview but even more so Baker story lays ... extraordinary conversation and we go on from there and now we're going to really take our time with this issue today and\nWe're going to now begin to put the pieces of the puzzle together because what this is where laying out here are the top people the the upper echelon remember twenty five people have either been demoted fired or have left the FBI the O. J. and their\nUpper ranks here and James Baker is one of them and Andrew McCabe at least a page of both corroborating what apparently now James Baker is set about Rod Rosenstein anyway John Solomon ease but investigative reporter is what the hell\nRag Jarrett Fox News legal analyst and of course the seller of the number one book the Russia hoax\nThank you all for being with us I'm John let's just I I Want to also put this in context for people because it gets complicated\nWe've got a first start with the timeline the timeline is may have twenty Seventeen or that's when Robert Mueller is getting appointed by Rod Rosenstein just before that we had people like ... Lisa Page and and Peter Struck talking about uh media leaks strategy\nThat had to do with the dusty a while it now appears that that was all being league for the purposes and again ... all was was the dusty a recycled and different news outlets\nFor the purpose of initiating the special counsel so would get appointed that we're discovering that they're even talking about Sarah ... taping the president of the United states so that they can remove him from office this sounds like a cool to me\nOr if there's one other event that occurs and that may turn friends that rarely I think you're a shockwave for this conversation and that was the termination of James\nComey's the FBI directors that allowed all this Russia investigation to go on and we know now from refrigerators testimony that it may they still have that where you're from a proving any form of collusion with Russia so they've been nine months out of James Kobe's let this go on for nine months\nHe's let two agents who have an anti Trump a virus read that investigation he get fired and what's the natural reaction of all those who've been supporting James Comey that rose to see a a Medicaid and a stroke page it's hey maybe we can remove this guy rather can't prove that he's got something wrong with Russia\nMaybe we can prove that confident it will will record him\nAnd uh and maybe try to take 'em out through the recording and the twenty Fifth Amendment this is not what the FBI with ... with the ... I'm ... ... talk about history his book\nLays out a real possibility that this was a soft grew right look at this we have the FBI they're not investigating a crime here that in fact they can't find a crime by a page as\nWell at least two pages testimony just to be clear she said they um they had found nothing in nine months leading up to the point\nThat's right so they switch gears right maybe we can remove him through other means and and this conversation is so extraordinary ... it says that job for the FBI or twenty Fifth Amendment\nNever envision the FBI being involved in it she got the FBI and the deputy attorney general or allegedly have a conversation he says it's a joke\nThey say they're dead serious about it and they believe he was dead serious about it and it no matter which way it comes down is just another example of how far down the road the FBI was beyond its core mission which is to investigate crimes stop counterintelligence\nAnd again this has nothing to do with rank and file agents that all this this is John group of rogue power hungry upper echelon management types and if anything they took the the cases away from the field offices purposely so that they can involved themselves in these nefarious activities that's why\nIt really does explain a Greg Jarrett why every FBI guy I Know is so angry about this because they know was ripped out of their hands\nAnd this and all of them say that if this was them they know they get fired\nThat's right and in fact I interviewed former top officials or the FBI who are angry at people like James Comey Andrew McCabe James Baker Lisa Page\nPeters struck for ruining the reputation the good name of the FBI I wrote a column recently that said Rosenstein actions\nIn an attempt to do pose the sitting president United States is the equivalent of an attempted coup not a bloody violent coups what's known and John refer to it a moment ago as a soft coup ah using in misusing\nTheir power in the law to remove a sitting president and so here we now have not just James Baker who was told this was serious but the people in the conversation with Rosenstein who are Andrew McCabe and Lisa Page you said he was\nDead serious recruit people to invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment and secretly record the president to gather evidence in support of it uh Rosenstein whenever he gets caught engaging in wrongdoing\nClaims oh I was misunderstood he threatened the intelligence committee staff members in January first denied it\nThen it mitigated but said oh\nI was misunderstood he threatened Devin Nunes\nAnd said oh I

recommended the special counsel Robert Mueller number three is also the guy that signed the for the financial advisor warrant\nOther words the third renewal application on Carter Page a Trump campaign associates\nWell now we have information corroborated and confirmed by three separate high ranking FBI ideal Jay sources including a James Baker who is resigned and Lisa Page and Andrew McCabe that is now under criminal investigation all corroborating that Rod Rosenstein\nHimself was discussing wearing a wire to ... secretly recorded conversations with President Trump and the whole she'd say something that they could use and then in both the twenty Fifth Amendment and remove him from power Andrew McCabe telling that in and confirming that along with Lisa Page\nAnd going to the office of the general counsel James Baker he's corroborating all of this and uh they're saying the Baker's set it bigger and heard about it and the other two actually took notes about it at the time the other story that we're following is\nWe use ... pretty stunning revelation since it directly contradicts what the Justice Department\nAnd the FBI officials have said in sworn testimony but James Baker also telling Congress last week member of the law firms Perkins Kuwait that's where Hillary's campaign that's where the DNC bottled money so it would look like a legal expense\nWhen in fact there was anything but and then they hired fusion GPS and research firm that went out and got hired by the name of Christopher Steele and he used as Russian sources to put together\nA series of papers they become known as the ... the same ... that was never corroborated a verified but used as a buys a warrant application the bulk of information to get a buys a warrant to spy on a Trump campaign associates\nAnd it gets worse than that it was used even though this information was not corroborated it was disseminated all all levels of government to propagandize on line to the American people in the lead up to a campaign and then it was used what now understanding to bludgeon\nThen president Donald Trump and to try and get him removed from office and creating a phony Russia Trump narrative that never ever had any evidence whatsoever anyway we found out that you know in the case of a ... coup either lawyers who die by the name of Michael ... directly handing documents Baker told

on the Trump campaign was done\nAt the direction of a political opponent Hillary Clinton and that's entirely illegal for both the FBI department of justice and Clinton herself and you have numerous

chairman Devin Nunes saying on Sunday Now you have one of the top lawyers for the Democrats and the Clinton campaign was\nFeeding information directly to the top lawyer at the FBI so it appears the

continue with us or anything I'm saying here that is wrong Greg Garrett\nYou've got a hundred percent correct there was never any Trump Russia collusion the FBI and the DEA OJ knew it there was

against the things the president wants to get done in\nOr the God Forbid I get cancer or the God Forbid I got a bad accident right\nRight um you you don't have\nA car insurance for gasoline you don't have home owners insurance for long term care insurance just for the big thing and we've tried to ensure everything top down and that's led to the last ten years of\nInsurance premiums that have doubled or tripled we need to do is ensure less which is how every other insurance product works they keep it that is means doctors have to make more of the services they provide affordable\nAnd they can if they cut out the middleman and streamline than a simple\nAnd how big is your practice how many patients do you have in your facility the atlas MD and Wichita\nIn Wichita we have five doctors and over thirty two hundred patients\nUnbelievable and your age and you give concierge care at all I could pick up a phone and I'm getting a doctor at three in the morning that it's going to answer my call\nYou do you have and I could go down and see somebody at three AM in the morning\nIf you need stitches and it's an emergency\nYou know a lot of the three am phone calls or chest pain which we might send the ER but a lot of times the kid who's sick and a mom who's worried and\nUm you of if you can avoid the ER you can avoid a thousand or two thousand dollar bill that's how you get health care health insurance is a card in your wallet health care is access to your doctor yeah\nAll right and then how many other practices around the country have you been able to to provide your model that they have duplicated how you you've been out and about an a champion of this for a long time\nYet we've helped over five hundred and fifty doctors convert to this model in the last few years but there's about a thousand total there in forty eight states in every state except north and South Dakota right now but we have one about to launch in North Dakota [noise]\nUm and then it's even gotten a little bit international so um this is a a sound tried and true model\nNow and what do you do Dr grows in terms of your president of duck a doctor patient care foundation you know now that we have alternatives that are working real life experiences seems to me that we ought to be able to duplicate it a lot more than we are\nAbsolutely a so doctor patient care foundation is a physician or on health policy because doctors never seem to be at the table whenever we're having these important conversations about health care\nSo we put traditions about getting back to the table to have these conversations personally I I also have a primary care practice much like that lets them here in southwest Florida a practice of health are pissed when he was\nYou know why are we using insurance to pay for health are for basic primary care services all it does is create ... tour\nYou know and we're ... ... ... ... points as Dr Josh and we're seeing patients come to us\nFrom all over the state of Florida and even from outside of the country was ... medical tourism\nAre and what we're finding is that you know not not the same thing got about health insurance we're just using it for all and you know when somebody is you know plays twice the amount of money for a service because of the ... shots wandering insuring it using insurance drives up the cost of the product\nSo ... cash price Ross is two hundred and twenty dollars while using her your commercial insurance you know we go through all the the hoops to give it all the rise\nAnd your co pay five hundred dollars or so we we see this time and again on the more people are are coming out of pocket to pay for health health or\nI'll let you signed up to ... more insurance seems to be becoming an optical ... solution so I'm pleased to see that you know we're shifting the conversation from our coverage for everyone who I'm Talking about reducing the cost of health care\nI think that the real close enough I was about to testify on us some help committee on the ...\nWould it be a better idea that me and I'm watching for example they have this race out in California everybody's shock gather news and who is now offering free health care\nFor everybody he whether you're a taxpayer whether you're in the ... the state legally or illegally everybody's got to get free health care well I basically put a sign that says come to California but you get sick\nUm but there's people are going to go there now what's interesting to me is that a Republican is within striking distance in that gubernatorial race out in California because instinctively people no we can't afford to pay\nUp for every illegal immigrant in the country but the reality is is that if I Lived in Wichita, Kansas I Would be a part of atlas empty and I would be your patient\nDr ... because I I think it's the best deal I liked the idea of being able to call my\nDoctor whenever I'm sick or if I have a kid that sick every parent wants the ability to do that and your preserved for service provides it for fifty bucks a month now how much does the average in Wichita, Kansas catastrophic plan of it but the big things heart attack or accident or cancer how much would one of those plans cost\nAbout five hundred dollars a family member dollars per year or a month a month\nOr so and the current rates closer to you know a thousand twelve hundred a across the nation people are paying more for health insurance each month and they're paying for their mortgage\nIf the Trump tax cuts only put a hundred dollars per household per month in and they're being credited with the economic boom of your four point two percent GDP\nIf we fix health insurance we could put five hundred dollars back in the pocket of every household a the the real ... and the the politician there has in California is to send them an originality\nJust throwing more money at the problem has never fixed it what we're doing is Dr Lee and ourselves and and a thousand other physicians is is innovating and saying how do we get meds cheaper how do we make it so patients don't have co pays how do we provide stitches for no cost because they're so affordable [noise]\nUm you know actually looking at ways it's fundamentally fixing the system that's what we need not just promises of more spending\nWay and if I could at ... ... you know as far as the cost of care is the biggest thing that people ask us as well how can I just get\nMajor medical you know we we can afford what what services the primary care practice is providing but we just need something catastrophic well Obama Care made that illegal ah so something mental stretching just brought by ... that access to these major medical plans called ...\nShort term medical plans and you know some would argue that these are actually crew insurance that don't cover anything except the major medical expenses they're Seventy five dollars a month or\nWhat it is this going to be implemented easily city by city town by town we can duplicate the model it already does take care of individuals with preexisting conditions if somebody wants to sign up for atlas empty and they have a preexisting condition a doctor or do you deny them service\n... everybody's welcome and everybody's price the same just based on age um we know we're going to work harder for some patients but well so now we're going to not have to work as hard for other patients and we don't want to know judged by their illness\nHow did you get to who directly negotiate these prices with these pharmaceutical companies\n[noise] boy I I Wish I could say was because we're so darn good at it um the the truth is it's so much more simple than that I\nHave a doctor's in forty four states are allowed to work directly with pharmaceutical wholesalers so just like you can go to Costco and get something for much cheaper because you pay a membership we do the same thing and we're able to\nGet the you know the actual cost of medicine might be at ten dollars for a thousand pills and because we don't have a staff of seven people per physician fighting insurance\nWe can lower the cost and and pass the savings on directly to the patient that this is a win for everybody we we don't take care of of Republicans or Democrats we take care of people\nSo how does somebody had a group of doctors in New York say implement those because they're going to look at this and say fifty bucks a month I Can't make ten cents off of that\nWhat they're gonna have to move to New York because they don't make it easy but um they could work with a pharmacist in New York state's one of the few states that make it a very difficult but then a pharmacist could say um if you do a five dollar a month membership with them then you get the medicine that cost that would be an amazing model it it would cut down there\nRight let's take your do your kind of the equation for California ... let's say any other state Louisiana Florida um I don't know Missouri yeah how do they do it\nIt's as simple as signing up effect shopping on Amazon there's there's almost nothing to it um\nYou know we have one supplier that makes it very easy overnight shipping and that's just it if I Want to buy a bottle of a hundred pills a blood pressure medicine I can if I Want to buy a thousand pills I Can't [laughter] and it's about the same price um but it's fundamentally cheaper than what\nAbout Lindsey Graham is saying that what only block grant the money that we're already providing to individual states and let them come up with these innovative you know like centers of innovation all around the country and I think naturally people would move toward your system\nI I I Would agree with the logic or the federal government is basically saying we've given you money with strings attached before and we haven't received full value for that because we weighed you down with regulatory burden so we're going to\nCut those strings and just give you the money and say go forth and do the best job that you can't\nMake quick break we'll come back more Dr Josh ...
