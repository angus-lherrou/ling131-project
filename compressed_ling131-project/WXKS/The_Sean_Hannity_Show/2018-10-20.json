senator Dean Heller to protect\nAnd talking about fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson well\nHe's now saying indicated he's going to plead the fifth he's not saying a word anymore\nAh he was on Fox News Sunday telling Maria ... that Glenn Simpson is unreal legal jeopardy in all of this you also confirmed that the FBI has evidence that directly refused the premise of trust a Trump Russia probe in other words that there's been and remains\nEvidence that was a great piece by Jonathan Turley ... three reasons Mahler may not charge Trump with obstruction apparently not asking any questions about it but sticking exclusively to whether or not there was any type of collusion which we all know the answer to a you have one top Republican lawmakers\nSaying the FBI failed to provide a federal surveillance court with important evidence well we don't that now for a long time and we know that for Pfizer court judges\nOr handed information that was supposed to be verified and corroborated ended up being Hillary Clinton's bought and paid for Russian lies that was put together by fusion GPS interestingly funneled money through ... from the hiring of Christ is Christopher Steele of foreign national he doesn't even stand by the information and the ...\nAnd it was the bulk of information to get for Pfizer warrants against the Trump campaign associate and the lead up to the twenty sixteen race\nAll this comes down to some simple basic fundamental things and they never told the Pfizer judges that it was Hillary Clinton they paid for this information and it's unbelievable that this could be happening in this country but it looks like we're finally beginning to get to the bottom of it at least I Hope so Jason Chaffetz is with us\nFormer congressman now Fox News contributor author of New York times best seller the deep state\nWe have Victoria Toensing and Joe diGenova of of the gentleman ... with us ah thank you both for being here let's start with Jason shape it's because this is your wheel house\nAnd it seems to me that it doesn't matter what Congress request as they seek to do their job of oversight they're never going to get the information from the department of justice and they're not going to get the people they need to talk in front of them under oath\nWell the hard part about when you issue is the pain that when I was the chairman of the oversight commission or committee I can issue a subpoena but the only way to on for that is through the department of justice and so the weight of the paper really isn't worth much because the deejay won't enforce its own subpoena the subpoena issued by Congress\nThat the name that people need to also familiar ... themselves with is marked Elias market why it was ...\nHe was counsel for the DNC he

you'll start to see his name along with you know or and Simpson and all these others\nWell I think the fact that ... Simpson is now saying Victoria that was going to plead the fifth and can get away with that and make them come in and plead the fifth you know the idea that they can do is threatened to plead the fifth and not have to actually go through with it I think is important\n[noise] they should make him show up and in front of the TV cameras plead the fifth\nThat's ridiculous to accept a letter from the lawyers and I hope Jason you're talking to your former French and telling them to get them or get in to the Congress to take this it and I don't care if they're not trained cute [noise]\nI'm In ... because I think there are other ways to to figure out how to do it you've got a subpoena you subpoenaed first and then you negotiate later\nYou don't say oh mine he didn't show up talking trying to work it out now you have to think of that scene and he said Pina and then you say you can't make it Wednesday then you make it Thursday that I Can't believe there's no ...\nWell I mean I'm trying to understand I mean the president said that there would be de classification and all the materials the Jim Jordan was just talking about would be an redacted and we'd have a chance to see the ... the gang of eight information that three oh two between\nA Bruce or and Christopher Steele and how they wanted a funnel that information straight into Robert Mueller's office uh Joe diGenova but you know the idea of why do I think even with you and Victoria's my attorneys\nThat I wouldn't get away with just saying oh I'm going to plead the fifth leave me alone now or or not handing over subpoenaed materials to Congress\nWell I don't think there's any question that Congress has dropped the ball on course to get some subpoenas but let me just say this 'cause this is really important all the names that you heard\nMichael ... Mr liar and said or all those people they are to everything that was done in the United states\nWhat's fascinating is what happened in the United kingdom between the Congress has an important issue any subpoenas court we now know that the FBI or am I fix\nHim that you do a few to conduct electronic surveillance of Americans said he said it on foreign soil without legal authority to do so\nAnd that information what fact conversations George ...\nWere intercepted and in the course of the intercepting the compensation they found out that Papadopoulos was not interested in Hillary email or anything else and they never ... information because by the court\nYou know it seems congressman shape it's that every piece of the puzzle now is falling in place I think we now understand what the insurance policy was Lisa Page testified that in the the nine months of the investigation\nLeading up to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller that they had no evidence of Trump Russia collusion at all\nAnd by the way even her lover Peter Struck said the same thing he said well I'd be all end up there was something there there's no there are there and then all of a sudden we find the media elite strategy that they discussed this with Andrew McCabe comes in James Baker comes in and other people come in\nAnd what we see is again it goes back to the Clinton bought and paid dossier that dossier information has leaked out to the media creating the impression that in fact there was Russia Trump collusion\nBut they did it themselves they took the again it's it's all they were doing the leaking so that they can appoint the special counsel so that in the which one could be ... begin\nAny part of the puzzle that isn't clear to you because it's getting very clear to me\nDo it is becoming a crystal clear\nAnd that's why Jim Jordan is exactly right\nThe people that were in that meeting and remember the timing of this evening this meeting happens directly after a district Colombia's relieved of his duties but just before Mr Mueller is put into place and you have to understand who's in that meeting what was discussed it sounds like bakers being most candid about what was going on there\nBut each of the people in that meeting should be brought in for its own their own deposition uh transcribe under oath\nOr before Congress you don't have these five minute little ... you know after you have questions when you do this and I've been in these things go for an hour for the Republican than the Democrats get time than another hour for Republicans if you can really get in depth information if they would do it that way\nWell Victoria I think that's true and that's right and that's just not fair but\nThe obstruction continually I Will take a break

a a photo by the New York times Turkish officials have shared an audio recording with the U.S in Saudi Arabia and they say ... ... was murdered by Saudi operatives upset the president say they didn't get any tape but this time I\nAm a pro government newspaper reporting that ... apple watch recorded the interrogation torturing killing\nWell I Would assume if that watch exist in this happened and what we believe that he might have been taken out and body pieces not sure that they wouldn't take the watch at that point but before leaving reality Pompeo told reporters at the Saudi leaders made no exception on who they would hold accountable\nAnyway so now according to the British newspapers are saying circus of fish or Turkish officials have a recording of blah blah blah and that had to pack up and down the apple watch and you have some of the other people saying it's highly unlikely that show that you could have broadcast the signal from his apple watches it was too far for Bluetooth connection\nYou know I think what's happened clearly as the Turks and the Saudi ... had the Saturday counseling wired they have transmitters and the Turks don't trust any diplomats that have been into most of the embassies most consulates in Turkey and they listen to what's going on\nAnd we'll find out in this case um my take I think it probably all happen but I don't think we should rush to judgment because the truth is going to come out probably sooner rather than later\nJoining us now Dr Sebastian Gorka former White House advisers brand new book is phenomenal by the way why we

questioned uh I think this man is dead whether or not these audio tapes exist is another question but it's absolutely certain\nThat this individual was caught between two nations that wants to dominate the Sunni Muslim world\nThe new off to them and as the wand regime of turkey and the birth place of Islam Saudi Arabia and this man was caught in the middle however however this isn't the fake news we've got to be accurate this man was a journalist wasn't an American so well that trying to spin it was a foreign national resident who\nWas a common pay ... you wrote commentary and he has a long decades long history of ... the Muslim Brotherhood and there's also related to the figures Arab arms deal out of the twenty first century ... so all of these things are total statements of factual\nWhat do you think a missed the hop and it's been a while my uh my friend Dan is good to have you back I Know this has been your life and your business for so many years um my gut is pretty clear on this uh I think this man was murdered and the most evil roof brutal way possible\nAnd I think that the president is wise knowing that we're going to get to the truth now there's no doubt we're going we're going to have the truth rushing to that point is not smart in my opinion\nI I agree with you uh look there's a lot of evidence that we have already we nailed it Fifteen Saudis traveled on the Gulf Stream Arafat arrived at the cost of the day the show he answered and we know he just show again never exited the costs ...\nA week do the makeup of those of the Fifteen Saudis for them apparently part of ... the one of them the forensic doctor you referred to as listening to music well allegedly this membrane ... body after he was killed\nOr what we don't know\nIt was with the orders that were given the safety and Saudi and who gave them the orders and and to whom did they report posts for them\nThose are all questions we need to answer that President I think was a hundred percent right to just fashion secretary state they gather the fact emphasize that they were issue of greatest concern to us\nWe'll get that fact with accuracy and a lack of the that's what matters I Will remind the listeners that when Sergei Filin power was poisoned back in March\nHome secretary said they needed to avoid speculation while we allow the police carry on their investigation I think that's what's going on here in the last thing I Would just highlight is that Well Secretary palm pain was meeting and doing its public diplomacy I'm quite sure what the the FBI legalized fish in Riyadh\nAnd the other in a central or an uncle or probably meeting with their Turkish and Saudi counterparts to collect the evidence but it to be a part of reviewing a shot\nYou know it's the I

favorite radio talk show host is on the air right now right Mr mall when\nSean Hannity\nThere was a twenty fourteen study scientific study and they said that average European American walking around his point one eight percent Native American she's half\nSo the idea that she continues to double down on that why is the most disgusting thing to me it's a fact that she's in the public eye and she continues to use is and what she was trying to do was put this to bed so she could run against President Trump and twenty twenty and it is backfiring on her and I'm Glad to see it because she was she needs to come out and apologize to all of us\nI'm not running for president I'm not running for president I'm not running for president I Am not running for president of the United states are you going to run so fast that I Know I'm not running and I'm not going to run\n\nHi I'm Geoff Diehl running to be your fulltime US Senator you don't need a part time author part time senator and part time presidential candidate I'm going to put Massachusetts first\nI'm Janet deal the guy who's done automatic gas tax hikes and now I Know to stop partisan gridlock in Washington that's why I'm running for Senate against Elizabeth Warren same Elizabeth Warren they call a lease officers racist\nMe I call them heroes men and women with their lives on the line every day\nMy campaign isn't about party politics about getting the job done [noise] Massachusetts I'm Jay Field I approve this\nOr that is the ad glad you're with us by the way twenty five now so the top of the hour eight hundred nine four one Sean ... is our number\n... ads by Jeff deal Elizabeth Warren will she does have to get reelected as senator she wants to think about running for president from the great state of Massachusetts in the commonwealth look here's where we are this week Elizabeth Warren has claimed for ever that she is native ...\nCan we can go back to Nineteen eighty six to Nineteen Ninety five she listed herself as a Native American and the directory of the association of American law schools she identified as a Native American during her tenure when she was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania while teaching at Harvard law school\nShe was described as quote the only tenured minority woman and on multiple occasions Warren stated that her mother and father were forced to a low\nBecause of racism surrounding her mother's Native American lineage he was featured in a Native American cookbook that is entitled\nHow while chow and it turns out according to the DNA test that she released a justice week well it turns out he is approximately between one sixty one sixty fourth and one one thousand twenty fourth\nNative American let me interpret it another way that's less than zero point one percent Native American Ninety six percent European according to the American Journal of human genetics that's less than the average white person that lives in the United states so you have are claiming to be a Native American and our professional career a political career\nFor personal gain claims of family was discriminated against as a result of all this\nThen tries to prove to her detractors that she's right and releases a DNA test showing less than point one percent of Native American heritage now is this all the Democrats have to offer you know identity politics the worse than I mean you know it's a national embarrassment what's going on here\nNow the question is I I Know that Massachusetts plans solidly left I Know it's a solidly blue state but do you really want to elect somebody that has lied on such a spectacular level to advance her career all throughout her career as your senator\nWell do you have to deal is the candidate running against Elizabeth Warren I Know it's a long shot but you know Massachusetts also different points elect the guys like Bill well than\nMitt Romney at the time so I guess it is possible ... that are the people of Massachusetts can wake up how are you doing\nTo shine great to be with you thank you hey this is the state where I'm you know Scott Brown won when he ran again or\nA ... state that was the model for the on Affordable Care act so uh if we can definitely when this and I'll tell you something the Boston determines association has never indoors to Republican for the U.S Senate they've done in this race the last Republican was H. George W. Bush\nUm when Elizabeth Warren talked about the criminal justice system being racist front to back them she got so many people angry there's a lot of families out there that care about community safety and here she is insulting law enforcement so this is a different race and I think most people are expecting and I think now that she's made it very clear that she wants to run for the White House and twenty twenty\nI'm In no focus on Massachusetts whatsoever\nOn this is a no brainer for a lot of people out there and and of course the integrity issue I'm not really concerned about her ancestry but the integrity of claiming Native American heritage is what I think people are most concerned about and she says one thing all the time and does another she wants to raise your taxes Sean", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Newton", "day": "20"}
