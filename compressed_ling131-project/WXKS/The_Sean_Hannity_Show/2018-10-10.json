and it made landfall with one hundred fifty five miles per hour when they're in close to a category five so powerful it could hit Georgia as a hurricane\nOr it'll be a little south of Atlanta Atlanta is not going to get the brunt of this at some point tomorrow but gosh the is going to be hit really really hard so draw a line from Panama City Beach Florida straight to Augusta, Georgia\nAnd if you're in any of those surrounding areas you are right in line of of the path of hurricane Michael and it's moving at a pretty rapid pace which means that will be there sometime tomorrow and then make its way up the coast\nThrough Columbia South Carolina into North Carolina and then we expect at that point it's probably going to go out to see a little bit but the bottom line is a this is a cat for borderline tap five hurricane\nAnd the strongest one ever to reach the Gulf Coast area there in the panhandle area and are on top of it we got catastrophic storm surge\nThese destructive wind gusts hundred and Seventy five miles per hour and even higher I'm over ... million power outages we expect occurring and not just near the coast but also inland after now this is hitting as we speak\nRainfall and flooding is gonna be a significant threat into the Carolinas so uh everybody if if you're in\nIf you're in Georgia if you're in South Carolina of you're in North Carolina you know you can make your preparation now and I would listen to local authorities of the telling you to get out get out and uh you can come back take whatever important pictures valuables you need to take with you packed\nOur move inland and protect your family and uh you know our thoughts and prayers are with everybody in harm's way today this was this is the real deal this is you know Florida governor scared to death for those who said\nThis is why you know at times they make predictions they tell you to leave and it it's not as bad as they say it's gonna be this is one of those times it's as bad or worse than they predict that it's going to be the worst\nThe worst hurricane ever for the panhandle in Florida that's how dangerous this is as it goes inland we're talking about in Augusta, Georgia you're going to be having eighty to a hundred mile an hour winds tomorrow same thing as your head up to Columbia South Carolina into the\nInto North Carolina so a lot of bad stuff happening our thoughts and prayers are with everybody and just no help will be on the way we live in the greatest country on earth would the most generous people on earth and whatever our friends in Florida Georgia\nThe Carolinas are going to need I Know that people will be there to to help in any way imaginable a we have some breaking news on the deep state as it relates to Rod Rosenstein oh this is really outrageous\nRod Rosenstein I'll think of everything that he was involved and think of how conflicted he as bad as it relates to all things deep state that we have been telling you about now for a year and a half he is the person\nIn may twenty Seventeen recommending the firing of Jim told me he is the guy that appointed special counsel Robert Mueller he is the guy that signed the third ... knew all the fourth Pfizer application to spy on the Trump campaign associate Carter Page\nOr the bulk of the information in the ... of warrants as we all know now where the Hillary Clinton bought and paid for phony Russian ... that even its author Christopher Steele doesn't stand by\nAnd of course that was funneled money it was made to look like a legal expense when in fact there was anything but a legally spends\nNow he was now are supposed to testify but those three people now\nLisa Page Andrew McCabe the former deputy FBI Director and James Baker again we just learned this you know this week James Baker now the third person\nAre all saying that Rod Rosenstein talked at length about surreptitiously going into the oval office\nTaping the president of the United states by the way that would be without a warrant and then hoping he can get some information something from the president\nThat could then at night or ... or start the process of invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment to remove the president from office\nNow he's denying it said he was being sarcastic said it was he was joking about it but the testimony of Lisa Page Andrew McCabe and James Baker all contradict what Rod Rosenstein is now saying\nWell Rod Rosenstein was scheduled to testify tomorrow to the house Judiciary Committee but unfortunately this hour there at an impasse and the impasse over the terms of the testimony because lawmakers are calling for what is the standard congressional task force interview\nAnd insisting that Rod Rosenstein give a transcribed interview and that the interview be under oath\nHe's refusing to do so and those close to Rosenstein say they prefer a meeting and I'm sure they do or briefing with the house Judiciary Committee chairman and other lawmakers they don't want any paper trail they don't want to be under oath at all\nNow the house Judiciary Committee aides said on Wednesday they left the door open for a possible resolution there should be no resolution the resolution is to subpoena Rod Rosenstein and have him testify under oath did he or did he not\nAs Lisa Page as McKay Andrew McCabe is James Baker all saying Diddy or did he not talked about wearing a wire against the president and the hope of getting something he says to help invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment\nEither he did it or he didn't do it and then we can also talk about why he signed the the fourth and final buys a warrant application as it relates to Carter Page\nWhy why did he sign off on a document himself talked about well with regards to ... you know that it was an affidavit and career law enforcement swears to the validity of truthfulness\nAnd if they're wrong there's consequences well we all know the bulk of the five applications including the last one\nAnd there's one that shouldn't have been signed by that point they knew Hillary paid for it they knew that Dan St paid for it\nThey knew it was full of uncorroborated on verified information we're now nine months in two surveilling Carter Page by then you think they would have figured out that the the us da was phony and made up and even its own author\nOr couldn't prove any of its contents and when questioned in in in Iraq a tour and Great Britain and said I don't know if any of this is true of just raw intelligence and people just say and things like to hookers urinating in a bad in front of Donald Trump or in Moscow and the Ritz Carlton\nWell nobody ever verify that or corroborated that and it is if you're going to get an affidavit ... the law especially Pfizer application Pfizer warrant\nAnd protocol that you verify the contents and the information you're presenting to a court\nAnd you don't purposely withhold information pertinent information like the fact that Hillary Clinton bought and paid for that pony ... that you didn't take\nThe time to verify or corroborate because obviously they all hated Donald Trump because remember struck was the one that said well first they get to smell the Trump voters in a Wal Mart but also said\nShould win them a hundred million to zero\nAnd then you're going to add to that the insurance policy comment that he made and what you really have here is I think now the validation or the ... operation of what the insurance policy was\nInsurance policy is that you have people conspiring not only remember Lisa Page testified\nAs we head into may nine months into the investigation into so called Trump Russia collusion by the very same people that gave Hillary Clinton a pass on the biggest obstruction of justice case in history\nThen they go into the Trump Russia so called investigation\nLisa Page confirms that they had no information Peters trucks tax confirmed that there is no there are there but anyway then they start ... media elite strategy all coming from the same source which is Hillary's bought and paid for dot CA\nThey get their willing accomplices in the media to spread their lives and propaganda from the CIA\nAnd it creates an atmosphere where an impression is being created that whoa there really is something going on here\nAnd then it's used by the very same people the phony information that they spread to whip up hysteria so that they can go forward after the firing of called me on the ninth of may in twenty Seventeen and then they appoint\nRod Rod Rosenstein goes out in the points his buddy Robert Mueller\nBut there was no evidence at all according to Lisa Page that there was any reason to open a special counsel investigation\nThe whole house of cards the corruption those failing school is now exposed no wonder Rod Rosenstein doesn't want to speak to the Senate Judiciary committee is outside of the house Judiciary Committee no wonder why Whitey\nEspecially under oath where then he could be charged with lying under oath you know and people worry about that just ask Papadopoulos or General Flynn\nOr we have a lot of information we're going to get to we have a rash musician a poll out today Republicans tied with the Democrats on the generic ballot that is huge we have more information specific information of just how radical\nThe Democratic party's agenda is if they ever get back power and twenty seven days we have in Arizona mix Sally thankfully has taken the lead in that close Senate race out there she is really an American war hero\nAnd ah anyway I think we're seeing a lot of moving in Missouri

Jones junk twelve hundred\n[noise] this is the Fox\nNews alerts Florida get hammered and so does the stock market timely separating\nDown down eight hundred ten points at the closing bell that's the third biggest point drop ever for the Dow interest rate concerns getting most of the blame I'll have more on that in a moment first hurricane Michael\nAnd from the standpoint of a left wing Democrat\nThis'll be the end of the world so I think her level of intensity and emotional as was right because she's actually sending a signal that of course this is what this is about you on a future where the the\nHillary Clinton's and and the and the congresswoman waters and people like Nancy Pelosi defined your future where do you want a future\nAnd what you have the power because you've got money in your pocket your taxes are lowered red tape is less the Washington bureaucracy smaller and you actually get to find your own future that magnetic uh difference\nWell look you know as well as I Do there's only been three times in the last hundred years where the party that wins the White House ends up picking up seats in in Congress and their first midterm election now the last time that that happened was after the nine eleven attacks in two thousand and two and I think the costs\nIt was so unified at that moment that there was no desire to change of power in any way shape or form I think before judge Kavanaugh I was a little worried about the enthusiasm gap that existed between Republican voters and democratic voters\nAre that gap is now closed completely and in most instances when there's a tie that means that's a huge advantage for Republicans because pollsters don't tend to get that right\nRight well let's talk you mentioned I mean one of the key examples of why the next few weeks you're going to become Republican which Kevin McCarthy just introduced a bill that says basically look here's your choice\nYou want to stop ... now from killing people you want to stop carfentanil is even worse too many people you want to stop opioids coming in from Mexico you want to stop human trafficking coming into Mexico you want to stop and I was Thirteen coming in Mexico you got to control the border and he got the first bill that actually says unequivocally\nWe're going to control the border now what are the Democrats are offering open borders\nEither abolish or shrink ice sanctuary city\nSo the Democrats are saying look we feel really bad that your child may die of an opioid overdose feel really bad that your neighborhood school may be terrorized by Mr team but after all were left wing ideologues and you can expect us to be practical\nSo why don't you go along with us because you know that's the right thing to do is open up of America and let every drug dealer every human trafficker\nAnd and every single Emma searching gang members come in the country I think if that's the choice in elections don't you and I go to fast 'cause we are going to be up for election result like we have not seen our lifetime\nWell I ...

noticed there was a running up against this business guy by the name of what was his first name John Cox\nNon ... and and Cox is now in a five point almost within the margin race against Gavin Newsom

[noise] strong opinions\nNow there's a lot of talk about ... applications and many people that I I see talking about it seem not to recognize a what a five ... five application is actually a warrant just like a search warrant\nIn order to get five or a search warrant you need an affidavit signed by a career federal law enforcement officer who swears that the information the affidavit is true and correct the best of his knowledge and belief\nAnd that's the way we operate and if that's wrong sometimes it is if you find out as in any incorrect in there that person is going to face

warrant signed by a career law enforcement person swearing that what you are presenting to the court is true and\nYou know it to be true and affirmed it to be true well\nThat didn't work out what the third renewal by an application in the case of Carter Page a which is the fourth buys a warrant issued but the fourth one that was signed was signed by Rod Rosenstein\nAnd we all know that the bulk of information that was put in the ... and ...\nWell that was based on the phone eight Clinton bought and paid for dot CA that not even Christopher Steele stands by to this day\nAnd that was never verified never corroborated and has turned out to be mostly debunked which is among the many other complex that Rod Rosenstein has of course he's the one that recommended firing Jim called me\nHe's the one that signed the visor warrants he's the one that appointed Mueller\nAnd are now he was scheduled to appear tomorrow under old and a two sources now telling Fox News at this hour\nThat Rod Rosenstein scheduled the parents before the house Judiciary Committee is at an impasse over the terms of the past\nThe moaning and he doesn't want to have a transcribed interview under oath which is the standard for congressional task force interviews\nAnd those closed Rosenstein say well he prefers a meeting or a briefing with the house Judiciary Committee chairman and other lawmakers where there's no paper trail where there's no under oath part well the question is why would he be afraid to go under oath\nWell here to weigh in on this and much more\nUh as as impasse continues Mark Meadows he is the Freedom Caucus chairman and congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio also a Freedom Caucus member a and by the way would be in the house Judiciary Committee\nOr the interview of Rod Rosenstein um we also have learned in the last three days Mark Meadows I'll start with you that\nWe now know that Lisa Page\nAndrew McCabe the deputy FBI directors under criminal investigation leaves the page who is out at the FBI James Baker the top attorney the FBI they all are telling the same story that Rod Rosenstein said that he wanted to surreptitiously record the president of the United states\nIn the hopes of being able to get him to say something that would allow them to invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment so we there's a lot of questions were Rod Rosenstein at this moment\nWell there are a lot of questions I think probably the bigger question is why would Rod Rosenstein\nOr not be prepared to come to Congress tomorrow to clear his name and I think the reason for that is there there are a credible witness as you know your lead in had Rod Rosenstein voice saying well you know the needs to be facts and we have the rule of law well we're willing to to consider him innocent until proven guilty\nHim not coming tomorrow indicates a that there is real credibility with these witnesses that suggested that he not only wanted to take the president but he wanted to use those tapes a to effectively have a deal Jake two on the president of the United states\nWell he met with the president apparently earlier this week and blue on air force one does anyone know what the result of that meeting was\nWell I think the biggest thing is uh Shaun is is a let's don't read too much into a flight on air force one and I think it's the president trying to be reasonable and hear rod side of the story I think the president has been extremely measured\n[noise]\nDiabetes high blood pressure anxiety meds everyone's on them if you're a fifty year old male maybe a bit Porgy and you may even have

know why there would be any hesitation\nConsidering that he is up to his eyeballs and everything the firing of combing the appointment of Robert Mueller the signing of the third buys a warrant and three people now saying that he's talking about taping the president of the United states in the context of possibly invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment what else do we need to get a subpoena for somebody\nWell hopefully I I Would I Would not encourage giving out anybody's phone number in your great at holding people accountable but here's what I Would say is the fact\nCovering it your list interest and the people that are truly tune in on a regular basis to listen to you they need to make sure their member of Congress feels the heat and understands how important this is but the other part of that is is Gemini or try to work today\nUh to to stress the importance of why transparency and and the fact that the deputy attorney general much caught me at\nA bus raises right in and say this is what I did and this is what I didn't do anything shy of that uh really uh would would be an indictment on his credibility\nYeah what about the president now talked about the classifying and releasing the un redacted by the applications especially pages ten through twelve Seventeen through thirty for the final buys a warrant the one that Rod Rosenstein sign have either have you seen that particular Pfizer application\nI have not uh Shaun we need to see that we need to see it and don't take an after every time roots or goes in and talks with yeah yeah I remember Mr or told us\nThat after each conversation he had with\nGlenn Simpson and Chris steel he would then contact person at the FBI and he would sit down with them and they would take notes we want to see all those notes of all those conversations we know they're at least twelve of those\nSo the so called real too as we need to see those and remember when the president first talked about classifying well we all asking to do this three weeks ago he talked about any communications from Andy McCabe Lisa Page all those documents as well\nThat would include ... number so we we need all that information\nAnd again if you're ... find that lead into your debt talks about how our great system of justice works\nKey to that is transparency give us the information that we need to see it more important the American people need to see\nWell do you want to call chairman Gowdy it's too old to two to five six zero three zero be polite please too old to two to five six oh three oh\nA chairman Goodlatte is too old to two to five fifty four thirty one too old to two to five fifty four thirty one we'll put them up on Hannity dot com and again be respectful but I think\nWith all that's going on and they should demand that he

interest rates the NASDAQ plunging more than four percent it's biggest point drop in Eighteen years\nA welcome both of you to the program I'm ... you you watch the tactics you see the polls for the first time raspy used in showing that Republicans have more enthusiasm the Democrats in the lead up to the mid term elections I think the Kavanaugh hearings says awoken people to just\nHow vicious the Democratic party can be\nYeah I'll listen to the old tactics to the past with the Republican Party mature intimately familiar with where\nDemocrats lobby political grenade right onto the field usually some kind of a you go through the list every night on Fox show you a racist besides you just you know the the phobic ... kind of stuff these identity politics can easily Republicans would scatter\nWell they tried a new one with Kavanaugh they try to really disgusting one this rapist line which is one of the most important things I've ever seen in politics and for the first time shot in a long time\nWe had a president the White House who said we're not going to back down a cabinet we're not going to let you back then I Will get back you up and we won one\nAnd that when I Believe is really just and this is not a scientific sample I don't want to oversell it but based on me just driving around in my town which is a fifty fifty Republican Democrat county Martin County Florida\nRepublicans could not be more ecstatic that we finally have a warrior and a fighter in the White House who is not going to leave the battlefield when that identity politics or disgusting label or comes in from the Democratic party and I think it's really a spiced up the Republican base and I think we may have a we may have a a decent the election day\nWell I'm not sure I Can't read the tea leaves um I think it all comes down in these midterm elections always comes down to turn out and if people are motivated like the Rasmussen poll says uh than it would happen\nLooking at the numbers that Republicans are more mad about the cabinet controversy that Democrats\nAre in a more determined to vote and the upcoming elections just as a dramatic twenty five points shift in just the last six weeks Greg Garrett so that would give hope to me and hopefully the American people that\nSomehow the Republicans can bucked the trend in and maintain power in the house and maybe pick up some Senate seats which I think are a distinct possibility\nWell I think you're right the only question is with twenty seven days remaining or does this trend that Republicans are motivated in energized devote have legs will it last over the course of the next four weeks [noise]\nUm and you know we just don't know that but you're right the polling data does show that and I you know I think that there is a general anger among both men and women across America that this was a process\nOf the confirmation hearing that was a mass amount of fairness and the presumption of innocence and due process and that absent some corroborating evidence from a thirty six year old claim\nYou really can't ruin somebody's career and their lives and you know the reputation or ... that they've built up in the goodwill and their families reputation\nSure I mean I Do think that there is a feeling across America that a lot of this is unfair now there are liberals and the media which is done and\nUh who are show rabbit that they don't care about fairness today just care about their own political agenda however misplaced in wrong it may be\nAnd so you're never going to change their minds there is no reasoning with on reasonable people so we'll just have to wait and see it's up to the Republican Party I think and and the candidates and indeed President Trump to maintain the momentum going forward over the next twenty seven days\nLook the hell out of great article today about what their agenda is then they the Democrats have big plans none of which will help the country\nOr they want to shore up Obamacare which has been nothing short of a disaster for the American people\nThey want more Dodd Frank financial rules to protect quote dreamers and the integrity of elections in other words they want massive amnesty they want to aggressively probe any single thing they can they want this country locked down into endless investigation\nAnd likely the impeachment of Donald Trump they you know Republican celebrate the passage of the biggest tax cutting history they refer to as crumbs\nAnd they're saying it's time to take the crumbs back I guess the crumbs or the most delicious part of the meal um so all of this is in jeopardy dam bond you know I don't see a waning in people's enthusiasm now I think they have\nThey went so far in the cabin okay some frankly in the last two years what we have witnessed with the and you chronicled lives in your new book\nYou know the the attempted sabotage of the president I think they see the fundamental unfairness and nothing they stand for is going to help the average American have a better life\nRight and so on the media and Greg just nailed it by the way [laughter] you know the media and the Democrats ... ... it's it's it's symbiotic I mean it it's a host\nAt a at a parasite at this point they're the same thing they have ... up this rage ... not all of them but many of 'em against Donald Trump to such an intense for me think about the things showing that have come out I mean new lows in politics\nDonald Trump's Supreme Court nominee called the rapists Donald Trump called the uh treat treat guilty of treason a crime literally punishable by death that's not hyperbolic\nHe'd been he's been called trees is they ginned up the base so much on that here's the problem the Democrats have created for themselves in the election\nThat in order to seem like the more anti Trump candidate to get that money in those volunteers for your twenty twenty presidential campaign or to get that money in the midterms what do you have to do you have to oppose the trader you have to oppose that train rapist or whatever sick name they call the cabinet\nSo that that's what's leading to this ... this cycle pathology on the left\nAnd I agree I I don't see this waning and I do see Republican voters saying listen when is enough enough you attack this that this American patriot and cabinet you try to take down the Trump Administration weaponize and the government when is enough enough and I think they're going to show up I Hope I pray they do\nWell what do you think about Hillary's endorsement of ah the incitement of getting in people's face and you can't be civil suit basically calling for instability you you can't really civil with the political party\nThat wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about and then the other comments made by people like Maxine Waters and others getting their Hayes\nFollow him into a grocery store is following the gas stations confront them chase them out of restaurants which we have seen going on and on a on a regular basis\nFor Republicans it is absolutely wonderful you know they ought to send an early Christmas gift to Hillary Clinton Michael ... Maxine Waters Jerry Adler Nancy Pelosi many of those individuals are calling for\nA the investigation and teach men to Brett Kavanaugh which Americans realize you is wrong and preposterous I could
