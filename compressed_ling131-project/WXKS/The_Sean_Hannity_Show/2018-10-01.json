against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh I'm\nWaiting just like you certainly if they find something I'm going to take that into consideration absolutely I I have a very open mind meantime\nThe New Yorker piece this was by Mr Ramirez and remember even the New York times couldn't go with that story they had reported that\nThey interviewed several dozen people in an attempt to corroborate her story they couldn't find one person with first hand knowledge\nAnd then they reported that Mrs Ramirez herself was contacting former your classmates asking if they were called the incident told them pull some of them that she could not be certain Mr cabin all was the one who exposed himself and that's what they're saying\nAnd remember she admitted she quickly became a ... jihad gaps in her memory foggy slurring of words\nSo that's what the Democrats are said there's a credible allegation well if it was so critical why didn't they ask judge Kavanaugh when he sat in front of them last week 'cause they ... they all have the opportunity to delve into anything they wanted to delve into and\nThey chose not to then we've got the the third incident which is the ... case\nWhere a woman claims that routinely almost on a weekend basis and she had been the ten of these parties herself personally that there was Brett Kavanaugh one and a bunch of ... kids that were drug ...\nGirls and then lining up in the hall waiting their turn to rape innocent girls\nAnd a whole series of allegations he looked at as as Byron York said the gold polls\nHave moved very very far away very very quickly and all the people that but not just going to be a week limited scope no big deal just an FBI investigate you want to clear your name right you'd want to clear your name right judge\nIt's not about clearing his name it's about giving them more time so they can come up with more allegations and it doesn't matter at the end of the day Democrats do not even want a vote on judge Kavanaugh\nAnd they want to continue the smears the slander the lies the mismanagement character assassination frankly the political blood joining of judge Kavanaugh and his family now as evidenced by now remember\nDianne Feinstein had this for six long weeks she had this back in July\nThere was a California state or California congressman that had it early July and then they went to Dianne Feinstein Dianne Feinstein on two separate occasions was meeting with judge Kavanaugh then of course we had the original hearings\nAnd not at one point that Dianne Feinstein ever mentioned professor Ford\nBut while she was meeting with him privately she was simultaneously recommending lawyers to professor Ford and one that was eventually chosen was Deborah cats\nAnd she is a lawyer that represents professor forward but which is fine but she has a history of oh challenging Paula Jones and supporting Al Franken so in other words she's radical left political the attorney is\nAnd so anyway they were emails sent out we just found out late last week of a friend of this attorney for professor for this Deborah cats woman and she was in the hearing she was sitting to the right\nOf professor Ford or to the left on your screen if you were watching the hearings\nAnyway it goes on to say that friends emails were sent by a friend of Deborah cats the lawyer representing professor Ford recommended by Dianne Feinstein\nAnd they were soliciting women to accuse judge Brett Kavanaugh of impropriety and this is what they were sending out last week where we just need an FBI Barry expeditious very quick very limited in scope they were they have been and continue to be on a fishing expedition\nNow the emails were obtained by the Washington Free beacon seeking corroboration from classmates of cabin all about your book and trees and gang rape and won emails sent\nA late last week delivered to roughly fifty alumni of stone rich school of the Sacred Heart an all girls school near Georgetown Prep\nWith the subject line corroboration needed Deborah cats need to find people who are familiar with what the slang terms were used by Brett Kavanaugh on his yearbook page meant\nAnd the devil's triangle and the F F F F F\nA wording in there if you can speak to any of these are willing to sign an affidavit pleased contact us that's a fishing expedition and that is ... this is what the Democrats wanted the delay for\nNow if it was truly limited in scope and we know that in the case of professor poured that they were four people she mentioned we're at this party some don't remember ever being even her best friend don't remember ever being at a party where Brett Kavanaugh was at\nUnder the you know that one of your perjury I mean ... ... under the penalty of a felony here so they all signed these affidavits all agreed that the that they didn't have any recollection\nAnd the the most difficult part of it is is professor Ford identified an eye witness to the event that eye witness has said under penalty of a felony that it never happened what professor Ford is claiming and this is professor Ford who put\nMark judge in the room at the time of the alleged incident so I'm not sure what the FBI really can do in this case beyond\nSee whether any of these people are going to admit that they committed perjury and gave false statements that ... there's nothing else really left for them to do please use your voice you will not get a second chance this letter goes on to say I mean well this point you're you're pretty much just soliciting\nYou know randomly anybody to come forward please please come forward and then the hope is that there will be delayed again and again and again and you know on top of that than we've got you know what was supposed to be limited in scope what was supposed to be done expeditiously in a week\nNow is turning into because they can't get anything else at least not that we know of yeah who knows what Dianne Feinstein owes\nThen the only thing they've got is well did he commit perjury about the amount of alcohol that he drank you know did he really black how would anybody know if he blacked out that's the only he would be able to tell you if he blacked out\nNow he admitted to drinking to liking beer liking bureau lot still liking beer drinking too much beer you know being intoxicated he admitted to all of that\nWhen he was in high school and college which not all that uncommon let's be honest about it and so they're trying to say well he didn't he do we know we had to uh blacked out as an I work as a bartender for a number of years I Know a lot about alcohol I watched it up close and personal\nYou know everybody's got a number for some people the numbers to and after two they lose it\nFor some people I there were people that every single night I work could sit there from six PM till four thirty when I close the doors and other throw him out and they'd be walking straight having been drinking all night I mean the tolerance level from individual individual is just it's an enormous\nYou know you'd see some people that go beyond their numbers they become aggressive or flirtation I saw it all I learned a life lesson and it wasn't good if you go beyond what ever your individual number is it's never going to be good for you or or anybody else for that matter\nUm anyway so he got that and so it's not about limited in scope there's a lot of news or no time any uh was I don't know where the clock is I'm Mark Penn and wrote an interesting piece which I I found today\nAnd he said that he's a poster was the Clintons pollster and he noted today that in the immediate aftermath of last Thursday's testimony by professor Ford and Brett Kavanaugh slim majority of those surveyed sided with her but\nThey found he found is the support for professor Ford collapsed one voters were told that none of the three ... a witness to she cited to corroborate her allegation have any idea\nAs to what she's talking about and that fact was barely mentioned during Thursday's questioning and it was only mentioned if you remember at the end of the questioning or one of the things that were saying that we see a new poll out by ... to research group because the election is thirty six days away\nI Want you to think about thirty six days from now when you turn on your TV on election night and do you want to hear the words Nancy Pelosi has just been elected speaker of the house and Chuck Schumer is the new majority leader of the United States Senate because that's what the Democrats want now if this doesn't\nIf this does not show you this is not a party that wants to make America better that has a plan to help the working men and women forgotten men and women of America\nAs a matter of fact with every bit of six tests the president has it it it diminishes any chance they have it getting back their power and after two years of trying to destroy the president\nYou know they want to Christian do their way back into power just forgetting the eight years of Obama which would disastrous\nAnyway so we've got this election\nAnother tune in at night and you're going to flip the channels are you going to be

don't talk to the FBI is pretty amazing\nTo me you know just to use his exact words from his op ed refusal to most people will speak to the refusal to do so is its own kind a statement\nOf the problem

asked Papadopoulos who pays five years in jail\nYou know the idea that you know the FBI back in the middle of it you know you're screwed that's what you know when I was handed the Clinton email

of the FBI investigation\nWhat does it have to do is read I don't mind answering the question but you know what I'd like to do the ... with the other headline in the news which is the cow but I Know but how about talking about trade and then we'll get to that will do that a little bit later think anybody ever ... you don't have a trade deal will pass through Congress there are I think so but you know if it does look we have lots of other alternatives but I Do think so I think if they're fair\nWhich is a big question but if it's fair on both sides are Republicans love it\nIndustry loves it our country loves it or if it's fair\nIt will pass I think it'll pass easily right our to Sean Hannity show as we're back in the swamp were back in D.C a lot of breaking news eight hundred nine four one showing us auto\nFree telephone number you want to be a part of the program well what we're supposed to be last week a limited in scope and done very quickly is now evolved into Democratic senators\nOh the FBI must investigate all three credible allegations of sexual assault against judge Brett Kavanaugh\nBy the way why didn't they ask judge Kavanaugh when they had the opportunity last week if they want to expand the scope now the interesting thing about this email is well they are now putting out a list of we've got to interview this one and this one and this one and this one and this one including that anonymous person and this anonymous person that they're literally trying to tell the FBI had\nTo do their job and we found out this weekend emails were sent late last week by a friend of this left wing attorney that's representing professor forward that's the one that didn't believe Paula Jones and\nSupported Al Franken anyway but a friend of hers last week a you remember Dianne Feinstein recommended this attorney cats Deborah cats for professor Ford\nAnd of course while she was meeting Dianne Feinstein with Brett Kavanaugh anyway it turns out that they are now soliciting members of the Georgetown Prep community for information and searching for additional women who accused\nSupreme Court nominee judge Brett Kavanaugh of impropriety this is what you would call a witch hunt this is now a we don't have enough so let's see let's let's go out and solicit people\nSee if we can find people that are willing to say something horrible about Brett Kavanaugh because maybe that's the way we'll be able to stop the nomination we got delayed like we wanted now are we going to be able to get everything that we want Newt Gingrich has a great question is there even one Democrat decent enough or disgusted enough to end this cabinet travesty\nAnd he joins us now Sarah how are you welcome back to the program\nI'm doing well but I was very struck this morning by Byron ... column which he points out that the Democrats having decided that sex may not work are now looking at whether or not Kevin all might have been inaccurate in describing how much he drank so they're spreading a wider\nAnd frankly in an age when Justice Ginsburg was very political\nAnd some attacks on President Trump Democrats are trotting out judicial temperament of this whole thing is is this character assassination it is I think tremendously bad for the country uh and it is it tells us who they are I mean\nI think the key to the election this fall is which America do you want to be do you really want to be an America\nWhere somebody could live a decent life for thirty five years have two lovely daughter is a good marriage\nAnd then get smeared on ending Lee was totally uncorroborated assaults as I said really the America we want to become\nYou know the judge was honest as could be said I like beer I drink beer I drink beer then sometimes I drink too much beer\nHe denied ever blacking out I mean the accusation that somebody could observe them well he had the blackout that night um I was a bartender when I was Seventeen and Eighteen years old and I've seen a lot of drunk people in my life\nAnd I couldn't tell you whether or not they remember the incident the next day and it wouldn't be me in the position of saying that\nBut what they're doing is they're moving the bar this is what you're saying the goalposts now are being literally moved every second every hour of every day and now that we have people working on behalf of the Dianne Feinstein\nRecommend the lord lawyer Deborah cats and sending out letters saying ah we we need more people um it sounds like they never want this to end and I don't think there is going to be a Democrat to answer your question that's going to be decent enough or disgusted enough to end it\nWell let me try to be very clear from it because I'm I'm frankly very disappointed in the judiciary Republicans up just denying reality fact is\nThis has nothing to do with\nTraditional government this has nothing to do with the Senate this has nothing to do frankly with judge how this is about a militant left wing group willing to lie\nAssassin H meaner cheat I mean when you when you have\nWhen you have a mob that goes into a restaurant to harass Sen Cruz when you have to women [noise] who break into a an elevator to harass or senator over and over and over again which you have on the left his willingness to break the rules\nTo get what they want and I think that is a very serious problem\nYou know it it does raise a lot of questions because at this point I don't think we're going to go back to high school years you know when people talk and I watched a lot of there's this weekend you know two commentators actually saying this is Sean Hannity could have given the speech\nAnd I'm thinking okay um how is one supposed to act when they're falsely accused\nOf literally drugging women and boys lined up halls all over the costs of course of many weekends\nAs the boys can then take their chance that gang raping women and being a participant in that I don't know what the significant or normal reaction would be for me if you're innocent it would be righteous anger and indignation that that to me it would be the normal human response if you're innocent\nRight well let me let me know players trying for a minute because I spent the weekend thinking about what we're living through when you know Cory Booker says you're complicit with evil if you support Kavanaugh\nDeceiving example though you're getting Blumenthal who is the president was pointing out\nIs terrible record of overtly publicly lying about having served in Vietnam when he didn't\nKnow suddenly he's lecturing us on the importance of honesty and integrity [noise]\nAs I thought about it I went back and found a the following quote from Abraham Lincoln which he gave at Cooper Union in New York City and Eighteen sixty\nSpeaking about the defenders of slavery who are prepared to destroy the union\nHe says quote your purpose than\nPlainly state it is the you will destroy the government unless you be allowed to construe and enforce the constitution as you please\nOn all points in dispute between you and us you will rule or ruined and all events close quote I Dreamed I brought that option is I really believe that's where we are I think on the left you know people like Maxine Waters who remember if they get a majority she chairs the committee\nMachine not some random back bench not take she's a senior member of the Democratic party leadership and she has publicly saying that people you go out and find members of Trump Administration you harass them and the stores you harass them at the gas station you harass them at that at a restaurant what kind of country is that\nWell they're telling everybody to do it now they're out on a fishing expedition in what they promised last week which would be limited in scope\nAnd you know ... and an extra day to expedite the timeframe is now you know they're expanding it out even longer and longer longer which means what we've all suspected they just they just want to stop this no matter how they end up doing it\nUm when you are but the point is I think you're right but I also think that there's there's got to be a choice that has made here by the American people\nBecause if you can smear and lie and slander and bludgeon a guy like Brett Kavanaugh and go on these fishing expeditions and you're not even hiding what it is\nNobody is ever going to want to serve in any capacity in government ever oh not that we want\nPeople should remember when you get to the total attorney and history of the left if they can do to count and all they can do it to you that can do it to your daughter they can do it to your son\nI mean this is what happened to the Duke lacrosse team a total liar total fabrication Trent over a year is a cloud over these young men who had done nothing and so you turn around and the left is is very adept at this they believe in bowling they believe in intimidation\nThey they don't think the truth matters what matters is power and I think people need to understand this\nBook [noise]\nRadio I'm rich Dennison President Trump's as Supreme Court nominees been treated unfairly as the FBI

two weeks ago yesterday and look where we argue they took her welcome to the show\nThanks Sean well yeah I mean look\nYou know as being destroyed not because if anything he did or didn't do but because he's in the way of the Democrats retaining power\nIt's not personal it's just the party wants what he's about to get and so they're crushing him and his family in order to get it are we moving to a revolution while I don't look at the people in charge look at the Congress look at our media they're pushing conflict in division on us they're pushing racial division endlessly\nThey're pushing

... and you cannot cross fire reminded me and my dad who were just he just died a few weeks ago and so I think you'd be happy recalling him getting on to your show so\nI appreciate it you know cross fire was a defining show in the history of political debate in the country and and Pat Buchanan and breathing and all those original guys there there was an amazing show and it's funny\nYeah so I can empathize with I'm Brett Kavanaugh was one of those middle school nerds that you know it was probably watching those types of shows and doing the things that people want to mock now but I'm\nIn any event I think there's a silver lining potentially till the FBI investigation a number one for sale where conservatives we have a moral up us if we if we do detect that there's something wrong that he should be thrown overboard that's number one is that without being said but I don't that's not going to be found that being said\nIt's an opportunity for the Republicans do investigate further in turn the lands on the Democrats and some of their dirty tricks and use the power not that anybody should be abusing that power but the FBI should use that power to investigate everything that's going on here\nAnd potentially witness was being coaxed July people being put forward to sign false affidavits there's obviously a lot of that funny business going on I don't think Democrats ever thought that the public funds were going to allow such an investigation\nWell I don't think you look if we're going to be fair if they really cared about the issue then they'd be asking ah what about Keith Ellison and why would they supportive of Bill Clinton where's Juanita Roberts FBI investigation\nThey don't want any of these things because it's not\nThe issue with politics the greatest evidence that his

that we have now\nAchieved in two years to stop that will happen too but all the senators saying well\nNo no no we got to limit the scope but it's got to be very quick expeditious and just have the FBI do this that's not what they ever intended they want this to drag on through the mid term elections in the hope that Donald Trump doesn't get to make is pretty court nomination\nAnyway joining us now is Carrie Severino she's the chief counsel policy director for the Judicial Crisis network a welcome back to the program as well as predicted the bar has shifted\nAnd now the Democrats wanted ... then the FBI investigation but from my\nPoint as it relates to professor Ford there's really only for people that need to be interviewed and I would assume by now all four of them probably we're\n... I'm sure they were it was easy to find people because they already had been interviewed\nThe Senate Judiciary committee look the the the goalpost are moving faster than the speed of light here it's it's very difficult to ... to believe that any of these people um it it can take themselves seriously they said it's\nGoing to be here for days for just me a week and now they're going to have an artificial that time you know they were saying the FBI the gold standard there impartial there you know she said that every Democrat is now they're going up but Trump is evil puppet master controlling the FBI they're actually going to be as horrible part is an organization\nYou know it it it it is and it would be laughable if it wasn't a man's life long reputation here on the line\nTo hear your kind that are doing two weeks ago as far as everybody else knew Brett Kavanaugh had an impeccable reputation that is now that's gone forever you know ... you know re Donovan famously one said after being investigated for a year and a half where do I go to get my good name back mhm well in this case\nI I don't think ... ever gets back in many many ways\nI mean Clarence Thomas will ever be remembered because of the last minute accusations of Anita Hill\nYet it it it's very discouraging although I have to say I I Do get some on it you know someone who clerked for Justice Thomas and knows the why he he you know there's certain ... ... people who are going to just simply use that as their excuse is counted the name of this kind of them because they disagree with them anyway [noise]\nUm and he is someone who does ... incredible amount of perspective on that that\nJudge Kavanaugh is a kind of person where even when he was on the DC circuit as a lower court judge the Supreme Court said it saw him as someone to really take seriously you know more than a dozen times they fought to fourteen different times they found out they vindicated his opinion they had a huge amount of respect for him\nI don't think that's going to change I think um they are not going to be watching this with the same knee jerk or part is in response is I Hope that that that we're seeing some some of these people a\nHat but I but I think you're right on the parents to do on a reputation now\nIf you read James ... New York times piece that he came out with the ... it to me it's absolutely stunning\nAnd the things that he's saying because the FBI's back in the middle of it when we handled the Hillary Clinton email investigation while he was writing an exoneration himself prior to the real investigation which didn't happen until three days before he publicly exonerated her um\nBut then he goes on to trash the president at length and then he talks about FBI agents are experts which they are and interviewing people and quickly dispatching leads to their colleagues around the world to follow up with additional interviews\nAnd they will confront people with testimony and other towns and you know yes the alleged incident occurred thirty six years ago but that would be I ages no time has little to do with memory um which I found a little strange\nAnd then you know for example everybody remembers if it rained on their wedding day\nUh I don't think that's a political in that particular sense maybe to somebody who is traumatized by could see that but for somebody that's not traumatized maybe not um once they start interviewing every witness knows the consequences he says\nIs one thing to have your lawyers submitted statement on your habits are very different thing to sit across from two FBI special agents and answer their relentless questions\nOf course the bureau won't have subpoena power only the ability to knock on doors and ask questions most people will speak to them then there's what he says refusal to do so\nIs its own kind of statement now I Want to just address that because my FBI friends my friends in the in the bureau special agents have all said to me never ever talk to the FBI unless you have a lawyer ever and I'm like why am somebody who loves the FBI\nI don't love the upper brass under Khomeini and the cave and struck and page but the FBI is is ... ... people I Know the fault of the earth people and I said I'd course I'd want to help him he goes no\nAnd then they say look what happened to General Flynn General Flynn is accused of lying to the FBI and the up here I didn't think he was lying to them\nAnd you just it's dumb to ever talk to any law enforcement without a lawyer that's what all my law enforcement people friends say\nBecause it's a crime if you lie to the FBI let's say you said something in the Senate Judiciary investigation and it doesn't exactly match up you could be charged with a crime of lying to the FBI it's ridiculous\nAnd you know the irony that says hey look he he told me coming ammo right now is just to try to destroy Trump with everything he can and it's just another another section in that play book but\nThe irony is the exact same federal law provision\nThat says it's a crime to to lie the FBI is the one that says it's a crime to lie to the Senate as their ... with their investigators it's not just you know a similar penalty it's exactly the same statutory violation so that's just not they've been kind of pretending there's that that I guess playing a little bit on people's images maybe from the movies\nOf what the FBI guys to say that this is somehow it's going to be a separate different thing what they're really doing here is there going down the same list to people the Senate Judiciary committee has already talks to\nThey're getting the same statement in some cases they might get exactly the same thing 'cause the FBI ... and ... as well make that can't force them to talk to them\nEspecially if all you know as\nI don't remember that I wasn't there they they couldn't be dealing with taking the same\nExact statement from the same lawyers for the same the same individuals that that's ... that that is all we can no ... just because the nature of this old investigation so the FBI isn't going to find anything new to hear that there there's my prediction\nTurned it around the IRA and that they don't have any other thing\nThey've already moved on I guess the ... and and that's the one that came out in the New Yorker piece and you know ... that's the one we're even the New York times that said they attempted\nTo interview over the course of a week several dozen people they couldn't find a link to one to corroborate a story and then saying the mist Ramirez\nContacted former yo classmates asking them if they recalled the incident and told some of them that she could not be certain Mr cab and all was the one who exposed themselves which at that point tells me you know what do they investigating here if she's asking other if she's telling other people she doesn't know what are they investigated\nThe more shocking thing is eating right and it's you know right before\nThis whole um ... most recent face exploded I think it was the morning on of the vote she actually
