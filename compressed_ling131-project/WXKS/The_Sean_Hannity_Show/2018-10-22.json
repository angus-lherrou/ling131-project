reporting that ... apple watch recorded the interrogation torturing killing well I Would assume that watch exist in this happened and what we believe that he might have been taken out and in body pieces not sure that they wouldn't take the watch at that point but\nBefore leaving Riyadh aid Pompeo told reporters that the Saudi leaders made no exception on who they would hold accountable\nAnyway so now according to the British newspapers are saying circus of fish or Turkish officials have a recording of blah blah blah and that that in fact happened on the apple watch and you have some of the other people saying it's highly unlikely that show that you could have broadcast a signal from his apple watches it was too far for Bluetooth connection\nYou know I think what's happened clearly as the Turks and the Saudi constantly had the Saturday counselor wired they have transmitters and the Turks don't trust any diplomats that have been into most of the embassies most consulates in Turkey and they listen to what's\nGoing on and\nWe'll find out in this case um my take\nI think it probably all happen but I don't think we should\nRush to judgment because the truth is going to come out probably sooner rather than later joining us now Dr Sebastian\nGorka former White House advisers brand new book is phenomenal by the way why we fight defending the feeding rather not defending the

assassinating murdering this guy in a a barbaric way that's what I'm thinking\nYou know the ruin in warfare or report from the battlefield must be questioned uh I think this man is that whether or not these audio tapes exist is another question but it's absolutely certain\nThat this individual was caught between two nations that wants to dominate the Sunni Muslim world that's\nThe new up to them and add the wand regime of turkey and the birth place of Islam Saudi Arabia and this man was cork in the middle\nHowever however this isn't the fake news we've got to be accurate this man was a journalist wasn't an American so well that trying to spin\nIt was a foreign national read them and it was a common pay he wrote commentary and he has a long decades long history of ... the Muslim

been a while my uh my friend Dan is good to have you back I Know this has been your life and your business for so many years\nUm my gut is pretty clear on this uh I think this man was murdered and the most evil Ruth brutal way possible\nAnd I think that the president is wise knowing that we're going to get to the truth now there's no doubt we'll go and we're going to have the truth rushing to that point is not smart in my opinion\nI I agree with you uh look there's a lot of evidence that we have already we nailed it Fifteen Saudi\nTraveled on the Gulf Stream Arafat arrived if it costs to lift the day the show he entered and we know eat fish again never exited the costs let's\nUh we do the makeup of those of the Fifteen Saudis for them apparently part of ... one of them the forensic doctor you referred to as listening to music well allegedly this numbering\n... body after he was killed\nOr what we don't know what were the orders that were given for these Fifteen Saudi and who gave them the orders and then to prove that they report posts Puerto those are all questions we need to answer\nThat President I think was a hundred percent right to just fashion secretary state they gather the fact emphasize that they were issue of greatest concern to us\nWe'll get that fact with accuracy and a lack of the that's what matters I Will remind the listeners that when Sergei Filin power was poisoned back in March\nHome secretary said they needed to avoid speculation while we allow the police to carry on their investigation I think that's what's going on here and the last thing I Would just highlight is that well\nSecretary if I'm paying with needing and doing its public diplomacy I'm quite sure what the the FBI legal at Shea in Riyadh and the other in a central or an uncle or probably meeting with their Turkish and Saudi counterparts to collect the evidence but it to be a part of reviewing it shot\nYou know it's the I Wish everything could fit in nicely neatly into a box assuming that I Believe that the Saudis are involved and whether it goes straight to the top I don't know the crown prince is denying it I'm kind of having a hard time buying that myself but\nKnowing that there are very different country but\nNow it gets complicated because also the Saudis the Egyptians Jordanians the Israelis the United states the Emirates they're all fighting against the Iranian had you had many in the region\nAnd their quest for nuclear weapons and the instability that would cause the entire world um I Know everybody Dr Gorka would like to say that okay we're cutting off all ties with Saudi Arabia were done where this was that\nUm I think this will be consequences severe consequences the president said\nBut it gets a little rough or what do you do if you're also trying to

the enemy of the good\nGeopolitics is like on a fix itself domestically it is the the out of the ... the uh over the perfect on on the truth is we have a lot of leverage over Saudi Arabia or at the beginning of the Trump Administration we established very very\nGood ties through a and B as to vomit been found them in a without those relationships are not going to be tested\nBut this is a nation that revival depends upon our support militarily and I'm settled in training so there's a lot but reachable average against Saudi Arabia but you're absolutely right this is part of a\n...

goals and dreams in this great nation that's the part that upsets me the most when you see this kind of thing happen and the and the possible political implications and motivations behind these think\nThat's what bothers me the most and I think it is\nCommon sense Americans say look this is not how it's supposed to work you want to come to this country and you're a legitimate asylum seeker that's one thing but when eighty percent of the people who show up at our border claiming assign um aren't legitimate or asylum seekers that's a problem and we know that's probably what this this group is is mostly about as well\nWe also have this issue of the mob that no Democrat seems willing to come from either I mean you know we saw what we watched Ted Cruz and his wife get out of a

that near left\nThis isn't new to this is the way liberals and and and people who believe in their positions and their ideas and their their policy that's the way it's supposed to be but what is happening now is so dangerous for this country and so\nSo wrong and just let me ask you this when this great nation off or\nHow does the president and this would be my goal the president obviously is going to pull back aid to some of these countries that are allowing this this caravan to move forward\nUm nobody wants to anyone to get her to the at the border these you know I Would assume the vast majority are innocent people but you know we're getting we're we don't know anybody I mean you could have people that are mixed in with the crowd that want to bring harm to our country but I Would assume most people come here because they want a better life\nIf they're hell bent on disobeying our laws and our sovereignty and the president then has to protect our borders how do we do it in the way that is safest for the people that are there because I don't want to see people getting hurt at the border you don't see people the president does want to see that\nBut on the other hand I Can't you can't allow them to come in either\nI write and this is why we've had legislation that's been introduced the Democrats won support it because I think deep down they want the politics of this you

has a chance of flipping and as Perry has said he knows the people the fourth district I grew up with them so when the district was we redrawing it was heartbreaking that the hand you're dealt\nAnd ah

you know a twenty five you're going to say twenty five hundred dollars keep your plan keep your doctor all that stuff all lives right\nAnd now they're blaming us for messing it up um we try to repeal

Anthony Scaramucci is with us I just finished cover to cover is bad brand new book uh and it's phenomenal and it's the Inside Story about Donald Trump it's called Trump the blue collar president\nAnd held billionaire living on Fifth Avenue identified the struggle of blue collar Americans had won the presidency and all those are the forgotten men and the forgotten women in this country and I don't think they're liking this mob mentality I don't think they like the way judge Kavanaugh was treated much\nAnd I don't think they like watching this caravan of thousands marching towards our border\nI mean they they literally are mishandling everything and so what's what's happening is uh the the president has almost like this light showing like you know you and I were out on Long Island in the summer or parents would hang up that insect light\nWell the president has that the Trump Twitter insect light and they're all going towards the late in the rape arising\nOr orange she's got to get a DNA test she's less of a Native American and your mate\nInto the vapors ... big caravan issue the way they're handling the care of an issue if the galvanizing his base that Kavanaugh's thing was absolutely ridiculous they were making up one story after the next they figured okay me too movement seems to work there is no due process and the meat you will Smith\nLet's take this guy that did very well credentialed judge\nOr he's got an impeccable adult life let's try to destroy him\nGoing back to Nineteen eighty one and Nineteen eighty two and so again right into the Trump Twitter insect vaporized or so so for me I'm enjoying this the polls are tightening of and the president's base is actually going to turn out in much higher percentages and people predicted and so\nOnce again he's going to defy logic here I think we are very good chance to possibly ah keep the house we're certainly going to gain seats in the Senate and it couldn't happen without the energy and the for tutors for a President Trump\nWell if they do it when I'll say this he's carrying a lot of these people on his back but you know what if you like Nancy Pelosi the dangers are what we're going to have endless investigation higher taxes keep Obamacare open borders\nNow the president is is battling back on all these ... in Guatemala Honduras El Salvador he says there we're not we're not able to do the job of stopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to the U.S\nNow we will begin cutting off substantially reducing the massive foreign aid we routinely give them and Trump tweeted out every time you see a caravan of people illegally coming are attempting to come into our country illegally\nThinking blamed the Democrats\nWere not giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws\nRemember the midterms it's so unfair to those who come in legally and he's right um well and and we don't know anything about the people that are coming here we don't know when when one thing about them and I know the media can be sympathetic because they want but you know who might mix in with the people that maybe just want a job is a big problem for us\nBut but it's but you but here's the other thing okay the American people intuitively notion that he or she says all it is is he he's recognizing with the legendary Milton Friedman one set about any country\nIf you have a welfare state in the United states does have one you need to protect your Puerto Rico's free market forces dictate that people will cross over that border\nTo participate in your welfare state and so\nEvery country has a strong border and so should the United states so I don't get\nA you know I'm I'm I'm I'm promoting my my uh my book that today in the last couple of days mom a lot a left leaning shows and they go they go nuts so crazy on the president's response all\nYou want to illegal immigration you have democratic and Republican presidents and democratic elected officials that of voters it was I don't understand why just enforcing those laws\nHave everybody saw such Sean ... will cut their answer possible\nWhy don't they well it's a lot of things are we better off economically than we were two years ago\nBy every single objective measure the answer is yes the growth of the economy consumer confidence jobs created the number of people leaving food stamps or out of poverty eight million Americans so you know by every measure and more\nBottom the bottom ... percent of the society showing the wages of five and a half percent\nAccording to the wall Street Journal over the last Eighteen months but as a direct result of the president's policies but also the fact that he cut the slack at the border and so he made it tightened up the labor supply and it's giving the lower middle class families shot now have real living wages\nWell that's the story that you actually tell in the book by the way Anthony Scaramucci is with us author of the brand new book it's out today we put it up on Hannity dot com it's on Amazon dot com and bookstores everywhere it's called Trump the blue collar president I first heard that term from one of his sons of his either Erica Don I don't remember those Donnie\n... get on each call them the blue collar billionaire yeah and I said ... Don if you don't mind going to hijack the nickname and just switch out billionaire and put in President he's at the end of the day he resonates with these people for a reason\nYeah look I I I think it is and you talk a lot about his background you you talk a little bit about your family background it's similar to my background and and it's amazing because the only thing that I really care about what motivates me it's not politics itself it's not a game to me\nBecause the policies that we have in a country as we do now greatly impact whether or not people are on food stamps or whether or not there are jobs we now in two years\nHave us a scenario that has not unfolded in this country since Nineteen sixty nine and that is we have a million more jobs than we have people on unemployment you know that I identify with that that's what you identify with you you did not have any that are in your mouth\nAnd you know I saw it as a dishwasher at twelve and and look where you started I you know\nSean Sean listen I mean I think that's the message and I think that's the reason why you're so clearly popular at the end of the gay America is about aspiration in America is about passing the ... the the baton to a next generation of Americans that\nCan do better than ourselves and that's what our grandparents did for our parents and our parents did for you and I and and the cat that the right policy shift of white free market based motivating market incentive policies\nBecause what we both know is that you cannot system the ties or through a political system created equal outcomes should never happens black markets crop up and then there's a thin layer at the tippy top that are living better than everybody else and everyone else has devastated whether it's Cuba or Venezuela place like that\nYou know the real danger so I don't know how this is all going to play out but we we see all weekend long these mobs you know really making ... an unsafe environment for anybody to even go get a bite to eat if you're a public figure which was really sad I mean when you're doing it in front of people's wives\nIt's not only sad it's pathetic when you're going after Pam Bondi Sarah Sanders and our kids and\nSecretary Nielsen and all she do all they're doing is trying to sit in a restaurant and have something to eat telling you know one group of Americans they're not wanted here in any way what are you doing here get out of this you know they're going after an a Ninety year old guy Henry Kissinger now who served his country with honor and distinction\nIs that it seems like there's no limits here but there's no moderation left either mulch and the Democratic party it used to be I I used to think Democrats at least they on paper they said they cared about the American working men and women but apparently they don't\nHave to losing the argument then you have to suppress the other side's argument in other words if you're wrong on the facts and your ideology is going to create\nUnequal outcome so you know bad society uh even though it sounds great on paper all of your ideas when they meet contact with reality or\nDisaster for a country a person a citizen then you've got to suppress the voices of the other people\nIt's happened to me it's happened to me on a college campuses it's happened to me I'm Around the country when I'm traveling I'm cool with it I'm up for the fight of it are both the you know when you know what's great about the people just want you to think about Ninety five percent\nOf these professors Sean or liberal but about forty five to fifty percent of the kids are conservative so they're not buying into the Malone\nAll right stay right there by the way the books phenomenal I read it cover to cover Anthony\nScaramucci is whether Trump the blue collar president\nUh you know it's interesting you look at the jobs created who's benefitting when we create manufacturing jobs in factory jobs\nAre and we bring an industry back to America and we incentivize businesses to invest here well that's the forgotten men and women the Thirteen million under Obama\nThe additional Thirteen million that were on food stamps and after eight years of his presidency and the eight million more Americans that were in poverty after eight years of his presidency well now we have for a million new jobs and eight million fewer people in poverty and on food stamps and so dramatic turn around\nAnd they're back happily working and some are getting career jobs and opportunities that we were told was never coming back\nAnd listen we're all big supporters here on the Sean Hannity showed the second amendment also responsible gun owners that's why we're friends with the USCC a they're giving away free gun every day twenty four days\nNow you'll

also watching and Arizona this caravan\nAre headed right towards our southern border it's become well a big big issue\nWe have a couple of things that have literally taking the people of Arizona back\nFirst instead of a once calling Arizona the meth lab of democracy and the people of Arizona crazy a inviting Arizona State university the radical attorney for the blind shake yeah that blind shake involved in the what the bombings that America\nUm she had no problem with Americans joining the Taliban\nMartha McSally confronted her in the recent debate will you apologize you would not apologize and accusing troops to torture and that's only part of it and then on top of that we have the latest development cinema once attacked be asked to stay at home moms for ... off their husbands\nThese women who lack like staying at home ... their husbands or boyfriends and just catching the checks to some sort of feminism because they're choosing to live that life is fairly judgmental you would think\nMartha ... with us ah Martha how are you\nHey John I'm doing great thanks for having me on\nWell I think I'm happy with the last two polls want to do it by seven want to do it by two ah but ah I frankly after these latest revelations in the last two weeks about Christ and send them I Would imagine that your polls are going to go higher\nShon well it it's unbelievable every single day a new part of her radical passed and her mocking Arizona and their extremism on so many issues is being on earth\nBut the Arizona local media is protecting her a and making excuses for her and so the only way that filters down his shows like yours are us turning it into a TV ad\nUh the fact that she's still hanging in there is really ridiculous so out of step with Arizona values and American values you rattled off a number of uh a number of things that would have a Senate candidate B. disqualifying in the past\nBut here we are way down to the wire over eighty percent or around eighty percent of people will vote early over half have already voted and so we need to make sure that the messages out about her radical out of step past\nThis qualifying statement you know compared to me serving twenty six years in the military and defending our freedoms and our way of life\nWhat did you do in the military I Know well you served abroad post nine eleven correct\nYes sir I was a a ten pilot I was just fortunate to be the first woman in us history to fly a fighter jet in combat\nUh and then the first to command a fighter squadron in combat I've had six deployments to the middle east and Afghanistan a hundred and twenty five combat hours in a tan ward hog again saving American lives on the ground and defending our way of life it was absolutely honor of my life to be able to serve\nYou know when you hear curse than send them to say oh it's okay at that point what I Believe it was two thousand and three that oh it's okay if Americans want to join our enemies the ... nearly died\nA son when I when we heard this I I couldn't believe it I mean I was deployed on nine eleven or the Taliban harbored al ... who came and killed three thousand Americans sense then with them and their affiliates they've killed thousands of American troops to include you know truthful I was deployed over there\nI've told this story before but we would at Bagram Air force base when I was a commander\nOr we would you know we would get out there as soon as we heard a firefight was going on and we'd be overhead to protect them and are eight ten but oftentimes ah you know the ... the the firefighters happened before we could get there and Americans lost their lives\nAnd as we would we would line up on a taxi way as the cat the flag draped casket would come through and there was ... it was a silence there and everyone is saluting giving our final salute to these American heroes\nWho perished over there fighting the Taliban and their affiliates", "show_name": "The
