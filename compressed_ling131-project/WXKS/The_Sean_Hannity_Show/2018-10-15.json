Turkish authorities suspect ... met his and\nTerm elections I think the cabin on hearing says awoken people to just how vicious the Democratic party can be\nYeah I'll listen to the old tactics to the past with the Republican Party mature intimately familiar with where\nDemocrats lobby political grenade right onto the field usually some kind of a you go through the list every night or on your Fox or you know a racist besides you this you know the the phobic ... kind of stuff these identity politics grenades and Republicans would scatter\nWell they tried a new one with cabinet all they try to really disgusting one this rapist line which is one of the most important things I've ever seen in politics and for the first time shot in a long time we had a president\nWhite House who said we're not going to back down and cabinet we're not going to let you back to how we're going to back\nYou up and we won one and that when I Believe is really just and this is not a scientific sample I don't want to oversell it but based on me just driving around in my town which is a fifty fifty Republican Democrat county Martin County Florida\nRepublicans could not be more ecstatic that we finally have a warrior and a fighter in the White House who is not going to leave the battlefield when that identity politics or discussing label or comes in from the Democratic party and I think it's really a spice up the Republican base and I think we may have a we may have a a a decent the election day\nWell I'm not sure I Can't read the tea leaves um I think it all comes down in these midterm elections always comes down to turn out and people are motivated to like the Rasmussen poll says\nUh than it would happen I'm looking at the numbers that Republicans are more mad about the cabinet controversy that Democrats are in a more determined to vote and the upcoming elections this is a dramatic twenty five points shift in just the last six weeks Greg Jarrett so that would give hope to me\nAnd hopefully the American people that somehow the Republicans can bucked the trend in and maintain power in the house and maybe pick up some Senate seats which I think are a distinct possibility\nWell I think you're right the only question is with twenty seven days remaining or does this trend that Republicans are motivated in energized devote\nHave legs will it last over the course of the next four weeks [noise]\nUm and you know we just don't know that but you're right the polling data does show that and I you know I think that there is a general anger among both men and women across America that this was a process\nOf the confirmation hearing that was a massive amount of fairness and the presumption of innocence and due process and that absent some corroborating evidence from a thirty six year old claim\nYou really can't ruin somebody's career and their lives and you know the reputation or ... that they built up and the goodwill and their families reputation\nSure I mean I Do think that there is a feeling across America that a lot of this is unfair now there are liberals and the media which is redundant\nUh who are show rabbit that they don't care about furnace today just care about their own political agenda however misplaced in wrong it may be\nAnd so you're never going to change their minds there is no reasoning with on reasonable people so we'll just have to wait and see it's up to the Republican Party I think and and the candidates and indeed President Trump to maintain that momentum going forward over the next twenty seven days\nLook the hell out of great article today about what their agenda is and they the Democrats have big plans none of which will help the country or they want to shore up Obamacare which has been nothing short of a disaster for the American people\nThey want more Dodd Frank financial rules to protect quote dreamers and the integrity of elections in other words they want massive amnesty they want to aggressively probe any single thing they can they want this country locked down into endless investigation\nAnd likely the impeachment of Donald Trump they you know Republicans celebrate the passage of the biggest tax cutting history they refer to as crumbs\nAnd they're saying it's time to take the crumbs back I guess the crumbs or the most delicious part of the meal um so all of this is in jeopardy dam bond you know I don't see a waning in people's enthusiasm now I think they have they went so far in the cabin okay some frankly in the last two years what we have witnessed split the\nAnd you chronicled lives in your new book\nYou know the the attempt to sabotage of the president I think they see the fundamental unfairness and nothing they stand for is going to help the average American to have a better life\nRight and so on the media and Greg just nailed it by the way that you know the media and the Democrats ... ... it's it's it's symbiotic I mean it it's a host\nAt a at a parasite at this point they're the same thing\nThey have ... end up this rage or not all of them but many of 'em against Donald Trump to such an intense for me think about the things showing that have come out I mean new lows in politics\nDonald Trump's Supreme Court nominee called a rape is Donald Trump called the treat treat guilty of treason a crime literally punishable by death that's not hyperbolic\nHe'd been he's been called trees as they ginned up the base so much on that here's the problem the Democrats have created for themselves in the election\nThat in order to seem like the more anti Trump candidate to get that money in those volunteers for your twenty twenty presidential campaign or to get that money in the midterms what do you have to do you have to oppose the trader you have to oppose that train rapist or whatever sick name they call the capital\nSo that that's what's leading to this a psycho pathology on the left\nAnd I agree I I don't see this waning and I do see Republican voters saying listen when is enough enough you attack this this this American patriot and cabinet or you try to take down the Trump Administration weaponize and the government when is enough enough and I think they're going to show up I Hope I pray they do\nWell what do you think about Hillary's endorsement of ah the incitement of getting in people's face and you can't be civil suit basically calling for instability you you can't really civil with the political party\nThat wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about and then the other comments made by people like Maxine Waters and others getting their Hayes\nHim into a grocery store is following the gas stations confront them chase them out of restaurants which we have seen going on and on a on a regular basis\nFor Republicans it is absolutely wonderful you know they ought to send an early Christmas gift to Hillary Clinton Michael ... Maxine Waters Jerry Adler Nancy Pelosi many of those individuals are calling for\nA the investigation and teach men to Brett Kavanaugh which Americans realize you is wrong and preposterous I could have certainly explain how in a legal basis\nImpeachment is not possible uh for Brett Kavanaugh but the more that these toxic individuals and all of the ones I mentioned\nEspecially Hillary Clinton are toxic uh the more that only drives Republican voters to the polls to make sure that these people are not ah in positions of power and will not be able to a ruined the accomplishments\nOf Donald Trump which have been incredible you know in the course of two years he's accomplished more than\n... Obama did in eight years the greatest level of American economic growth and prosperity in modern American history and that is not just made up there I mean the statistics demonstrate that and so if Americans want to\nMaintain that prosperity 'em and add you know money to their wallets into private ah from government officials who loved to squander hard earned money from American taxpayers are their choices easy\nWhile I did like Kevin McCarthy introduce which has a bill to fully fund the Trump border wall\nA the president has already spent about what three three and a half billion dollars he needs about twenty three billion dollars more to get the job done and I think that is certainly one of the big issues that Americans would be motivated to go out and vote for and the other I think\nYou know the president rightly said he could make as many as four and more Supreme Court appointments that is a massive issue at this point is it's a tipping point for the courts you know if you think of the age in the health of some of the justices that there is no doubt there will be vacancies in the in years to come in the\nFuture yeah and don't forget showing that the circuits and the district court the Supreme Court gets all of the attention you know it's the sexy story the highest court in the land quite obviously but his grade can tell you most of these cases that are over ... importance to American businesses American individuals' moms\nWhat you can do for your country\nI found out that her son but we're\nAmerica will do\nWhat what do we can now\nFor the freedom of mad [noise]\nGetting fire the museum at the John F.

five ... actually a warrant just like a search warrant\nIn order to get five or a search warrant you need an affidavit signed by a career federal law enforcement officer who swears the information the affidavit is true and correct to the best of his knowledge and beliefs\nAnd that's the way we operate and if that's wrong sometimes it is if you find out as an incorrect in there that person is going to face consequences\nAnd if you find that anything's wrong in the air that person is going to face consequences you got to fix your signature to this you know it was signed up as David they get a ... a warrant signed by a career law enforcement person\nSwearing that what you are presenting to the court is true and that you know what to be true and affirmed it to be true well\nThat didn't work out with the third renewal by the application in the case of Carter Page a which is the fourth buys a warrant issued but the fourth one that was signed was signed by Rod Rosenstein\nAnd we all know that the bulk of information that was put in the ... and ...\nWell that was based on the bone eight Clinton bought and paid for dot CA that not even Christopher Steele stands by to this day and that was never verified never corroborated and has turned out to be mostly debunked\nWhich is among the many other complex that Rod Rosenstein has of course he's the one that recommended firing Jim call me he's the one that signed the visor Warren she's the one that appointed Mueller\nAnd now he was scheduled to appear tomorrow under old and a two sources now telling Fox News at this hour\nThat Rod Rosenstein scheduled appearance before the house Judiciary Committee is at an impasse\nOver the terms of the testimony\nAnd he doesn't want to have a transcribed interview under oath which is the standard for congressional task force interviews\nAnd those closed the Rosenstein say well he prefers a meeting or briefing with the house Judiciary Committee chairman and other lawmakers where there's no paper trail where there's no under oath part well the question is why would he be afraid to go under oath\nWell here to weigh in on this and much more\nUh as as impasse continues Mark Meadows he is the Freedom Caucus chairman and congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio also of Freedom Caucus member a and by the way would be in this House Judiciary committee\nAll interview of Rod Rosenstein um we also have learned in the last three days Mark Meadows so start with you that we now know that Lisa Page\nMcCabe the deputy FBI directors under criminal investigation leaves a page who is out at the FBI James Baker the top attorney at the FBI they all are telling the same story that Rod Rosenstein said that he wanted to surreptitiously record the president of the United states\nIn the hopes of being able to get him to say something that would allow them to invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment so we there's a lot of questions were Rod Rosenstein at this moment\nWell there are a lot of questions I think probably the bigger question is why would Rod Rosenstein\nOr not be prepared to come to Congress tomorrow to clear his name and I think the reason for that is there there are credible witness is you know your lead in had Rod Rosenstein voice saying well you know the needs to be facts and we have the rule of law well we're willing to to consider him innocent until proven guilty\nHim not coming tomorrow indicates a that there is real credibility with these witnesses that suggested that he not only wanted to take the president but he wanted to use those tapes a to effectively have a de OJ to on the president of the United states\nWell he met with the president apparently earlier this week and blue on air force one does anyone know what the result of that meeting was\nWell I think it gets thing is uh Shaun is is a let's don't read too much into a flight on air force one and I think it's the president trying to be reasonable and hear rod side of the story I think the president has been extremely measured\nBut the fact that there are no wires means everything you don't have to build out walls build them back you don't have to run the wires along

going into my life have you tried any way\nIt goes on from there I mean it was it is just the typical thing that you'd expect um are we got a lot on the program we got this election and we're going to talk about it in detail we have the riots over the weekend in New York City and in Portland and it's getting ugly\nAnd I don't think it should surprise anybody in light of the rhetoric that we've been hearing about getting people's faces and creative crowd and when you create a crowd followed them into the department stores and restaurants and gas stations\nWhat do you think is going to happen when those types of things are set\nAnd I'm not look at the end of the day people responsible for their own behavior but when you're when you see this was going to look back here and Rand Paul's right and I'm right somebody's going to get severely hurt or killed and all of this\nAnd we'll get a look at the signs and symptoms were all there and we'll think about Pam Bondi and what happened to her secretary Nielsen and what happened to her and we'll think about oh other things like uh oh Sarah Sanders in our family and Ted Cruz and his wife and Mitch McConnell and his wife\nI mean at some point someplace somewhere something's gonna happen if you didn't see it this weekend I mean you had a demonstration billed as a march for law and order in the streets of\nPortland descending into chaos as you have rival political factions now breaking into a bloody brawls downtown Portland on Saturday Night yet members of some group called the Patriot prayer I've never heard of them and\nTheir their black clad adversaries known as antifa using bear spray ... tons thrashing each other outside what's known as Kelly's Olympia that's a popular bar in southwest Washington street\nThat may lay which lasted you know fairly long period of time riot cops rushed in firing pepper ... sprays at the street fighters Portland police bureau reported seeing the protests\nAnd counter protests participants outfitted and with hard a narco gloves knives firearms earlier in the evening wanting to do something about it\nWell he said to make one arrest Saturday Night not one but they're investigating this scene is unfolding amid tensions among both groups are fueled by impart uh some national news stories you had the marching in Portland against the police were brutality last week drew headlines after law enforcement's\nYou know they had a hands off approach to the event was blamed for an encounter between protesters and an elderly driver which was caught on tape that outrage many including\nUs some leader of this group out there patriot prayer anyway a viral video surfaced showing in New York City members of the group which I also never heard of Proud Boys some type of male chauvinist\nOrganization a beating two or three protesters in New York City after an event at a Republican headquarters\nSo what do you have is you know I Know the media has been reporting that there were a group of white supremacist I don't I don't know anything about them\nBut there was a a hate rally at Republican headquarters in New York City anyway where you know the way the media is portraying it I just have no idea 'cause I don't have it but of courting to the Daily Caller and people members actually vandalized the metropolitan Republican club in New York I had a an appearance of\nThis group Proud Boys prompting an outbreak of violence they're fascinating that ... Andrew Cuomo the governor up for re election in New York is not going to have any trouble my opinion sadly he's blaming it on Donald Trump he blamed the president after antifa attacked the Republican headquarters in New York City\nUm the Southern Poverty Law Center has a history of of smearing Republican organizations as white supremacists neo Nazis they labeled this group I hate group what did they call an ...\nYou know better if you go back in twenty sixteen the same so called watchdog group put housing and urban development secretary Ben Carson on its extremist watch list Ben Carson\nBecause he supports traditional marriage um anyway Sarah quarter reported that the night before the leader I guess it's Gavin McGinnis as the head of this thing and ... had\nThreatened to attack his group leaving a note that read our attack is merely a beginnings romantic ... we're not pass it we're not civil we won't apologize\nThose have good conscience at a clear mind though the state of oppression cannot remain the U.

Romo\nGlenn Simpson is unreal legal jeopardy in all of this he also confirmed that the FBI has evidence that directly refused the premise of trust a Trump Russia probe in other words that there's been and remains exculpatory evidence\nThere was a great piece by Jonathan Turley ... three reasons mother may not charge Trump with obstruction apparently not asking any questions about it but\nSticking exclusively to whether or not there was any type of collusion which we all know the answer to a you have one top Republican lawmaker now saying the FBI failed to provide a\nFederal surveillance court with important evidence well we don't that now for a long time and we know that\nFor Pfizer court judges\nOr handed information that was supposed to be verified and corroborated ended up being Hillary Clinton's bought and paid for Russian lies that was put together by fusion GPS interestingly funneled money through Perkins Coolio law from the hiring of Christ is Christopher Steele a foreign national he doesn't even stand by the information and the ...\nAnd it was the bulk of information to get for Pfizer warrants\nAgainst the Trump campaign associate and the lead up to the twenty sixteen race\nAll this comes down to some simple basic fundamental things and they never told the Pfizer judges that it was Hillary Clinton they paid for this information and it's unbelievable that this could be happening in this country but it looks like we are finally beginning to get to the bottom of it at least I Hope so\nJason shape it's is with us former congressman now on Fox News contributor author of the New York times best seller the deep state we have Victoria Toensing and Joe diGenova of the gentleman ... with us ah thank you both for being here let's start with Jason shape it's because this is your will house\nAnd it seems to me that it doesn't matter what Congress request\nAs they seek to do their job of oversight they're never going to get the information from the department of justice and they're not going to get the people they need to talk in front of them under oath\nWell the hard part about when you issue a subpoena when I was the chairman of the oversight commission or committee I can issue a subpoena but the only way to on for that is through the department of justice and so the weight of the paper really isn't worth much because the DEA Jay won't enforce its own subpoena the subpoena issued by Congress\nThat the name that people need to also familiarize themselves with is marked Elias market why it was ...\nHe was ... for the DNC he was careful for Hillary Clinton he was counsel for a ... group he was involved there\nThis this guy sits in the middle of a lot of these transactions in the movement of money and I think more and more you'll start to see his name along with you know or and Simpson and all these others\nWell I think the fact that ... Simpson is now saying Victoria that\nGoing to plead the fifth and it can get away with that and make them come in and plead the fifth you know the idea that they can just threatened to plead the fifth and not have to actually go through with it I think is important\nThey should make him show up and in front of the TV cameras plead the fifth it's ridiculous to accept a letter from the lawyers and I hope they send you are talking to your former friends and telling them to get them or get in to the Congress to take this it and\nI don't care if they're not ...\nI'm In ... because I think there are other ways to to figure out how to do it you've got a subpoena you subpoenaed first and then you negotiate later you don't\nSay oh mine he didn't show up talking trying to work it out now you have to think about CNN said Pina and then you say you can't make it Wednesday then you make it Thursday that I Can't believe there's no ...\nWell I mean I'm trying to understand I mean the president said that there would be de classification and all the materials the Jim Jordan was just talking about would be an redacted and we'd have a chance to see the ... the gang of eight information that three oh two between\nA Bruce or and Christopher Steele and how they wanted a funnel that information straight into Robert Mueller's office uh Joe diGenova but you know the idea of why do I think even with you and Victoria's my attorneys\nThat I wouldn't get away with just saying I'm going to plead the fifth leave me alone now or or not handing over subpoenaed materials to Congress\nWell I don't think there's any question that Congress has dropped the ball on of course it gets so subpoenas but let me just say this 'cause this is really important all the names that you heard Michael ... Mr liar Simpson\nOr all those people they are ... to everything that was done in the United states\nWhat's fascinating is what happened in the United kingdom between the Congress as an issue any subpoenas court we now know that the FBI or am I stick and that you do a few\nTo conduct electronic surveillance of American citizens on foreign soil without legal authority to do so and that information was fat conversations George ... were intercepted and in the course of their compensation\nThey found out that Papadopoulos was not interested in Hillary email or anything else and they never ... information because by the court\nYou know it seems Congressman Chaffetz that every piece of the puzzle now is falling in place I think we now understand\nWhat the insurance policy was Lisa Page testifying that in the the nine months of the investigation leading up to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller that they had no evidence of Trump Russia collusion at all\nUm and by the way even her lover Peter Struck said the same thing he said well I'd be all end if there was something there there is no there are there\nThen all of a sudden we find the media elites strategy that they discussed this with Andrew McCabe comes in James Baker comes in and other people come in and what we see is again it goes back to the Clinton bought and paid ... that the CIA information has leaked out to the media creating the impression that in fact there was Russia Trump collusion\nBut they did it themselves they took the again it's it's all they were doing the leaking so that they can appoint the special counsel so that in the which one could be ... begin\nI is there any part of the puzzle that isn't clear to you because it's getting very clear to me\nDo it is becoming a crystal clear\nAnd that's why Jim Jordan is exactly right\nThe people that were in that meeting and reverse the timing of this evening this meeting happens directly after a district Colombia's relieved of his duties but just before I'm Mr Mueller is put into place and you have to understand who's in that meeting what was discussed it sounds like Baker as being the most candid about what was going on there\nBut each of the people in that meeting should be brought in for its own their own deposition uh transcribe under oath\nOr before Congress you don't have these five minute little ... you know after you have questions when you do this and I've been in these they go for an hour for the Republican than the Democrats get time than another hour for Republicans if you can really get in depth information if they would do it that way\nVictoria I think that's true and that's right and that's just an that's fair but\nThe obstruction continually I Will take a break we'll come back more with
