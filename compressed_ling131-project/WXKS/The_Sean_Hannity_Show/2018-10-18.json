just a huge advantage and they're all grows out of what is now if you go back to Goldwater of fifty four year movement um but I think it's also coming to a crisis because\nTrump so clearly articulate each a pro American pro work ethic pro patriotism policy that he drives the left crazy\nAnd I think as a result the left which has gotten more extreme they haven't modulated they haven't come back to the center they've decided that their job is to beat up and intimidate those of us who disagree with him and and they and I think that just further isolates from\nSo their agenda is pretty clear they get back the house they wanna teach men they want the crumbs back the largest tax cutting history which is obviously having a big impact on the economy we you know all the record unemployment numbers the varying demographic groups that are doing better than they've ever done\nUm they also want open borders but John Podesta saying don't talk about immigration\nThey want to eliminate ice they want to keep Obamacare\nI'm an endless investigation I Would add to that I don't hear one positive thing that's going to create one job or make this country one bit safer not nothing that they're running on just that and we hate Trump that's it\nWell I think that's right and it's partly because I think if they tried to tell us honestly what they stand for there will be defeated so badly that they just they know that they can't afford to be honest but but I think I mentioned the send your TV show last night I think that we're about to be\nA magic moment\nIn American history and I think the two words that captured in my mind are Kavanaugh and caravan I think Kevin all the way they treated him of the viciousness the smears the character assassination to childish behavior by\nUS Senators in Senate meetings I think all that came together to really re galvanized conservatives and I think this caravan coming up from Guatemala\nShould be a major focus of Republicans for the next couple of weeks because it makes clear\nThe argument about whether or not we have a right to be a sovereign country or whether in the\nFeinstein below sea San Francisco Democrat tradition we have an obligation to open up our border to anybody who can get finance\nAnd remember these three thousand people I I agree with Laura Ingraham is asking the question who's paying for this these three thousand people will probably cost Twenty one million dollars to move\nFrom Guatemala only four thousand people is now grown too amid a spike among a U.S border crossings but you know Nancy Pelosi actually said we are not funding the border wall\nAnd that just is it seems to be an appendage that Donald Trump manhood I mean you know imagine anything similar said about any woman by any Republican or conservative\nI mean it's outrageous the double standard and then so flagrant but\nYou know we're we're already have paid between healthcare education criminal justice we've already paid trillions of dollars for people that didn't respect our laws and sovereign states costs the American people a fortune and by the way the people of California and now we're going to be paying for their health care for free no questions asked\nBy the way we have in Georgia a democratic nominee for governor Stacey Abrams a who are clearly favors allowing illegal immigrants to vote a says that she has one draw any distinction between the people who are American citizens and people who came here illegally\nUm and that's that's sort of typical Gavin Newsom candidate for governor of California\nWho openly says he wants to have government run health care and make it available to every illegal immigrant who can get to California I mean the Democratic party is becoming the party of illegality the party of breaking go all the point you made earlier and a party which\nBelieves that can't win was legal American votes and so it's kind of try to find some way\nTo turn around the system and it's an amazing thing to watch

a year and that got turned over by the Fifth Circuit court of appeals it sounds complicated it really is it is the single biggest abuse of power corruption scandal in the history of the country\nAnd I haven't even mentioned\nThe abuse of the powerful tools of intelligence that we give these people supposedly to protect us joining us now\nA civil liberties attorney criminal defense attorney David shown and Carter Page was banned at the center of all of this for the last year and you know Carter I Know that you're moving forward with investigations lawsuits and I don't blame you one bit I mean\nFrom everything you've told me is that our FBI our CIA our intelligence community knew well because as your work took you to foreign lands when you come back from places like Russia\nOr you would willingly ... feet deep briefed ... and and tell them everything you know to help your country out so uh I guess if you were really the bad guy that needed to be surveilled and they needed to Hillary Clinton's unverified phony Russian ...\nAs the presentation to commit fraud on the rise of course I Would think you'd be indicted right now you were as bad as they say\nChina is just ... it just kept getting crazier and crazier every day I uh I think it just uh just this week we have the Saudis that are um owning up to various things that may have happened there and you know starting investigations\nAbout things that may have happened a couple of days or or he was within the last few weeks\nI mean this is something that is you know people have been covering up here in the United states for over two years so I think as a a you know a symbol of democracy a symbol of\nGood government that hopefully uh hopefully the uh the car just starting to fall here and people will start phoning up to all the uh all the wrong doing that was done and I I think we're getting into that as you've been a\nA all over in terms of your reporting so\nSo I bring David and David as an attorney in a in a really good attorney you know Congress has a constitutional roads called oversight their job they or their check we have a system of separation of powers and checks and balances part of their oversight is when they are investigating the investigators\nThey have been obstructed every step of the way request document requests we have found instance after instance where they cite national security is a reason for not turning something over ... only to be turn out to be having nothing to do with national security only an embarrassment to them now\nWe see in in just the last two weeks oh Rod Rosenstein who gives an extensive interview to the wall Street Journal he doesn't have time to testify under oath lens Simpson has pleading the fifth Nelly or doesn't want to appear and testify under oath James Baker is testifying today and James Baker\nAnd Lisa Page and Andrew McCabe one other person all saying Rod Rosenstein wanted to wear a wire to go after the president of the United states\nOr if you are representing our friend Carter Page here I mean I Would think you'd have a multitude of lawsuits and the Carter page ought to be a pretty rich man by the end of all of us\nYeah quarter page has a strong basis for thinking not only information but also damages and relief and he is now by the way of course conducting somebody's again going after that doesn't Carter Page is very important to St example of how very wrong\nThings have gone both with the ... the court and otherwise and governments you hit the\nProbably the most important thing going on here Congress's role in providing oversight um you know God willing congressmen Munoz is going to return after this election his work and good last worked as a vital Congress can no longer bluff though anymore they've got to compel the testimony of these folks\nI think there's a real argument for a Fifth Amendment waiver from the public statements\nThat these folks make the American public demands transparency\nAnd they deserve nothing less than transparency and by the way these aren't simple in the states that have gone on you know we've talked about this\nNinety nine page report on fire that court a abuses that a director Rogers was talking about um these aren't just mistakes these are conscious efforts and engender by law enforcement officers to invade the law there is by the way one author or as a new that no one really has exploited yet\nAnd that's a fight the quarter review\nThere is a court that just above the five to court there was also under their rule for consider procedural motions there three judges to chief justice appointed right now that said just cabana sent telling talent in different circuits maybe ... maybe that court should be the subject of the uh the ... the foreign promotion trees you what's going on in the\n... the court also just remembering you have in the ... the court efforts\nBy the ... where are these ... court judges a fraud was committed on every one of them they were that run verified uncorroborated information\nTo spy on the guy you're also talking to on this on this line quarter page why haven't we heard from them yet\nYou're right they should do outreach collie or the judge and the fifth corps and these judges other quarter review\nIt violates their own rules rules Thirteen and it violates the constitution and as you pointed out many times the most sensitive area of our government probably because that's the part they application for the most intrusive kind of eavesdropping that there is in the world\nYou know you know there was an article by John Solomon I Want to just read a little bit of it to both of you and carnival salt would do to get your reaction considering you were as of now you appear to be the victim and all of this unless something changes ... Carter Page that I don't know about you are as\nOf now have you with this horrible person that needed to be surveilled\nAnd not just basically a I don't know chink in the armor to get a Trump and then you become\nThe on winning victim in a witch hunt against him but you know because you were light about they use phony information to obtain the warning against you but of all the agencies in the federal\nGovernment Solomon points out that should be immune to special interest schmoozing the the OJ as premier law enforcement agencies like the FBI the DEA the bureau\nOf Alcohol Tobacco firearms and explosives\nTop the list their independence from influence and their integrity and meaning out the law fairly are essential\nTo their success in the trust the American public puts in them but\nThis week the D.

specifics in terms of myself it's really about our country and I think what you see in terms of some of these ah actions that they were doing I'm against the rules and potentially against the law that really reflects you know people just looking out for themselves and you know it's like president\nTrump always said as a candidate a it's not about me it's about us and you know\nWhen they when they
