James O'Keefe is going to join us and a Democrat reticent who's running against Marsha Blackburn who's now began to pull away in the polls a little bit there\nHim and his campaign his campaign staff caught on tape absolutely saying he's lying to the people of tendency\nBut the very purpose of getting elected and they say it not once but they say over and over and over and over again I don't play view later in the program today but I mean it is it is mind numbing that people have zero\nTruth or or ability or character that they can be honest with who they are and what they believe and the problem for Brett us in just like the problem for people like Claire McCaskill or Heidi Heitkamp or Joe Donnelly a or send them all oh where do we get to the tape on cinema today\nOr you know some of these other Democrats that are running Jon Tester\nIs they can't be honest\nWith who they are and be honest with their voters of what they're going to do when they get to Washington if they get to Washington but\nWhen they get there and here's what they're going to do even though they're in red states that overwhelmingly voted for Donald Trump\nThey're going to get to Washington and they're going to vote for Chuck Schumer that's sort of first vote and then they're going to vote with Chuck Schumer Ninety eight percent of the time because that's what Democrats do there is no voice of moderation in the modern Democratic Party\nI got to get one little tip part of the hat to Joe Manchin of West Virginia frankly why he stays a Democrat in this day and age I have no idea\nWhat Republicans also offering\nSolutions and answers and solving problems and the numbers beret out all across the board which is why you know historically in mid term elections people don't like to show up but if you don't show up all of the progress that we've made in the next two years is in jeopardy\nAnd you're gonna get endless investigation possible impeachment they have stated publicly they want their crumbs back they have stated publicly in other words they want to raise taxes\nWell that's that's what created the last eight years of Obama\nWhich put Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps eight million more in poverty and he became the only president in history ever to never reach three percent GDP Growth in a single year and he gave up on manufacturing jobs of post jobs are never coming back\nWell in less than two years Trump brought back more than four hundred thousand of them\nHalf the time he brings it back not only by\nEnding burdensome regulation and asking businesses well what do we what can we do to help facilitate you working here in building here in creating factories manufacturing centers here and tell them well you know it's costing us\nYou know a thousand dollars for this regulation per unit and a thousand dollars per unit for that ... that because of that regulation\nOr the president's wiping those regulations off the books\nAnd then on top of that is created a tax incentive for business to build in America and then when that doesn't work he just gets on the phone and just well humiliate publicly any company that is not building in America\nAnd then on top of that each challenges even allies of ours that have taken advantage of us economically on bad trade deals over the years and he's telling them hey ah you're treating us unfairly this was a one sided deal I'm pulling out\nAnd we now successfully navigated thread the needle negotiated better deals with for example most recently Canada and Mexico have you don't fight for a better deal you're never gonna get a better deal pretty amazing\nI Know everybody's been all hyped up about Kanye being in the White House you know I listen very closely what country was saying and I'm like\nWhy do we think we need some prison reform or give me an example when the president ... commuted the sentence of ballots marine Johnson remembers a woman at a given like a life sentence one of the fence drug a fence\nA grandmother apparently should run in a horrible economic difficulties with like ... there's no new ones sometimes in our criminal justice system and we spent Twenty one twenty two years in jail I had an opportunity to interview or\nI absolutely fell in love with this woman she comes rushing out of prison after President Trump does this for her right into the arms of her loving family I've got to meet her sister and I got to meet somebody a lawyer that was working for her pro bono and helped make this happen\nAnd then she goes to the microphones and she says to America thank you\nThank you for giving me a second chance I'm not going to let you down\nWell I Want to find all the Alice Murray Johnson's imprisoned that or like car with that attitude that deserve a second chance and you know that would that may be a big given heavy sentences for reasons for whatever the reason happens to me I agree with you we can find those people\nYou also talked about safe neighborhoods we need safe neighborhoods I disagree with him on stop and frisk only because the murder rate in New York well I've been here under Rudy Giuliani went from about twenty five hundred a year down to three hundred three or four hundred Bernie Carrick was a big part of the success of that program\nIt just works unfortunately got to go into the neighborhoods where the crimes are being committed with the shots being fired wherever it happens to be and you have a grasp of resources and policing of those areas so every man woman and child can go to sleep at night\nAnd not worry the bullets they're going to be flying through their windows and the next hour it's unbelievable that nothing is ever been done\nAt this point to pick Chicago\nI mean it's it's sad it's unnecessary ... our our human our human family in talent or being literally you know are literally evaporating before a rice\nIt's unbelievable we can do better we ought to do we owe it to people to do better and then he's talking about bringing jobs making things in America and creating jobs in America\nYou know they shouldn't be about conservative liberal Republican Democrat but liberalism fails socialism redistribution has failed and we see it we had eight years of it and width hasn't done a thing\nAnd why as a any African American conservative that speaks out is just beaten up and excoriated on a level that his downright racist and disgusting\nWhy is it matter if somebody happens to be\nAfrican American and a conservative and it happens all the time and somehow in this era of political correctness it's acceptable to say the most disgusting and atrocious and obnoxious vicious vile thing you can\nListen to some of the things said about Kanye\nWest is what happens when they grow don't

I think you just cut through something really important I think we should describe this is the mask came off yeah\nI think it is I I I I think what's interesting I don't know I I definitely feel momentum the polls are showing momentum we now have if we go through all the states is a very tight race how old is up by two out in Arizona Mick Sally believe it or not as now what by six this was before the release of these tapes which I Believe is definitely going to hurt\nIn the case of of course than cinema Marsha Blackburn is up by eight in Tennessee that is such an important race Ted Cruz's rebounded in spite of all the hype of the state or working all the money that prone against Ted Cruz\nIs such an important seat Claire McCaskill is down Heidi Heitkamp is down Joe Donnelly is down and I think tester is vulnerable in Manhattan I think there's a lot of Senate races\nThat are rich dark really winnable in this atmosphere where we just watched the Senate all stand in line but for Joe Manchin and follow Chuck Schumer's lead\nAnd remember if if you have that happening and that many states you're not going to get a blue wave in the house\nIn ... that they're the same voters at the same people and and the tide is not there but but there's something else or you just said that it's really important uh and again I'm I'm thinking out loud with you so because you you trigger the reporting you're doing his trigger this in my own thinking I think our folks so to start shifting towards humor [laughter]\nI think I I I I really mean is I think you could take you know I mean here I Am I'm I'm throwing is hard to punch is like yeah I'm I'm fighting as hard as I Know how to fight and then you had any just put your foot off the gas and tell a joke\nNo no no no I Want you put your foot on the gas even more but remember as Reagan often proved sometimes humor is more devastating that anger\nHe's right now so for example in practice and I I really think marshes attitude of the big ... it's okay well I understand you're a liberal well understand you're going to vote for humor that don't don't be ashamed of it it's All right\n[laughter] for it and it's really really are and and again I think I think it's just something I just I learned\nThis in part from from theater wage great coverage oh John F. Kennedy and in Queens New York in Nineteen sixty or Kennedy went on those rough but we can before the election just just ripping the Republicans but it was all funny\nIt was all humorous I mean I think my salary for example to take all of these crazy things that are opponent is said weave them together into an eight or ten minutes fish will be like a vaudeville act\nIt's OK okay you're saying the men\nBut all of the of the of the world than in\nThe people in Arizona are crazy I ... I Can't ... I think there should be over now\nBut they had a shot on the first thing we should say ... why would you want to be the senator from the capital of the world I mean if you believe the stuff he said why would you want to represent people are crazy what what's wrong with you\nCan't bring life you know and I never really\nI think I think we should we should accept they really are who they are\nI accept that and I also incidentally another thing that the there is no more moderation\nYou know the history of relationships even Tip O'Neill and Reagan I mean those days are long long gone and the era of moderation or a scoop Jackson Democrat or even Joe Lieberman got thrown out of the party Mr Speaker the pretty much says it all\nThat was one of the nice as human beings ever\nYou cannot be a moderate Democrat today and survive a and and be because you just get more and more and more isolated I mean I thought it was very telling that the votes on Kavanaugh\nYou had people who might have had a better chance of getting re elected but they couldn't break with their caucus only want to do with their donors\nOnly one person and not to give them credit Joe mansion ... probably my home is in a you know I'm sure he got the help me out of him by Chuck Schumer and company\nThey were desperate for him to not vote because they didn't want it to be bipartisan and that's what his vote to\nWell I mean I guess that means he's strong and he's like you're not going to ruin my career because you you because of your radical left his agenda maybe even think about becoming a Republican to be wins and that is the one seat that seems safer red state Democrats the only one you know this point\nI think that's right I think and and it really even Asia and if you watch the ... even when he voted for Kavanaugh the numbers narrow the races closer today than it was a week ago because I think what's happened is people hooked up and suddenly realized what a team sport this is\nThat you got two teams in and there's a really simple question for every so called moderate and I'd say this I Would also says to mention is he was really going to vote for Schumer\nAffairs much everybody needs to be asked that question that's a Democrat\n'cause we live because we've got to vote for ... why would why would West Virginians send somebody to Washington to take power away from Mitch McConnell in the neighboring state\nMean McConnell least understands West Virginia [noise] humor as contempt for West Virginia as Hillary Clinton has contempt as just recently in two weeks ago you know you add\nI'm Nancy Pelosi saying things that were contemptible about what's really there's the question I'll be opposed to to mention is why are you able to running\nIf I go to vote for him or why run\nYou know when you look at things that have been said and I mean just in recent times I mean the the idea of smelly\nWalmart boaters or or we can't be civil or\nJoe Biden saying in September the ... the ... society\nOr era de mobile deplorable ... or ... or a bitter people\nClinging to their God guns bibles in religion\nI mean it's pretty obvious where these people are you you haven't had a chance you have to see\nThe bread is an office beat the undercover video project ...

I think without a doubt by the way one of the things you've got a notice this week you notice the market went down it's a up a little today but went down in the past couple of days and it was triggered by interest rates stuff but in the meantime I had some analysts telling me they're afraid of the Democrats taking the house of representatives\nAnd they would want to raise taxes again they would stop Trump from doing all the good things that he's done a regulation the businesses with the economy and they would want to raise taxes again and that would cost jobs that were slow down the American economy and you've got an economy now that's really growing at about four percent higher than any of the expectations\nAnd what they're really afraid of is that Nancy Pelosi could become speaker again I agree with you showing that the Republicans are going to pick up Senate seats in the Senate seats looking really good because of what happened with the backlash\nOf about the whole cabinet hearing it how unfair it was and you can see we had a poll this was this week where I'm McCaskill was losing to Hawley the Republicans for the U.S Senate\nAnd the white labs and I also Joe Donnelly is now down right and rain Heidi Heitkamp is finished she's down by double digits\nRight we have polls there because of the the energy sector is so important to the state that you're seeing that you're seeing these these polls um you know people want jobs\nAnd what Gary is in the last three weeks where you're going to decide is\nDo you want the economy to keep growing or do you want do you want it to slow down your policy to raise taxes take what you got to take away the job to take away the pay raises and the vast majority of Americans\nDon't want to go back to that I mean we had polls in September with were Nancy Pelosi has a fifty five unfavorable among all voters she has a she has the fifty three percent\nUnfavorable among independent women that the independent women are going to decide this election and and they don't want to go back to the way things work before Donald Trump took over and started to drain the swamp and get things moving again for the country to the house races you're talking about\nOverwhelmingly most of the ones in play a Republicans those Republican incumbents or the or the Republican or a candidates in the in those open seats\nThey're the ones who are going to vote to keep lowering taxes to keep the economy growing and basically to stop what you saw the last couple of days where\nYou know the smart money on Wall street saying hold that she's if she's going to be speaker\nAnd they're going to oppose the president's ah ah agenda they started selling off\nI mean it'd be a disaster for the country\nDoes shown 'em I honestly don't have a feel yet for the house but I think the Senate you have to have been looking very good for Republican pickups\nI think when you have thirty three races now that will that will actually tipped the balance one way or the other in the house of representatives a little too close for comfort but those as somebody that knows Nancy Pelosi I think that would be a worst case scenario and we'd have endless investigations and impeachment and higher taxes and\nAnd you know it then they want to get rid of ice that won't fund the border wall et cetera it's gonna be the same nonsense all over again with them\nWell I my sense is that the house is still a in democratic hands where the election today so it's getting closer or the real clear average is gone from a thirty one or thirty two seats for the Democrats to twenty six twenty seven so it's moved the same direction as the Senate races but not quite\nAs far and I would have to concede much as I Would like not to that the Senate races have moved decisively andme interaction\nKavanaugh had a lot to do with it\nYeah I Do I think they are really two realities there's the reality of the world that we live in on the east coast and west coast and the reality of the rest of their country who thought that a lot of what happened to him\nYeah I'm kind of like an island in the middle of that east coast I'm not the rest of the east coast I don't represent the values of the New York and I've noticed yeah which is a pretty hard core left wing said even in a Governor Cuomo doesn't even want me in this day did you know that\nI Know but if I got I got\nTaken it no he actually said those conservative\nOr their problem is not me at the end of it stems cells or are they streaming service or write to\nMe it was so where is that there are ... are the conservatives have no place in the state of New York city knows that it's not New Yorkers\nIt's simple no one has tons within a rifle me hang\nA um right to life I'm pro Second Amendment uh and uh although I don't I'm libertarian on people's personal lives I think we ought to lead people to hell alone\nI'm Sorry but there's no place for me in the state of New York you said it himself when that happened I had a bunch of governors Florida Texas North Carolina South Carolina all calling and inviting me to move to the states I Want to take them up on this they're shown that would be governor and everything you love and vote for one's me out of town\nI speaking for myself and wanted you to run as an independent for president I think had you run an Alabama one of your old stomping grounds Doug Jones would not be a senator and I would be happy to be part of the bipartisan committee to keep Hannity in New York or to promote Hannity\nOffice would like to run for I think my friend John and I can\nSpot John ... well you disabuse our friend Doug the very notion that I can win any office I don't even think I could win dog catcher\nNo I I I think look you're still the kid from Franklin square you're still you're still have with your working class roots and Andrew Cuomo is trying to make you move out to join because New York that's our biggest export is is the people on taxpayers of New York state\nWe send them to places like Florida and Tennessee in Texas where they have no no income tax and no state income tax may have jobs but by the way Doug fold than out on us because his client right Doug you still work for a a this former mayor for New York my Bloomberg\n... I heard it oh yeah yes I don't I ... I tell you you know people are speculating he might run for president but Andrew Cuomo is clearly afraid of him because he's moving so far left\nChat it's unbelievable he's gonna get whiplash but but I don't even think I don't think they'll make to get through Mayor Bloomberg could get through a Democratic primary these days because they're so radical and that's my point about what's\nGoing on right now the country's realizing in the next three weeks what's at stake is this is the most as Sean says the most important in midterms in our lifetime because\nYou really have a clear choice from a country that's gotten back it's got its footing back\nWhere the economy is moving while we're stronger in the world are we we we are basically the heartland is feeling that people are paying attention to them that the swamp is being put back into the place that that the average person might have something to say about how their wives are going to be gotten governed have control of their own healthcare but\nBut if Nancy Pelosi becomes the next speaker she will be the most powerful elected Democrat in the country she'll be the national face and voice of the Democratic party and that is just frightening\n'cause it let me say something we're not just friday is a frightening Republicans Doug shown does not want this do you do oh\nI Want democratic candidate at all levels in the house to say I will vote against her because that's the way to get votes in these marginal races absolutely don't you should go period style\nAbsolutely and and does point about in previous times we've been on the radio is you know you know what the president's message was when he ran for president was making America great again what's the message of the house Republicans to get re elected this time what should have been on the edge should be better stop Nancy Pelosi from getting\nOh I think it's got to do this or not I I think look if you if you like the success of the last two years\nIf you want your tax cuts to go permanent if you\nIf you believe in secure our borders if you believe in energy independence if you believe in the health care plan and the free independent market healthcare plan\nThat actually would work for the American people like the concierge care for blue collar workers that we talk about all the time with our buddy Dr Josh home or all of those messages and constitutional originalists on the fourth I think those are all winning issues\nYeah you can put all those issues and one vessel and personalize it because Nancy Pelosi will take away all those things show reverse it will have fewer jobs show raise taxes ... you'll have open borders you won't have security\nI come to us and that's actually to ... now you appears to be such a bitter ending and so
