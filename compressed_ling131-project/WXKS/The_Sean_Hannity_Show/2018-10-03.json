Brady ... sources telling Fox the FBI supplemental report on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nIs expected to be sent to Capitol Hill as soon as today they've been conducting interviews about sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh while the partisan sniping over the handling of the allegations continue boxes John decker live at the White House\nUm so we'll see and you know everyone's trying to make a big deal the president was laying out the case about what is you know what we now know fact should matter in this particular case and in the case of any obligation\nNow I Want to get into what this all means I'll get into that at the bottom of the hour a little bit but what we do know now is that obviously\nAll the people that said we believe her long before we knew really anything about it those that rush to judgment eliminated all due process all presumption of innocence\nThat is the Democratic party today forgetting that of course they were against judge Kavanaugh before he ever got an ounce anyway and it didn't matter who Donald Trump nominated to the U.S Supreme Court they were going to be against but Democrats not caring about\nRights fundamental rights that have made this a stronger country actually think the New York times by moving onto a Fifteen page\nA tax expos AA on Donald Trump's father and well he might have gifted his son money years ago when he was eight and therefore he got his\nOh from his father I mean it's it's totally seems to me that they moved on from any chance that have covering the Kavanaugh case 'cause it's probably already done\nWith the FBI investigation wrapped up wrapping up and now handing hand he goes over to the Senate I Want the American people that have a right to see this I think the American people now invested in this\nAnd I think the American people will have a right to know for sure what the FBI came up with remember they're not going to make conclusions they're not going to make recommendations they're just going to say probably what the Senate investigative committee and found out already that they in the\nCase of professor Ford for example she didn't remember date a day of the week a location how she got to or from the location where the alleged crime took place\nShe mentioned four witnesses for people that were at the event no corroborating evidence of any kind\nAnd no one backing up her story including the one person that she placed in the room during the alleged attack\nAnd Democrats you know they they thought this was enough to initiate yet another FBI background check and you know so now it's wrapping up in the mainstream media they've already made up their minds in fact in\nYou know that we learned about mystery mirrors and the New York times couldn't even print that story because when they called dozens of people they found out this Ramirez\nWas actually no she didn't know herself if it was professor I'm Sorry if it was judge Kavanaugh because she was asking former yell classmates I don't fully ... do you remember I'm not sure it was him\nWell that kind of puts that case to rest and on top of the other things that she admitted that she had gaps in her memory and that she had been in ... braided\nRather quickly that that particular event and the third claim the most outrageous claim from this woman named Julie sweat Nick represented by the anti Trump to sell it Mike eleven Ninety alleging that Kavanaugh was involved in\nThe cereal drugging almost on a weekly basis all she says she went to ten of these parties but as you said almost on a weekend basis\nWhat happened where young boys and these prep schools would be drug in young girls teenage girls and lining up in the halls and raping them\nAnd then of course she gave for names to NBC News and well NBC News didn't find one person to back up or story one of the names was dead another name was somebody who said I have no idea who this person is\nAnd they still ran the story and then of course backtracking on a on a variety of issues significant issues of the story that she just released a week a week prior\nHow does that become news and yet that is what the media now does that were perfectly happy airing that interview and now she's saying well\nThey weren't exactly wind up in the hall um while he was in ... no I saw him near the punch bowl and he was given out red solo cups too people that's not drug in girls on a nearly weekend basis and lining up in the halls to gang raped women\nYoung girls and you'd have to believe that if that happens that regularly and was that well known there would be some cooperation\nThat somebody would have told at the time or a law enforcement official a teacher a parent that this was happening or this happened or their drug young kids and and then lining up to rape young girls\nAnd it's gotten so absurd now that you have the senator from Hawaii wanting to investigate the ice throwing incident Brett Kavanaugh apparently through ice in a bar when he was in college\nHe police documents that show that Brett Kavanaugh through ice in someone's face during a bar fight when he was in college do you feel that that is in any way disqualifying for someone who sent U.S Supreme court [noise]\nWe need and has the ins and because there\nA lot of allegations at any point really are about how he behaves finance drug\n[noise] All right so we're at the end of this process now it's interesting that the Senator Grassley in a written declaration release late last night that we got a hold of at the Fox news channel an ex boyfriend of\nProfessor Ford's uh was the California professor accusing Brett Kavanaugh on that particular case anyway directly contradicting her testimony under oath last week that she had never help anyone prepare for a polygraph examination\nFormer boyfriend whose name was redacted in the declaration also said the Ford\nNeither mentioned Kavanaugh ... mentioned that she was a victim of sexual misconduct during the time that they were dating from around Ninety two to Ninety eight and he said that he saw for going to great lengths to help a woman that he believe was a lifelong best friend prepare for a potential polygraph test\nAnd he added that the woman\nI had been interviewing for jobs with the FBI and the U.S attorney's office a further claimed afford never voice any fear of flying even while aboard a propeller plane that they were on seemingly having no problem living in a very small five hundred square foot apartment ... look\nThese are the small details to me I and I some of you may think this was all significant\nAnd at the end of the day she said there were four people\nThat could corroborate her story none of them\nCan corroborate her story most don't remember any party like this and the one eye witness that she placed in the room at the time of the alleged assault said it didn't happen so at that point you've got to presume somebody's innocent\nYou don't know the place you don't know the time you have a date you don't have a location is nothing that the FBI can do except take your statement and assuming that the for people that have already been interviewed again under penalty of a felony\nYou got to assume that they didn't commit perjury and commit a felony when the FBI came back to ask the same questions\nAnd if they did then okay that would be a pretty big deal there is no indication up to now based on reporting that has come out on all the people that have been spoken to\nA lot of people are making a big deal over the fact well they haven't spoken to professor Ford but I mean professor Ford is now told their story multiple times and I've got to believe and assume that\nThey're they're thinking that well her story hasn't changed you just said at last week before the Senate Judiciary committee I'm\nJust [noise] I I just there's there's so much at stake I Want to get into what this all means\nBecause what it means

you're going to tune into TV and you're going to get results from a midterm election\nNow the left will either be happy because of the announcement Nancy Pelosi will be the next speaker of the house or Chuck Schumer is going to be the next Senate majority leader and Maxine Waters will chair her committee peach forty five reclaiming all the time she ever wanted\nAnd that's what's at stake in this election\nNow it looks like the Democrats Hail Mary pass with Kavanaugh's now backfiring and you look at\nYou know if if you go back forty nine percent of voters back the Democratic party forty two percent Republicans by the way I Can't remember elections were Republicans led a generic ballot just to give you some historical context\nBut in mid September it was fifty two thirty eight and I know Nancy Pelosi seems competent she's out there I'm going to be the next speaker well you don't get to decide that it's actually in the hands of the American people\nNow we can't make you vote but we can

you can't have shame if you're only interest is raw power and that's where we've seen a Dianne Feinstein deliberately holding the letter was about ... hours\nOf the fact that you have a democratic senator who says if you're for Kevin all your complicit with evil best raw power or the kind of smearing dishonest\nQuestions and accusations that we've seen that raw power and that is what this election is about this election will decide what kind of country we are\nTo Iraq how ... how many Americans are really comfortable for this kind of character assassination dishonesty and all out effort to destroy decent people and I think that's gonna be in it that is truly on the ballot even if it's not on the ballot because all of us have now seen\nRight there on television and editing without distortion we've seen how bad these people are\nWell I just you know on a level that we've never seen before and I guess it really comes down there are five people but I think it really two of the Democrats that would've considered voting\nFor judge Kavanaugh will only do it I Believe of impact is enough Republicans to get them over the finish line but it comes down to Susan Collins that comes down to Lisa Murkowski and Senator Jeff snowflake who is on his I Want to be president trip to New England this week ... most of the week\nAnd his media tour which is second to none so how does this end up\nWell I mean I think in the short run that I I'm an optimist I think that the the basic decency\nA judge Kevin all of his family ah the sense that most Americans have that he has been a smeared and treated with a vicious personal in fact\nAll those things I think means that the Susan Collins who was going to vote yes and he's going to be confirmed probably by Monday or Tuesday and Wednesday and he'll be on the court but to deeper underlying lesson that all of us should learn about who these people are\nHow they operate how truly dishonest and vicious they are I Hope that that stays for very long time\nLet me ask you a thirty four days out of an election you were there as a strategist when Reagan became president\nFor the first time in forty years you ran on something and you've got the entire caucus of Republicans house and Senate to agree to nationalize an election and make promises to America you called it the contract with America and that you would you promised you would vote\nOn ten specific items in the first hundred days of which you\nDid accomplish that task and Republican for the most part with a few bumps pickups in the road\nHave been in power since um how to Republicans now I think the anger of the bases beyond anything I've seen in recent years rightly so over what's going on with the Kavanaugh hearings and the Democrats\nDemocrats don't have a vision for the future we had I ate horrible years of Obama we've had two very successful years of President Trump what is the pitch what what should the Congress men and women and senators be saying\nWell first of all the president has done a great job he watches various trips such as Mississippi will be in Minnesota and he's laying out the case\nThat if you want results of a team called Republicans\nAnd if you want resistance you've got a team called Democrats\nAnd he's been laying up and and you see it and the numbers than people realize the lowest unemployment for African Americans in history lowest unemployment for Latinos a continuous economic growth many good things that are happening I think the president is set the stage now to pit and spent the last five weeks\nTelling us what's coming next\nWe got this much damage you know ... and I loved the vice President Pence and like you said America's coming back he didn't say we're back yet because we're not\nWe still have a lot of work to them but we're coming back\nAnd now you have a chance for the president's leadership\nAnd I think this election ought to be about which kind of America do you want us to be\nYou want us to keep coming back keep creating jobs do you want us to\nControl the border to shave our children from MS Thirteen gangs from central and promote ... are you prepared to be part of a team to one's constitutional judges not radicals I think if we got campaign could be stunningly successful and we can have as much fun\nOn election night as we head into thousands of\nWhy I mean I hear optimism in you that I look I'm going to be honest I don't quite share it I'm not there with you\nI think it can happen I Believe it's winnable I Believe the Republicans can keep the house I think that Rick Scott can win the Senate in Florida I think Republicans could defeat Joe Donnelly in Indiana a U.S a Joe Manchin of West Virginia\nA Claire McCaskill in Missouri I think they can beat Heidi Heitkamp I think Martha ... a great candidate out in Arizona I think Dean Heller can hold the same no matter but\nI think they're all tight races and then you've got then we've got about fifty competitive house races which could tip the balance of power their\nCourse that's probably have campaigns\nBut we've got we've got thirty five days out here to go out and when\nAnd and I remember and you remember 'cause you were there two thousand six team two weeks out I Do have you with Megan Kelly and she's telling me how we're going to lose so then you're gonna lose Michigan we're going to lose Wisconsin I just said to her we have to alternative universes in my universe\nI Believe the average American is so disgusted with this resistance oriented left wing radical Islam I think the average person knows when when you hear Democrats say they're for Medicare for all their time to destroy Medicare they're talking about destroying your health insurance they're talking about bankrupting the country\nAnd I think that we just have to go out and wage campaigning I must say\nPresident Trump is doing as good a job of getting out on the stump telling the truth laying it out as anybody I've ever seen and I I Believe in the American people my optimism grows out of a belief that the average hard working decent American his disgusted\nBy what they just saw happened to Kevin all his is committed to a work ethic due to a better future and as the Democrats get more radical I think you're going to see the Republicans continue to move a you know for example a\nGovernment run health care means tax paid abortion well they're very few places in America where there's a majority for your tax dollars paying for abortions and I think we have to be fair to tell the truth play into it in a direct way and if we do that we're going to have a very good election\nI got to take a quick break from our nation's capital more with Newt Gingrich on the other side later on Joe diGenova Victoria Toensing and much

Idaho I hung by I saw him given rent solo cups quite a few girls during that time frame I saw him around the punch I won't say malls or the punch container is\nI don't know what he did but I saw him by them or their friends who remember these parties to remember how I think everybody in the county remembers that part and we have we haven't heard furloughs friends so I'm asking you know are there people alive today I ... I yeah I had I was part you know yeah there are people that know about that as part of\nThis morning's sweating it provided for names of friends she says went to the parties with her one of them said he does not recall a Julie sweat Nick another of the French she named is deceased we've reached out to the other two\nAnd has occurred back so if you cannot get a single person given to you named given to you that would corroborate the story\nTo actually corroborate the story and you don't have it and you see a pattern of of backtracking and shifting and changing\nNot not in significant facts but the most significant facts\nRemember the story was about almost on a weekend basis and I've been to ten of these parties myself where young girls were drugged and boys lined up the hall so they could gang rape them\nWell um he gave out red solo cups and I saw him at a party I don't know if he did anything to the punch\nUm this is so reckless irresponsible NBC how they would ever dare run this is beyond any comprehension I have now if they had come from a nation\nIf they had witnesses\nIf there wasn't a changing shifting\nStory if there wasn't traumatic backtracking they might then have some legitimate reason to air this but because they want what the Democrats want which is the smearing of judge Kavanaugh to continue well they had to air it but even they airing of it made them look really\nReally pathetic it's not fair there are ... and I'll tell you the other thing\nThere are victims people I Know in my life\nOf sexual abuse\nI Know there's evil in the world I wrote a whole book about evil people that would ever drug rape or girl are evil these people are predators they need to get off our streets but you've gotta have some collaboration to these things\nAnd it just comes out of Seventeen Days ago just on the eve of the confirmation vote for judge Kavanaugh and if you go issue by issue case by case you know it comes down to do we believe in the presumption of innocence due process\nAnd simple common sense or do we believe in guilt by accusations\nBecause in each case there hasn't been any corroborating evidence at all in each case what you see is a lot of smearing a lot of smoke a lot of blood shunning\nAnd he said come the Partridge Family generation him when he when I think I Love you would lose my newly minted teen idol David

though and then add to it a Ferguson, Missouri Trayvon George Zimmerman Cambridge police\nFreddie Gray Baltimore there's a collective left wing rush to judgment no presumption of innocence and they get proven wrong over and over again and media companies get sued and lose over and over again and they keep making the same mistakes\nI guess the problem with the president he's the president he can't super slander\nWell it's right in and sadly neither can judge Kavanaugh ugly for the same reason these public figure a show I don't believe it's going to be able to legally go down that road but this is what they do this is who they are and Sean I Want to see is the last couple of days you have done a fabulous job opening up a ... year\nUh I mean if if we're going to have a serious conversation about breaking in high school and drugs and high school and adult conduct of a domestic violence when you have incumbent democratic\nMembers of the Senate with court records well out there well discuss uh and and and suddenly this is no longer part of the conversation or can't be discussed I mean this is crazy this is crazy I mean I think they've gone down a road here that they're going to regret long term because every\nGovernor out I I don't I don't think so because it sort of like what Harry Reid lied about Mitt Romney out and pay taxes in ten years and then he was asked after the election if he cared about lying about Mitt Romney's way do you know we won the election what's the difference\nAnd the ... the means for the I think the left so believes conservatives are evil that they feel justified in whatever it is that they say that's right you know but the problem is here this is so serious an allegation\nAnd you know I'm not the biggest fan of the Republican Party I'm not a Republican I've been very critical when they're weak in timid and stupid and I would say they have handled this what the appropriate amount of serious this they have balance what is a fair system they've\nGiven every possibility shadow of a doubt and now it's time to vote now the question is Kelly where Susan Collins where's Lisa Murkowski and wears Jeff snowflake gonna vote\nThat had right it comes down to three I mean Mitch McConnell I had been a real warrior and pushing for a look at a journey Grassley not ... ... and takes up a Democrat you're exactly right but then it gets on a week ago we would have had\nLike Howard park how young are San I think he can hear that we might not Arab\nYou and I say that not because I had any faith and Democrat\nBut because they have political calculation didn't mind you have your mansion looking at a state or\nThirty percent margin that people are getting out what the un confirmed by thirty percent margin people North Dakota once the Kavanaugh confirmed it would be political suicide\nOr high camp or match or don't you're not vote for the nominee don't don't do that people get their humor lapdog but they might do it out of their own political okay for a loop Beckley\nRight well I mean yeah I mean high camp and and mentioned but I think I don't think they go that way a less Collins and Murkowski or a combination of of Collins and ends lake or or Murkowski inflate\nOnce the Republicans have the vote then they'll have the freedom to go and I don't think the Democratic leadership because of of flying hoot about their\nConstituents in West Virginia Florida North Dakota Indiana Missouri because\nIf they did they would say vote your conscience I mean Jeff Flake the hero with the Democratic party why because he admits season on principle man that would never vote the way he really felt because he's only doing this because he's he's lifted up the burden of having to face the horrible voters they get\nI mean that was a horrible mission on sixty minutes\nYeah yeah I mean [laughter]\nDon't get a real does wrong principle is man that stands on their values\nAnd it is a man who wrote a book mimicking Barry Goldwater's a conscious of the conservative ... and it you know if he is then now we have a moment to stand up\nHe thinks he's going to be president let me just first to tell Jeff Flake Jeff delusion [laughter]\nYou are delusional you will never be the president of the United states not in my lifetime All right that is the thank you both for being with us he couldn't get there just teen votes I I mean he's like at nine percent of his own state race it off to the northeast\nNew Hampshire's not interested in Jeff Flake and neither is Iowa\nI mean so out of touch and nobody's interested in the guy that says though I'm only voting this way 'cause I don't have to face the voters again oh so every other vote was because you wanted to get reelected and you didn't care about what principles were

Joe ...\nTore tons to go with the gentleman Toensing ... will be back to the program I'm Victoria will start with you get your take on all the\nWell the new media standard is very very interesting at least for Republicans it's it's you can say John Smith rape somebody oh we can't prove that we don't have anybody else you don't have any witnesses so we're telling you you know what our problems are with our story\nBut nevertheless John Smith rape somebody named that's that's what the media is going with Johnny I it's really important that your listeners should know about what happens here in Washington when there's a high publicity investigation because I was involved in one in the Nineteen eighties with Ronald Reagan's or the CIA director bill Casey\nAnd it was all over the the papers how ... you know how soon we all forget about these things but\nIt I was with the Senate intelligence committee and we got fetch far ranging\nBizarre accusations about Casey Casey met me in a park and held me up with a gun bill Casey took all my stocks and sold them kept the money for himself I mean they were just radically out of a\nWild and that happens all the time and these investigations and you know what we didn't make any of the public and even the Democrats back then\nDid not make them public and yet we have Kamala Harris\nI'm I'm told she's a lawyer she was the attorney general was California's she's supposed to know due process she released an anonymous chain do\nAccusation that's how the person signed it about Brett Kavanaugh of committing some lurid sex acts\nIs there no decorum left in the U.S Senate anymore aren't going to sanction her in any way\nOh Alan Dershowitz was saying that isn't the case of Julie sweating that can particular that if in fact she you know she made the statements and they're probably falls that he would want a full complete investigation into perjury allegations\nUm you know Joe I I I don't know what the law enforcement should do I do know this I Know that\nWe have now examined every single case in\nEvery case there is no corroboration in\nEvery case there is multiple inconsistencies in the last case Julie sweating like there are so many inconsistencies in his mind numbing that NBC would ever aired that interview\nBut they are today anyway the eyewitnesses are the witnesses she mentioned one is dead one doesn't even know who she is and they can't get an answer from the other two\nAnd now the last minute because they're desperate now they want the FBI investigating ice throwing incidents in high school\nYeah well I think um what has happened with Julie sweat Nick is that the Senate committee after the confirmation vote occurs\nNeeds to make a criminal referral\nTo the Justice Department or the U.S attorney for the district of Columbia to investigate her for obstruction of a congressional proceedings by submitted false affidavits and for perjury is written testimony very easy to investigate and it has to be done in order to send a signal\nTo everybody out there that you cannot simply make false statements to a congressional committee in a confirmation process to get yourself publicity is very very important that this ...\nBe investigated by a federal grand jury to act as a deterrent against others from making false accusations there is no substantial ... for her story there is no substitute education for mystery mirrors story and I just want to say something that I Know\nUh probably showing you don't agree with she has repeatedly lied of liked her lawyers did not tell her that the committee was willing to come to California to interview her that is a lot for lawyers did tell her that no good lawyer would never community\nShow I got I got to tell you I don't think they told her if you remember that moment when professor Ford was asked when I forgot maybe it was Lindsey Graham who or whoever it was said we offered to go to you may be Senator Grassley I think both Senator Grassley and then\nShe said oh I there was genuine surprise now remember Dianne Feinstein was working behind the scenes to get a radical left wing activist the resistor as a lawyer this is Deborah cats never catch by the way who said well Paula Jones\nOnly spend ten or twelve minutes with with Bill Clinton it wasn't a big deal that wouldn't constitute sexual harassment in the workplace and also defended and in the case of Al Franken\nBut I I saw genuine shocking surprise and she goes well but I didn't know that but that was very nice do you if you offered that I didn't know we should\nThey should be referred to the D.C bar then for violation of professional world\nI I may I may very well come to conclude that eventually and I'm perfectly happy to accept that\nI can buy that and I'll tell you something that really bothers me about her story and as an old prosecutor who tried sex crimes cases here's the one thing about her story besides everything else we talked about that doesn't make any sense any victim in a situation like that goes to where people are for safety\nNow why is her story not include her going to those people\nBecause if she had done that\nIf she ... literally if if what she says the Kurds and if she had gone to those people get what they would have remembered that in order for her to have a story that holds up without anybody knowing about it she had to leave the house\nI don't know though and look maybe you know 'cause we're talking about the we all know that there are real evil predators there are people that do murder\nAnd rape innocent people there are people that will drug and rape people I eat look at the bill Cosby case\nWe know that and and this is why I think that the Republicans credit they took these allegations in charges seriously they handled it professionally they appointed every combination which was the right thing to do\nBut for the Democrats are they just they just now I pushed this so far\nInto a ... ... ... any allegation no matter how many inconsistencies no matter no evidence no matter no cooperation whatsoever and we saw that they hated the guy from the beginning\nI I don't I don't know what I don't know what victims remember or don't remember Joe and I don't know what how they act or react I Would assume was probably\nPeople react differently like you go to a funeral some people are crying some ...\nI was I was perfectly happy to accept anything that she had to say and I listen to her testimony carefully at the time and his and then I went back and I looked at it repeatedly and it may very well be that she believes everything she said\nThe problem is there's not a sin pillar of evidence to corroborate and conveniently enough everything that could have happened that would have made her story corroborate rubble is non existent shot us than happened that just doesn't happen\nSean ... let me just say well you know we make our living trying to look at stories like this and taking them apart are supporting them\nThere's another problem with her story listen she said that they they're rich music on an upstairs bedroom that's kind of weird because the party was downstairs that let's take it and they turned them music up so nobody could hear her\nAnd then she likes to south in the bathroom and she can hear them talking going downstairs what you think these guys and it just turn the music ups and one could hear it went over and then said let's turn it down so many flaws in what she said\nI just don't know what look I I it's very hard I don't want to get into that whole aspect of it I got to take a break we'll come back more with Victoria Toensing Joe diGenova next\nAnd then your calls coming up final half hour we'll just do all calls eight hundred nine four one Sean\nHey listen if you
