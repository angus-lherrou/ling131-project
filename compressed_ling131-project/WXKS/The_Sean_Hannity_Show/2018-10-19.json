Senate for the Republicans\nTight race though in Florida vote for governor in for Rick Scott who always does an amazing job for the people of Florida are anyway joining us to analyze where we are Eighteen days out is our good friends welcome back to the program John McLaughlin Doug shown pollsters both of them\nJohn Eighteen days out what do you see happening\n[noise] uh well the the houses are still in play and the Republicans are a without a doubt are fighting back to have gotten more aggressive but still it needs to do a lot more and and what's really amazing to me is the focus of\nYou know you're exposing the Democrats and what their agenda is all the time but the focus of the Republicans really needs to be to expose Nancy Pelosi and what she intends to do I think\nYou played a clip earlier about humor in the Senate and he wasn't very specific about whether they're going up in the polls because the Republicans post Kavanaugh uh have have really done a lot better it in a in a\nIn the Senate polls that have come up I mean when you're talking about uh Arizona ... now hit by a little in Tennessee Republicans leading now decisively a sort of ... so the\n... the Democrat opportunities to pick on the Senate look like they're going off the table and on the other hand it looks like the Republicans are ahead in Missouri they're\nThey're they're running close races in in Montana Indiana\nA West Virginia I mean even in New Jersey uh it's it's turning into a competitor and\nWhat is really looking like New Jersey might be a dog fight for Bob Menendez and the people in New Jersey of had it with him and you know now that his association\nWith this Chilean Epstein guy uh that has now become an absolute verbal war between ... and his Republican opponent of opponent and now showing up at the polls are dug show where do you stand Eighteen days out\nWell I think where America's fans and John and you are right on fortunately I might add\nIs that the Senate has moved pretty decisively Republican I don't think that New Jersey will go all the way because it is a operationally democratic state but the other states you cite Sean I think are moving in what I think are the wrong direction I\nStill have a chance to pull out in Nevada and Arizona but both of those at the terrier rated above it from my perspective at all last\nWeek and I think Arizona in particular but Dean Heller was in a very tight race for reelection the Republican\nWas ... it was a to point raised a week ago Donald Trump goes in and now he's up by seven and I saw the crowds when I was out there was massive but the crowd outside was even bigger than the one inside\nWell look okay yeah I was gonna say I I've seen the same numbers John please go ahead\nAnd absolutely I mean the president is motivating his base and and the Republicans need to embrace up because a nationally when he won he had sixty three million voters and when the the uh uh\nUh when the midterms occur we only get Ninety million people usually out might be a little more this time but it won't be as big as the hundred and thirty nine million who showed up in a twenty six team\nSo if you can get the sixty three million Trump voters motivated that they're coming out again which the Kavanaugh hearings did and it appears to have backfired\nParticular Senator Schumer and the and the Democrats in the Senate or if you can motivate those Republicans to come out\nThose Trump voters those independents and Democrats that supported them they have a very good shot at getting Senate seats and it's probably the only shot they have a winning the house that van and going after Nancy Pelosi the idea of stopping Nancy Pelosi the most popular a\nFoil let me tell you what I'm saying I Am radio and TV if you vote I don't care what congressional district here and there were four hundred and thirty five\nCongressional districts in this country in any of those districts if you vote for any Democrat you're voting for ... if you stay home it's half of ... and the same in the Senate if you're going to vote for tester\nAnd McCaskill and send them on against Dean Heller and Donnelly and you're going to vote for you know breath and it was just a phony fraud to the people of\nGetting caught on tape being it uh and and not put more Marsha Blackburn in you know you'll get the government you deserve but you're really electing and voting for Schumer because they're gonna they're gonna tow the line with pillows the in the house into the line with Schumer in the Senate that's\nYou know and what do we know that they want they want to impeach the president they want endless investigations\nThey want to raise taxes they're actually saying that they're hiding the impeachment begging Maxine Waters not to say it any more John Podesta Center for American Progress and saying all Democrats should not talk about immigration for for this they want to open borders sanctuary cities\nSanctuary states that elimination of ice and they want to keep Obamacare that's not that that didn't work for eight years dug and\nWhy why do we we told him to a bit of a leading Indiana is say a heat by you saying go the wall and he's saying no impeachment which\nWhen he was the only reason he surviving and not down by five or six now is because you've got a libertarian in that race that is polling at nine percent you take a libertarian outta Donnelly is history in Indiana\nWell I wouldn't be so sure on but he is running where Democrats may be in the center and if we were a centrist party rather than a leftist party with new leadership from top to bottom I think we would go in a lot better I think it probably agree with that song\nHow is it possible that Democrats hold on to below sea and Schumer how was it ... it is a phenomenon to me ...\nAll one word answers on Snowden's money so it's you know raising enough money yeah ... that's what it's\nAll about ... and and and he's absolutely right because showing that when we asked in September national poll that there were ... when we ask voters if the Democrats took over Congress do you want and she pulls you speaker didn't\nOnly twenty three percent of all voters said yes fifty six percent said now\nBut then when we asked them about the fact that you know if you know that they're trapped in that these candidates are accepting millions of dollars to raise them for their campaigns from Nancy Pelosi or a woman oh their votes to her fifty percent agreed with that statement only twenty nine percent disagreed of all voters so they\nNancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer hold the mortgage on these candidates\nAnd let me tell you it's a for for ... for someone who's involved in congressional races right now trying to defend Republicans\nThe Democrats are pouring millions of dollars into the race is right now\nWhat enter patio and he's behaving Republicans\nProject very toss released to tapes and they are stunningly\nYou know revealing in terms of the willingness of campaigns to purposely organized a campaign\nTo lie to the people at Tennessee in the case of Brett us and to lie to the people of Missouri in the in the case of\nClaire McCaskill to say one thing privately another thing publicly it tells me Democrats to when they have to they can expose who they are if they can't talk about impeachment which they want\nThey can't talk about immigration and being told not to talk about that they can't talk about raising taxes even though they want that they can't talk about Obamacare even though they want that\nI mean what kind of people are they if they have zero sense of honor honesty character and integrity\nWill do good in that that it's a little too cold there the government agency launched its cold Adam lab with the goal of
