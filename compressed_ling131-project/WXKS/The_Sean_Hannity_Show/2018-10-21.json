{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WXKS", "content": "Really depends surfing the Web probably doesn't care too much so it really depends on what you're doing if you if you you know intel ran into a problem which is they couldn't make faster and faster chips that kinda got stalled around for gig or hurts they ... they thought they were going to be able to make five and six gig urged chips and\nIt turned out physics to fight them\nAnd so they instead of making faster chips individual chips they made multiple core chip so\nInstead of having one forgive hurts process or they might have two processors in the same they call it die the same physical chip two processors that was the court to you by each a to point to a to point eight gig or hurts\nA and then they went to four they now have the nine processor\nOr are we just review the Ninety nine hundred K. which I think has eight corps and they're getting bigger and bigger um sixteen threads but that's another thing entailed did which is they said well each court could do two things so we're going to say this can do sixteen things at the same time\nBut it's not quite as sixteen times faster as a single court and again this is the important thing most\nSoftware only uses one of those cores if it only uses one than the most important thing to you is the clock speed of that core not how many of course there are right so a forgive\nHurts to courtship is faster on a word processor than a to giggle hurts hate courtship because the process was only using one core\nOh All right so that's why this is a complicated answer I think is what do you do what do you do with your computer\nMainly service on the Internet but I I we usually we don't know the computer and they used to sell all processor [noise]\nYeah and that you know you don't these days or to court\nTo core processor always great you know but the only thing uh I Would like to get a like a SST job up to speed up the Buddha\nWell and that's the other important factor in this right a ... it's the truth is E. A. M. D. chips are a little less expensive and a little slower\nBut maybe if you could take the money you save it put it to some other things that would speed things up because for instance if you're doing word processing it doesn't matter how fast your computer is\nYour slower than any processor you could put in the modern computer on the other hand the speed with which you load programs load the operating system save files\nThat's more important to you so as solid state drive that is much much faster boot up times and and ... times to load programs and say five that's going to make a big difference in overall system performances holistic thing it's not we focus way too much on the gig or hurts of the processor\nIt's so many other things graphics processing unit for instance may make much more difference for you even if you're doing high end video or photos may make much more of a difference to you then the the the CPU the the main corps\nIn fact you you'd probably be better off buying a faster gp you and a slower CPU for most of the things you do\nSo it really comes down to what is your used case how you're using this process or\nUm I Would recommend reviews at the to the geeky is reviews out there are two different sites and non tech A. N. A. N. D. T. C. H. dot com and PC Perspective which is P. C. P. E. R. dot com\nPC Perspective has some well I was mentioning their harbor leader board they're high in computer that's got an empty rise and chip in it one of the thread river chips uh so you know these are not bad chips by any means I don't think they save you quite enough to to make up for the\nPerformance loss but it really it you know sell you when you're talking a cellar on one of these really cheap entail ships they make these just for the low end market\nBut the truth is for surfing the Web it's fine\nI you know ... you see people surfing the Web on very slow processors so it really depends on how you're using it it's a it's a complicated frankly thing and I think we pay way too much I certainly tech journalist but people geeks and general way too much attention to the speed of the microprocessor the CPU\nOnly one small part of the overall um equation you're right get to save money get a better screen get ... get a faster hard drive get a better gp you all of those things

lawmakers are skeptical at best\nThe Saudis say they are working to punish those who are behind to show these deaths but Saudi foreign minister Abdul ... Fox is Brett Baer there seems to be a rush to judgment\nAnd talking about fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson well he's now saying indicated he's going to plead the fifth he's not saying a word anymore\nOr he was on Fox News Sunday telling Maria ... that Glenn Simpson is in real legal jeopardy in all of this you also confirmed that the FBI has evidence that directly refused the premise of a ... a Trump Russia ... broke in other words that there's been and remains exculpatory evidence\nIt was a great piece by Jonathan Turley the three reasons Mahler may not charge Trump with obstruction apparently not asking any questions about it but\nSticking exclusively to whether or not there was any type of collusion which we all know the answer to a you have one top Republican lawmaker no saying the FBI failed to provide a federal surveillance court with important evidence well we don't that now for a long time and we know that\nFor Pfizer court judges\nOr handed information that was supposed to be verified and corroborated ended up being Hillary Clinton's bought and paid for Russian lives that was put together by fusion GPS interestingly funneled money through ... from the hiring of Christ is Christopher Steele a foreign national he doesn't even stand by the information and the ...\nAnd it was the bulk of information to get for Pfizer warrants against the Trump campaign associate the lead up to the twenty sixteen race\nAll this comes down to some simple basic fundamental things and they never told the Pfizer judges that it was Hillary Clinton the page for this information and it's uh\nBelievable that this could be happening in this country but it looks like we're finally beginning to get to the bottom of it at least I Hope so Jason Chaffetz is with us\nFormer congressman now Fox News contributor author of New York times best seller the deep state we had Victoria Toensing and Joe diGenova of of the gentleman ... with us ah thank you both for being here let's start with Jason shape it's because this is your wheel house and\nIt seems to me that it doesn't matter what Congress request\nThey seek to do their job of oversight they're never going to get the information from the department of justice and they're not going to get the people they need to talk in front of them under oath\nWell the hard part about when you issue a subpoena when I was the chairman of the oversight commission many I can issue a subpoena but the only way to on for that is through the department of justice and so the weight of the paper really isn't worth much because the deejay won't enforce its own subpoena the subpoena issued by Congress\nThat the name that people need to also familiar ... themselves with is marked Elias market why it was ...\nHe was ... for the DNC he was careful for Hillary Clinton he was counsel for a ... group he was involved there\nThis this guy sits in the middle of a lot of these transactions in the movement of money and I think more and more you'll start to see his name along with you know or and Simpson and all these others\nWell I think the fact that ... Simpson is now saying Victoria that was going to plead the fifth and it can get away with that and make them come in and plead the fifth you know the idea that they can do is threatened to plead the fifth and not have to actually go through with it I think is important\nThey should make him show up and in front of the TV cameras plead the fifth it's ridiculous to accept a letter from the lawyers and I hope they send you are talking to your former French and telling them to get them or get in to the Congress to take\nThat said and I don't care if they're not going to\nI'm In ... because I think there are other ways to to figure out how to do it you've got a subpoena you subpoenaed first and then you negotiate later you don't say oh mind he didn't show up talking trying to work it out now you have to think about CNN said Pina and then you say you can't make it Wednesday then you make it Thursday\nThat I Can't believe there's no ...\nWell I mean I'm trying to understand I mean the president said that there would be de classification and all the materials the Jim Jordan was just talking about would be an redacted and we'd have a chance to see the ... of warrants the gang of eight information the three oh two between\nA Bruce or and Christopher Steele and how they wanted a funnel that information straight into Robert Mueller's office uh Joe diGenova but you know the idea of why do I think even with you and Victoria's my attorneys\nThat I wouldn't get away with just saying I'm going to plead the fifth leave me alone now or or not handing over subpoenaed materials to Congress\nWell I don't think there's any question that Congress has dropped the ball on course to get them to pay his but let me just say this 'cause this is really important all the names that you heard\nMichael with us Mr liar and said or all those people they are who to everything that was done in the United states what's fascinating\nIs what happened in the United kingdom between the Congress has been an issue any subpoenas court we now know that the FBI or am I stick\nAnd that you do a few to conduct electronic surveillance of American city citizen on foreign soil without legal authority to do so\nAnd that information was fat conversations George Papadopoulos\nWere intercepted and in the course of the intercept compensation they found out that off the top of it was not interested in Hillary email or anything else and they never ... information because by the court\nYou know it seems congressman shape it's that every piece of the puzzle now is falling in place I think we now understand what the insurance policy was Lisa Page testified that in the the nine months of the investigation leading up to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller\nThat they had no evidence of Trump Russia collusion at all\nUm and by the way even her lover Peter Struck said the same thing he said well I'd be all end if there was something there there's no there are there and then all of a sudden we find the media elite strategy that they discussed this with Andrew McCabe comes in James Baker comes in and other people come in\nAnd what we see is again it goes back to the Clinton bought and paid ... that the CIA information has leaked out to the media creating the impression that in fact there was Russia Trump collusion\nBut they did it themselves they took the again it's it's all they were doing the leaking so that they can appoint the special counsel so that in the which one could be good begin\nI is there any part of the puzzle that isn't clear to you because it's getting very clear to me\nDo it is becoming a crystal clear\nAnd that's why Jim Jordan is exactly right the people that were in that meeting and river the timing of this evening this meeting happens directly after\nA district Colombia's relief of his duties but just before a Mr Mueller is put into place and you have to understand who's in that meeting what was discussed it sounds like bakers being the most candid about what was going on there but\nEach of the people in that meeting should be brought in for its own their own deposition uh transcribe under oath\nOr before Congress you don't have these five minute little ... you know after you have questions when you do this and I've been in these big go for an hour for the Republican than the Democrats get time than another hour for Republicans and you can really get in depth information if they would do it that way\nWell Victoria I think that's true and that's right and that's just not fair but\nThe obstruction continually I Will take a break we'll come back more with Jason Chaffetz and Joe diGenova also but Dorian ... with us\nI Want to remind you our friends at my pillow they have done it again call their

York between different groups some group that identifies themselves I never heard of them before Proud Boys\nA bird seed versus some other left wing protesters\nI'm a think any of this might be connected to the rhetoric that we've been hearing\nMaxine Waters and Eric Holder and Hillary Clinton you can't be civil and kick 'em and\nGetting you know follow them into department stores and gas stations you know maybe on the heels of nobody in the Democratic party condemning what happened up Pam Bondi here's the Nielsen the secretary of homeland security or Sarah Sanders or Ted Cruz and his wife in a restaurant or Mitch McConnell at an airport\nYou know it's just play a little bit of uh some of the marching orders\nYou cannot be terrible with a political party that wants to destroy what

killing each other on the streets every day\nUh invited on somebody that I disagree with strongly politically but I think makes a good point and condemns all of those with me\nOr Sally cone she's a of a super hard left wing or ... you don't mind me saying so the author of the book the opposite of hate and the host of a state of resistance a pod cast\nAh do you tell people to follow Pam\nBondi and and Sarah Sanders family and and secretary Nielsen into restaurants and getting their faces and confront them and greater crowd and push back in ... does that advice you give people\nSee you know Sean this is one way or [laughter] or small Hi nice to hear your voice and\nDoes he hates when she has never agree with me and she's going to now like\nI'm not I'm gonna I'm gonna tell you the answer is\nAh when I was an organizer you know before you and I met him in a community organizer I used to organize protests like the scene of going to\nPeople's workplaces or you know not just the halls of Congress right which are that's where the people's businesses supposedly done but we're talking people's lawns et cetera\nUm you know look I support and a free speech absolutist I support free speech on all sides so am I and the and these protests those sorts of protests now make me uncomfortable and look I did speak out against\nA you know going up to you know and I are costing people in restaurants or you know what happened to Sarah Huckabee Sanders et cetera\nI Do think you are I I Love you say you're dancing 'cause you're kind of ignoring you know I don't know what I'd like to punch I'd like to punch him in the face or not the crap out of them or you know maybe they should have been rough up or you know that that if we talk about\nViolent rhetoric and we're gonna look I think it's all bad but like ...\nRhetoric is now the tax or the the heart of the hard left you know people don't like when when the president says you know fake news and they're not real news people and their phony journal is I think that's just that's the exercise of free speech and my hearing you write used to organize protests in front of people's houses\nYou didn't hear me correctly yes\nWhy would you do that knowing that there could be kids women and children in the house because I kind of a role leave the women and children alone\nWell I I I haven't\nMet maybe maybe it will say that I don't know maybe it'll be accused of being\nSome of those policymakers might be women so leave the husbands and children alone to where the partners whatever again John I'm not saying it a ... or some kind of bragging rights I'm saying it because my position on that has changed but\nWe'll hire hearing now regularly is these sounds to me like marching orders creator crowd push back followed them into gas stations department stores restaurants you see a cabinet member you go at him getting their face\nI'm I'm not hearing the Republican side and my point to you is this look I I think it's very hard to tie I I ... I wasn't there I only watched what when the fights that started the videos that that everybody's been putting on line\nAnd um\nI got to be honest I think Rand Paul and we saw what happened in the Brett Kavanaugh hearings during the hearings which is fine that was free speech I didn't have any problem with that at all I think we've gotten to the point where we're going to have to kick out citizens so that the men and women hunger is\nGet to walk the halls without what's now becoming I think it's dangerous confrontations zone that are\nIn protest on the left and and the right in Congress including disrupting hearings and by the way all within the last week of ... and they\nDo it but I don't have a problem with the with the speaking part but I Do have a problem if they're not letting these people walk there screaming at them they're in their face and if something's gonna happen Sally here's the praise my fear is just rhetoric is now crossed the line if you're talking about physical violence confronting members of the government\nYou know you know one thing I and I pulled by play it for you right now\nI always said about Obama the number one leaves kids alone that both he and Michelle seem like good parents they really did and I ... and I also said we've got to protect our presidents and I said it when Obama was president so many times I can play a loop of it if you like to hear it\nWay I don't need to but what I Would love you to play it again look first of all your during the stairs of nonviolent protest the phone calls to petition the whatever those are the marching orders and second of all you know if you're going to be ignoring the examples that Donald Trump really\nWhen people were stood up protesting him saying I got to hurt him if you know I'll get you in court don't worry about it are you on TALK marching orders for violent\nOkay I remember one nothing had another one another that sort of like people are saying oh no no no no no if you want me the\nQuestion I didn't take that as is the same intensity and messages I'm hearing regularly but this is an everyday thing that is now happening with the Democratic party by the way I have the evidence of me saying about Obama only\nPlay I mean ... you're talking about protecting the president of the United states of America and it's just there's no room for error\nYou've got to protect the president that that represents the free world so they've got a very difficult job they've got to almost be perfect and anytime any incident happens a lot lately is becoming pretty high profile I\nMissed the speakers you're gonna have strong feelings about this we've now learned that this guy that broke into the White House not only did he get in the door\nBut he knocked down the secret service agent went into the three different rooms or the White House and pass the stairs that would have gone right up to the the residents of of the Obamas that is extraordinarily chilling to me huh

Clinton's recent comments Eric Holder's using comment I spoken out about them and it gets\nOut there is also a very very visible pattern\nComment after ... after comet of Donald Trump I'll beat the
