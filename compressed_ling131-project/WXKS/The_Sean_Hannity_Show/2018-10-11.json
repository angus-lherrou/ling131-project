you didn't ask me questions about all those it then throughout that two month period\nAll right Dave Brat let's bring you into this uh what first of all how has your race going I you know I Know that you've been targeted now by by Nancy Pelosi and company and the thrown a ton of money in your district to get your defeated how's it going\n[noise] yeah it's going good weren't went on the policy yet the healthcare immigration pact or my opponent is a clerk liberal and so we're putting the word out but it's like you said they're pouring billions and because\nThey know they're going after you and never come back talk big time and I would do and you're right\nRight no it's it's a it's a battle and that there there is is that my opponent the resist\nI should really doesn't have a platform it All right now and so she's just running out of the resistance and out and do vote and that's it so why I think I think the people especially after the Supreme Court dabba ... a lot in the lab and then she Hillary yesterday and all the folks chime in and on the left\nI think the ah the voters in Virginia regard to the right thing\nLook I think we've been putting a pen specific raises a night um congressman Jordan\nYou know I mean the California Arizona a Mayo loving Utah Colorado is a number of seats there there\nWas it and if people want the full list the we've identified the top Seventy seats we put it up on the Hannity dot com at all so that people can check and make sure that that if their congressmen or a woman who's in a tough race that they get out to the polls what do you think's going to happen in twenty six days Congressman John\nI think we're going to win I think we've got great candidates like Dave Brat who were fighting for the for the American people elected us to fight for so I think we're going to win and I think the way you phrase it ups on his way you've been doing it\nHow radical the left is I'd like to say it this way there there that that left today is that they apply Capra Nick when he respects the flag they embrace Governor Cuomo when he says America was never that great material and Maxine Waters when she says go out and harassed anyone who supports the president and we saw that double down on that whole mindset double down on yesterday with luck Whitman holder said about Republican\nWhat are you ... and ... they're going after terrorists Sanders I'm Pam Bondi and secretary Neely says\nYeah I it just it just how radical the leftist today's modern Democrat Party today's party of the lab has taken most extreme positions in history raise your taxes abolish ice never secure the border continue to socialized medicine and impeach the president and you contrast that with what the president under his leadership we've accomplished\nList is phenomenal did this the other day but they could buy the taxes cut ... regulations reduced the economy going for quaint two percent lowest unemployment fifty years we're out of the Iran deal the embassies in Jerusalem we've got a new NAFTA deal the hostage to come over North Korea and we got to get guys\nOn the United States Supreme court that's an amazing record and if we ended up that way and twenty six days we will win and keep the majority and continue to be able to do things to make\nAmerica why don't you know some of these candidates they can't string two sentences together there's no no idea why they're running for office when you can't communicate\nThis is a nationalized election and we got to understand that and go out and get that kind of message Dave Brat understands that he's out campaigning on the good things that happen with conservative leadership and his leadership uh that's how we have to run these campaigns and if we do I think we keep the majority\nLet me ask you a question now Fox has confirmed that the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein enacting FBI directed his after the firing a coma Andrew McCabe and Robert Mueller all met on a weekend day after Mueller's investigation started up\nAnd in that meeting Rosenstein and the and McCabe or or both detailing reasons why the other one needs to recused themselves from the Russia investigation as as a whole are sitting there watching all this go on and knowing that well I guess I'm In charge of the whole thing what do you make of that uh they brought\nYou know I just go back to the way your frame that you only got ... dot com it's all like ... Iran over its like get the specifics but in your intro Rosenstein said we have to follow the constitution for the people because we need oversight to follow the evidence using reason\nAnd now he woke up in front of the people right say he's not just saying no to Jim Jordan and members of oversight committee he's saying no to the American people and he when he just sat in your remarks\nThat the job and the role of the constitution is to give the people oversight\nUsing evidence and reason so he he's thumbing his nose at the U.S Congress and if we don't hold strong that President is not good and I'll let him go on with\n... yeah it sounds so ... you're exactly right both of the cave and Rosenstein ... this is interesting that both actually right Andy McCabe should have been recused from any type of oversight over the Muller investigation because of his involvement with his wife with his his conflict when his wife was running for office and he was supporting her\nSo that should disqualify him Rosenstein is right about that but the caves right about Rosenstein Rosenstein wrote the memo\nFor why companies should be fired one of the things Mohler is looking into was there obstruction of justice into the firing of calling me you've gotta be kidding me so that guy's going to oversee this so both of them had conflicts and so that that that sort of the funny thing is to argue with each other and like you both right neither one of you should be involved in this special counsel\n[noise]\nNews on rich Dennison another sell off on Wall street [noise]\nThey after losing more than eight
