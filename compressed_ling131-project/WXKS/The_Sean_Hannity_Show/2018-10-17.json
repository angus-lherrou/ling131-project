most consulates in Turkey and they listen to what's going on\nAnd we'll find out in this case um my take I think it probably all happen but I don't think we should rush to judgment because the truth is going to come out probably sooner rather than later joining us now Dr\nSebastian Gorka former White House advisers brand new book is phenomenal by the way why we fight defending the feeding rather not defending the feeding America's enemies with no apologies also Dan hop and Fox News contributor thirty year CIA up operations officer\nA duck the Gorka I assume you agree with me that all signs point to the Saudis assassinating murdering this guy in a a barbaric way that's what I'm thinking\nYou know the ruin in warfare or report from the battlefield must be questioned\nUh I think this man is that whether or not these audio tapes exist is another question but it's absolutely certain that this individual was caught between two nations that wants to dominate the Sunni Muslim world\nThat's the new often ... as the wand regime of turkey and the birth place of Islam Saudi Arabia and this man was caught in the middle\nHowever however this isn't the fake news we've got to be accurate this man was a journalist wasn't and Americans or they're trying to spin it was a foreign national read them and it was a common pay ... you wrote commentary\nAnd he has a long decades long history of ... the Muslim Brotherhood and there's also related to the figures\nArab um the ... of the twenty first century ... so all of these things are total statements of factual\nWhat do you think a missed the hop and it's been a while my uh my friend Dan is good to have your back I Know this has been your life and your business for so many years\nUm my gut is pretty clear on this uh I think this man was murdered and the most evil root for brutal way possible\nAnd I think that the president is wise knowing that we're going to get to the truth now there's no doubt we'll go and we're going to have the truth rushing to that point is not smart in my opinion\nI I agree with you uh look there's a lot of evidence that we have already we nailed it Fifteen Saudis\nTraveled on the Gulf Stream Arafat arrived if it costs to lift the day the show he entered and we know he just show again never exited the costs ... a week do the makeup of those of the safety and Saturdays for them a fairly part of ... the one of them the forensic doctor you referred to as listening to music well\nAllegedly this membrane a show he thought he after he was killed\nOr what we don't know\nWhat was the orders that were given for these Fifteen Saudi and who gave them the orders and then to whom did they report posts Puerto those are all questions we need to answer\nThat President I think was a hundred percent right to just fashion secretary state they gather the fact emphasize that they were issue of greatest concerns what will get the facts with accuracy and a lack of the that's what matters I Will remind the listeners that when Sergei Filin part with poison back in March\nBritish home secretary rods that they needed to avoid speculation while we allow the police to carry on their investigation I think that's what's going on here in the last thing I Would highlight is that Well Secretary Palmdale with needing and doing it public diplomacy I'm quite sure that the FBI legal as they say in Riyadh\nAnd the other in a central or an uncle or\nMeeting with their Turkish and Saudi counterparts to collect the evidence but it's to be a part of reviewing it shot\nYou know it's ... I Wish everything could fit in nicely neatly into a box assuming that I Believe that the Saudis are involved and whether it goes straight to the top I don't know the crown prince is denying it\nI'm kind of having a hard time buying that myself but knowing that there are very different country but\nNow it gets complicated because also the Saudis the Egyptians Jordanians the Israelis the United states the Emirates they're all fighting against the Iranian had you had money in the region\nAnd their quest for nuclear weapons and the instability that would cause the entire world um I Know everybody Dr Gorka would like to say that okay we're cutting off all ties with Saudi Arabia where Don where this with that\nUm I think there's there will be consequences severe consequences the president said\nUm but it gets a little rough or what do you do if you're also trying to battle another enemy I mean the United states did partner with our arch enemy is the former Soviet Union to defeat or not the Islam in World War two\nYeah absolutely I mean you you don't make perfect the enemy of the good\nGeopolitics as like politics itself domestically it as the ... all over the ... the um over the perfect I'm On the truth is wrong we have a lot of leverage over Saudi Arabia or at the beginning of the Trump Administration we established very very\nGood ties through a and B ... bombers been found them in with those relationships are not going to be tested but this is a nation\nThat survival depends upon our support militarily and I'm ... and training so there's a lot but reachable average against Saudi Arabia but you're absolutely right this is part of a\n...

their own their own learn something\nMy words I'm not the one who said quote get over it this is a direct quote for staffers next to roast about how she's going to impeach Trump but she didn't tell the moderates to get over it after she gets elected that's their words and she's calling me a fraud stir for telling the truth to the American people it's the job of investigative reporting\nTo expose the truth and and I think she didn't have to respond to her response because it's filled with lies and then you wouldn't do an accusation\nI'm just glad that you were able to get all of this out than

twenty fourteen study scientific study and they said that average European American walking around his point one eight percent Native American she's half\nSo the idea that she continues to double down on that is why is the most disgusting thing to me it's a fact that she's in the public eye and she continues to use is and what she was trying to do was put this to bed so she could run against President Trump and twenty twenty and it is backfiring on her and I'm Glad to see it because she was she needs to do come out and apologize to all of us\nI'm not running for president I'm not running for president I'm not running for president I Am not running for president of the United states are you going to run that I Know I'm not running and I'm not going to run\n\nHi I'm Geoff Diehl running to be your fulltime US Senator you don't need a part time author or part time senator and part time presidential candidate I'm going to put Massachusetts first\nI'm jet deal the guy who stopped automatic gas tax and now I'm not just not partisan gridlock in Washington that's why I'm running for Senate against Elizabeth Warren same Elizabeth Warren ... at least officers racist front to back\nMe I called them heroes men and women with their lives on the line every day\nMy campaign isn't about party politics about getting the job done [noise] Massachusetts I'm Jay Field I approve this message\nThat is the ad glad you're with us by the way twenty five now told the top of the hour eight hundred nine four one Sean is our number\n... ads by Jeff deal was born she does have to get re elected US Senator if she wants to think about running for president from the great state of Massachusetts in the commonwealth look\nHere's where we are this week Elizabeth Warren has claimed for ever that she is Native American we can go back to Nineteen eighty six to Nineteen Ninety five she lifted herself as a Native American and the director of the association\nOf American law schools she identified as a Native American during her tenure when she was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania while teaching at Harvard law school\nShe was described as quote the only tenured minority woman and on multiple occasions Warren stated that her mother and father were forced to a low\nBecause of racism surrounding her mother's Native American lineage he was featured in a Native American cookbook that is entitled\nHow while chow and it turns out according to the DNA test that she released a just this week well it turns out he is approximately between one sixty one sixty fourth and one one thousand twenty fourth\nNative American let me interpret it another way that's less than zero point one percent Native American Ninety six percent European according to the American Journal of human genetics that's less than the\nAverage white person that lives in the United states so you have are claiming to be a Native American and our professional career a political career\nFor personal gain claims of family was discriminated against as a result of all this\nThen tries to prove to her detractors that she's right and releases a DNA test showing less than point one percent of Native American heritage now is this all the Democrats have to offer you know identity politics is the worst and I mean you know it's a national embarrassment what's going on here\nOther question is I I Know that Massachusetts plans solidly left I Know it's a solidly blue state but do you really want or elect somebody that has lied on such a spectacular level to advance her career all throughout her career as your senator\nWell do you have to deal is the candidate running against Elizabeth Warren I Know it's a long shot but you know Massachusetts also different points elect the guys like Bill weld and\nMitt Romney at the time so I guess it is possible Jeff that uh the people of Massachusetts can wake up how are you doing\nToday showing great to be with you thank you hey this is the state where I'm a non stop brown one when he ran again or\nA ... state that was the models were they on Affordable Care act so uh it can definitely when this and I'll tell you something the Boston patrolman is association has never indoors to Republican for the U.S Senate they've done in this race the last Republican was H. George W. Bush\nUm when Elizabeth Warren talked about the criminal justice system being racist front that she got so many people angry there's a lot of families out there that care about community safety and here she is insulting law enforcement so this is a different race and I think most people are expecting and I think now that she's made it very clear that she wants to run for the White House and twenty twenty\nI'm middle focus on Massachusetts whatsoever", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "Newton", "day": "17"}
