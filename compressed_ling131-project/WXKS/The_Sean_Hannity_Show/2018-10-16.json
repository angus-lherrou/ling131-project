California I don't want avenue and that's our governor I was living in San Francisco when he became a San Francisco and he does ruin that city\nAn eye you have a great Republican candidates out there John Cox she's a great businessman his his problem is simple math\nIt sort of like New York city although it's happened in New York City is even happened in New Jersey Chris Christie Christie Todd Whitman a man and then all the other occasions Tom Kaine is another example where Republicans were elected after Democrats make a mess\nI guarantee you that Cox could wind now that the sanctuary state of California wants to put up a sign and say free health care\nFor everybody in the world it's a sign you're basically our governor saying illegal legal doesn't matter resident non resident doesn't matter we're going to give you free health care\nNow if the average Californian is that is tax that Thirteen and a half percent statewide on income if you're OK with that good luck to you\nBecause it is unsustainable it will bankrupt your state there's my prediction but if people want to experiment with is that you know what what am I I'm not there to tell people\nCan't and I agree with you and they had on counted on it and the way the thinking gotta get out of California can't afford to pay taxes in the capital this\nYeah I mean it's unbelievable look why do you think there's a mass migration out of New York and New Jersey and Illinois to states like Florida Texas in the Carolinas wire Californians all going in Texas\nYou know what what are the Democrats on what they're hoping for that California demographic shift so that the people that ruin California and left might do the same thing a Texas\nSo unbelievable which is what the beta Rourke has been all about from the beginning\nAnyway do you know good luck um I Would say John Cox would be a great start and that was done in the world will tell you that on election night three ... three weeks from tonight will take

yards now\nPresident Trump's feud with Senator Elizabeth Warren is heating up the bay state Democrats called the president creepy on Twitter today after he said he wants to personally administer a DNA test to prove or Native American ancestry the President's Day the DNA test me is bogus\nIn earlier tweets the president said\nHe would only make good at an earlier one million dollar bed if he can test Warren personally in battle Fall River mayor ... says allegations against him are politically motivated in falls\nHe says the charges have nothing to do with his job as mayor and he reiterated today will not resign he was George last week and a Thirteen count federal indictment of fraud and filing false tax returns and the mega millions jak pop organized wrongs now up to an estimated six hundred sixty seven million dollars\nWith the cash often around three hundred eighty million dollars jak bombers last one in late July\nTonight we can expect ... to the mid forties and tomorrow mostly Sunni with ... into the low sixties with Boston's first News I'm ... twelve hundred\nMore body found in Florida and the ... hurricane Michael now blamed for at least twenty six task force states as a grim search continues and the devastated Florida Panhandle\nLocal police working off a list largely they have exhausted that list pending the notification they may be done with it but you still have task force number two out here it's working the map and they keep finding more people\nSo that people can tune in and literally see we've also put up an interactive map on Hannity dot com that people can use\nAnd you also see it Christian cinema is imploding out in Arizona project Vera tossed with the tape that they released a Claire McCaskill is devastating that she's hiding what she's running on the same happened to governor governor Bredesen and Tennessee\nHave Heidi Heitkamp was already down by double digits Joe Donnelly is in big trouble are we now see Heller was very important seed in Nevada he's now a by seven in the latest poll at least eight I'm really worried about right now is Florida and Rick Scott just has done an amazing job for the people of Florida\nWell yeah and then the hurricane obviously that that was devastating but but the response next to hurricanes I remember that benefit there in the last year where we're Scott has really shown if you remember showing the two thousand twelve election right here in Jersey uh that's where Hurricane Sandy hit and the President Obama had the advantage of acting like a commander in chief and going\nTo the devastation while Mitt Romney basically left helpless and they say that that hurricane may have tipped the scales back to Obama's member Romney at all the\nMomentum in the world are going into that storm so yeah look a Jim Messina who was speaking of President Obama two thousand twelve he was the campaign manager\nFor a strobe I'm at that time and he said yesterday said why did Senator Warren have to do her announcement with our DNA\nNow he goes why can't Democrats ever stay focused and I think this Elizabeth Warren revelation or lack there of will only hurt the party further because I don't see how you could ever say many media outlets by the way Shawn said that this was definitive proof right I'll give you literally the headlines\nA fence around her neck that she's Ninety six percent European I mean that that one one thousand doesn't twenty four she has perhaps maybe Native American ancestry of some type I mean but it is it\nHer she literally personally change ourselves to minority status when the U. Penn and then at Harvard that she was billed as the first minority female professor there a Native American heritage that the Cherokee Nation has spoken out and said this is just outrageous they're out there outrage by it\nRight and that was the turning point right when they when they came out and said this is wrong this is inappropriate this is a mockery then where are you going to say is attacking was with Warren is it still conservatives or does it actually Cherokee Nation but I mean that that the headlines yesterday\nAssociated Press Warren DNA shows I have Native American heritage a CNN Elizabeth Warren releases DNA tests with strong evidence of Native American ancestry ABC News Elizabeth Warren relief reveals\nProof of Native American ancestry again what proof at this so backfired on her ... nation got involved in and all the mockery that that ensued from there this is going to follow her I Know people think that she is a front runner\nBut the fact that she lied about our heritage to advance her career I could see the signs are already at Trump rallies in twenty twenty with one one thousand twenty four just written and that's it\nBecause now this defines her and this is not something you shake very easily and suddenly she's kind of morphed into Hillary Clinton where you can't really trust what she says and then on top of that she has no real economic message at outside of you didn't do that so\nYeah they're going to see who the Democrats settle on right away and and twenty twenty because I think the left wing of the party has taken over and that's not the way you'd be President Trump\nOne of the things that I've been pointing out I don't know if you had a chance to look at the center for American Progress and it was a group formed by none other than John Podesta but they're running their reelection now ... very\nRevealing the Maxine Waters says they keep telling me not to say it I keep saying I'm not a lot but I'm going to keep saying it anyway meaning impeach forty five\nSo they're hiding their agenda we learn that in this project ... with Claire McCaskill in her own words also\nBut now we know that they're being told directly not to talk about their immigration and all you know a sanctuary attacks pack up punch says the four page memorandum I'm like yeah OK and anyway the New York times or obtained a copy of it\nAnd Democrats in strategist they're prepared the memos that\nThe Democrat you spend as little time as possible ever talking about immigration itself pivot\nTo more fruitful issues like health care and taxation it's very difficult to win on immigration so nobody's talking about what they really are going to do their part Democrats too when they have to pretty much lie misrepresent\nCon be quiet about what it is they want to do how they're governed\nAnd and the types of agenda items they really have\nThat's not an enviable position to be I mean ... all the criticism Donald Trump takes he's pretty authentic he made promises and he keeps them\nThat's the thing I mean when you look at the record right everybody focuses on the rhetoric of the president too much right you look at the results and it's a completely different ballgame any president would kill to have a GDP above four percent unemployment below\nFour percent right there's something like seven point six million job openings that was that was reported by CNBC today I think in the country that's incredible we have Ninety eight percent of the ISIS caliphate\nEvaporated in Iraq and Syria when North Korea is no longer lobbing missiles over Japan threatening Guam and the United states these are all very substantial victories the trade deal he just did with Canada and Mexico I'm not sure leading here I'm Talking about the\nPillars of the presidency in terms of accomplishments Trump is winning right now you want with capital as well even that CNN did a\nSegment last week John Avalon where he says the president is on a winning streak and the polls are showing it he's back around forty four percent forty five percent among registered voters member that\n... was the most accurate and twenty sixteen has them at fifty one\nRight fifty one percent everything is trending upwards at the wrong time for Democrats when you go into the selection because to your point\nThey have no message like they had no message and twenty sixteen I don't know what Hillary Clinton's platform was outside of that guy is bad but for me so I can be the first woman president and I I Would say the same about Mitt Romney two thousand twelve I I think that I Can't remember what his platform was but I remember Joe Biden had bin Laden is dead and GM is alive that's easy to remember and it's\nA it was good enough right who was it will make America\nGreat again or keep America great again the Trump could run on his record\nAnd Democrats just go with personal attacks like they have a it it's going to be a long long election you know you're going to hear about how Trump some trouble like it did in two thousand sixteen but\nAgain a in till they have a message in ... Michigan Pennsylvania Wisconsin to win over those voters that see jobs coming back and companies coming back I unless they put up a centrist fiery centrist candidate to have a lot of problems on\nThe one poll that shocks me the most the latest one out of Wisconsin had Scott Walker who I think that a phenomenal job in the state of Wisconsin and now\nHe's always had notoriously close elections he's always had all of these groups and millions and millions of dollars pouring in from outside of Wisconsin that he's had to deal with I'm not sure if the polls accurate but it has him down and that surprises me\nBut I think especially when you look at the Senate I I could see the Republicans again with three weeks away I don't have a crystal ball I always tell everybody play like you're behind and you're losing and you got you got to make up ground than anything can happen between now and election day and Twenty one days but\nYou know I don't see Heidi Heitkamp making a recovery I think a Christian seminar is falling apart in Arizona I see a surge of just the right time for Dean Heller in Nevada which will help him\nUm I I look at the other races Donnelly now is beginning to fall back in Indiana Marsha Blackburn is emerging in Tennessee thank goodness Claire McCaskill I Believe this tape is absolutely going to help to feed her or if the people in Missouri if this was widely disseminated 'cause it's outrageous\nAnd the only Democrat that might be safe at this point seems to be Joe mansion in the Senate yeah\nAnd and the Senate in order to win that back you had to go through this narrow paths if you're a Democrat through Arizona red state Texas Red state Tennessee read stand\nBeside the way up I'm going to he's up by eight in the latest poll I'm actually going to be down during a town hall with him this weekend around the Houston area I'll I'll give up that announcement later in the week\nOh there you go yeah and and remember better or got more money than any cat and my gosh are eight million dollars and he's tattered already has a twenty twenty presidential candidate you know\nI I think we'll probably be twenty to twenty five candidates and that's not an exaggeration because Republicans and Eighteen but yeah that would have been a very big symbolic victory of ... unseated cruise but that's going in the right direction for Cruz as well so\nThe Senate you gotta think they're probably going to pick up three or four seats and now I Would have told you two months ago and like I don't see how Democrats don't win twenty three seats to win back the house and given the history Eighteen in the last twenty midterms I have got against the party in power by an average of something like thirty three seats a bottle of sixty three seats in two thousand ten\nSo I was thinking you know I ... I Can't see that not happening now I I think it's a toss up it's fifty fifty that the Republicans keep the house and if that happens\nAfter all this negative press that President Trump has received Republicans have received to overcome that and keep all three branches oh my goodness\nBut I Will tell you I think back then you have two things the fact that they have no agenda\nIs part of it the second thing is is that they're catering to a mob mentality\nAnd we saw that in the cabin on hearings and we've seen a post Kavanaugh hearings and you know when you say as Maxine Waters did about cabinet members and high ranking officials in our government you create a crowd and you you follow them into department stores and gas stations in grocery stores and you tell them\nThey're ... they're not wanted here anymore anywhere anymore I'm like that's the party because I say\nFor a media perspective it's funny because then you have even some anchors on CNN that are saying you know the people that chased Ted Cruz and his wife out of a Washington restaurant right they're not a mob and you can't say the word\nSix yards and still to sell bunch [noise]\nThanks boys and girls you can listen to new an archived episodes of the only foreign how's your show on the ice heart radio our diocese Rapaport\nHurricane Michael now blamed for sixteen Destin, Florida Fox's my Tobin reporting from the hard hit town of Mexico beach\nPolice she was working off a list of people on a counter born as of yesterday said there was only one person on accounted for well today they found a body sadly a ... and the police was pending notification getting ready to say that the list of those unaccounted for was exhausted Michael\nMade landfall as a category ... storm killing at least twenty six people in four states Wall Street rebounding from last week's big sell off\nWithout a doubt jail average five hundred and forty seven point the twenty five thousand seven I got I got up nine twenty eight o nine and ... and I'm Wondering fourteen point from Seventy six forty five in fact all three of the major averages out more than ... percent with the math I guess the best in the bunch up two point nine percent\nThe Fox business networks Nicole ... at the New York stock exchange this is Fox News [noise]\nOn it one thousand dollars now\nThe key word or two hundred two hundred you'll get attacked confirming in three plus I hard\nRadio info standard data and Mrs resupply that's luck to two hundred two hundred\nAnd ten or ... ... ... people forced me to honesty I'm Sorry you had to live that way through doesn't affect my life and compassion if he wants to identify says\nTo my children [noise] something that is in\nStock twelve hundred talks will\nAgree that free the but it feels like Chris ... fall out there with lots of sunshine tomorrow that will be the case but there is they were looking at forty five degrees that are highly sent\nThis report is brought you buy compassion international you can't change the whole world but you can't be part of the change in the world for a child living in poverty by becoming a compassion international travel sponsored you can choose a child to sponsor now with compassion dot com slash radio vets compassion dot com slash radio\n[noise] the unemployment rate is that a forty year low most people\nThat want to work are working if you're trying to fill open positions that your business you'll have to find your next candidate from the currently employed I heart media can help you spread the word to Ninety two percent of the U.S population that's right Ninety two percent use this radio station defined your next employee driving to or sitting at\nTheir current job you'll have your pick of the most qualified candidates for any position you have available we can help to go to I heart works dot com that's I hard work dot com\nI times the most iconic brand into booming canon based industry just went public joined me I peeled now pie time investor dot com dome is your chance to be part of his Purina making busy at high time investor dot com Ben lifetimes investor dot com\nHigh times holding corps operate will be made only by means of offering circular which has been found with unqualified by the U.S securities Exchange Commission the security's are highly speculative investing and shares a kind of ...

Amy on TV you hear me on the radio I mean I Can't just we don't write lines for this program we just talk and you know unless I guess your super con artist I don't think it's you're capable people can ascertain\nWho you really are especially that's why they call radio awards to medium\nThat you're exactly right you're exactly right look shutting the reason that ... that was known your program yet they fight a ... delivery Clinton's speech in in in that she mentioned the fact that the only way we're going to return to civility\nIn this country is to elect Democrats and then when I heard it down don't make that extortion chief telling us telling the American people\n[noise] the only way you don't have any peace\nImpressed shut up shut up if Democrats [noise]\nThat's pretty you know that's one way to put it but you gotta understand\nSince the day Donald Trump won\nLeft in this country those quote resistance in this country now\nThat now emerging into a mob in some cities in this country and confronting you know the attorney general's like Pam Bondi or secretary of homeland security Nielsen or Sarah Sanders or Ted Cruz and his wife piety or\nYou know Mitch McConnell and then then of course you know putting their anarchist symbols on the GOP headquarters in New York City et cetera all of this\nIt's a pre member Maxine Waters set it if you see them get a crowd get a crowd and you confront them and you follow them into department stores in gas stations and and restaurants and you\nTell them you know wanted anywhere anymore okay\nWell that sounds like you\nWant something bad to happen and the fact that the Democrats\nAre now the strategy is to hide who they are\nBe honest lie we see it in the project baritone videos or ... it is it they're not telling Maxine Waters Ted said they keep telling me not to say it\nThen you read the center for American Progress don't talk about immigration because if you're ... you're not going to win with by telling people the truth about what you believe\nIt's it's sad that this is what it takes for them to win it's sad that Hillary Clinton had the cheap Bernie Sanders to get the nomination and that she tried to use the phony Russian tough the a ... and then had all of our deep stay friends lying to the American people with\nUnverified uncorroborated Russian bought and paid for lives there is this who they are there's nothing that they're running on that tells me oh if you elect us we're going to create jobs by doing this\nWhat Trump said how we create jobs by giving us the largest tax cut and eliminating burdensome regulation and opening up bad wire and building pipelines and saving the coal industry those are saving jobs\nSo you know the ... look it's I'm I'm just telling everybody three weeks from tonight you're going to turn on your TV set\nAnd you're gonna watch the coverage and you're either going to be you know maybe maybe it'll be a mixed bag maybe the Republicans gained ... seats in the Senate when maybe they lose the house you lose the house\nThen all you're gonna see for two years is never ending non stop obsessive compulsive Trump paint and investigations and possible impeachment that's the agenda that's\nIt there's nothing to improve the lives of the American people ... know that there was a lot at stake\n[noise] the Democrats rely on people of low information they rely on propaganda and
