Ramirez the New York times wouldn't even public publish it because they discovered nobody that corroborate her story number one\nNumber two or own words that she was ... they'd quickly had gaps in her memory and the fact that we now know that you know so many different things that we didn't know before\nAnd that Mr ... was actually out there soliciting information from her fellow yo classmates the New York times reported that because she quote couldn't remember\nThen in the case of Julie sweat Nick we saw her backtrack dramatically from her original story and her claim that judge Kavanaugh was a serial\nDrug or and rapist of teenage girls will give me the evidence and cooperation to any of these women story that's what I Want from you Danielle and don't duck and don't dodging don't hem and haw that I'm asking a tough question give me any cooperation you have\nI don't hit the cooperation because I'm not do it and I'm not the one who was investigating that's right and we talked about this last week\nWait a minute but everybody's talking and\nIt was a full and fair investigation get married at twenty cooperating witnesses to the I didn't know and if I had to\nUse I mean every main person that was mentioned in the case of professor Ford and the case of missed for me or as the New York times tried to corroborated they spent an entire week interviewed dozens of people and then she herself was calling around to other yell classmate saying I don't I don't remember do you remember I'm not sure if\nIt was him that exposed himself and then we all watched Julie sweat Nick alter shift and backtrack from her original allegation which was gang raping and systematic drug gang of women so you have any cooperation for any of these incidents at all\nI'm not saying that I don't expect that you would expect that I did\nI mean all you're following you can't find any cooperation either can you as a matter of fact we're getting just the opposite of corroboration people are saying those they don't recall those stories at all that it or that to happen that way at all\nSo the charges are college or in that scene on at the last twenty four hours at looking about ah the judges drinking oughta honestly I I think this is horrendous for shy and the idea\nOf not answering my question I'm asking you if the people make serious claims allegations on a serious real topic because there are real evil horrible ... predators in this world\nAnd they mentioned that there are specific people have you interview them that they're going to tell you my story is true and it turns out to be the opposite don't you believe in the presumption of innocence Danielle McLaughlin yes or no\nOf course I Do short timeline get something\nOf course I Believe in the ... and the and the presumption of innocence but also believe that the FBI should've been allowed to do a full and fair and ... and that is why you're going to see on the left a huge outcry and I understand that this is energizing the geology hey\nI'm not talking point what hang on a second\nI Want you interview looking in the case of professor Ford the four people she identified were at the party and none of the four have any recollection of the event and the one eye witness says it didn't happen\nWhat else are they supposed to do with this we don't know where it happened we don't know when it happened we don't know the location she doesn't know how she got there I got home from their what else did the FBI to do they had already given sworn statements under the penalty of a felony\nAnd all they did is reiterate those statements that the FBI what else could they possibly do Danielle in that case\nAnd being on the opposite side of the nation at the FBI just\nDidn't know what else can they certainly do knowing the facts as we know that we don't know where we don't know when we don't know huh\nOK okay she thinks the fact that she doesn't run into wearing out where and when exactly it's not necessarily\nDon't you know you're you're trying to what you're trying to\nChange it look follow the bounds of the ... if there's four people that were eyewitnesses but we don't know where we don't know when we don't know how she got there we don't know how she got home we don't even know the house which you mentioned four people were there they for people under penalty of felony all said that didn't happen the way she

of my life in Arizona where my family's still it and I'm I'm actually a distant relative of Jeff Flake and I do think he is a decent man and I think he had\nA good heart but I really feel like he's getting late here by the Democrats and the left and I just really really hope that uh but you'll make the right decision tomorrow or Saturday challenge\nSounds like after his comments today that that's more likely but uh it just you know I I Know there's a reason he's not running for reelection and it's just hard to see a see good people leave to Washington and come back a few years later and not be able to really recognize them and I feel like that happened with McCain I feel like that's kind of happening with just as well\nI think the most shocking statement that he may was on sixty minutes when he when he actually admitted\nWhen asked if he would be voting this way if he had to face the voters here in Seoul hopefully not [laughter] I'm and I'm like oh so you're you're only stand on your principles when\nWhen you have to face the voters but that's not how you really feel it really sums up how I view a lot of politicians you know I\nI just look at a guy that can't doesn't know was old mind at times and doesn't right\nNow is the\nSame guy that wanted to be on the survivor show and you know ... you don't look at him and uh you'll find that funny Sean but we were actually

that yesterday on my record with really\nNo there is a snowflake Arizona senator Snowe for like\nUm I Hope it goes the right thing if any Republican senator now especially Murkowski Collins flake after they they got what they wanted they got their delayed they got the FBI weighing in\nA Joe Biden said it would not going to offer recommendations and they're not going to offer opinions here\nAnd all they're going to do is give you a straight data and that's what it was given and everybody seems pleased by that his comments Susan Collins comments seemed to satisfy them no corroboration of any of these claims as we've been claiming\nAnd as we've been telling you and so the allegations have been problematic from the start you know assuming assuming for a second here judge Kavanaugh where to get confirmed we we have got to have a deep analysis\nIn this country over where we want to go forward in terms of going forward because if we allow this to happen to good people\nIt it's it is so it's so dark um I was having a conversation with a friend of mine is religious and we were discussing you know look at the ten commandments why is one of the ten commandments\n... shall not bear falls witness against the neighbor because it's devastating for the rest of Brett Kavanaugh's life\nPeople know that this is what he's been accused of and yet in spite of the fact there's been no corroboration shifting stories and a media hysteria that's ... that's why to the extent that people can literally destroy other people with a new window falls uncorroborated\nClaims a shocking to me they did it to Robert Bork they did it to Clarence Thomas they've been doing it to Brett Kavanaugh they do it to Republicans conservatives every two and four years they're racist or sexist\nThey want grandma to die all these things that they've come out as a matter of of course because that's their play book I don't know\nI um I I some house at some point we may need to examine libel laws at some
