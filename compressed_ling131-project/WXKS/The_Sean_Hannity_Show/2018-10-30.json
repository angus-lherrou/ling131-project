I'll talk twelve hundred\nA mid term distraction I mean ... that's how some opponents describe what President Trump is considering an executive order to end the citizenship policy it's based on the fourteenth amendment to the constitution\nA congressional candidates in very important districts it's interesting all up there are four hundred and thirty five so they're all important\nEvery ... every one of you listening to my vote I don't care if you think your congressman as safe or not you better get out and vote\nBecause otherwise if you don't vote that's pretty much a vote for Nancy Pelosi and if you have a Senate race going on in your state that's vote for Chuck Schumer\nThe second potential outcome is a split decision\nSplit decision would be Republicans hang on to the Senate gain a couple seats and Nancy Pelosi them become speaker\nAnd Maxine Waters is a chairwoman Adam Schiff is a chairwoman and let's say Gerald ... chairman analyze your Cummings that chairman and it's endless investigations\nInto one of the most unbelievable things that we're watching unfold here\nIs what we got this desperation factor of the Democrats I mean even when I think even when I warn you of what they do every two and four years racist or sexist besides your nose Gina phobic Islamic phobic homophobic you know dirty air dirty water kill children throw granny over the cliff\nJust when you think it can't get worse it gets worse\nAnd the echo chamber if you've ever doubted ever doubted who the media in this country is pulling for just just watch any so called cable news channel besides Fox for thirty seconds\nIt's every second every minute of every day hate Trump destroy Trump help the Democrats and if it means falsely accusing the president of being responsible for the synagogue shooting over the weekend\nAnd not even tell the people there viewers that well the shooter this mad man power hated Trump because of Trump being so allied and good partners with our closest ally Israel\nAnd the same people you know saying Trump cause this Trump's responsible for this you know it's a it's it's a sense of man this but it also does show\nA desperation that has now kicked in for the Democratic party they are desperate\nYou know one thing I I think I'm going to talk about pose a little bit in the course of the program today but I'm also on the other hand seems like I'm Talking to both sides of my face I'm really not\nI'm I'm gonna tell you to just ignore the polls at this point doesn't matter you still have a job to do and if you want to to keep the progress that we've had you want to prevent hearing the night of one week from tonight\nAnd one day after one week from tomorrow when we talk about the results if you don't want to hear the word speaker elect Pelosi Senate majority elects sure then you're going to have to do something about it\nThe worst case scenario is they can win at all and the only way that's going to happen is if you stay home\nThat the reason I'll tell you not to pay attention to the polls is because they get it wrong so often\nJust two years ago the exit polls showed that Trump lost Florida he won it last North Carolina he won it that he had lost Ohio he won Ohio that he lost Pennsylvania He won Pennsylvania that he lost Michigan in Wisconsin and he won both of them\nAnd the media nobody there weren't you candy because they read these results as I was on the air at five Fifteen I had it before everybody else\nI remember my first break at at the about twenty after the hour I called then candidate Donald Trump and I said somebody's going to come in in about a minute with bad news and tell you that you lost everything don't believe it\nI said I don't believe these polls I said there's no way these polls are accurate\nAnd he goes why do you believe that and then I told them the story about two thousand and four with the media again the polls came back and George Bush and Dick Cheney and lost Florida Ohio Pennsylvania and it was over\nAnd Dick Cheney called the radio program this radio program at you know on election day two thousand and four or five thirty five and reminded people they still had time to vote because he read the same information that I just read that John Kerry was going to be the next president\nYou know if you go back and you know other polls where they've been wrong twenty fourteen you know let's go back with the election one week away it's coming down to the wire conventional wisdom is Republicans will pick up a few seats in the house or in the Senate but lose the house by a painfully slim margin\nOne of the reasons is look if you look at real clear politics that's based on polling polling is not totally inaccurate information there's some things you can glean from polling that are\nAnecdotal maybe the way to put it helpful in other ways right now real clear politics has the Democrats are two hundred and five seats locked solid\nOr leaning Democrat and it has leaning Republican lock solid Republican two hundred that's a five seed difference but because Republicans have the majority\nOf ah right now that means that they have more seats they have to defend his like thirty seats that they called toss ups that can swing one way or the other we've identified these we put them up on Hannity dot com you can check it out for yourself\nAnd the only thing that can make a difference as if you want the progress of the last two years to continue\nYou get to decide how you're going to feel a week from tonight I mean when the if you watch called back the media in twenty sixteen this five Fifteen they were getting\nWell it's pretty clear Hillary I think there's going to bring on our presidents Frank Luntz who's reporting from Times Square at six Fifteen and I'm watching him it's over Trump lost it ain't happening turned out not to be true it turned out the polls were wrong and I'm not criticizing Frank he was reading the polling data\nI had read the same data\nSo if you don't have the sense of urgency I don't know what I can say or do to give it to you but the media is all in on helping the Democrats get back the house and the Senate and they're doing everything within their power to make that happen\nBecause they've handed Trump since the day walk down the escalator with millennia\nI think it's worth noting now that conventional wisdom does not exactly have a stellar track record this is where I urge you to be cautious about the polls and don't let the polls influence\nYour motivation here but it's not only were they wrong and twenty sixteen they also wrong in two thousand and four they were way off in the last midterm election remember Republicans were even saying oh because Ted Cruz's fellow buster oh we're going to get cleaned out in the Senate that didn't happen\nOne year before the twenty fourteen midterms the media insisted the GOP hopes to recapture\nThe Senate were dead on arrival because in October Ted Cruz had filibustered Obamacare and shut the get government down for sixteen days good for him makes me like Ted Cruz more\nExperts such a short us a hundred percent certainty in twenty forty Republicans are going to pay huge price when the twenty fourteen midterms rolled around Thirteen months later the geo ... not only won back the Senate they did it with a nine state Senate landslide\nNow remembers the night went on in twenty sixteen media was kinda Getty but then that getting this began to give away to a little bit of a little bit of nervousness I think we got it still but ah yeah get a little tighter than we thought isn't it\nAnd then I turned into what all out melt down depression collectively by the media and they couldn't believe it because you we the people shocked the world all that but an old for it's happened and fourteen and it happened in sixteen no reason it can happen in a tea\nYou should do it for no other reason because you want to keep America on the great growth growth trajectory we're on and maybe for another reason to watch these idiots in the mainstream media these sanctimonious\nA self righteous they're not news people advocates that they are the extension of the Democratic party they're going to lose it\nIf the house remains in Republican hands and Republicans picked up a number of Senate seats they will lose it just like they did in twenty six he this is a this is all white latch CNN was reporting that night\nAnyway the so called experts saw the Republican landslide coming that none of them thought in twenty fourteen no very few of us saw that we could wait\nI'll give you a deep let's go to twenty fourteen final Wall Street journal NBC News survey before balloting and twenty fourteen had forty six percent of likely voters favor Congress led by Republicans forty five prefer democratic control\nKind of similar where they are now the G O P claim they similar one point advantage lead\nIn ten states where Senate races where the most competitive with a balance of power in the chamber would be decided those results suggested narrower advantage for Republicans in in the latest mid term\nAnd you know still they claimed oh Republicans pick\nUp nine seats that's a hell of a field goal they were saying they might they might well twenty ten was kind of a two touchdown embarrassing loss for Democrats this is more

cross and read the text message to you know apparently\nIt's now out there many you know people in in South Florida apparently are pretty angry at this remark and er which seems pretty anti Semitic to me as he's standing by this\nBook I think it's reprehensible Andrew get one picked this guy knowing\nThat he had done that but here's the thing about Andrew Gillum he is aligned himself with some of the most anti Israel and anti Semitic groups in Florida including this radical group called the dream defenders which is a leader and the boycott divest and sanctioned movement\nTargeting Israel they actually say Israel the genocidal apartheid state and so that's one of the Andrew strongest supporters Andrew\nTo this day of poses having our embassy in Jerusalem he opposes recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital\nAnd when a Israel fought back against the Moffett fats and may ah Gillum blamed Israel he said oh they just use those attack as a pre K to be able to do a disproportionate response to\nWhat what is that really ... organization that he won't disavow\nThey're one of the most radical organizations in Florida uh they they believe that the police and prisons have no place in justice and that the police needs to be the funded they paid they said to us as the biggest bully in the history of the world that our military needs to be caught\nThey if they favor replacing what they consider disaster capitalism is their words with socialist principles that are so radical make Nicolas Maduro flush\nSo he signed their candidate alleged gang that he would support a this radical manifesto so that's just who he is he believes in what they're doing is endorsed them personally and uh it would\nLose a tape of him I guess that was discovered in June and saying that he's pleased I'm proud to sneak food to dream\nDefender activists during a thirty day sleep in protest that the Florida State Capitol referring to the twenty Thirteen month long anti gun protest or after the Trayvon Martin George Zimmerman case and I hope you keep at it and he supported them but you're saying that there are radical group\nWithout question I mean they they are in the law enforcement they're\nAnti free enterprise they're anti military um they're anti Israel uh I don't know I mean like that may be a group you would want to be aligned with if you are running for the mayor of the Gaza Strip but not for governor of Florida\nWow well let's go over a little bit of his his background and the proposals that he's making but he's I think it's fairly extreme\nA number one he was endorsed by Bernie Sanders that speaks volumes to me there's a lot of outside money uh reports that he's getting money from the left wing billionaires like George Soros the George Soros really spend one point two million in this race in Florida to help him\nOh yeah I'm probably much more than that at this point now\nHe says that he supports Medicare for all I Am a champion of treaty health care and as a right not a privilege so he wants what nationalized healthcare\n... the bill he supports what abolish Medicare and Medicare Advantage for seniors enforce them on a single payer\nGovernment planned it would eliminate everybody's employer based coverage and force them on a government single plan so it's really a fan the arrangements have millions and millions of Floridian that he thinks it's appropriate for government to take away health benefits that people have burned into force them to be on the single payer plan I think that'd be a disaster\nHe wants to raise the corporate tax rate forty percent of forty percent increase ... what's that going to what's the impact that is going to have on Florida businesses and Florida workers if the businesses pack up and leave\nWe will lose jobs we will lose business says and we're also I mean you know shock because everyone who works and high tax states\nThey're always thinking about relocating to Florida and we have a historic opportunity to really capitalize on that when I'm governor buddy Andrew has his way he'll stop the flow of investment coming into Florida because people are going to invest if you have the highest tax rate in the south east and actually he would raise it to be higher than New York\nYeah and he also was the first democratic candidate Nash nationwide I read to call for the abolish meant a vice is that true\nHe supports abolishing ice and impeaching President Trump\nAnd he wants to eliminate Florida's Stand your ground law\nYes he wants to impose on law abiding Floridians a duty to retreat so somebody up a criminal is attacking you you have to run and try to hide rather than fight back you\nAlso support legalizing drugs in Florida like marijuana and others yes he does\nWell I mean you're just looks like he is Bernie Sanders on steroids down there I mean I've got to believe with this controversial background that looks like a almost a phenomenon that the media's just pushing for him and pushing for him\nAnd you know his record I only spent about a half hour and I was able to dig it up it wasn't that hard to find and it seems like most of the media is ignoring who he really is\nOh without question I mean the day he won the primary particularly the national media you know they've tried to elevate him and try to make him into this great candidate\nA they do not like to scrutinize his record uh the fact that those documents bad release after he lied and the debate last Sunday or the media kind of had to cover that buy at the end of the day\nHe has been given very kid glove treatment so really falls to me and other folks to go out and make the case and let people know and the good news is just one Floridians figure that out or they definitely don't want him as their governor and so we're going to keep making the case for the next week\nI'm worried about our friends not only the recovery uh uh thoughts and prayers go to all our friends in the panhandle\nUm but but the panhandle to so many people whose lives have been up ended and disrupted and some people losing pretty much everything they own and they now moved out the panhandle happens to be one of the most conservative areas of Florida are you concerned that people from\nThe panhandle of going to be able to get their hands on a ballad maps and tea or otherwise would maybe be part of early voting is Florida doing anything to assist in and help those people that have been displaced would want to vote in this election because Florida is their home\nThey're doing a lot ah everything from mobile voting sites to\nA combination traps in the ballot you know the bad news as as you said it was a terrific stormed the good news is I think all but about Fifteen thousand homes are going to have power by the weekend a which we weren't sure could happen that quickly um and I know the rest of the folks there is a combination is being made so\nAre they are resilient people are in the Panama City area um and I know a lot of them do want to vote and so they'll have the opportunity to do it\nYeah I'm a ... the devastation once again to the people there how long do you look at rebuilding not part of Florida and some people I looked like a tornado would wiped it out\nYeah lugging I mean it it's going to take time obviously with me coming in as governor I'm gonna have to deal with it and take off where request off I Will say though um had that gone forty miles west of the population would have been much bigger\nI'm so there is damage and its extensive damage but I think can damage in a relatively limited area is there's a couple of areas that got hit pretty good so we know what we got to do and I think we'll be able to go in and do what we are the president has committed to doing any repairs necessary for ten do air force base\nIran is an important not active duty ... so I'm really pleased that that is going to be fixed\nI got to take a quick break we'll come back more with
