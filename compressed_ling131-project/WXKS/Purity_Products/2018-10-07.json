being able to testify for a week right allegedly on the grounds that Dr Ford because of her trauma was afraid to fly well that just went out the window so that's a pretty big why\nDo you ever given him a committee would go to her that they would so the whole thing was is just a sham she doesn't know when it happened what year it happened how many people were there were the house was what the neighborhood was who ... sided than\nI have all refuted it they didn't know he did not have been reviewed and would you say you're in colder no more Mr White guy I'm going to I'm going to post a link to this too that maybe the her latest book is resistance is futile have the drone hitting left last has lost its collective mind and we're lawyer are we seeing that with\nCattle and we really are in and I got to tell you I don't know\nI'm I'm kind of dumb in a mostly white although my skin is much more Italian all of a but I'm a white guy and I'm watching it and Ford is white and\nBlue sweat Nick is white and there are white men on the left that we're asking questions and they were really mad\nAnd the blue and voted lawyers face off he was really mad at 'em all these people everybody involved with stories white except for Deborah Ramirez and we can argue about whether Hispanics you're white or black or would the races but this is not this has never been about race he'd wanted to go there\nUm it's but this has has been a cliche for some time I'm I've been noticing this Hillary you probably don't remember this but in one of her slams of Trump during the campaign she said something to the effect of um he has an odd fondness for whites\nAutocrats I Do remember that no I yeah so okay\nCast your mind once again we're going to think about actual factor cast your mind over the world and think of where there are dictators autocrats or something like that it may have been white authoritarian\nRulers well I I think I'd start with the entire continent of Africa I Would move my way up to the middle east we\nWould get lots of autocrats authoritarian rulers in in in the far east\nUm I guess she's talking about who and who was the only white autocrats I can think of he's not exactly style one he's even Khrushchev right but she throws and that's one thing people like me started to notice oh my gosh white is just\nIt's the way Hannity uses the word literally it's an intense a fire and has no actual meaning other than um\nIt's really bad why\nIt's so bad because of his white news is getting colder no more Mr White guy ... you cite a bunch of these quotes from from the idiots on the left the media you've got to understand they have all these white men would be questioning Islam and the next one is women across the nation should be outraged that\nWhite men senators are doing this to a woman there's been some discussion but ... what happened to be all white men I mean I\nI don't I don't understand why there's so much anger against white men and so much guilty in white men themselves that this crap works in\nA it doesn't work on may nor me and I as I Am I'm slowly dude\nIt's um it's very strange and I also take issue I mean I at least understand the logic of saying it should be women\nWomen understand massage any and that should be a panel of women questioning and alleged sexual assault um accuser\nUm but the last time um that I can remember where I'm somebody one big for don't worry women understand massage any and end violence against women wasn't when they pick the OJ jury\nRight because I remember that was Marsha Clark big idea\nI'm black white I don't care as long as they're women they will bond with with um what's her name I'm Nick Nicole Brown Simpson right um didn't work out for oh no oh I guess the jury didn't see the point so I think it's idiotic to say that only women should they\nShould be questioning that actually don't you have all these rape laws as Janine bureau said right bless her soul she said you know for years I've been prosecuting sex crimes\nCases and I was prosecuting them under laws written by white men I mean I did feel\nWhen he wrote about America he wrote about how the ... the crime of rape\nIn ... in contrast to even you know other European countries which was what he was familiar with the crime rate is so much more serious in America than anyplace else it is just barely seconds to murder this is what the respect for women in this new country is ...\nUm and it has always been ... wow American women don't know what they're asking for if they want you to throw over the the white male patriarchy because the white male patriarchy has been pretty terrific for women\nKnow it really has been it's been cold during the name of the book is resistance as you do have a trope hitting left last is collective mind she's written this article no more Mr White guy you're just back to the OJ trial for a second you have to give the the the jurors a pass and you see the blood evidence always showed that the that the kids will be being him or seven billion to one\nSo there's a chance it wasn't him go through on\nThe bottom line is and I'm going to ask you about this before we run out of time I could ask you about Jeff Flake or if you're in charge of this committee why is he still bitter when he says I'm not running for reelection when he says that I'm Out of your what do you mix all this noise about how Trump is horrible and the director of the country is bad why is that guy that we\nStill want to be a limit on the Judiciary Committee do you have any clue\nThat's a really great point Republicans do not think seeing these things out strategically Republicans are used to being over just going to you know the gentleman we're not going to say\nI'm strategize um and and and look I Love 'em this week but don't get too high on Lindsey Graham run he's the sort of Republican and takes the position well if I keep voting for Democrat nominees just even though I Know they're going to be total disasters on the court maybe maybe Democrats will reward my\nGood they never happened never\nMade it looks to me you know you got to start thinking about this and advance guys\nRuth Bader Ginsburg Ninety six to three she was confirmed\nThink about that how radically left you use and you write these people like Lindsey Graham and in the late John McCain's vote that they were going to get paid back the pay back to screw you were not going to allow you to do it and it happens every single time it's colder get the book resistance as you tell how the Trump hitting left\nLost its collective mind last question does he get confirmed or not because there was that about him being rapists any more about him being an angry drunk\nAnd ...\nExactly right and he's older than I used to be with somebody in\nA bureau holiday would go with anything that is so obvious that this is unfair I mean I Can't think about anything else I I I'm outside I get splashed with a puzzle and I think I was just going to affect cabinet\nI wake up and this must be how um you know Hillary\nSupporters felt the day after the like our side is not going to let Republicans given this time I tend to say yes I think he will be
