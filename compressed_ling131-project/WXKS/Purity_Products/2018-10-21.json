Senate he was the governor is the governor no and I ... the Democrat nominee for governor who's a far left wing socialist a run I appreciate you how're you\nDoing good how are you\nDoing I'm living the dream in really glad to have your own it would be a it would be bad of me to not start we're the most important story of foreigners happening and that's Panama City in that area I Know that you've been there are a lot you've been you've been monitoring what's going on you been talking to people throw my listeners and viewers in on on what you see there and how things are going\nWell they really got well I mean we thought I'm born and raised in law that we've seen a lot on by the end\nYou know you're at home better Ninety to buy the worst damage I mean I turned to Panama Sandy in terms of Mexico beach in feminine Dario so I'm a I'm a bell servants rising was totally out um they're starting to get power back off\n\nOn a structural damage because you had basically about category by\nUm I talked to some of the Arabs they're um they're actually progress thing about how to schedule which is good I think uh\nYou know one of the threat neighboring counties golf county are going to have their power on by the way it's supposed to be back on which I thought was going to take another week or two but you know there's just certain amount of damage and we're going to have a you know\nEach secondary obviously we're talking around to see it as former congressman he's a Republican running for governor of ... um this is secondary of course but I've heard reports that I've seen reports I've read reports that voting might be an issue it might be not as easy to vote because a lot of the places that are traditional polling places in that region of the Gulf Coast\nUm are going to be out is that getting to handle a jacket and taking care of who's working on\nIt is so there's a the governor's working on that some of the local folks I think what you're going to see is they'll probably be extraordinary accommodations or the people that were displaced\nOr just for the people who are still in the county but I think you're looking at having additional polling location\nAnd then I think there's going to be a consideration for if\nYou are display or\nYou can vote and other county or your vocal silk out so I think they're working on that and by that that that's something that's doable and I think that they will look I mean you know a lot of these\nFolks um uh you know are not necessarily\nThinking about voting on the first thing on their mind but at the same time these are resilient people I don't you know the people in Bay county I mean they're so they're very stiff minded so I think a lot of them are even though they got a lot of this\nDebt to deal with I think they will appreciate having the opportunity to cast a vote\nIs a Republican Ron deceived is running for governor race beat a former rung you may or may not notice I've got several stations from Canada very highly rated in South Florida which is where I grew up I'm I'm I grew up in South Florida was there for Twenty one years and I love to go back all the time my mom was there my sisters are there and I thought I understood the politics of the area\nAre clearly don't there's there is a sea change that happening since I moved away that I didn't see common and and the southern ... about his very heavily populated is is having a fight whether it's center right or center left but of a lot of like the school districts and school boards and a lot of the sheriff's officers do lean\nOf how much of a challenge is it for you to get any any movement in the southern part of the state which is so populated or to understand that your your your conservative guard that believes in traditional American values that and that's a good thing for Florida\nWell look we're getting we're getting contracts and I mean I think if you look at South Florida and for the Miami Dade County\nHuge energy with Cuban Americans\nUm other Hispanic Venezuelans and the Nicaraguan to understand the dangers of socialism\nThey don't want to see socialism in Florida they know it didn't work in their home country or we also have a very significant contrast which usually doesn't work this way in Florida politics but you know I'm One of the leading a pro Israel leaders in the country that had been in the Congress\nGillum and hostile to Israel I mean he uh is endorsed by a group that dream defenders which is prominent into bbs movement against Israel they say Israel to genocidal apartheid state I led the effort to move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem I think that was a great that you get one last hosted\nGillum opposes having our embassy in Jerusalem he opposes recognizing Jerusalem in Israel\nOr turn on indivisible capital so when you look at some of the voters who that is something that they are concerned about uh we have an opportunity to make some headway in areas that may be a Republican wouldn't 'cause the Democrat\nEven though their party has drifted more and more in Israel and Florida they usually nominate somebody who's pro Israel but they didn't they find they nominated Andrew Gillum who's really align with the radical left a which\nIs really a very hostile to Israel now\nHe's in he's like he's really he's also into our freedom and liberty he's also pro taxation and it'd be government he's also pro abortion me the guy's a socialist he wants Medicare for all we can get into all the problems with him but I think that it's it's even more beneficial to talk about the positives that you bring to the table\nYou know it's interesting to me run in in I live in southern Texas now so I grew up around Hispanics I now live in a place where it's a predominantly Hispanic\nOr I've never met a Hispanic person who generally speaking is Catholic or Christian who is some far left is loon why is it that the Democrats have always been able to count on that Hispanic vote and would have guys like you and me how to do to let them know that we are on their side\nWhy I don't know that day that they have always been able to I think that the Hispanic voters not monolithic I mean in Florida you know we have a lot of conservative Hispanics than in South Florida", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Purity Products", "city": "Newton", "day": "21"}
