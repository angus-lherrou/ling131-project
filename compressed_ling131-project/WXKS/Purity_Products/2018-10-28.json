... he's going to be the bottom of next dollar use the executive director of the the regular Institute out in California great conversation comparing the media and how we treated Reagan and how he acted back to them with how\nThe current president President Trump is acting toward the media also ... will be off the top of the hour yup the former communications director for president Donald Trump what the hell out of marriage only on the job for a living days will have bad for you to write none of the phone lines delivers the old welcome to outline one each Lisa in California I Lisa\nHi how are you living the dream which I Would have\nJust calling um I actually ties into what the last caller was talking about um went shooting how how would you get that\nChurches typically forget I mean there are a whole nother story in the movie theaters and other other churches ... how would you get at a church\nTake action to sort out the bad guys from the gun versus the good guy with a gun and I'll tell you I'm a good guy with a guy you know and I certainly when I go to church I go to church and I take it that personal responsibility right not only protect\nOh but anybody that might in there that might come under attack against the bad guy with a gun you know\nWhen I first and foremost would allow concealed carry a church is a ... that's for sure I carry a gun everywhere I'm allowed to ah I live in Texas still allowed to in many places but at the same time they're also signs up that prohibited from carrying my gun I think at that point if you're going to\nIf you're a church or any facility that can be deemed a soft target\nThe simple answer is that if you're not going to allow me to carry my going in\nAnd you should but if you're not gonna allow me to you better have protection there for my family and for me\nAnd that goes for any facility whether it's a movie theater or school or church or whatever I mean I'm so sick and tired of seeing signs up and say that that prevent you from carrying concealed handgun you want to to get a license for and you've gone through the classes for\nA and then there's no protection whatsoever I mean we can look at the Aurora shooting a gun in Colorado that guy quite literally avoided six other theaters in the area because they all allowed people to carry guns\nBut wants to be interviewed tack did not allow good guys like you and me to carry guns in their twelve people died\nSo we are I think that you have to work in conjunction synagogue should either allow people to conceal carry and they'll be do or don't I'm guessing they don't or they should they should have protections to make sure nobody gets in there with a gun I Would also close it down to one entrance annex it\nThis way anybody getting ... getting out or anybody get a good mood to be an emergency exit on the other side to get out but anybody getting into that facility and they want to cause harm\nYou're gonna you're gonna identify them where they could pull the trigger one gun\nSure I mean I guess if they can do it at the land they can certainly do it at a church\nWill they will be doing it moved in the halls of Congress they do it at the White House so so the people that we pay to be our legislators are representatives or a president they are protected one hundred percent I've been to the White House\nYou can't get anywhere near the place until you have a full body scan so why can't they do something to protect the good guys when they're out there a church synagogue school whatever they happened to be doing\nYeah as much as I don't think it's a bad idea there there are other things I think that come into play in like obviously the economic a\nFull body scan for example or even a metal detector and you know those are those are those items that it's not just that have an accent that the people around them and in a church probably qualified people that are\nGoing to be there any way to get out that kind of thing but then there's training and then right I don't know I just feel like they're it\nLike I said as much as I don't disagree with you I I certainly think that it would be a great idea I also almost ... think that it's not a realistic idea as much\nWell I I I think that you allow concealed carry them almost at a time if you allow concealed carry by good guys like you and me\nCongregation members that people know and that we know have have gone through the steps to get the license to be able to carry like but also you you just have a bus system where you have to be close to ... to ...

... gunfire with police\nDeliberate rage days though maybe we're living amazing days come on let's\nAppreciate I had a great time you know unfortunately I made a mistake and got blown out of my seat could uh you know there were political reasons for that as well which I described in the book with a you know what I was there to help the president they're loyal to the president you know I did some a\nMedia this morning I was on CNN and try to spend what I said that I called the president a liar not what I said the president is telling the it's like\nThat and he's covering the truth is doing it to set your hair on fire right into a finger your eyeball 'cause he knows it's going to distract you cause you to be like a school monitor all rocker\nAnd it works every single time when you go to a CNN or MSNBC when you walk into stores and look I've done work at CNN headline news and fifty over there I mean I did that when you walk it still feels good it's a nice organization but then you realize that there is a definitive spin when you walk into that ... did you know you were to get you know some some lip poked and it's hard to get\nYou to spend the president a certain way\nPretty much on message I think they were really hitting these horror this morning and I'm trying to sell a book they figure that could kill me with the base but that's fine people that know me they know what I'm super loyal to the president or say listen I got fired Fifteen months ago if I wasn't loyal to the President Joe you would have figured it out by now uh I wrote a very colorful very funny book [noise]\nAbout my relationship with him do what do you like it like it as a guy what he's like behind the scenes and by the way that a lot of research on him and his father when they were like young\nFathers obviously now deceased but I'm going back into the seventies when his dad was working with him and mentoring in what they were like so this was a real fun book to write a ... call yesterday uh she said that she she went through the book should read it a hundred percent what Bush said\nIt was great he couldn't wait to show it to her father for it but at one of his best friend said the same thing you know what I listen I\nI I Love the president I said that from the press box you know I got criticized for saying that I Love the president two or three times when I was given my press briefing last too bad I'm a New Yorker I to be an Italian I like to use the word love Joe and Joe ... guy we want me to do\nIt and again I'm from New York I'm In a town you're ... or core short for packing we willow so All right we we we enjoy I get where you where you're coming from just like everybody I gotta tell ya my mother's from Jamaica, Queens so as the president these people are fighters\nWho come from Jamaica, Queens and I don't know that that the rest of American certainly not the elite media in America they don't understand that do they\nKnow they don't understand it they get sent it there's micro aggressions Reagan president is that your doubt that the left wants your brain disconnected from your mouth you know you get up and emotion feeling you could ever politically incorrect thing to say you\nAre and they want that totally sanitizing edited and God Forbid you should say something that they're offended by right there was a tiny bit of a micro aggressions\nThey started sending bottle rockets off the president place than like a Stradivarius that he does\nA ... and that's how people from queens or from my area your area talk and I don't mean anything by it I'm just asked my personality\nI agree it's embodies their most of the blue collar President Bill blue collar president it's out now go and get this great book let's go back to the media stuff because again you were there when he did The Apprentice he made tens of millions of dollars for NBC now NBC turned itself on him him almost immediately when he said he's running for president more U.S surprise I've talked to him seven different times he he was actually\nNot surprised they turned on him but he was surprised by how dirty and how nasty bad guys were you\nYeah I think he's been blown away I mean I I there was a scene in my book where I'm Talking about us in the oval office\nAnd he looks at me so she you know I had a forty five you're great relationship with the media will do and what happened I said there is a combination of things they don't they don't like your some of your policies and you know we we let Steve Bannon declare war on the media and that they're trying to take it out on you\nThat I and and it took them a second but he realized what was going on so he kept on going out and I think you're right he purposely looks for a cost an out and tries to tell me your fake news\n... enemy turn in a cost to eats it up he does it every time you make fools himself when you were dealing with the media to give him a job for eleven days but again I thought it was really really good pick up a time I understand what happened but um when you were in that job did you think that the media would work with you\nDid you think that they wanted to actually get good information from the White House when the price of\nA I thought I thought we were going to have a ... month I thought there would be some kind of a peace offering me Jonah what\nAdam ... and the press I turn the lights and cameras back on that first day Joe ... era as the press secretary I did the first press conference and I'm so sorry that would be my last one I was going to focus on strategy and building the communications team\nAnd also wanted to put us in a service position if you go you can find it on the net Mike ... plan\nBut listen you know I'm accountable for the mistake I made I trusted a reporter I was having off the cuff conversation with ... everybody forgets the context to\nEat was being very of seat we use and flattering to me any begging me effectively to do a profile story within a trail me around and I'm like well I'm not the ban and I'm not there are still promoting myself run I\nUse of expletives which I obviously regret she loved that guy changed ran over to CNN with it right he waited he wrote this ridiculously\nIn you know exaggerated article and then you really should take you know four or five days later ... and I'm like jeeze the taste sounds like to normal guys from queens talking to each other right\nWhy would you do that to the guy and the answer is well we wanted ambushes and see if we can get him out of the White House or a you know some people thought I Would have been very effective in helping the president so\nI bought it will give you went back to the white but\nIf you went and checked up a pod cast after you were named I thought it was a good pick because I felt like you were a guy who wasn't ... going to be very direct you're gonna be very strict with the information and and you would say look if you want a relationship with a retired minister Asian here's a way it's going to work but you're right I think that\nYou got suckered into a little bit and it doesn't feel good I've had that happened to me but you got you got pulled in because you're actually trust somebody something that guys like do you want to do we want to trust people\nThe age Joe I made a mistake it's dishes vibrant place down there I didn't anticipate how bad it was a I told my Wall Street present Thirty years on Wall street now let me tell you something the worst person on Wall street is literally the best person down there so while\nI I Know how bad it is down there and it is what it is\nAnd so for me uh a lot of my book is also about that ... that you know where I got up\nDusted myself off I was sort of like mayhem and they all say commercial coming through the car crash right and I told my kids watch what I Do with this thing now because we never want to do is be on your back for too long to you don't want that left wing media to build a shame box for you to stand inside of\nYou want to be you and so I'm I'm fully expressing myself a lot of fun writing this book I Hope that people who go out and buy the book at ten percent as much fun reading it as a kid writing it was really an enjoyable thing for me to do a lot of research that\nIt's a ... but in the book is the blue collar president I originally go ... go get five copies give it to your friends and family it's the blue collar president a last question and I think people are dying to know descent but what's the relationship now with the president\nYou know I Would say it's good I mean we we we don't talk or a super Matty is the part of the United states I don't feel the need to bother him a\nI had a very good conversation with them last July recording trade I put in an op ed in the F G we had a rigorous intellectual discussion about that um and I get along I mean we I think we see the world are pretty similar late I'm and I'm not sure damn I Hope he's not as ... me for what happened he seems to be\nA that kind of guy I right at the end of the guys like ... I see myself a day was environment Korea was fired I was fired I call this S P else were fired but loyal and said oh you know I I feel very good about the president\nOh he's got the one of the toughest jobs in the world I certainly didn't want to make it harder for him I was there to try and make it easier and by the way I'm here to help until I Do a lot of media surrogacy for the campaign a and I'm writing a lot of a bench warmer state by state\nEverybody going to get this book the blue collar president it's Anthony Scaramucci you know somebody that you said earlier in the interview really stuck out and it's a you know hearing is Fifteen months later and you're still loyal to the president or a summer ocean was out for Fifteen seconds and had a new book\nSo uh I really think that that you showed your loyalty and the fact that the fact that you can look at me look at my listeners and look at look at my viewers and say I made a mistake I should have thought the ... better and I really think I could have been an effective guy I agree with everything but you just said I think that's also\nGot on the mistakes you make in life you're going to tell my kids to be accountable I'm not blaming anybody I'm not playing the victim and one last thing which I think you would appreciate growing up the way you did and I hope your listeners that you know whining and sports of politics Joe\nFacts are going to win in five on a story to tell you like the machine\nWhile I don't know I'm a big Jake you fail obviously but but if it's gonna be the ... anybody attribute the red Sox 'cause it would be the edges\nOf just like you know to like a machine that were like last night so to me no whining and spores and ... I got slammed around uh but I'm having a great improbable life I'm very blessed to be able to put my life back together with my wife uh and I guess\nJudging by the think he's we get at the clinic I'd

make an allegation that I Want to comment on it you got to stop for a second and then I'll let you can to you but the fact\nThat she wouldn't have stopped talking she thought that she would whether she kept talking unfortunately for you I have the microphone\nAnd I have control of of what's being heard at any given time I know I have a decision to make\nEither both of us speak the same time and my listeners and viewers don't get to your either of us or turn your daughter just hang up on you know just keep talking um it's not going to be both ways though I Am a fair a guy that I'll stop and let you continue but if you're gonna make allegation of drug allegation about how great CNN is and not let me respond it's not going to work when it comes to\n... because there are there are a few big lives out there about Donald Trump he was trying to ban all Muslims from coming here that's not true ah in fact the Muslim ban or the the travel ban yes\nYes predominantly Muslim countries were involved but Ninety One percent of all Muslims around the world are allowed to come here so that's a ... it was one of my focus just not true of the second allegation is that in Charlottesville he said that white supremacists are good people or very funny people he didn't say that what he said was it's a it's a a very\nLoud debate debate an emotional debate there are very are there are bad people on both sides there are very fine people on both sides\nThe debate we're talking about isn't whether white supremacy is good or bad the debate is about monuments and statues of Confederate a war heroes or soldiers\nOr leaders that's what it was about cause they're tearing down people turned up monuments because they feel like they can and they really can't it's against the law first of all and second leads to debate that we should have are there are good people on the side of of course the monuments should stay there which are history of course there are\nOther bad people on that side yeah\nOr they're good people on the side of Jared Jared down sure or they're bad people and I said absolutely so ... is not a racist because of what he said about Charlottesville but those of you who have listen to CNN and MSNBC and and the other left wing media outlets saying get over it over a drawing on and on and on you actually believe\nThat he is a pro white supremacist guy he's not he's never said anything that would that would suggest\nThat he is and this whole thing about how we mocked disable reporter is also ally yes the reporter does have some affliction where his hands are are are are in a position on his on his arms where I I guess I don't know what to do with the ... it's called but I'm showing people on the Web cam I mean his hands are sort of like this\nAnd when he talks is huge deal like that that it'd be he doesn't have the full mobility over he ended his and his forums as as most people do\nAnd the president what I guess the guy wrote something bad or report something bad about or negative about the president and he said go look at me any sort of did his hands at a similar fashion and made you know you just spoke at a at a certain kind of way well the guy doesn't speak that way so he wasn't ... mimicking them that way\nAnd be very good just go to you to use your brain and actually see the other side of the story there are are are ... several examples example after example of president Donald Trump before he was the president before even consider running where he's a Larry King live and other places where he's making fun of himself doing the same ... should exactly\nSo is he ... mocking the disabled reporter uh before he was the president was the clear Boyd once he making fun of the reporter in Nineteen Ninety\nWhen reporters didn't do the report until two veteran sixteen or maybe just maybe and whether you like the fact that he does this or not sometimes he acts like a door that way the president and he does is he used that way and he speaks that way do look at me in trouble um stupid so you have to make a decision\nEither you're really you're going to believe what these these fake news outlets you're saying and doing or you're going to do your own research it independently decide what is it that he said and what is it that he meant what is it that he wrote what is it that he meant would hand motion to do and as you ever done that before and one not talking about this reporter\nAnd then you make the decision but if you buy hook line and sinker went to fake news media is giving you you're the person who's in the wrong and don't ever give me your four year degree crap as if I'm some lowly radio guy or TV guided know squat an angel in New York and I know more than you\nYou may in fact the unity no more than I Do but you failed in any debate when you walk into thinking you're superior\nI'm telling you that right now I'm going to have a debate on any level with anybody at any time\nBut I'm not willing to walk into where you think you're better than I Am and you'll win the debate by reminding me of the paper that you that you got from some journalism school\nThat's not going to help you I've got Thirty years in this business\nFifteen of which were I was just a journalist I was not a commentator wasn't somebody who gave an editorial is outlook\nI didn't write opinion pieces I gave you a straight news to the point to my viewers and listeners had no clue what what by politics were so bringing next time I get ... but you better bring it better than that All right let me get to John Hi Bush he's the guy that runs the or the Reagan pursued the Reagan Institute I'm ... and it's a really interesting conversation\nAbout how that President dealt with the media and how this president deals with the media John appreciate ...\nOn this great great to be with\nYou I Am really glad to have you back I got to tell you something you'll with wonderful but that thing behind you just got my attention it appears to be a plaintiff some short and some beautiful flags waving the breeze John what is that\nYeah well we're right here at the Reagan Library that's a A R at fourteen at that jet is one of the famous jets that little off the carrier that a President Reagan ordered to shoot down the Libyan fighter pilots are when they came after our fleet at one point in Nineteen eighty six\nI Do remember that and I also remember that the President Reagan said watch this and went back in and launched an attack on on Gadhafi himself and that really got him under control doesn't it", "year": "2018", "show_name":
