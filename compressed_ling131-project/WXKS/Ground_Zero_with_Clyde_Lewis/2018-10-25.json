E. V. I. N. for Hillsdale dot com that's living for Hillsdale dot com [noise] alright\nClaudio Rockford, Illinois the great W are okay go\nThen to live and how are you okay thank you I'm a great a lot of a lot of the topics and points that\nYou make our our typical ingredients of what is taking place in the destruction of Europe and fortunately we in the U.S are just mere in that image and I I Believe that uh\nThat what we're seeing happen in this country is just a um\n[noise] it just what they're seeing taking place in Europe as far as the the uh what they called them they know that they're there Mike when they're um uh people coming from the Syria band and all these regions that are going through wars\nAnd do we have the media that is destroying everything and has their opinion and agenda and they have in Europe the EU which people that are wearing suits but not appointed by anybody they're dictating what's going on mhm and I find very interesting I fight and I don't know if I can share on the\nWith you while let's not but uh you make you make some interesting points there and um\nAnd you're probably not aware of this but you're quite right in this to this extent the progressive movement a reaches to its philosopher kings in your roof so and ... and marks and ... among others\nAnd also you know in in certain respects the signing of this nation reaches back into your or to lock and monitor skew in Sydney and in others but also of course our style and says real but\nBut the point is these are really two different ways of looking at humanity one looks that humanity one individual at a time that's where we come from you on a one individual at a time individuals have merit\nIndividuals' have value individuals have worked their God given God given God created and then there's another view which is to look at the whole the community and if people are stepping out and they're not doing what they're expected to do for the better good\nWell then those people need to be addressed and dealt with\nAnd of course what happens here is a relative handful of individuals when compared to the overall population determine what is good for the community whether it's good for the community or not and this is where you get in trouble you get into these various ideologies and theories and extraction\nIn which I'm a relative handful of individuals seek to impose their will on all of society\nAnd to destroy manage nature\nAnd so the individual is only as good as the individual is willing to surrender his or her individuality to the greater good to the state because conformity and uniformity our priorities their primary\nNow argue doesn't view it that way conformity in uniform me that's not the priority as much liberty for an individual as possible and in order to society and amoral ordered society that's our model\nAnd so you want in in addition to that an economic system that is competitive that his market oriented that is relatively voluntary and so forth and so on as opposed to this constant central is Asian a government\nPower uh but that is essentially seized by an elected individuals and a will that is imposed on you rather than exercising your own will you can see this now your point on the immigration from\nThe vast majority of Americans don't want what's taking place on the southern border the vast majority of Americans do want the southern border security even those who are fairly liberal and the issue of immigration\nBut you have a political party leadership and a political party that believes it must change the population it must change the electorate it must change the citizenry in order to have as close as possible a permanent hold on power\nAnd that's exactly what's taking place here that's what America did in Germany that's what's taking place and people don't have a right to come to the United states of America they don't have a right to come here at all they're not even covered by our constitution it's the people in this country who have rights\nAnd have the right to make these determinations\nAnd so um I agree with you to that extent that what's\nHappened here on the American left as they've taken the European left the progressive left both of which are ... of Hagel and marks and then the angles and the and the Russo and others are and that's the that's the road they've taken as opposed to the road we've taken which is the light meant\nThe embrace of western civilization and those sorts of things\nThat's my round about kind of process oriole way of agreeing with you All right Claudio thank you

if they disagreed with ... with the government\nOr a a form of government or something going on a government disagree they bring their differences to light the boat the EU's constitutional law we use law and order which is based on a constitution but solid\n\nCenturies\nNearly centuries almost two centuries but more than two centuries actually yeah more than two centuries a little over now we've had disagreements in the past and that's something to this country does it we have a debate and\nWe have conversations we talk we have dialogue hopefully dialogue\nWith his balanced and ah\nAnd and that's something I think we're lacking right now I mean we're writing off people because we disagree with him and that's nonsense\nEighteenth sixty one\nThere's only one time in our history and Eighteen sixty one where we just trusted the systems so much that we decided to have a civil war or we had a civil I don't know if we decided that the civil war broke out because we didn't agree we had such a disagreement about how our system was run we have some we have a civil war\nThere was so much instability at that time the civil war broke out it wasn't declared it broke out there were divisions on on a on front lines there were a\nYou know border divisions and things of that nature it was clear cut as to what a civil war was back in the Eighteen sixties were not living in the Eighteen sixties anymore America's instability\nIs increasingly an undercurrent in political discourse right now\nBut I Know it's difficult to see the civil war is happening because we always thought it\nWould be an armed conflict then one day\nPresident Trump or whoever would step up to the pulpit and say what about your guns guys we're going to war here in this country\nBut he established with a battlefield America had already been proposed during the Obama administration is proposed by none other than John McCain who now is a political hero of the left for some reason\n\nWe always thought it would be an armed conflict where we would be shooting other Americans every day with the police would be forced to shoot Americans every day we're martial law would be declared\nAnd all that can happen but at the moment the symptoms of civil war have not been diagnosed\nBy the majority of the people and most of the diagnosis you get about wars are from history not declared by the president but be ... be declared the aftermath\nNow in the past there were a number of ways that the military had identified illustrated the point by point sign post\nAs to what a new civil war would look like in America and this is based on\nContemporary standards not the standards of the Eighteen sixties or the Nineteen fifties or or the forties or whatever I mean there are major coups in the planning for Truman and for FDR major coup of course planned and and and uh actually executed by a those in the deep state against President Kennedy\nBut a new civil war in America look something like this according to military planners number one\nThe country would be in France in national polarization would no obvious meeting place for resolution\nNumber two\nThere would be increasingly divisive press coverage and information flows weaken institution notably a Congress and the judiciary\nNumber three\nThere will be a sellout or abandonment of responsibility by political leadership and the legitimacy and the illegitimate edition of violence\nTo solve any and all disputes\nNow I Know that that's pretty damning to actually point all these out and of course we have been analyzing and speculating about the state\nManipulations it's a ... we've been told is conspiracy analyst said this is a an invention of Donald Trump would we know that the shadow government has not been in Ventura Donald Trump the shadow governors always been\nThe dark command that leads from the shadows\nBut it needs to be clear here\nThey while we're looking under rocks for false flag proof while we're having these disputes and the symptoms of war here in the United states the effect is working in the left has made it a point to turn what happened today with the bombs into a moment where their persecution complex can be proven which makes it even more suspicious especially when\nThe media should be talking about how more than a week ago Senator Susan Collins a Republican from Maine\nReceived a suspicious letter and again early this month President Trump's defense secretary James Mattis and chief of naval operations John Richardson were sent rice and and more than a year ago\nThere was an attempted assassination of multiple Republican congressmen during a charity baseball practice and yet since no one died this doesn't indicate civil war does it no not at all it's just we're attacking officials\nBut this isn't registering and the media today the only thing is registries the persecution complex we see on the left because the left is all one sided in their pain\nBut continued attacks on political figures from shootings to attempted bombings are part of a civil war tactic and it's becoming more and more pervasive fees are attacks on the Republicans and and the intelligence that are linked to these resistance they're using it for sympathy they're using on the Democrats for sympathy the truth is Democrats are not unique\nRepublicans are not unique in the American people are not unique we can and will if we're not already having a civil war in this country\nThe attacks are happy to do a lot more people than just the Clintons in Obama's there are journalists that are being attacked we've had anthrax being sent the journalists we've had rice and being sent a journalist\nSo time to wake up\nSome Americans have hit the Suze Orman since they're not affected directly by the evil in this country they walk around like outsiders just like in John carpenter's a movie they live they have not put on the glasses to see the real world that has written glazed over by an overly political narrative that does not wish to expose the demonic Lee infected among us\n\nThe movie they live created by John Carpenter was actually released Thirty years ago this November\n\nThe film still remains chilling only appropriate as a metaphor for what is happening today of course John Carpenter is responsible for the movie Halloween which is having a bit of a renaissance as it's forty years sequel is selling out to the theaters across the country and the original Halloween introduced to Michael Meyers who was eventually referred to as the shape kind of evil that cannot be killed\n\nJohn carpenter's films or horror metaphors exploit what trauma does to the soul\nWhich he also infuses his films with a strong anti authoritarian messaging concerns about how our society is unraveling and there's always some evil hidden in the shadows ready to pounds of every moment in the film they live carpeted portrays the government working against its own citizens\nThat appears to be some silent alien infestation the echoes of the films invasion of the body Snatchers if you remember that them however\nIn the body Snatchers movie there were some people that we're realizing that their loved ones were losing their humanity\nIn a film they live\nCarpet of shows that the majority of the populace are out of touch with reality and they have allowed technology to run 'em up they have allowed believed to choose their values they are unaware that a war has been waged against them and their way of life do you recall\nCarpenter also did the film escape from New York where the future of America is fascism\nSo the bottom line is\nThat the message has been quite clear and no one seems to be listening we're being fed a series of\nCarefully contrived fictions there no resemblance to reality [noise] and the agent provocateurs create these attacks in order for us to feel as though we are threatened by forces beyond our control [noise] and with these tactics they're able to destabilize the country making us distrustful of each other divided by our prejudices ... others throats\nThese types of events generate a lot of fear based retaliation\nAir symptoms if part of or within the realms\nAnd the confines of civil war in the United states of America\nUsing the constitution eliminates these problems\nAnd ... and say the key is to use the pin update your software and only send money to people you know\n\nFox News I'm Carmen Robert seven homemade bombs such a prominent Democrats CNN and a liberal billionaire called ... across the country and put in your study

won't add up to say hey we're in the middle of something really bad year\nAnd it it it's like a the civil war that happened in South American the Nineteen seventies and eighties it's like what happened prior to Ukraine and and when he was destabilized these things are happening in America and no one sees it for what it is\nRoger why is that people are paying attention why don't they why don't they just stop ... they they they're mere completely insane and they want to continue this I guess maybe it's it's just a way for us to get our frustrations out or why do you think this is
