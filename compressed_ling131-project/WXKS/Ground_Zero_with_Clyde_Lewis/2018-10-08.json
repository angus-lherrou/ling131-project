there's just Fifteen Years ago and they do have the process you have to go through all of that first okay something somebody is making a mistake that doesn't work for\nThe new the new in what we bought so it just starts all over again\nIt's not true well that's what they told me I don't\nEven know collection agency or the credit reporting agency ...\nOkay have you ... have you looked at your credit reporting out your credit report yes absolutely\nAnd it will go on and it's still on the credit report\nCorrect okay you can't forget about the collection agencies ah they just hang up on them that they have nothing to do within earth's threaten them or I keep on telling people just say hey I'm recording this call is a Fifteen year old dad I'm recording this you have no lawsuit against beach and you argue consenting to\n[noise] to keep on being recorded and they'll hang up on you show or\nThe next problem and this is the big problem is that from Fifteen Years ago a debt was unpaid is still on the credit reports that's that's an issue\nBecause that's huge damages so well could actually destroys your wife effectively ... especially in this day and age All right so you go through the appeals process you say I Want to refute it sent me the paperwork and your refuted you say Fifteen Years old\nAnd you ask them it don't you have a policy of uh after seven years I've been dropping from the credit report and what are the interstate nope that policy has gone\nIt's crazy I agree it's crazy yeah I don't I don't understand it I mean I just don't understand that happening I'm had credit and I've had clients\nWho had a the issue with these statutes ... with these statutes that no longer apply for your statue in California for example when on paper to ... a credit card or any written a contract and a\nCredit card agency or collection agencies and some of them are real ... agencies have called and people know there was a four year statute and they'll say hey this was five years to go there is a four year statute they just changed the law\nWhen they change the law last month it's now a ten year statute and\nWhat do you do well my clients said okay just send me just give me the code just told me don't get the bill number let me look it up right now if I owed them money will start talking oh oh oh oh you know that's sort of thing\nAnd horrible rolled out there with credit credit reporting I mean there's a whole just I think it's going to be a huge huge a new area of the law dealing with it already is a\nPretty good size area and are those are people that deal with credit but it's a it has to explode just has to explode All right Paul Paul Europe welcome to handle on the law\n[laughter] hello about a year and a half ago my Seventeen year old was in a clothing store and bought it on the repairs and she walked up to the girl check the items [noise] oh she checked committed something I'm not sure what she did\nEnd of the garment sector [noise] she went and tried in on the parents want him to step device about the cover and the last ... truly\nYeah Eighteen Inches ooh or anything there\nI mean is there anything there and he told me about the scratch or was the was the femoral Ari a artery cutting did she bleed out there is a\nNo no I wasn't I was thinking more about the struggle we went through\nYou know ... no no no ... no one cares about your stress\nThat for an aids test we had to have her tips\nFor HP ... wait a second in age test because one of those security devices scratched\nHer and you did an aids test\nWell how many people on the other GOP scratch but how do we\nRight okay so you did the AIDS test and of course came up negative\nYeah okay now what that's where I'm at no\nNo no and matter of fact there is not good news is there's nothing there either in terms of the case of the eight or ... yeah yeah no there's nothing there\nThere's there I mean theoretically there you go to the doctor did she get stitches ah yeah the emotional ... there's not an an emotional issue when you get scratched [laughter]\nSo no there's nothing there although you know it's always interesting is are All right my knees or anything they're in you know everybody ... this is America where your default to how do I get\nMoney that is it how do I get money\nAnd then we start talking about well what what happened in oh okay so there's nothing there well emotionally distraught ah I'm Upset because I I Want money and I can't get money and therefore can I sue\nBecause of my anticipation of getting money oh sure that's a great case oh why not\nAt this high Agnes welcome to handle on the law they sure\nI've got a problem I have a like a fake test that uh it doesn't work that guy can were less than half hour and they kept me seven hundred and I didn't I doubt it I Wonder though I have a right to ask them to the investment\nFor what I mean how much should you pay them and how did that\nI Know but how much do you think you should do they fix it or not\nI think that holds less than half hour\nIt doesn't matter I don't care if they fix and half an hour or did they give you a ... did they give you a an estimate\nThey didn't they already did you pay did you pay for the glass door being fixed\nAnd when do they do they say it was going to cost eight hundred dollars or just after the ... they hinder do a bill for eight hundred dollars\nNo they'll know nothing All right and just don't pay\nGo then\nWell then that's the problem you have a Agnes because you paid it and now you say I pay too much\nSo it's a they're going to say you accepted our\nOur bill the bill basically use verbal says I Want a eight hundred dollars\nAnd so ah and then there's the issue of uh contractors over five hundred dollars you need a written contract but I don't think that's a that's going to be particularly important although it might be in a in the case of a a small claims spending on the judge so ah you wonder if it's worth something Agnes right does the work they did\nNot what do you think you should pay I\nMean I think you know much about it\nAnd there may be reasonable so you turn around soon for six hundred dollars and you take it to court and they are going to say you accept the deal and you're going to say is too much money and I didn't know and then I found out that they just rip me off its predatory\nBut I had nothing to prove they get it and then the ...\nWhere do you mean you're not did you hand them eight hundred dollars in hundred dollar bills in cash\nNo no I didn't my credit card\nOkay so you have the planes that you pay them eight hundred dollars\nOkay and you're saying it's too much and you and you want your money back and they overcharge you okay and you didn't know the overcharge\nYou until after the fact and they were going to argue it doesn't matter what we charge we told her I was gonna be eight hundred dollar she agreed there are going to lie about it ...\nAnd you're going to go to court and tell us your judge okay that's that's all you can do that I asked him before I go to of course you you have to ask them first okay that's the law you have\nTo make a demand to do it in writing say you over charge me I've checked around and by the way you\nDo have to check around you just can't arbitrarily say I I think it's only we're two hundred dollars because what kind of expertise you have ... nobody cares what you think it's I've checked around and you do want to check and it's worth two hundred dollars you overcharge me I Want my six hundred dollars back you make that demand they're going to tell you to go pounds Sandra pound glass in this case\nAnd you are and they'd go to sue\nWhen they say no [noise] not that complicated [noise] this is handle on the law
