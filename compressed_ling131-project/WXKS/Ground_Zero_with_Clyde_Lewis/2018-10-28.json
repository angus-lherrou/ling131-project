industry of do the talking board into this into the community of the spiritual movement and also it in the United states only that it was an Eighteen Ninety the ... board that we know today got its start\nIn Eighteen Ninety One it was patent and trademark and was in production at that point so there's always some interesting stories about that but an Eighteen Ninety to Canada Watson writes from us the United states to sell their own version of the ... board and so they started making boards and Eighteen Ninety two\nAnd the rest is history and so bored such as Bob board which again falls into the category of talking boards\nA lot of sports after the wage what makes it a prominent splash into\nThe market I mean ... everybody was buying them and using them at the heyday I mean this this has been a spiritual moving with going\nBig time and I was going on with their communication at the time that people started making copycat boards and started doing different types of their own type a board and of course we get the trademark tens of the name they couldn't use that name\nRight so you have to use different names but I mean this is the story behind this board is rather unique I've never heard anything a particularly unique is the story of of Bob being a suspected serial killer or making aboard the base\nTo go you see it it's almost as if it's penance for him to make this board so that he would feel right about himself or what have you ah in his own special way I'm just curious if there are any other unique stories behind certain types of boards that have been released in the past\nThere there are many reasons that people make their own boards and as you mentioned during people do make around and start customizing assign um\nUm but the degree of this type of story no I've never heard of this story but there are reasons why people make boards and it could just be a personal their own little personal portal or they want to communicate with the deceased one or they see an opportunity to make money I there's a lot of different reasons but this is a very unique case\nI'm In its I haven't heard ever heard of a serial killer making aboard before or I shouldn't say he was in a secular he was posted\nA legit or we don't know if he really was or not\nYeah we we don't know if he did he checked into somebody mental institution right in fact a you know\nThat's that's the that's the thing is he avoided a any kind of prosecution because he checked in a mental institution I mean in in since you've been using the board you've gotten longitude and latitude of you submitted any in any of this information to the authorities and if so do they take it seriously\nWell which is kind of awkward because I haven't really you know this is really just a small thing that I was just selling on on on would just put the color\nA Xerox is on on board and then I met this guy used to work for current affair which is an old TV show or\nOn a which has only channel five or something right in the east and um\nShe was really for years he was kind of trying to do something with the board\nAnd he worked on hated like on the show he did like producing I think mhm current affairs and then he was the one who\nIntroduced it to the guys that make these um [noise] it's a company called allied board and they make different games things and they took it to another level\nI think it's the same image to same exact\nYou know but then they took it and they just put on more quality thing with boxes and everything\nYeah and the and the background to write the background history\nYeah and they were told and everything you know and they put it down to they made it more like a sophisticated I guess but I'm the same story and it's a very and I tell people you know\nThat too I I made them put on that you can't be under Eighteen years old because this is real this is really happened this really works\nAnd it's a very scary and if if you have the wrong intentions and you know everybody is we call go to the same place at the end but says some bad people that are around and they go to you know so you don't want to some of them back\nSo I always say that it's not a joke\n... no I'm In I Want to ask her and you know I have some idea of criteria that I have you know if I ever use the word I use a boarding a long time was beyond its use the board uh gosh I Can't count back but I I I've been president during other sessions with boards I mean I Know somebody who has their own board they brought it in one night and they used it wasn't really a board it was just\nSomething that just rolled out like it was a laminated a lemonade peace that had a a crystal glass so they use I mean I you know boards can rudimentary like that even even when you see the TV show stranger things that you kind of a mix you board and Christmas tree lights\nSo that her little boy you could go to the uh the little boy can communicate with his mother his mother\nUm you know ... it doesn't ... we really do need boards do we care and I mean even the boards of their uh you couldn't channel on your own and you can use a you know automatic writing and other things in my right\nYeah that's a good point and the board is really not doing the work we're doing the work ourselves support just becomes a permission slip if you will or it becomes a stepping off jumping off point a springboard and to be able to to access your own abilities to this work\nA lot of people don't think that's the case and I didn't think that was the case for many many years but when I realized what was happening here when I started working the board was at my own six cents ... he started developing really started really being fined tune\nAnd taking a broad way I can still do this work and pay a lot of people use and the old days they used typewriters word processors now they used computer keyboards and they've channel that way\nIt's what I find it to board the people if the tactile experience and the movement movement itself that kind of opens up the receptor seek to start bringing in the information and so again I Want to be real clear the board there's no negative energy with any board that's why I have no problem\nHaving any board at my home so then I got an ... even this board that I'm that great uncle made 'em for his purposes I have no problem with that because I Know nothing negative will happen unless I Want that to happen unless I Try to bring that to me or that's my desire\nOr that's how I view the world so people doesn't mean you know people in these scaring us even talking about this on the radio while I have\nAre do they they they think in the they don't understand and this is what I Want to try and bring out with this whole conversation and they don't understand that a lot of this has to do with what's inside of them and now it's hideous motor responses are that are basically muscular suggestions are subtle suggestions and the mind that come from the unconscious\nIt's from deep within dream scape time it's like you're in there and and things come out of you I mean the human body in the brain are big transmitters\nAnd so the only way this can work as a transfer through the body and then the board as you say is like a permission slip and it's like a way to to view I mean people would use pencils that I I used to do a medium that would ah would he would do his thing he would just scribble he would take the pencil\nAnd he would just scribble another bad and it just scribbling scribbling as he scribbling for some reason they just doing the scribble he's looking at this go on all I see a scribbling but what I what he saw it was something else and so this was his way of I don't know what it was but it was just his way of kind of doing something with his hands on his mind was bringing in the information from getting it\nFrom so either you're scribbling or using a pendulum are you using something else but it certainly is there to\nHave the mind generate or push through the body the motor response\nThat certainly is a interesting you see it in an action tonight on ground zero talking about Bob's more ... a
