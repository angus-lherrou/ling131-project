I fight your cats books for my nieces and nephews and I just I absolutely love them think by your welcome\nAnd listening to your ... interview with David Limbaugh on there is a monument that which or help us the piety with orange to build a monument a hundred and Thirty years ago and by that\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd there are certainly people all over the world right now they would rather rules for other reasons you know maybe it's just that I've been watching too much American horror story apocalypse but my dad got\nIf you watch that\nThat's a lesson in in the fight between what is the dark powers and whether powers out there in the midst of an apocalypse\nPredicted programming revelation doesn't matter if it\nWould be increasing globally should a globalization of political economic institutions it's becoming easier for relatively small group\nTo deceive itself into quite staggeringly influential positions and one ... particular reveals alarmingly what another small group will do is driven by financial belief systems and a cult things and all the things in the shadows all the things that can reach out and grab you from the darkness\n\nAnd while there are many conspiracy writers and observers that tend to talk about the material world within the conspiracy history\nWe always seem to point to whomever we hate but has control over the world the spiritual realm but what is the thriving right now and then it's globalization a lot of frightening and somewhat complex beings that are difficult to understand even I sometimes have to go back\nAnd read and understand that's why I come in every day early\nYeah you can go through all of the bad guys the ... the Jesuits accusing them of controlling all of a spiritual realms of what appears to be this imperial called\nHowever it becomes more complicated when you deal with witchcraft or pre scrap that takes place within the spiritual matrix of the elite\nAnd a lot of this I mean I'm sure many of you don't understand it and you know I understand a little of it because of what I've studied my my entire life when I when I put into this program every night every major step\nIn the development of the new world order from a simple ideology to a worldwide super states can be traced back\nTo specific ideologies which uphold ruled by a chosen body of spiritual elite secret Brotherhood's from behind the scenes the Brotherhood whatever it may be or the sisterhood if you want to be equal\nAll plays a role in the hidden hand that guides us towards this order you can also be seen as a manifestation of elusive theory and spirituality the professors to enlighten practitioners through mysticism and magic\nAnd I kind of alluded to it in the last hour I use the the word sin anarchy there was a guy by the name of a Joseph ... say knives\nAnd he\nHad an opposition to the rise of anarchy and the second half of the nineteenth century\nAnd to him the ideal state was a rigid social hierarchy topped by an elite that is pre destined to rule absolutely at odds with the event emerging concepts of democracy and so he decided that the only way to win\nAnd the gain power which do you use the supernatural as a weapon\n\nAnd so\nHe wanted to transmit the secret synergy throughout the ages basically coming in coordination and cooperation with a divine rule meaning that some spiritual fathers do not exist on this planet and they must be conjured up contacted\n\nAnd one of the spiritual fathers or some of the spiritual bothers us that are key were of course the knights Templar\nAnd other groups that\nYou know actually spawned and and and new ideas and and mysterious mysterious subjects and hidden meanings and certain conjure rings and all these things\n\nAnd I said before that it seems to me that you know be beyond the deep state in the dark stayed or whatever state you want to point to as a problem there is a darker type of rule\nOf dark command that actually uses the darker powers to create as sin arcade may be in power right now the government it's run\nAnd it's not our government into child but what it is it is a government of some kind of group a conspiracy of men or women that form of priesthood and are ruled by a secret society open societies are not always the ones\nThat are named by conspiracy theorists all of them however it played a role in establishing their power plays within the United states and within the world the formation of this nation was perhaps the mother of all\nConspiracies but from there there were other conspiracy groups other secret societies and I know many Christians in America believe that the ... the United states was based on Christian values and ideologies business half true\nThe rebellious nature of the insurrection was purely Syrian any bordered on things like her medic arcane them announced the system so from the very beginning we've always had that group\nThat are simply observers they they they're custodians and they make things happen and they call themselves into a different opinion that of the Christians or the Jews are the Muslims and they're in systematic opposition\nTo the apostles do the disciples to those who've adopted the views of Christianity Islam and Judaism and they're against the general teaching of any gospel whatsoever any word there would be connected to a God God did they don't approve of\nAnd they are on the opinion that the dog was if any gospel are not good for anyone\n\nAnd this is why the ruling oligarchy in most respects has a secret doctrine which is reserved for the elite\nAnd this is why when you see things happened that don't sincerely seem\nGodly or or Christ like or or or anything you you look at the symbolic language you look at the actions you look at the numbers and all the numbers in the symbolic actions in the language and all of them are puzzle pieces to a greater picture and not always do you have the greater picture and even I don't\n\nThat's why you know I gave a few clues gave it a few hands and I said a couple of nights ago I said you know I'm not gonna give you an exact date I Can't give you a decay exact date of anything\nI'm not here to tell you the world ending I I that would be stupid to do something like this and many people say that many people are used to the idea that people who talk like I talk or wanting to just gather everyone together and say the world is ending do yourself then that's it no I'm not a cult leader I'm a talk show host\nAnd know what I'm Talking about is not magical thinking it's really pattern seeking it it it's basically acknowledging that a lot of the coincidence is that I'm seeing lately are meaningful at least to me they are they might not\nBe
