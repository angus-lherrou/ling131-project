all dressed up in political pseudo scientific biology and it was offered encouraged\nWould be logical apocalyptic ideas that certain people were a burden on resources and the environment and some argue that many people believe that in order to bring balance to nature we had to eliminate certain people we had to kill off some of the population\nSo people were rounded up and killed\nMeans centuries prior we're European columnist who took the land for the natives because they were believed to be a strain on the resources their beliefs were different than the puritan belief\nAnd so they hunted them down and kill them she was always this\nAffect the process for creating an agreed upon way of hunting down in killing other human beings in order to boost some sort of agenda in order to\nYou feel better about your belief system because these are believed that you don't necessarily agree with it so when you have like for example the times I'm assuming\nTrials there were governors or complicit in carrying out a lot of the atrocities and the public trust is always exploited in situations like bees and it would be opinion of the political elite the day but the the\nInto the weeds cheese they were seeing we're actually happening because there was this work going on this working\nOf the devil ... like today that there was a polarization of the people on on one side we have the devil and the others like we are God and in between there was something else and there was black magic being used in other ways of trying to\nI guess take care of the governors take care of the leaders go against the bankers it's just a never ending process in fact Thomas sharing it on our show today we're talking about the attack that's being planned tomorrow on justice cabinet\nAnd I mean a lot of these actions have not been you know a lot of the uh uh different people have very views on what this is going to do it's going to take place where there's a guy by the name of father Gary Thomas\nAnd he's The Exorcist for the diocese of San jose California He's offering a mass for Kavanaugh tomorrow and basically he's the guy that was the subject of a ... uh the twenty ... book the right\nTo making of a modern extras this and that was a movie and twenty eleven twelve years is becoming an extra ... father Thomas who said that he is terrified of what is going on just like Thomas in fact father Gary\nAppeared on ground zero and you know when we were talking earlier about this thing and how it represents the serpent and the serpent teen and be and be empowering them the female and the male and the and the fruit and all that fathered Gary said that in some of his extra systems\nHe has been known to you know put his hands are annoying or lay his hands on people during the ...\nAnd they'd been known to turn into or at least appeared to be serpent teen or appear to be reptilian he appeared on the show when the right was popular let's play that segment from father Gary Thomas listen to this is\nMore of an increase of reports of shape shift as if you've heard of that before father when you say a shape shift or what you mean\nPeople who are able to and I've seen one I've seen a person change their their their ... and it's where they're able to change their look up the eyes dark and they get large and yet you've seen this\nYes I have and I've also seen when you said as soon as you I I wanted to make sure that I understood the gym that\nMean I've had people with whom I prayed over whether the as you say that the counting and\nI mean there's not a physical like somebody putting a bag over somebody and all of a sudden there there's a a different had right I have seen the contours of a person's face change in may and and appear to be reptilian and and and and have the head of a cobra\nA and I and I when I said is to people they have a very difficult time believing I oh I Do not I've I've I've seen this\nPhenomenon is below this very day I Am\nGoing to be speaking I Am actually being called as a person to be on television program in a network TV show\nTo talk about the shape shift ers who shaped shift into these reptiles and ... and like I say ... you're right you don't put a bag or they have they changed but their their eyes jet out black\nThere there are four had kind of a curves differently their their face kinda titans and they look very very reptilian\nWell and they began moving there Tom yes\nAnd very reptilian way and I I've had several people literally flop off the couch and coil and and a body language passion\nAnd surfing oh
