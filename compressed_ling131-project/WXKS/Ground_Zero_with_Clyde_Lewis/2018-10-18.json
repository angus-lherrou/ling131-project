literate audiences in radio is the mark Libyan show because of the strength of his affiliates and the and the reach of ... his intellect and we\nHave caused all over the country including San Francisco and Chris in San Francisco welcome to the mark limited showed Chris please go ahead\nOn high or you are incredibly articulate and into the joy to listen to you you get the ... and very quickly thank you thank you think\nAbout what I'd like to say is you know I keep hearing about that the media lying and that's all we get is there information they you know they're dominating the news surface all liars well why don't we get more stations than Fox and get a budget competing\nConservative stations because I keep hearing people call in and say well I don't have a concerted station where I live what\nWill be are you going to go on how about the our TV ... your church the our TV\nYou can check Newsmax dot com one American network out to check with your cable company I think she our TV does a great job Fox I Can't watch Shepard Smith in the afternoon if I Want to watch that crap all watch MSNBC so I Can't watch Shepard Smith there's parts of Fox that I Can't watch\nI Love Hannity I'll watch him Laura no problem Carlson no problem I Love watching mark on Sunday night but there's there's parts of Fox that that I Can't watch and it's because if I Wanna watch Shepard Smith crap I'll watch MSNBC instead I'm also get the true thing but but I and I worry about Fox long term\nBecause of the drift of what it's doing and it concerns me but I I I like the more information not less than what I I tell you what I Do Chris I get up\nAnd I check out the Drudge Report news match dot com I check mark ... website I go to the Daily Caller I go to daily wire\nI checked out Fox and I'd go to those six or red state dot com is pretty good our target those seven or eight and I feel\nFairly well informed to start my day and then throughout the day I checked this Web search for information I Can't pay attention to the so called mainstream media it's too much for me I Can't watch it drives me nuts but but I think there is information out there but you have to be a little more proactive and finding it\nAnd if you watch the our TV dot com and you and your Newsmax Daily Caller Daley wire Drudge Report I think are good to go\nI agree except without referring to is the mainstream media where people don't have the talent jets and meet they don't go to that effort because they're they're on the facts they don't want for conservative ms we need to get out there it'd be a competing like the local news and the mainstream media we need to get in there\nYou know Chris I I tell you what would happen ... money controls everything if CBS or ABC said from top to bottom from the top of the tree through the root system we're going to have conservative viewpoints on all of our ah channels can you imagine the ratings\nSkyrocketing said CBS News if they determine they're gonna do television much like one of America's network or Newsmax or see our GB if CBS would say we're going to cover it\nNews objectively moderate\nTo the right side of things when they make billions of dollars because you can't NBC ABC and CBS it's the same news casts every night at six thirty if one of them would go against the fracas\nAnd reflect the values the once in the whims and the wishes of the majority of the American people wouldn't we be better off and wouldn't they make a lot of money\nYeah well where are the people that are being proactive enough to do that to get into the mainstream these radio shows on TV because they're preaching to the choir we need to change minds like they're starting to go out and go on these mainstream media because I don't know if you've got to go they are\nYes and and it's okay to come and be all with me it's okay to do Fox or do my friend Sean Hannity now mark ... may get them on on a Sunday night on Fox on the radio\nBut but he needs to go out and this guy is wonderful the sixty minutes interview he took ... stole apart on Sunday I thought it was fabulous and he's he's his own but the guy's amazing in his presence he looks to be fifty and not Seventy in his presence\nYou know it's like ... it's like being with Elvis and Nineteen sixty eight in a while it's like the Beatles on the television shows like Beyonce metlife stadium this is a superstar when you get in the presence\nOf Trump it's like ...\nIt's it's unbelievable and I've never seen this in politics I wasn't old enough during the Kennedy era Ronald Reagan yes I Want to Reagan rally in Nineteen eighty four\nPretty good but there's nothing in politics that equals a Trump rally and that's why you can go to Montana Iowa Erie, Pennsylvania Cincinnati Georgia Florida he'd go anywhere\nAnd draw one hell of a crowd I Wonder what would happen if the Trump stir one to Central Park in New York City I Wonder what that would be like\nYeah I wouldn't put it past and he took that stall apart\nYou know she she was a ... by the act stupid you know and this is off the subject that I said well irony and Madame desk because there are certain there kissing him going after young prostitute is its competitor and boy as he whining about how unfair it is it's cracking me up\nI tell I tell you what's unfair Chris is when you picture our first lady as a stripper engaging in sex acts in the oval office\nAnd the mainstream media doesn't care about it and the other floated says don't gather around ... to protect her can you imagine if Michelle Obama was pictured in a a video performing sex acts in the oval office what would the media due to the person that did that to Michelle Obama\nWhere the outcry there is none me because the Trump is Mrs Trump ... that\nNo outrage is sufficient to cause criticism as long as the Trump Bullock we gotta go Chris thanks for your call I Want to thank\nOnce again rich Samantha ...

is this is sending is like you say this is like a repeat or sending something that was certainly a is bizarre especially in the coincidental ... going on in the past three days\nTo last the single going into that coming out it's the same and the strengths\nDo anybody anybody can take the said don't and they could speed it up or slow it down to see if there's anything inside the signal because I

on\nSo or the you know whatever that says it could be I get really even slowed down side band or a spent upside banned it could be a lot of things at the moment though they're saying this is what they're getting these are seismic waves or they could be the wind and they're not sure they saying it to be under the cross or it could be something blowing over the crust decreed this type of\nUh the
