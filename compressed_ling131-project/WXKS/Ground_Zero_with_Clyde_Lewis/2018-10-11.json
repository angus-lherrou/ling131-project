when they're discovering some of these particles but don't exist there they go against the standard model and that's what blows me away let's go to her when in Tennessee I current when you're in ground zero\n[noise] Hi Hi I'm I'm I found this topic very interesting and uh um so I did a little research on the train because it was my understanding that you know neutrinos generally just came from the sun\nRight during my research I found out they were getting you know from a number of sources are ablaze or large metallic cloud\nUm and and the supernova Nineteen eighty seven eight ... and and um and and the fact that neutrino or detectors have to be buried\nSo very very deep in the ground and they have the extremely large\nOr what what are you where it came to my attention is this has been an article where\nAre you know at the polls\nA media writes in in media or they're all they're they're found very easily and and it's common place to find things that just fall who stay in in that and touched reaching the ... of our planet right um so you know it came to mind a lot of tension that what\nIf while they were building this neutrino detector system has to be so deep in the ground so large that they ran across something they found something\nThat lady shouldn't have been file you know ... and and and that may explain these New Jersey a microorganism\nWell see that's the ... you know in my ... from from whatever they may have filed we're building this detectors or the question is you know where each\nOne is the fall out why does it go against the the uh when they called the classic model these go against everything the classic model opera Z right not son particles\nThese aren't new apart these aren't these are not neutrinos from the sun is not neutrinos from perhaps the quasars something else these are neutrinos from a what we call break off from any kind of I guess nuclear fuel or anything it would be similar to nuclear fuel so this is it is just somebody that doesn't belong on this planet\nIs being a ... for the Antarctic ... into space\nExactly because you know neutrinos generally follow one path and um the majority of them was perpendicular through our planet and they were finding their detected large numbers of these\nAre coming from the polls you know that that that's\nThat's a that's all right out and to make our magnetic field or or whatever even affect the trajectory of beef up the drummer particle right and\n... and you know if it is really concerns me 'cause we're you know they said he is detectors have to be buried deep underground in Neal with a water and in in order to you know to detect the neutrino ...\nLarge numbers of it has to bounce off a particle right ... ... a heavy water molecule right and it ... when it hits that he'd be water molecule it creates a flash that that the detector can detect\nIt left how they detected neutrinos now while they're building this incredibly large apparatus this you know this is the he's the trainer detectors\nAre quietly is not quite as widely known as the um had drawn a collider right at least those things are miles twenty miles law in in circumference that leads to take these tree or detectors they're\nNot quite as large right but they are in the vicinity of at gargantuan nature and\nWhen they're taking down into their eyes that has not been disturbed\nOr hundreds of thousands of years I mean I'm we might they look they may have found a a a a thing literally\nYeah like the movie yes they do a thing as if they're\nIn and and they could open a planet up to something we're not ready to him\nAnd they and that's why they had to bring down the Russian Orthodox a patriarch a president turning his day\nAll the all these our all of these um\nUm public figures in and politicians in and scientists to before for what you know it it it's scary\nCome really come see what we discovered come see the alien that we've discovered come see the the the creature that lives on practically nothing lives on Aaron sunshine doesn't live on any food lives in a harsh conditions\nAnd look what he's putting up putting off neutrinos that are not the classic model sending a signal out into space and then we're getting a signal back and this is why we're so concerned about type technical signatures SETI\nThey could just be the microorganism whatever they found charity you know we carry microorganism bacteria\nIn our bodies are foreigners just to live just for us to survive you know have good bombing that book right now what ... wherever they found that may be there and it may be very first to our biological system\nSo they're keeping contained there obviously but they they're they're they're certainly concerned\nAbout the signatures it's giving up there certainly concerned about what we're hearing what we're watching this the the fast radio burst the ... the the rumbles in the horn sounds in the air they're concerned about these things because they just don't know how to identify it they can I did I not\nCoincidence no it's not going to blow it is going out and said oh something's\nBeen found in an article or something it was a a actually sending a signal out from space I Believe it was more and more they traced the signals to an article the neutrinos signals were also trace\nThis is definitely communication and they won't tell us it's communication until they most certainly habit pinpointed as to how the communication was set and what was done and what the what the result will be\n[noise] in the in this day and age that can't hide anything no
