like the third of the angels rebelled against God remaining two thirds remained with God\nAnd then there was one third the rebuilding and they remained with state and it's all these magical numbers so if you do the math you got a hundred and forty four thousand divided by two sixteen get you sick sick sick thick thick thick thick thick thick that it's an item to divided by three two thirds point six six six\nNumber two thirds remained with God eventually became in one third of the rebelled against God what was Satan\nSix cube decor six five six times fixes to sixteen you divide one hundred and forty four thousand by six six six you get to sixteen to sixth inducing seem\nTo add to that that that is the word of God that is the key okay and numbers and images and cheese and codes\nAre all part\nOf the matrix system wherein so even God who is the probably the most intelligent program or we have no it was the power of means symbols numbers and coats\nAnd this is white tonight the argument that we're making Chris geometry geo her on the program that I ... the argument that we're making is that we live in a matrix\nAnd the reason why is because in PCs non playing characters are easily programmed the organics the ones that are that they use a good I'd say critical analysis of the ones that will not be programmed and they are the ones that are going to try and pull us out of whatever it is rent otherwise we'll be mesmerized by this online\nMagic Chris geo will go back to ground zero it's good to have a year\n[noise] um let me finish up this point I was making real quick about the politics because here we have the mainstream media\nI'm putting out a program and the program has been racist racist racist racist thrown at the White House right and then all of a sudden Kanye West shows up and he has this meeting at the er at the White House in what I saw was the dissolve meant of the less agenda\n'em to divide on race and then the mainstream media turns around and uses a derogatory term against ... that I Will not repeat on this brought the N. word but it\nIt go ... and ... to show how the script all of a sudden changed what an\nAbusive did you see the the the there was a traffic it was being blocked in Portland the anti ... members were blocking and directing traffic well guy pulls up in a car\nAnd some guy who was holding a plate of tacos I don't know why but he was with the group and he started yelling at the guy goes you look like a Whitey I bet you're a Whitey aren't you he says to I'm gonna go on this guy's a white guy calling another guy all Whitey say when I was ... we have a a a black faceless and PC\nOn uh CNN calling ... n word that can read is what he said\nExactly and so all of a sudden what happened is that the script just changed on the PCs and they don't know how to handle this and it just goes to show they're just running a script or that they've been pre programmed with\nSo um you were talking about numbers and a number so symbolism and numbers play a big big role in this you were talking about the ... and PC means the way the means or ... and so on and so forth I mean there are so many different levels that we can take this to come\nFrom what direction do we break this down in because well I just it's huge\nI just want to point out that parents and they can actually called me and this was before this is like not in Nineteen Ninety this is\nTen Twenty years before this time that we're in right now it's called the mean\nThe smallest unit of an idea that still has coherent see and what a genius to biology I mean it's to ideology and so you need a lawn chair mean boldly and see it that will replicate Jess like jeans replicate and in fact and move into the organism that society and ... as I Do that society operates on a kind of\nBiological economy then I Believe these names are the key to societal evolution\nAnd you see with within PCs I I\nJust have to say it's almost like they they don't understand how to even make means\nIs that it doesn't make any sense to in order to send them in some way whereas the organics are\nFull of them and and constantly creating these means and they really do change our society and drastic ways very quickly\nWell maybe I could use some other magical terms of people are more familiar with like ... ah there's a ... a mind for them it is that when you manifest it becomes an ... which is of course another recalled concept which is a thought form or a collective group mind\nMaking a thought form that becomes a ton of it's kind of like slender man okay I I Would say this Letterman's kind of an egg regards Letterman really\nSentiment is is fictional he was made on the Internet okay but he becomes real\nWhen two little girls Moore another girl into a playground\nAnd ... and stab her because they say that this this egg records that serving a master whichever the master the creator is is actually influencing these girls to go and kill something\nSo that's what you got you got a a mean you have a toll but you have an ... and those things are are set out to grow into become either monsters or or just serve it and once again the hunk ... says the same thing and what is\nThe un PC me it is the bald\nThe you know ... basically does the will of its master\nRight exactly and it it really it's it's one of those start changing devices that that is that result it's the backlash against this these autonomy and that means a lot of time and it's I guess you could say\nOr anti autonomy thinking process that just totally dissolves any boundaries that that that whenever the media or whatever the the whoever's in control of all this is putting out it dissolves all of that in a in a\nSplit second and it and it that's what makes them so angry about this when ever people do come up with means that really do change people's minds and it really quick way\nWell this is you know even more ancient magic let's go back to the Jews okay let's go back to ... what was going but he was a a it was an animated anthropomorphic being made of clay\nThat was there to protect it was a monster that was created to protect the Jews pretty much it was there to protect the children in Prague and and so ah they created this this this creature out of clay uh he was harmless to to ah those he was a made for but he would attack those who are trying to attack them\nAnd and so this is the same principles the idea of creating\nAn Internet gum creating an Internet amongst us an Internet ... an Internet ... if people you know they don't understand the meaning of means means are certainly like this they are the thought forms that when when they are unleashed\nThey can cause trouble they can call it caused ill will but once again goes back to what Chris has been saying is is if it's so easy to create a ... if it's so easy to create an\nAnswer ... perfect form that is illustrating a programmed a botched if you will\nThan we know that we live in a matrix we live in a programmable world that the that they're it's getting easier to program because people are becoming more susceptible\nAnd not dealing with plane consciousness they're not dealing with a what we called primitive consciousness the idea that they can either feel or understand anything at all and I think this is the confusing part is because people are getting so confused now\nThat they're reaching a point where they can't even find you know simple\nConsciousness they have to seek it out elsewhere Christian a tree deal with a set on ground zero fascinating discussion and I
