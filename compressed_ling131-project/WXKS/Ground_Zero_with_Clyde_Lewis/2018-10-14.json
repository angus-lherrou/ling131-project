Bush started the conversation about putting them back on the moon to Ryan program the ... the crew exploration vehicle\nBy two thousand eight you know we're supposed to be a working towards going to the moon getting there by twenty fourteen normally no later than twenty Fifteen didn't happen why because in two thousand nine actually it was a two thousand nine round two thousand nine rock Obama pulled the plug\nBut uh it it was because of a a a failed mission that we had to go to the moon with the LCROSS a rocket\nBull cratered the moon's see if there was water which didn't make any sense because we already had surveyor and landers in and orbiters mapped the moon Clementine actually mapped the moon in Nineteen Ninety four and a seven times was able to deliver more than one point eight million digital images of the moon back to the ground\nAnd um\nThere was the interest satellite they were ground tracking the stations are but they they were bad the ... ground tracking satellites issue is picking up on these images\nSo\nEverything is accessible to the general public via the Internet\nAnd one scientist reviewed the data from Clementine they already found the existence of ice within the moon's creator so why did they did as well you know it was a failure nonetheless the LCROSS mission was a failure rock Obama pulled the funding from a vis a constellation Orion a project\nWhich kept us from going to the moon and a nine billion dollars is cut from the program and uh it slows down now here we are in twenty team\nWe've been told the moon is the gold again what's really cool\nIs it today it was reported at Seventeen scientists often to report stating that searching for signs of life\nShould be part of every future national NASA mission\nAt the briefing was authored by National Academy of Sciences engineering in medicine it says it says in the briefing and says that ah\nIt's very important\nThat the new NASA missions include a studies that astrobiology\nStudies of how life originated on earth and how it might have evolved elsewhere in the universe in every phase of all NASA missions destined for space from inception conceptualization they have to plan on trying to find a way to discover life in space\nAnd I think ... it's obvious the reason why they're saying is is because yes they have confidence that they found these techno signatures they found the group vehicle waves are in fact Russian scientists to colliding starts thinking it was armada I played the tones of the stars coming out of Senate south alarms all over the country so I won't be doing that again\nBut um\nAnd in fact this awful arms of shutdown radio station so if I had that Arabs because of that ah\nBut in recent years we in the show has been discussing that\nThousands of exoplanets and biologists were actually uncovering new insights to the complexity diversity of life on earth and and also a means discoveries would bolster and move closer to the chance to life could exist on other worlds and therefore\nAll space X ray exploration missions now should incorporate technology to find traces of alien organisms\nSo you know with the number of exoplanets they've discovered with all the ideas about life on other planets scientists recommending but NASA accelerate the development of technologies\nTo detect microscopic organisms citing the current lack of a single flight ready instrument meaning there isn't anything ready now nothing they can fly out the space to take care of this problem nothing that can traveled to distill rose and measured the composition of its elements minerals organic matter that sort of thing so the report suggests\nThat direct imaging systems to suppress star like should be used outside our solar system to improved detection a bio signatures from planet that might orbit those stars NASA also uh is being told they can plan for more missions appear under the surface of exoplanets however\nThe efforts to locate extraterrestrials either in our solar system are light years away is going to cost a lot of money and you need do advanced technology to do it\nWell here's the deal NASA space launch system B. S. L. S. the new rocket they were putting together to go to the moon was supposed to be the design to go to the moon and ... and then eventually go to Mars was a very powerful rocket\nApparently um it's running years behind a schedule is a lot of major cost overruns and it just got slammed by internal audit\nTwelve point two billion dollars to develop this launch system a Wednesday the auditors came in public to report highlighting problems with the work of NASA and bowling\nAnd the report flags sixty four million dollars in extra fees were given a NASA they slammed bowling for poor for a poor performance and question the long term sustainability of the super rocket program\nAnd the report even calls into question the sustainability of an entire project meaning that even with all the bright ideas and designs and the idea that we can go out and find aliens now this rocket won't even make it off the launch pad for years William and make it to the moon\nSo this whole newly manned moon project that we're supposed to have going on but twenty twenty ... may not happen now so I don't think space forces going to happen either I mean so you know once again we have this movie first man\nA big old infomercial for NASA and they can't even get a rocket off the ground sure we can sit up satellites probes robots but a man to the moon with a new rocket yeah we can't do that\nDon't have any more I mean we're going to do what we were gonna do it in twenty Fifteen\nBut Barack Obama made that go away and it was you were still supposed to send them out of the moon by twenty twenty and Ashley will not even be able to do that [noise]\nHe learned must companies rebuild the first private citizen to be sent around the moon but guess what [noise] ban and build a rocket for that yet either so the question is whether or not the first space tourist will ever get off the ground\nWe had the technology in sixty nine [noise] can we just go back I mean some of the scientists I'm sure are still alive\nYou know in in this is kind of like the old joke remember that old moron joke and say hey you hear about the more on that didn't uh there wasn't that they couldn't find ice for his coke\nOr the reason why is the guy that invented it died\nThe same thing I mean look he was with why can't we do this why can't it be done and then there's like once again raise your eyebrows sort of the possibility that we never went to the we didn't think general or even went to the moon ever\nThey just frustrates me we got all kinds of stuff out there waiting for us and we can get to it\nDon't have the technology or the money\nTo really fix every three thirty seven hundred will be back [noise]\n\n\nWhat happened you used to go hours without visiting the bathroom now it seems like you're

this a T Barnes with on the show when they could be classified some ... project ... guard with the ... project very fifty one you know he told us he said that their new in the satellites were coming overhead so they had to go out on the tarmac\nAnd they had to put cardboard planes on the tarmac to give the Russians the idea that they're working on some sort of an aircraft oh I remember something you know they used they used to put a fake aircraft that big car board airplanes they used to put on the on the runways review if you wanted to pull the Russian\nYeah yeah I remember that\nSo I I mean if they're putting fake cardboard planes on the tarmac it could be one that could easily uh\nSome you know grace soil put it somewhere on the sound stage\nAnd uh and make it happen they they could easily do that I\nMean I don't see why it it's beyond the pale the thing they couldn't set something up or do close ups of a of a moon modeled just like they did or you know for Star Wars I mean what Lucas did was basically what they taught him\nA what he learned from the NASA mission when he made Star Wars he knew they were able to use miniature ... I mean who would've thought miniature so advanced would give you the idea that you're looking at something like a death star it was it was just amazing\nWell that's very true yeah that's yeah and they they could possibly do it but you know and then another thing I I don't think our scientists now have the engineering backgrounds as it for now set back then as well\nSo that could be another thing or not coming up with things you know if you think about it they're searching for life but they're not looking for electromagnetic signatures you know you'd have to be alone or half of them oh well I have about like magnetic signature yes see what I mean\nYeah well I mean they they have this or they just they come out with all this stuff saying we want y'all to you know when you do your mission has got to have some sort of a plan to find alien life whatever you do from conceptualization to beyond\nYou gotta you gotta make this happen and then they say well okay but we're kind of like a over budgeted for the last program so what are we going to\nNow ... ... right yeah when I have to weigh out there that I\nI ... either way I I think I Will come out and the next few years whether that it or not it'll happen\nWhile I don't think they're ever going to go back on their uh I mean they were going to go back on their ideas or he went to the moon but thinking about this you know before Kennedy died you know he was talking with the Russians about UFOs don't kinds of other crazy stuff I mean what if he said that the Russians\nHey we're gonna we're going to the moon and that we're trying to go to a ... go to the moon and uh you know we gave you a little bit of money you act you know\nYou read this or this little space race a little more interesting and I I just would say that you know the space race was wasn't really a space race if it was\nRussia basically having an interest in space the United states saying wait a minute they can't have an interest in space we don't want them to spy on us and then they started to say well hey we challenge you do a race that I Am compared to like the fat kid going up to the the ... guy saying hey I'm going to I'm going I'm going to run a race with you and I'm going to beat you", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Ground Zero with Clyde Lewis", "city": "Newton", "day": "14"}
