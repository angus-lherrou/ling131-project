going to movie reefer madness yeah I remember ... ...\nA a Mexican immigrants who are coming to this country for a year to take the lead us back in the Nineteen twenties actually trying to ... century ... Spanish civil war maybe after that\nStash American or a ... a ... a lot of Mexican starting to come over here at the in the early part of the twenty century and they brought marijuana with them so marijuana became identified with Mexican immigrants and ah this was around the time of alcohol prohibition and\nA government got his great idea to uh to uh to marijuana along with alcohol and we really complain about marijuana 'cause nobody really knew what marijuana marijuana was back then\nBut uh they made a name to create in the campaign around reefer madness this idea that if you smoke pot you would go crazy and there's a funny movie now wasn't funny at the time called re from Madison talks about all the stuff\nOr ... but they couldn't make it illegal because it was a plant so they had to do is to create something called the marijuana tax act which I don't know if you heard of that a\nMarijuana tax act a ... put people in jail for not declaring their marijuana\nAnd they put a tax on marijuana and he said he didn't declare tried marijuana and the taxes on it you go to jail and then the Nineteen seventies they actually are completely ... or ... with Nixon's war on drugs they actually completely may marijuana illegal and it's been illegal ever said but the fact of the matter is\nIs that people have been smoking pot straight through prohibition or not and our ... our jail are ill with people who are\nThey are simply because they were selling or smoking or possessing marijuana and like you said earlier we created this police that a police state around are around people ah ah to surround people who simply want to get high whether it's through\nA marijuana or ... or even with opiate why don't why is that we don't have a prohibition against alcohol but we know that marijuana clogged I'll tell\nYou this is the thing that uh you know and and for me I guess it sets be apart from a lot of talk show hosts are mostly conservative radio stations because I live in Portland, Oregon where of course it's legal or both recreationally andme ... to to to uh use marijuana use cannabis and um what's really funny is that when I was a teenager\nA and of course one of the rights of passages or in some in some areas is to actually smoke pot\nAnd uh when I did and it was a teenager I smoked it and of course Scott Hi a couple of times they never touched it again and it was funny is that uh you know after you know you make a pact with you so I'm not going to touch this is not good for me to do this I don't think it's good for my body to do this\nThen I got cancer right and uh when I got cancer it became a so difficult to actually\nA deal with the law did every day the feeling of ah a foggy had all this stuff felt bad one of my friends came by and he says hey\nI Want to have you try something and it looked as though no no no I Can't do this and he says what's wrong he says I said I did it in high school it's silly you know no big deal I'm not going to and he said no give it a try and he says I'm a uses and and and it was a guy that it would just completely out of character for him to suggest to me\nThat I should try cannabis and so I did and uh it it it basically took the pain completely away and it was not like some psychosomatic\nDeal where you know some idiot ... helped me that that came to me because I was totally against the idea\nAnd I certainly changed my mind in one of the things they found that in studies with older people who have had these hang ups about\nUh things like a cannabis that they've uh let them use CBD Oil Somalian does it as an ointment on their joints and ever ... ever since they've been given it or if they're given it to end brownie form or an edible form\nThey find that it's far more preferable to the side effects they get from a using a kind of a a a a an an opiate\nAnd so that's the problem is that it has such a bad rap and drugs for this country have such a bad rap and see in other countries in Europe in England places\nAll over the world they they treat a this type of a crisis not with jail time and and punishment they they actually go in and they give them a medical arrest or they put them in the hospital and they have to be treated\nAnd and and they cannot be released from the hospital facility until they show that they're clean and ah and I'm thinking that I think it would be a far better or a far better thing for this country to look at people with this is not feeling morally but they actually people who are in need of help\nAnd they are in need of a ... they are in need of medical care and I know that that may put a burden but there are ways that we can develop facilities we developed cancer facilities were developed a facilities for specialized treatments\nAnd I think the facilities a specialized treatments on various drugs some of the more lethal ones like crack or uh or or or even heroin addiction and other addictions you know everybody complains about you know the needles everywhere well if we were to find people\nPut them in facilities and have him is not going as criminals and be trained to be put into the position of criminals there actually put into hospitals where they were under\nA medical arrest that would be something I think would be an idea that we would need in this country to help ... rehab all the people that have gone through this because the problem is bad and you can agree with me I Know the doctors do not know how to actually get rid of pain that's one of the things pain is one of those things I said at the beginning\nBut it evolves over time and you even brought up existential paying you brought up deep pain inside the body that is not pain but it's felt physically but it's pain that is spelled on a on a I guess you could call on a conscious level or or your consciousness is in pain or wracked with pain\nExplained Al Gore does work on that kind of pay they do yes absolutely that's why people do it I mean I I don't I Can't speak from personal experience but I Know that people I've spoken to many people who say that they like\nThings like ... and uh I don't know if you've heard of that is a similar to opiate similar they went over it or or biking down or Percocet\nBecause it makes them they say it makes them feel good\nAnd what they really mean is that it makes them it takes them out of their painter the pain of existence you know we we live our lives as the roast that most people live their life was quite a sense of quiet desperation ... and like we get beaten down over time\nAnd that creates just a sense of I don't want to be alive basically you know what I mean one of the scariest\nThings one of the scariest things about opiates and I'll tell you this this was a scary for me I remember when I had my first cancer surgery and uh I was given a a pain that I don't remember what it was I was in the hospital and all of a sudden I felt balance I felt no pain and I felt great because you know after you're dealing with the initial pain and you're feeling was stitches and you're\nYou know this is my got here and it's been caught you know you can't move because it you know you your core has been cut and you can't move and it was really weird it was a weird experience to have something that takes the pain completely away and you feel balanced and that's exactly how I felt when I needed the pain medication\nOr to get rid of my pain and see that's the thing is it's the idea of the balance at times\nFeeling that balance when the pain will not go away and you have that balance of of calm where you have that moment where the ... the the warmth Russia's over you and the pan is gone but like I said before there's dependence where you take that pain away because you're dependent on appeal to take the pain away\nAnd then when the pain is gone and you still take the pill that's when you realize maybe I'm addicted or maybe have an addiction to the smell\nIs your body down regulate its own natural production so all of a sudden your decision you're out like you say you're out of balance what's really interesting to me why and how much of the stuff that we talk about it affects the central pain for example could be related to things like inflammation inside the body from too much sugar Yeah Yup\nOr hourly sufficiency maybe we're not getting enough I think we know if you take out of the diet completely one of the things that happened to get anxious to pry\nSo maybe there's people are suffering from from the conditions fulfilling ever teaches this stuff but now they they gave us the food pyramid but they never say hey you know what if you eliminate sugar from your\nDiet side of the information is going to go away just like that you were to lose weight you're going to feel better about yourself and that's how it's going to happen\nBut we limited empire quiet where the empire depends on us eating sugar and eating grains and eating fast food and eating and eating and eating so they are well can be created yeah we again it comes right back down to understanding our body\nAs an alternative to mailed absentee ballot and individual counties can
