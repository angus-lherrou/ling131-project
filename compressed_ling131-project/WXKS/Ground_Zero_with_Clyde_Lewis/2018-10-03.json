Shakur levy remember that\nYeah I remember that it it after the planes hit the towers\nAnd they lost like getting a function they your but after the ... towers that story was that was a guy like you didn't hear about it\nSo do you say oh I Love you I mean but she she disappeared in May of two thousand one right and uh yeah I mean that was a the hot news item into the the towers went down and then that everyone was like by after that you know no more are talking about Gary Condit\nWell I'm thinking this is comparable with Kevin for\nWell I I yeah I I but Gary wasn't planning on a or B being achieved justice [laughter] we're having one again we have an extramarital affair story we have\nA a dead woman Chandra Levy a we have an investigation started in may and probably just disappeared off the map after that no one cared about the because of the nine eleven attacks\nAnd you're right you know there's that that that's a pretty big deal to cover up bad to have a bat but uh I Would say that you know\nThey're not connected but I Would say that something like this once again distracts people from other stories and of course I'm sure many people lost track of what happened was John relieving the Chandra Levy case would Gary Cohn did that is if they were able to look through the dust clubs of the nine eleven attacks\nRight okay well I just wanted to put that out there and I'll let you get to not\nVery good very good point though very good comparison history you get your brownie points for being a story about I think it ... it and you've been I Love you too man skilled at TJ in Rhode Island I don't either I\nMight I might be quick as much as I can be bought you obviously ... what does two plus one plus eight at up to\nTwo plus one plus eight yep ... eleven\nThat's right and what does two plus there are a plus one plus eight add up to\nUm London\nOr try and win was nine what was what was that date back in September\nAnd then I ... when when I was\nOne plus one add up to\nNine plus one plus one yep twelve\nNine oh want a loving sorry that's right\nOr the nine eleven had the total eleven twenty Eighteen eleven you have this thing going on at two Eighteen as you said right\nWhich is an eleven eleven yeah and we just had a job or who was murdered in DC not too long ago\nRyan Miller to what was discussed just recently by the previous caller right Kentucky yeah it does have an eerie quality to it in\n... you want if you want to get technical when was the brown broken for the Pentagon\nWhat I've what day was that September eleventh\nAll right yeah I Would say just one thing but I was calling up about the rice and to to go on Ben and I forgot\nWhere the young man was from but when he was speculating on it being possibly from someone on the Republican or or Republicans sympathetic side because if you recall back in terms of predicting programming what happened to the general in Venezuela where they accused him of staging\nHis little assassination attempt with that drone ... might have tip their hand right they're letting you know in advance what was coming\nWhile I mean you can see that there was something going on with these ah when I called these gain and function exercise I Believe the Emirates plane was part of that\nI Believe that uh when you have a group of people on the on the plane and they all complain of flu like symptoms all at once that's not a flu that's something else does\nSmack of of rice in poisoning and I'll just to be clear Nineteen forty one nine eleven September eleven Nineteen forty one was in the Pentagon round was broken for the Pentagon then so I Know nine eleven to be talked about two\nMen then remember overseas there's a lot of provocative behavior taking place upon the part of the United states where they're already threatening to strike a Russian missile or install installation because of start treaty violations and they're moving a shift to the ass off to\nSee a off of the Ukrainian coastline over there and they're Crimea right and so I mean there's a lot of powder keg occurring right now within the world\nRight and so there are a lot of distractions but the thing is is that how are these distractions affecting them both how are they affect you invest\nThe vote I Will tell you you don't have to I wouldn't even worry about it because I'm already screaming now the court has been de legitimize by Mitch McConnell's machinations and when something comes down that's going to be a dramatic decision that will be the battle cry\nWill be confirmed yeah and when he finally does make a decision for something that will become a fifty fifty unpopularity then it will be pointed out that while you can politicize a court you can't make it political\nHow you feel though if the FBI did not release the information about cabinet and his activities when he was in high school\nOh I Would be I Would be ripping but I've also ripping based on the fact that there's this ... this a speculation on the part of Fox News that they're gonna already be finished by ...\nNow you have the ... not ... I'm Sorry to tell you it's not speculation in fact I knew it was going to be done and over with on when as far as news that I heard it already from inside or that I have\nBut the speculation will be now that Mitch McConnell pressure them to wrap it up to a quicker than would necessarily be a\nNecessarily the FBI are quite frankly all they had to do is just to value wait a certain times in certain other things he could be guilty as hell and they wouldn't tell you\nOh yeah but don't Mitch McConnell has to take the fall based upon the fact that they'll say his fingerprints are over this\nDoesn't matter they're getting what they are getting and the American people are going to a prize over it and that yeah well that's what I really don't\nCause you when you when you start playing with the very last\nWord because it's not right because that's the last word but it's ... it's the last it's ... it's the last word not because it's right but because it is the last word once you start making something from politicized the political that nobody's going to have faith and or in in the integrity of that institution anymore\nWell I think we've lost faith Eighteen years ago you didn't really I Do I did and I have that's why I'm not political\nWell see that's why I don't understand your problem with people again being harassed you say by it I don't call that harassed and I think\nThat is around ... book if I if I get on an escalator and a woman says to me oh you turn your back on women as I treat women I look back at her and say no I'm On an escalator I'm getting away from you jumping all over me and yelling at me for something I have no control over\nBut they wouldn't be doing it to you because you're not a person who takes on the position of publicity and demanding attention\nAt it and then even then I had\nThis agreement because I still consider it better than a presidential candidate who says to people beat the cream cheese out of somebody and I'll pay\nFor your legal you know one excuses Trump I don't excuse Trump for what he says in fact he causes own problems on his own but when you have\nPeople that that basically ... things about you in public and yell at him out all over the place I get very angry about it in fact I get mad when people assume things about me being run through and the reason why they stand\nOn anything and you have and I need I don't know why you don't have a matter\nOf men do not have mattered and I I Do have power I have I have three hundred stations across the country to give me power\nBut in terms of being able to directly affect change or not a politician you don't have that kind of\nPower [noise] I don't know about ... celebrity yet that but again you don't take positions on anything you you'll offer hypotheses and have your guests and your uh\nSure I offer hypotheses that seem to come through now don't\nBut that's still it's still something you let people debate you don't take a stab you throw\nIt out there and we all get to talk about right but the thing is the OJ here's a thing as simple as I may be and it's maybe not as powerful as a politician I may be\nAnd a dry cough at night\nFox News radio I'm Carmen Robert
