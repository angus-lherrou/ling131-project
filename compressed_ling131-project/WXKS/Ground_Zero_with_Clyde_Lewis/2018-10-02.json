Ninety four or five and what did you manage to get you on TALK twelve hundred and I heard the radio station\nStanding by the judge ...\nCallahan Fox News President Trump giving Supreme Court nominee judge Brett Kavanaugh he was full support Monday Night at a campaign rally in Tennessee again questioning Democrat motives in the confirmation process\nDemocrats are willing to do anything and to hurt anyone to get their way like they're doing\nAll working for the green economy right and the smart city sounds like a a digital utopian of course they're pitcher get degeneration ... cities were Generation Z\nBut the as smart city is a place where data eliminates first world hassles dangers and injustices that's what they're claiming but there are problems\nIt's each march cities are are based primarily on data old data if you want data unique sensors it's not like roads buildings with street lights are just going to wake up magically it started chatting about the weather no\nWe need sensors did she hears smell taste didn't feel on behalf of these machines we need\nSensors to tell us when the bridge needs to be repaired we need sensors to tell us have been damaged gonna break we need sensors to remind us or to ... that may be a blood is about to happen or owners\nQuakes about to happen in anything that can be thrown in his data any data information they can get they'll have to do it by using sensors\n\nSensors measure temperature traffic patterns foot traffic air quality\nInfrastructure integrity and just go down the list of things that these data sensors are supposed to give us well Lux research and innovation researching advisory firm filed a report that suggested the world will have to deploy one trillion sensors by twenty twenty in order to fit\nThe criteria for the UN's edict on smart cities is smart city network shows redesign smart cities around the data we want instead of the wiring we have\nThis is where it gets more complex because mass data aggregation will establish a lot of truth about how our cities are being run\nIt's going to lead us to a social credit score for you or me and everyone else and a social credit score on the quality of life metrics that each city will have so let's\nSay you want to make a choice of where you want to move your family you could look at a smart city or the smart city metrics guide based on a number based on social credit based on what kind of people live there the social credit scores are extremely low in a part of a different part of the country people don't want to associate with people with a low credit scores\n\nAnd so we're going to create you know where to move everybody in the city and then we're going to have to figure out which cities are the best in the most desirable by behavioral my behavior data data by a way of life data or the quality of life data okay so we're going to sign these smart seems to be perfect and then the aggregation\nWill be reviewed and we'll be adhered to and it's going to lead us to score cities is the latest the score people uh you know it'd be like one big Yelp fast have you ever been to Yelp you know you can destroy your business by giving a business a bad review on Yelp\nIf you get enough people to rally around the basically a you know a right some bad stuff about a business you do that on Yelp yeah chosen business right there and there are businesses that have sued\nTo get yelled to remove certain things because people look at that and they go oh well managing that being you twenty four hours a day I imagine that being your city twenty four hours a day but how are we going to drop one trillion sensors\nBy twenty twenty okay that means we have to drop a trillion at once we can't do it we can't drop you know one sense\nOr a year or even a million sense as a year or once a year you you can't do that All right so it can be difficult to meet that by twenty twenty so how do we do is how do we how do they get the problem with the smart city taking care of\nWell we do it with dust\nWould your smart as we do it with nano particles we get I mean look I was discussing this to the ground zero and I said this is the future this is the Internet of things is is your city this is robo sex is everything and they say there's a glut of news about this tech stuff well it's interesting as a lot of it\nThey have to talk about the smart cities and how your smart city away\nToo with all the moves by the FCC and other authorities you're going to find a new development of five gee fell networks that'll all be mandatory in standard\n\nComing up on the third of October they're going to be tasked with your phone you know why because they want to figure out if they can do this for the phone systems\nYour phone system is going to be part of the pan off the gun ban opt gun is like a prison where everything is seen from all angles it's like big TV screens actually remembering Batman movie Batman\nWhere Batman had that whole thing of screens Morgan Freeman says I'll never do this again I'm going to destroy it all\nOr Alfred I Can't remember what was I think it was either Morgan Freeman or Alfred set at ... Morgan Freeman just shows up all the time and then whenever he shows up I Will pay attention to Morgan Freeman whatever he says I won't pay attention Morgan Freeman says I Will not allow this to go on anymore\nOnly has one time you're going to use all of these cell phones and all of this data to find one man to find the joker\nNow that's basically it except they're not going to be using cell phones that they were using nano particles nanotech\nLocal governments are no longer allowed to restrict the deployment of these wireless infrastructure sites in fact they're being pressured to get their projects figured out and budget and underway within sixty to Ninety Days for consideration for applications to small cells and that's pretty much taking away right now\n\nWe move is critical for deployment of five gee wireless communications his wireless signals for twenty four and twenty ... bands\nAre very short and significant limits to disease or localities and all of this so this means in some cases in all cases the next generation of high speed wireless Internet is a giveaway to judge Judy telecommunications companies that will eventually strip government of local\nControl the tech no companies will run government eventually\nThey have to\nIn fact if you really want to if you really want to look at ... in a different way all you have to do is see him as a world leader because he really is\nHe's he's the ... is a world leader he leaves the world with these little social media\n\nSo he is actually just as powerful\nIf not more powerful than the president and a lot of respects\nMe doesn't control or maintain armies and he doesn't order the deaths of people are nor does the order armies to go to war\nBut he certainly can make life hell for any government who wants to somehow get involved with a social media practices in censorship that's why Google kissing China's asked right now is really appalling in my opinion would drag and fly\n\nI mean why is up you know I I don't think people see the big picture here you make deals with a country that treats people like garbage you you\nYou make deals with it with a country that wipes out four thousand Web sites because there are comfortable about what you do ... who\nWho who ah schools should be ashamed of themselves\nGoogle should be ashamed and they shouldn't be shame they have a monopoly on search engines on the Internet right now they should be ashamed of themselves for what they're doing\nWhere we could time word is important to have dialogue and what exactly it means\nTo be a human in a technological world how humanity and machines don't have to be opposed to one another\nWe have to work with machines and knowledge that they are flawed justice we are\nAnd there were people and and then we have a place to control we take control back to that of the human taking control as we keep pushing forward through the new century and the new millennium it's becoming more parent\nBut the human touch with the human role of things has been sidelined [noise]\nYou're not going to be able to put one trillion sensors over any place on this planet unless you drop\nDust [noise]\nJulian sons
