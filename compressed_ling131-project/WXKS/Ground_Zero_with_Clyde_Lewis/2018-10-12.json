she did no one is realizing is they use of the word civil\nSuggesting exactly the opposite of what she is saying she's calling on all the people who don't understand what civil war means and using that word as I\nSaid it's a dog whistle it's so subtle that you didn't pick up on it wow\nShe all she had it was dropped that word because it confuses too many people and that way she's not saying anything bad she's nine citing any violence she's just saying I'm don't be nice but she's using that word because\nWe don't understand it and it has a lot of connotations that we don't even understand\nBut in that case then she's going to have it backfire on her when you agree what do you mean well I mean if she was you know if it was a dog whistle and you've seen or how you know people have acted towards the conservatives you've seen you know like Ted Cruz being harassed I'm not ... you know\nI'm I'm not sure she knows what she did I'm not sure she goes and she said I think somebody
