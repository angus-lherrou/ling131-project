{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WXKS", "content": "Yeah and and and how many how many years ago was the seven years ago you said correct yeah I mean in those days I don't think there was a bar violation but do you want to get back at him for a screw your wife at the time or you just basically wanna blow it off\nWell you know I don't know if you're going to make out of it yeah you're gonna make life\nMiserable so ah if you want you you certainly can I don't think much is going to come of it or they're going to do a bar investigation he's going to obviously you have to defend themselves probably hire a lawyer or an expert representing odd representing a [laughter] it was representing their lawyers who represent lawyers in front of the bar\nAnd um you know I was a oh and I once had a complaint against me that was quite had a couple of complaints against the these crazy crazy complaints ... a basic based on the handle on the law the advice I give because some people it took me seriously\nI relied on that anyway but I had to you know I brought in a lawyer or who specialize\nIn this the first time out or when I was actually friday night now I don't bother so it's your call here called why think anything's going to come of it no why as I said because it wasn't a conflict it was the white you were a notch\nA bean I you were not a she was not being representative wasn't a divorce case where there was clearly a conflict so ah I just think the two of them got it on\nA daily rate there your whole anyway yes\nAll right um well I'm oh\nGod I hate these winds All right let's try at a ...\nWe just lost you know there should be technology out there that overcomes this wouldn't you think by this day and age\nI mean we can send the guy to the moon that doesn't even work anymore last time there was a guy in the moon was in the seventies so that's kind of stupid so we're going to be able to we can send a guide to Mars\nRight at some point and so he calls back he calls back All right oh hello Chris\nWelcome to handle on the law Chris yeah there's\nA new tax law that allows me to a man that tax return from Eighteen years ago to get a refund paid on military severance pay back then I was married to a someone that I cannot locate now are hiding from having to pay ... or\nSo I have no way of contacting her and I haven't heard from her and like sixteen years [laughter] I don't know how to manage a tax return that would join with only one signature\nAh there there has to be a way of doing that\nBecause if the law allows someone\nTo file an amended return Twenty years later Eighteen years later a there's a a decent chance at the other partner their spouse or a ... he's not around\nEither can't be found a somewhere out there I remarried died whatever so I there there has to be a way within the rules of the IRS\nBecause the Irish is pretty good about issuing five thousand new rules every other minute so the trick is to find an accountant straight out accountant who understands these rules and now when you file your tax returns you have an accountant\nChris yeah yeah have you asked your accountant about this\nYes and he wasn't curve anywhere could do it then you have and I happen to have an appointment with the Iraq on friday\nAnd that is one day yeah that's the way I'm Glad you're asking me because of my vast expertise would not only this isn't tax law or this or tax returns that of course I you know when I have a complicated problem do you think I shouldn't researched\nTo look it up now I go to Mike counting Chris just like you did not what you did is you went a step beyond and that is what I Would tell you if your account and doesn't know or several accountants you make an appointment with the Irish and yet and you might occur\nDrafted that I actually buying it might go and uh maybe ... ... ...\nNo no I I I don't know why I don't know if I Would do that I don't know if I Would do that what I Would say to the IRS is do I have to find her and uh then I Will then I'll go to extraordinary lengths to find her and that's when I go out\nSeventy grand behind it All right that's another issue and and they made this and you and and you may be able to get\nThe whole thing okay based on the child support order so I the magical signature ah she's she's still entitled to happen yeah\nNow there could be a way where and this happens all the time with child support the IRS holds off I mean it'll grab people's money\nArcade cars and that that stayed right now we're ... supposed to be around her\nOkay so you're halfway there definitely time to talk to and IRS agent and and if the IRS Egypt doesn't know that rules specifically and it doesn't have any experience or or it doesn't really understand that you go to a supervisor and you ask for someone who understands what's going on because it's pretty obscure stuff\nAnd it's not as ... and IRAs Asian who doesn't I understand this is incompetent in any way I mean if you ever look at the IRS code if you ever look at the Internal Revenue code these our phone books fit\nWith hundreds of thousands of rules\nAnd you're not normally cook real to amend after three years\nWell they've changed the law I Wonder if you want to ask me I would've said no but if they passed a law that is a different than we are in great shape\nIt's for military better yeah obviously are on fabric All right All right so is there any of 'em out there to get their return\nSo we're talking about a very narrow narrow description of a very narrow group of people and so you simply need someone who understands it and you're doing everything right man on there is nothing more I can give you other than you're doing everything right\nAlso let me tell you about life like here's something they do right and life locked protects your identity\nAnd of course another hack this was Facebook Fifteen million accounts oh of course why not there isn't a person in this country has had Information Act already and it just doesn't exist so\nOh I've been a customer of life lock and I'm suggesting you look at them to a customer for ten years and they saved me from identity theft a couple of times will join me and my daughter\nAnd here's what they've done is they've added Norton Security to their program lifelike protect your identity nor is security protects your devices against virus attacks\nAnd if you have a problem with either one or they will work to fix the problem now no one could stop every cyber threat or prevent all id theft or monitor every transaction every business spotlight block

yeah\nBig moon landing right\nWell I don't know if they did or not I'm just saying if if they did it was genius anyhow\nWellbeing about this uh TV Barnes was on the show when they could be classified some ox Card Project ... guard with the ... project very fifty one you know he told us he said that the new in the satellites were coming overhead so they had to go out on the tarmac and they had to put\nCardboard planes on the tarmac to give the Russians the idea that they're working on some sort of an aircraft oh I remember something you know they used they used to put a fake aircraft that big car board airplanes they used to put on the on the runways review if you wanted to pull the Russian\nYeah yeah I remember that\nSo I I mean it's all their money and they're putting fake cardboard planes on the tarmac it could be one that can easily uh put together some you know great soil what it somewhere on the sound stage and uh and make it happen that we could easily do that I mean I don't see why it it's beyond the pale whipping\nThey couldn't set something up or do close up to the\nMoon modeled just like they did uh\nBut first Star Wars I mean what Lucas did was basically what they taught him a what he learned from the NASA mission when he made Star Wars he knew they were able to use miniature ... I mean who would've thought miniatures so advanced would give you the idea that you're looking at something like a death star it was it was just amazing\nWell that's very true yeah that's yeah and they they could possibly do it but I you know and then another thing I I don't think our scientists now have the engineering backgrounds as they get for NASA back then as well so that could be another thing might are now coming up with things\nYou know if you think about it they're searching for life but they're not looking for electromagnetic signatures you know you'd have to be a moon or have a moon well that helps to have a magnetic signature you see what I mean\nYeah well I mean they they had this idea just they come out with all this stuff saying well we want you all the you know when you do your mission has got to have some sort of a plan to find alien life whatever you do from conceptualization to be on\nYou gotta you gotta make this happen and then they say well okay but we're kind of like a over budgeted for the ... program so what are we going to now over putting to lay\nOut right yeah when I have to weigh out there that I I ...\nEither way I I think I Will come out and the next few years whether that it or not it'll happen\nWhile I don't think they're ever going to go back on their uh I mean they were going to go back on their ideas already went to the moon but\nThinking about this you know before Kennedy died you know he was talking with the Russians about UFOs don't kinds of crazy stuff I mean what if you said that the Russians\nHey we're gonna we're going to the moon and that we're trying to go to ... go to the moon and uh you know who gave me a little bit of money you act you know\nYou read this or this little space race a little more interesting and you know I I just would say that you know the space race was wasn't really a space race if it was\nRussia basically having an interest in space the United states saying wait a minute they can't have an interest in space we don't want them to spy on us and then they started to say well hey we challenge or race than I Am compared to like the fat kid\nGoing up to the the ... guy saying hey I'm going to I'm going I'm going to run a race with you and I'm going to beat you and then in the ...\nAnd ... and the the guy it's almost going to say OK guy given a chance and so one day the guy wakes up and says wait a minute he ... he won the race how did he do that and that's how I think Russia saw it as big in we were before we were more successful in the United states was and now they're doing this how", "show_name": "Ground Zero with Clyde Lewis", "year": "2018", "city": "Newton", "day": "15"}
