fiber optic cable as part of the directed energy weapons ... works just them five minutes ago I say you have any of this wow really\nYes look at it over the break you'll be talking about it after the

Snyder Spanish for the W and the one I think you\nIs\nLabeled high speed Internet with lightning bolts and lasers coming out at but it's so freaking fast really because this is the underground

when we took that we had our garden moment or even the garden of Eden moment when they say rep Chileans disabled\nStep and gave us the opportunity for this technology they're forbidden fruit of knowledge and we took it and we said OK you can a duck some of our people in the genetic test whatever it just shows how to use the fiber optics and stuff here we are just a little bit later

had to find skin but they felt as though that they were mechanical there were more so mechanical than they were a\nTangible uh and and that's why they don't have genitalia and that's why they eliminate their way through their skin because of the fact that they they they they don't have to reproduce they're made\nWere crop were crossing that line between organic and and mechanical and they're going to be our to both and that's what the whole trend humanism movement about and you go you got to pick out\nA hand in a Robin hands than he did the Mormon trends humanist association my

the when they say the sauces have been recovered there's no place for them to eliminate waste there no genitalia so they don't reproduce they do not have any uh the umbilical cord or anything like
