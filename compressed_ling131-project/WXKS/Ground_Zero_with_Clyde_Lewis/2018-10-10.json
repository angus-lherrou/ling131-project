about everything we have an opinion about everything that doesn't seem to be ... or or even a even healed\nAnd the aftermath of course is when we identify the war you're not going to identify it during the war you're identify after the war and that's what historians do\n\nWe take a look at all of the things that we can say we're a little skirmishes and and real ideological or fights we had
