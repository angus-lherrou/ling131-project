this\nIs actually pretty close to record\nSo you might hear quite a bit about where Michael ranked historically [noise]\nNow ... what you hear the top five so we're not quite a job's a recording\nIn us history but by name storms that is the case here's the deal we've had in Atlantic hurricane season that we've traction is Eighteen fifty one but they didn't start naming hurricanes until Nineteen fifty three All right so\nYou actually had the strongest hurricane that's ever been recorded in us history\nIt was a name to it was the Labor Day hurricane Nineteen thirty five\nO'clock in with tops who stayed window ample hundred and eighty five miles per hour\nThe second one\nWas hurricane care Nineteen sixty two top with one Seventy five\nThen yeah but ... for the third strongest hurricane that the ... hurricane Camille Nineteen sixty nine a buck sixty five yeah Hurricane Andrew in Ninety two and one sixty five as well the strongest hurricane\nAt the time the landfall recorded us

to the folks impacted direct line they're one of the other things so much for two and we heard the death toll earlier today Lebanon twelve and a lot of concerns that number's going to rise one thing that particular like in the in Florida we do often a really good job\nOr minimizing debt at the time of impact of a hurricane but often will see a bunch of people that will go out there and and make mistakes after a hurricane they'll end up died that's been four to track record historic\nReally easy by the way when you're ... you're tired you don't have power to go do something silly that sometimes it just didn't include stepping in water bottle or something with the downed power lines\nI kind of thing happens and the case of what we are taking a look at though with a hurricane Michael\nWhat we don't know how many people were actually in those homes Mexico Mexico beach and uh let's pray that folks did get out and that we are going to have a a debt told the rise is considerably\nTomorrow and over the weekend this one was bad bad news for sure All right and the end on a lighter note\nI ah I couldn't help but uh but they go actually the first time I remember hearing the name Kanye West and is that when I was doing radio in Savannah during the Iraq War\nThe folks you saw in Baghdad or toppling the statues of Saddam Hussein heroes among heroes those are the third if the third Infantry Division third id at Fort Stewart just outside of savannah\nJust amazing people and outside of the tourists that come to savannah it's a major military town everybody is either friends or family was somebody serve it and back then somebody who was overseas\nSo when we had the Iraq War going on it was important with all the major updates to get the information out to all of our radio stations we happen to have a a urban station a rap station there was a young rapper they are in the afternoon\nAnd uh he was playing in in ... is from Atlanta and so he's got a big deal in Georgia it was just starting to become a big deal I think nationally about that time to anyway I'm supposed to be going in there to do this major update on the third Infantry Division and the Iraq War\nAnd I go in there and this young rapper is doing his thing and he's all worked up and then he is coming over to me out of a Kanye West's song\nAnd he couldn't remember my name and he went it's it's it's Whitey with the news\nAnd I became Whitey with the news\nAnd I managed to hold it together long enough to give the the update but after that we kinda turned it into a thing and for oh for meaning couple of years that was in Savannah he would end up helping me with culture and so I Would do things like ah you know learn how to to speak the language\nI'd just be a ... and stuff you know ... those are the types of things that I was doing in in in Kanye West was at the forefront of my urbanized education\n[laughter] anyway I digress a it has been a couple of weeks for sure from the gab and all of a situation through gun yet and the oval office but you know the only thing that's changed in the grand scheme of things not even so much the stock market\nWhat's really change is
