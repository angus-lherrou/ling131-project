notified the law enforcement and an automated Lee and first responders that's\nTo the goings on in the world it's increasingly obvious that were already under a new world order and it's being brought to you by the global industrial deep state which is a powerful ... made up of international government agencies in corporations\nAnd I don't know how you defined I had to find out this worldwide fascism\nAnd it's something that uh I think we need to we need to be aware of as a country together agreeing with the enemy is out there too and that we shouldn't be fighting amongst each other we should be fighting against this order and wants to take over go to Jackie in California hijacked your ground zero\nApplied interest story but I think they're just\nDidn't ring true to me about how you pronounce his name ...\n... like I had known show gets ... jump to show you\n... you\nKnow you had a [noise] the Turks came out and\nShowed us the pitchers in the airport or what was supposed to be the hit team coming in [noise]\nWell if they knew that these guys over there to put a hit on somebody why didn't they stopped them so I think you have a the Turkish government also complicit that they also let this happen but what does it ring true\nTo me is have you ever heard of a of\nAny nation states sending Fifteen people to do it hit I mean if\nYou're if you're interrogating somebody you don't need Fifteen people to kill him but the more people you have in the inner price like this the more chances of something leaking something going wrong so the story from the beginning didn't ring true but Trump is ah between a rock and a hard spot now because\nYou're coming up on the mid term elections and they're pressuring him to do something against Saudi Arabia but he knows if he does in Saudi Arabia retaliate and they pull their oil back\nOr you could see a barrel of oil at a hundred and fifty dollars a barrel rather quickly\nAnd the price of gasoline would skyrocket would have an immediate effect on the economy and it would of course one of the things to lessen Trump's powers to blame him for a bad economy and the worst time for this to happen this right before the elections\nSo what's your indicators that something like this as a foot\nThis hasn't the stock market been dropping\nWhat was it like I said this is an example of worldwide beads stay manipulation heat is\nI mean it's not just about it's not just about President Trump is about everyone else is going to be affected in this domino occurrence\nWith this ... this happening and and how the world is going to be able to handle a high gas prices inflation and the economy is going to go by well\nIt's a big conspiracy believe me it's a conspiracy wish it were to look at\nThe un other indicators the price of gold gold spin going up stock market's been going down oil is going to start going up I think to moral can be a very bad day in the stock market is is this thing somehow starts to escalate\nNow how how does Trump do anything against Saudi Arabia when cars show ... is a Saudi citizens and he was actually\nIn a Saudi embassy which makes him on Saudi territory we have no authority over that we shouldn't even be involved in that the fact that he works for a newspaper here in the United states is\nOf no consequence the president United States has really no authority to retaliate against Saudi Arabia but yeah I watched him get pressured to do something and\nYou know it's interesting how CNN was I think the first one to lead the story out that Saudi Arabia is going to say that the interrogation went wrong and he died by accident or you know there's been no official statement from Saudi Arabia\nI Know I Know but you know the turkey and said that they know that he was taking in was killed and was dismembered and the flu is remains I Can't remember the ... too but uh the movement of wine country\nSlide if the Turkish government had a video evidence of this team coming in at the airport why didn't they stopped the Eighteen\nProbably do the same reason you say they use in a he was in Saudi Arabia territory they can't get in there and embassy and do anything about it\nWell but we're making the argument that that may be the CIA let this happen that\nThey may be argument the CIA was facilitating operation deep laid off in the argument that he said operatives the IRA were facilitators to the murder of is a a a a good show geek\nAnd of course Saudi Arabian or a B C D operators were involved here as well now turkey had something to do with it that will be revealed too\nBut what I'm saying is is that they all knew and they let it happen now why just like you said it's a conspiracy to topple or our country even more because the Trump is pressure to do anything it's going to bring up gas prices and it's going to bring\nUp a inflation and it's going to kill our economy\nAnd the worst thing that could happen to Trump is that the Democrats get control of Congress so you would want an incident is an incident like this to happen right before Christmas right before the elections what could make Trump look worse I Hope he doesn't fall for the bait and retaliate against Saudi Arabia and\nThe thing that I have a feeling do need to do that well I have a feeling though that's what they want I mean big the neo cons are still in control of a lot of things around Donald Trump okay you got boom who certainly was a signatory on the project for the new American Century and if they moved him into another George W. Bush were screwed so he's old\nEnough to remember when Saudi Arabia pulled back their oil supply in the seventies\nAnd we had an immediate gasoline shortage there were long lines for gasoline yup then they went to the odd even license plates right so you can gas up one day if you're playing was even in the next day if you play it was an even on that I think they went by the last number of your plate\nSo I mean number I was working in the motion picture business at the time and I'd have to have my\nWe had two cars so I'd have my wife gas up the car for me you know to get the car ready for the next day and then that they should gas up the other car and because the lions horrible I didn't have time to wait in line for gas but the price of gas skyrocketed and you can only imagine\nThe leverage that Saudi Arabia still has now they've pulled back or on their oil and they're saying if we're retaliated against by sanctions or any other means\nA that we're going to pull back or or oil and I think they used to figure that oil could go to two hundred\nDollars a barrel so we're looking at ten dollars a ... a gallon or easily by Chris I don't know does does a Trump want to call their bluff\nNo idea it rather than being a bait and retaliate\nSo I'll watch and wait now right that's why I brought this up because I'm Glad somebody had asked me they said well why don't you talk about Joe ... show and I thought what am I talking about and then I realized oh I Know what this says I looked over and I figured\nWell gosh if they were all facilitating this this is one more way to destabilize the country namely United States of America stabilized this from the pump it stabilizes with inflation destabilized this with an economy that's going to go bust and then what will we have to we'll have to be put on a war\nFooting by by Christmas Time\nRight and remember the key thing is though if if this goes south quickly it could really affect the mid term elections and the Democrats if Trump looks bad the Democrats would easily get control of the house\nAnd so do you think this is a well once again in the deep state so what do you say the deep state intelligence ops wanting to make Trump look bad and making them by putting him in a position where you have to make these decisions\nI think he made a good point that they not only the Turkish government but the CIA is a facilitator because I've always maintain that there's elements inside a all of our main intelligence agencies including the CIA that hey Trump and they want to get rid of trumpet and it costs like\nWell it's the allowance subject like this to\nHave his creating the it's creating the atmosphere and the environment for a global is to Lucian meeting that he does that work in America anymore the guy or something\nYou might have missed there there was last night and National Geographic special about the secret service and they talked about I'm a real story about an assassination attempt on President Trump while he was in a foreign country and kind of was behind it\nInteresting well we'll we'll see what happens but like I said right now this is certainly you know that's the whole purpose of the show tonight was discovering\nHow the deep state is worldwide thing about bad promote these states worldwide yeah BMI ... yang I'm Christopher Steele the British guy you have all boys things to make about Russia look bad\nWhile adapted if the driver looked away from the road for more than a few seconds a light on the steering wheel will flash read in downtown\n\nFox News I'm Carmen Robert

now of oil we produce\nMore oil and Saudi Arabia well the question I had been as it were that would that\nDivision why is gas so damn high right now I don't get it I mean\nWe we've seen it you know low before we've seen it in the you know down to you know to maybe even up to five to ... gallon but now we're pushing four dollars a gallon and uh I I really think though that would happen in fact probably not as much of the fact is maybe you know\nTen dollars at the pump by I mean but I always get into the sphere that some somebody will wake up to ten dollars an hour because it's something we've done or something is happening\nYeah I don't know the the the the world down anything is possible anything we speculate about the past is coming true it it's just weird how you know and and if you imagine how much division would happen if we found ourselves\nIn a in a moment of scarcity when I talk about ... weeks ago with what the number Kissinger was talking about scarcity we must bore scarcity\nIn order to demonstrate what it would mean to\nRedistribute the wealth redistribute goods and services and and make everything uh a happy global family feeding this is what they're pushing for an outside interest and outside interest that it's not American\nConstitutional republic not democracy it's something else they want and they they they need to make their dance and trauma that he's traumatized enough to be ready because they're ... they're due date is twenty thirty\nThat's where they would say that due date is twenty thirty and then from there who knows but the the beginnings of what they want to establish and what they want to put forward a and that is a a conspiracy to destabilize the United\nStates of America to go to George in Kentucky Hi George you're on ground zero\nHey I have my foot here scenario will that I think you're right about the deep state but what about the situation with with Trump we've never seen a president for that the rallies way Trump has to\nIgnite the public on both directions good and bad or we have and if\nI'm sure we have George George ... waste that white light but no you know you need to acknowledge the fact that there are many other presidents have had the ability to do with Trump does\nAnd what he's doing now if we destabilize the country when these elections come up and I don't think this election is going to be\nA major but I think the next one coming up is it will all of a sudden we're destabilized with this tape state airing involved in all this Trump is going to be put himself in a situation where he's going to say we're going to hold off on elections and we'll just carrying really through until we stabilize the country\nDo you ... or so this is what they thought Obama was going to do this where they thought George Bush was going to do they didn't do it so you think the Trump would be stupid enough to suspend election so that I\nKnow it's not stupid if you think about it well he did he would lay that loss you got most of the American public\nI can hear Hitler Hitler Hitler I can hear Hitler chanted in the streets about happened\nYet but that's what we think about\nWhat the upper ... between the a lot sees the plans and everything that's going on think about all the uproar what's going on and what this is set up for an Emmy again if you look at it in a respect the\nLaw is not going on and it's not happening but then he's okay well that can happen but it is happening look at all the diversity\nYeah I mean like that's happening with the Arab by up or you got all these\nA
