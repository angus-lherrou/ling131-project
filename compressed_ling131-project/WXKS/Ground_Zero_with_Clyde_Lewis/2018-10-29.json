{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WXKS", "content": "\nHighmark yes I entered into a a showman contract with a large\nInsurance company and they were supposed to uh give me a two good faith check up front for a total of a two hundred thousand dollars in payments for the next seven years I took ... down to the bank and the new account specifically for those\nAre the one check for forty five thousand dollars one through and I was notified by the bank and sent in the mail a return on a stop payment on the second check\nOkay did you did you call them up and just ask why\nI asked why everybody is walking around with their head gone G we've never heard of this ever happening before\nYou may have to hire a well I wouldn't even hire a lawyer yet a now comes a a letter saying you're clearly in breach of the contract\nAnd send them a letter out senator and breach of a car they're ignoring you send it to all the different\n... and ... how long ago how long ago did you spend that letter how many weeks ago or\nDays or weeks ago All right well ... couple of weeks ago is not enough time well they've had sixty days to respond I Know but they do and I just kind of a more\nI just had one of those where it was a settlement that do we entered into my company entered into where we're going to get paid 'cause we dealt with people that didn't do such a good job who had insurance\nSo we settled at and they have to pay within thirty days the insurance company they ended up paying within Seventy five days is how long it took us to get paid\n... and to the point where our warrior had to get in that's a lawyer who arranged the settlement had to come in and start screaming at the insurance companies we actually\nHad to file a lawsuit\nFor breach before they paid okay so mark just get really aggressive or if they ... you probably fell through the cracks mark a if you're dealing with a major insurance company you weren't going to get paid more so question and then I Would turn around and see how much interest you're paying ... small claims court for the interest you lost\nThrough OK well you'll get paid more guy it's it's that's world of insurance they're they grab you you're you're a second and a half late on your auto insurance for your health insurance ear canceled\nSeventy five days late on a payment that was supposed to be made within thirty days just like Mark and that's typically what the payment or the timeline normally is\nGo figure huh oh hey Gary welcome to handle on law\n[noise] hey I'm I have a question for you my wife and I own a house in Ventura and it's a smaller track about uh thirty nine lot thirty nine home uh we when we bought a house um where would give it a a excuse me a fancy an art that a\nLimited what we could do a lot of what we can do with them\nAnd one of the stipulations of the CDC and are fed that each of the home tests\nTo rebuild on a single a lot and um that each home had to be at least Seventy five feet wide there are other stipulation but\nWhat happened was they develop or got to the city of Ventura uh the city approved the flooding of the lot and now the developer is building to homes that are in violation of the CBC in are in a number of different ways\nOkay so I wanted to know what our record\nThe record on who you are you what you do is you get the homeowners you get the H away\nAnd immediately file a lawsuit against him just because of the city allows a certain type of building or the uh the community that is the age or weight also can control\nAnd they can say no one more than one lied or one home ... now I then it becomes an interesting situation where the developer now comes back and saying you're violating liability\nOr to build housing of which ah I'm allowed to do based on the city but I think the winner here in my opinion would be the H away but you you it's time to get a lawyer you need a land use attorney Gary like right now\nIs that a real estate attorney a it is a real estate attorney but it's a real estate attorney that specializes in land use and there are a attorneys out there than in fact represent nothing but H always [noise] okay so you get to\nGo just go on the uh go on the Internet and got check them out because that is I Know developers going to roll over on this one uh there's no way in hell was especially if you're building additional home such big money for them\nAll right max Hi good morning for yes or our insurance quite a horse [laughter] okay but yes you have trouble with an insurance company yeah sure never heard that one before ... much about it what\nWe want to ask me anyway anyway they shorted me based on the estimate based committed they shorted me eight or seven dollars yeah I called him a couple of times especially they told me to go around it\nFair that is anyway um anyway what I did I filed in small claims court trader maybe seven dollars and immediately they came with a check for five hundred\nAnd the verbiage on the checks if I get a check or that negates credit for the claims\nRight now I'm Wondering if I drink a check because I Know in ... in court if I take that check negate yeah yeah\nBecause that's part of the agreement the agreement is if you would sell is jak then I Will not go after you I waive all my rights absolutely so the only way you can go and kick their bodies to say no thank you to the check and go ahead and fire when small claims court and kicked her what\nOkay that's that's where I'm going to go good luck\nAnd here's the good news whenever you go in front of a judge small claims judge against an insurance company I don't know how that works normally they would kick it right up to superior court and so you're really not going to be in front of the uh a judge\nA small claims judge which are usually not judge was odd and daddy is and this happens all the time with big companies they immediately make a a motion to kick it up and then you have to go out and hire a lawyer ostensibly however there isn't a judge in this world that has not been screwed by an insurance company\nSo you're coming in with an advantage by dry cleaners never even go to small claims court ever because they know they're going to lose walking in the door and they just write checks now the good news is they write checks for the amount of replacing a\nDress and I've had\nA pair of pants they know I shop at Costco so what we're catching the ... [noise]\nIs handling\n\n\nThis is Michael ... here with my ... from health markets helping folks find the right Medicare coverage that news reports say that the rates might be going down\nThe government protect the costs of Medicare plans will decrease this year so you have to ask yourself are you getting the best right help markets offers a free service with access to thousands of Medicare plans nationwide help folks maximize their benefits and say honey\nWhat is it people need to keep in mind\nEnrollment in the right plan is not automatic with so many Medicare options that can be confusing my advice don't go it alone get unbiased help to find a plan that may cost less and cover more with lower copayments more choices like dental\nAnd vision and the freedom to choose your doctors with the enrollment deadline only weeks away it's important to act now our health markets Medicare assistance is free\nThanks my this is Michael method for health markets\nFor your free Medicare assistance coal eight hundred seven for one twenty nine thirty that's eight hundred seven for one twenty nine thirty eight hundred seven for one twenty nine thirty\n[noise] never reached the final straw I don't use\nI don't use plastic Mr when Iran we brew coffee for me here we've all been this way you know and we put it in the bottom of the world we shall I say I'm all\nRolling any crisis I'll do it we do have a new\nInnovation everything gets out his turn green\nTime and you know when my\nWell my hundred killed Jonah Halloween is going to focus on the fun in the severe and I

News the Boston Red Sox won there for the world series championship in Fifteen Years beating the Los Angeles Dodgers five one in game five so much for that eighty six year championship drought\nThe Sox headed into game five leading the series three when they took the lead early on and never looked back the call on Fox Sports with Joe Buck\nAnd he said it was you know really made is made out of great ingenuity\nBut he said that he will hardly think I shall neatly tested power disclosed the path to forecast the future\nSo we know that the industry of do the talking board into this into the community of the spiritual movement and also it in the United states only that it was an Eighteen Ninety\nThe we used to board that we know today got his start in Eighteen Ninety One it was patent and trademark and was in production at that point so there's always some interesting stories about that but an Eighteen Ninety to Canada Watson writes from us the United states to sell their own version of the leader board and so they started making boards and Eighteen Ninety two\nAnd the rest is history and so bored such as Bob board which again falls into the category of talking boards\nA lot of sports after the ... makes it a prominent splash into\nThe market I mean everybody was buying them and use them at the heyday I mean this has been a special ... going\nBig time and that's how much is going on with the communication at the time that people started making copycat boards and started getting different types of their own type a board and of course we get the trademark passes name they couldn't use that name\nRight so you have to use different names but I mean this is the story behind this board is rather unique I've never heard anything a particularly unique is the story of of Bob being a suspected serial killer or making aboard the basically feel that it's almost as if it's penance for him to make this board so that he\nWould feel right about himself or what have you ah in his own special way I'm just curious if there are any other unique stories behind certain types of boards that have been released in the past\nThere there are many reasons that people make their own boards and as you mentioned earlier people do make around and start customizing assign um um but the degree of this type of story no I've never heard of this story but there are reasons why people make boards\nAnd it could just be a personal their own little personal portal or they want to communicate with the deceased one or they see an opportunity to make money there's a lot of different reasons but this is a very unique case I'm In it I haven't heard ever heard of a serial killer making aboard before or I shouldn't say he was in a secular he was posted\nA legit or we don't know if he really was or not\nYeah we we don't know if you did you'd be checked into somebody mental institution right in fact a you know\nThat's that's the that's the thing is the avoided a any kind of prosecution because he checked in a mental institution I mean and and since you've been using the board you've gotten longitude and latitude of you submitted any in any of this information to the authorities and if so do they take it seriously\n[noise] well it's just kind of awkward 'cause I haven't really you know this is really just a small\nThing that I was just selling on on on we just put the color\nA Xerox is on on board and then I met this guy used to work for a car and a fair which is an old TV show or on the which has only channel five or something right in the east\nAnd um she was really for years he was kind of trying to do something with the board and he worked on hated like on the show he could like producing I think mhm current affairs and then he was the one who\nIntroduced it to the guys that make these um [noise] it's a company called allied board and they make different games things and they took it to another level\nI think it's the same image to same exact [noise] you know but then they took it and they just put more quality thing with boxes and everything\nYou know in the in the background to ride the background history\nYes and they told them everything you know and they put it down to they made it more like a sophisticated I guess\nBut um it's the same story and it's a very good I tell people you know\nNot to and I made them put on that you can't be under Eighteen years old because this is real this is really happened this really works\nAnd it's very scary and if if you have the wrong intentions and you know everybody would call go to the same place at the end but says some that that people that are around and they go to you know so you don't want to some of them back\nTo I always say there's not a joke\n... no I'm a ... and I wanted to ask her and you know I have some idea of criteria that I have you know if I ever use the word I use the board in a long time let's be honest with you to board a gosh I Can't count back maybe I I I've been president during other sessions with boards I mean I Know somebody who has their own board they brought it in one night and they use that it wasn't really a board it was just\nSomething that just rolled out like it was a laminated or lemonade peace that had a a crystal glass so they use I mean I you know boards can rudimentary like that even even when you see the TV show stranger things that you kind of a mix you bored with Christmas tree lights\nSo that her little boy you could go to the uh the little boy can communicate with his mother his mother\nUm you know ... it doesn't ... we really don't need boards do we care and I mean even the boards of bear or you can channel on your own and you can use a you know automatic writing and other things in my right\nYeah that's a good point and the board is really not doing the work we're doing the work ourselves support just becomes a permission slip if you will or it becomes a stepping off jumping off point a springboard into being able to to access your own ability to this work\nA lot of people don't think that's the case and I I didn't think that was the case for many many years but when I realized what was happening here when I started working the board was at my own six cents ... started developing really started really being fined tune\nAnd taken aboard the way I can still do this work and be a lot of people ... and the old days these typewriters [laughter] word processors now they use computer keyboards and the channel that way\nThat's what I find it to board the people at the tactile experience and the movement movement itself that kind of opens up the receptor so you could start bringing in the information and so again I Want to be real clear the board there's no negative energy with any board that's why I have no problem\nHaving any board at my home so then I got an ... even this board that I'm that great uncle made 'em for his purposes I have no problem with that because I Know nothing negative will happen unless I Want that to happen unless I Try to bring that to me or that's my desire\nOr that's how I view the world so people doesn't mean you know people scared us even talking about this on the radio so I have\nAre though they they they think they don't understand and this is what I Want to try and bring out with this whole conversation and\nThey don't understand that a lot of this has to do with what's inside of them and then it's eighty or motor responses are that are based basically muscular suggestions are subtle suggestions in the mind that come from the unconscious\nIf it's from deep within dream scape time it's like you're in there and and things come out of you I mean the human body in the brain are big transmitters and so the only way this can work as a transfer through the body and then the board as you say is like a permission slip but it's like a way to\nTo view I mean people would use pencil that I I used to know a media embed would or would he would do his thing he would just scribble you would take a pencil\nAnd he would just scribble on a new bad and he just scribbling scribbling as he scribbling for some reason they just doing the scribble he's looking at going all I see a scribbling but what I what he saw it was something else and so this was his way of I don't know what it was but it was just his way of kind of I don't know doing something with his hands on his mind was bringing in the information primaries getting it\nFrom so either you're scribbling or using a pendulum are using something else but it certainly is there to have the mind generate or push through the body the motor response\nBut certainly is a interesting and you see it in an action tonight on grounds that we're talking about Bob's warrior care and a comment on the program who is the director of the talking more Historical Society you've seen her all over and she's been on guy or a guy who showed beyond belief she's been a recurring guessing coast to coast am fade to black Jimmy church of course\nUm and of course the um tonight to a set at first they didn't want to do this you know he's feeling well things have a good time with us we're glad we'd like to get some cultural talk with them or questions we have about ... other criticism you might have like to hear from you about\nTripoli took seven three thirty seven hundred as Tripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred not be mystified the board and still mysterious thing but it's just to let you know the board itself is in art is on something to be afraid of its what may be
