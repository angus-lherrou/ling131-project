{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WXKS", "content": "And was immediate uh versus I was hypnotized and I have no control ... yeah I don't think so\n\nYes ah I entered into a a showman contract with a large insurance company and they were supposed\nTo uh give me a two good faith check up front\nFor a total of a two hundred and one thousand dollars and in payments for the next seven years I took the checks down to the bank and a crater new account specifically for those are the one check for forty five thousand dollars one through\nAnd then it was notified by the bank and set in the mail a return on a stock payment on the second check\nOkay did you did you call them up and just ask why\nI asked why and everybody is walking around with their heads gone G we've never heard of this ever happening before\nYou may have to hire a well I wouldn't even hire a lawyer yet a now comes a a letter saying you're clearly in breach of the contract\nAnd send him a letter out senator and breach of a car they're ignoring you send it to all the different\n... and how long ago how long ago did you send that letter how many weeks ago or\nDays or weeks ago All right well to a couple of weeks ago is not enough time for all that they've had sixty days to respond I Know but they do and I just have any more I just had\nOne of those where it was a settlement that do we entered into my company entered into where we're going to get paid 'cause we dealt with people that didn't do such a good job who had insurance so we settled at\nAnd they have to pay within thirty days the insurance company ... they ended up paying within Seventy five days is how long it took us to get paid\nOkay and to the point where our lawyer had to get in that's a lawyer who arranged the settlement had to come in and start screaming at the insurance companies we actually had to file a lawsuit\nFor breach before they paid okay so mark just get really aggressive or if they ... you probably fell through the cracks marking ah if you're dealing with a major insurance company you weren't going to get paid\nMore there's a question and then turn around and see how much interest you're paying ... small claims court for the interest you lost through OK\nBut you'll get paid more guy it's ... it that's world of insurance they're they grab you you're you're a second and a half late on your auto insurance for your health insurance ear canceled\nSeventy five days late on a payment that was supposed to be made within thirty days just like Mark and that's typically what the payment to the timeline normally is\nGo figure huh oh hey Gary welcome to handle on law\n[noise] hey I'm I have a question for you my wife and I own a house in Ventura and it's a smaller track about uh thirty nine lot hurting nine home uh we when we bought a house um where would give it a a excuse me a faith than are that are\nLimited what we could do a lot and what we can do with our home\nAnd one of the stipulations of the CDC and are fed that each of the homes has to be built on a single a lot and um that each home had to be at least Seventy five feet wide there are other stipulation\nBut what happened was a developer got to the city of Ventura or the city approved the splitting of the lot and now the developer is building two homes that are in violation of the CBC in are in a number of different ways\nOkay so I wanted to know what our record theory\n... what you do is you get the homeowners you get the H away\nAnd immediately file a lawsuit against him just because of the city allows a certain type of building or the or the community that is the actual weight also can control\nAnd they can say no one more than one lied or one home ... now I then it becomes an interesting situation where the developer now comes back and saying you're violating liability\nOr to build housing of which ah I'm allowed to do based on the city but I think the winner here in my opinion would be the ... way but\nIt's time to get a lawyer you need a land use attorney Gary like right now\nIs that a real estate attorney a\nIt is a real estate attorney but it's a real estate attorney that specializes in land use and there are a attorneys out there then in fact represent nothing but H always\n[noise] okay\nSo you get to go just go on the uh go on the Internet and got check them out because that is I Know developers going to roll over on this one uh there's no way in hell especially if you're building additional home such big money for them\nAll right max\nHi good morning\nYasser ... inch historically a horse [laughter] okay but yet you have trouble with an insurance company yeah I never heard that one before ever ... mapped out for\nA while now asking [laughter] anyway anyway they shorted me based on the estimate based committed they shorted me eight or seven dollars yeah I called him a couple of times especially they told me to go around all that\nThat is anyway anyway when I get I filed in small claims court trainer Ninety seven dollars and the way they came with a check for five hundred\nAnd the verbiage on the checks if I can check that negates claims right now I'm Wondering if I tell you a check because I Know in ... in court if I take that check negate\nYeah yeah because that's part of the agreement the agreement is if you would say is jak then I Will not go after you I waive all my rights absolutely okay so the only way you can go and kick their butts is to say no thank you to the check and go ahead and fire when small claims court and kick their butts\nOkay that's that's where I'm gonna\nGo good luck and here's the good news whenever you go in front of a judge small claims judge against an insurance company I don't know how that works 'cause normally they would kick it right up to superior court\nAnd so you're really not going to be in front of the uh a judge a small claims judge which are usually not judges\nOdd and daddy is and this happens all the time with big companies they immediately make a a motion to kick it up and then you have to go out and hire a lawyer ostensibly however there isn't a judge in this world that has not been screwed by an insurance company\nSo you're coming in with an advantage by dry cleaners never even go to small claims court ever because they know they're going to lose walking in the door and they just write checks now the good news is they write checks for the amount of replacing a\nDress and I've had\nA pair of pants they know I shop at Costco so it wasn't even more cash in the ...

Fox News thousands of people jammed in intersection Mitt a light rain for a vigil this evening for the victims of the shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue eleven people were killed six others injured including for police officers suspect surrendered and is now under arrest\nYou know you've got somebody unhinged people out there\nHow do you protect yourself you got the alleged bomber under arrest as well\nThe ah ridiculous legacy disgusting media reporting but it's still McGrath bomber the make America great again bummer which is disgusting\nReporting that the bomber was going after Trump targets no not the case will you have is a bad guy who did something very bad\nAnd calling him demographer bomber is not only inappropriate it shows that you shouldn't be in the journalism business at all those of us on the political opposite side we're not calling\nThe shooter advocating rational baseball game the Sanders shooter\nEven though he was a vehement Bernie Sanders supporter\nThat's not what we do that's also not being honest and it's not reporting the news as as it is in reality so we've got more violence today\nWe don't know why other than this person allegedly shouts some sort of hatred\nAnd I'm an incredible hatred and loading of of people have the Jewish faith we don't have any motive other than that we don't know his name although it's been reporter to use a white guy with a beard and we also was\nReported that the bombing suspect it was a white guy to that guy list themselves as Native American this first name is Caesar or says are so he could be Hispanic as well I'd also reports that he's a talented philippino\nThe media always though quick to say it's a white guy remember George Zimmerman the guy who killed Trayvon Martin because Martin went back and was beating the hell out of them in in self defense he shot and killed him they reported him as a white guy for a long time until they had to once his picture was out there admitted that he was Hispanic so then they started calling him a white Hispanic\nSo dumb that is so the media always is looking for a spin I'm always going to give it to you straight as I can\nAnd that's what we have a Pittsburgh I'll give you updates as we go I definitely want your thoughts on this uh this bombing suspect that is a ... that's under arrest and even more than that I mean it looks like at some nut job who had some crazy delusion about\nWhat his role should be in politics in this country\nI mean just the pictures the van itself if you're looking at a going what there was a guy riding down the street with a van that looked like that and nobody suspected anything here's a guy with a ... a substantial criminal record\nYears and years and years of convictions who by the way was a registered Democrat I've seen reports that he switched to Republican in twenty sixteen\nAnd suddenly Trump made him do it according to the media\nSends out a bunch of alleged bombs I'm not even convince door really bombs but he sends out a bunch of alleged bombs to people we put return addresses armies wouldn't fake addresses on the actual sent into an area they were supposed to show up at all these prominent Democrats houses and their officers they never made it there\nBut it's for the media it's not about are the bad guys off the street thank God nobody was hurt it's more about Trump did this\nI guess there were some letter signed by hundreds of journalists about how Trump is somehow inciting violence against journalists that's not true he's done nothing like that in fact it sounds really stupid and an journalistic to even say something like that\nIn fact I can make a good argument that the media is inciting violence against those who support President Trump you if you were a make America great again hat your target and that's okay\nIf you go to a Trump rally or you have a Trump bumper sticker you're a racist ... but that's OK the media school with that\nYou're late night talk shows calling the president's mouth a blank pollster for for ... that's okay that's perfectly fine\nFake news incessantly that's just the way it is will correct it later\nAnd there are there is an example of for example to resemble Yvette with the media again playing the victim in fact\n... concert from CNN the other day tweeted out this appointment or engaged over the fact that when President Trump was talking about the bombs that were they were going he didn't mention CNN specifically give it or not\nThis is a guy whose job is supposed to be the gold and report the news and he's not ever supposed to be the story is mad that he wasn't the story\nAnd when the president does call CNN out than a cost in in in his ilk say he shouldn't be doing that he's putting his endangering denigrating what we do for a living so make you make your mind up either you want to be mentioned by the president or you don't want to be on the president you don't get to tell the president ... mentioned he has to make\nFor you so I mean we're living in bizarro world here really are\nThose who perpetrate violence on the left should be arrested and or or killed in the act like the guy with the shooter was in that congressional baseball practice they should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and sent away for as long as we possibly can those who committed violence in there on the right same thing should apply\nBut the selective reporting and there's the desire by the media to pretend like one side is inciting violence and the other side is and it's just a crazy person that was an aged vats irresponsible\nThat's responsible or by the way that the bombing suspect very odd the whole thing's odd claims he's a seminal Indian\nIs family or a family friend or a lawyer somebody claimed that he wasn't at all that he isn't one by one name that he went by different name one name sounded Native American or American indian and the other one sounded Italian first they've certainly sounds Hispanic who knows what he is\nWhen we do know is he was some promoter for chipping nails\nAnd some bouncer at at a bar and even the night before he was arrested\nSo whatever the the left is trying to glean from him and put it on Trump easier responsible and stupid\nAnd the media needs to learn it's job again the job is to go there observing and tell us what you saw\nIs not go there observant and tell us why Trump caused it that makes no sense so I'll keep you updated on what's happening in Pittsburgh certainly we've got a bunch of interviews coming your way a bunch of interviews\nI'm not taking some false led called ... Charlie go I'm I'm not going to do conspiracy theories today that that that's that's stupid Charlie you can go ahead and hang up in Maryland I'm a technical I'm All right\nWe've got John Hi bushy use the guy from the he's the executive director of the Ronald Reagan Institute\nIn California great interview with him where we compare and contrast to Ronald Reagan or through his accomplishments treated was treated by the media and how he treated the media\nAnd it was a much better than what's going on with Trump and then how Trump does it very very different styles both of them had incredible accomplishments for the American people the media was not on either one of their sides how is it the that the media is Harold ... Ronald Reagan as a great president great leaders thirty some odd years later whereas Trump is being treated as he's being treated\nSort of get that for ya I've got representative Kevin Brady you're hearing the president talk a lot about a new a new tax cut plan for the middle class in America is that tax cuts to point out or is that something different we break that down we talked about it makes you stick around for that I've got a ... that caravan\nWe've got that for you which is okay\nI did it last minute I think on Thursday Wednesday or Thursday so it's okay\nWe'll try to get you that also mark Latta or from the GOP we talk to them about traveling around with um with vice president Mike Pence\nAnd everybody Scaramucci the ... the communications director of the trauma been strange for Lebanon old days you got a new book out we'll talk to him as well your thoughts right now in the bomber the bombing suspect that is on the media coverage on the\nThe climate in America and look I think that the left is causing this\nBecause they're deathly afraid\nOf what's going to happen on election day and by the left I mean the media the political left\nUm Hollywood left they were all freaking out now and there was one event that happened last Monday that I think is causing them to freak out we'll get into it that event was\nUh it happened to to to take place in Houston, Texas will talk about that too it's one eight hundred and five zero one Seventy eighty one eight hundred and five zero one seven zero eight zero Joe ... dot com stay right here [noise]\n... rules for alerts and offer semi automatic catch message message container rates may apply\nAmerica this is Martha Stewart now you can cut great casing dinners at home and leave us forget it that frozen foods and take out a fad killing me for great home cooked food introducing Martha and release them Neal Ken\nRepression fresh ingredients it's my wonderful easy to follow a recipe delivered rank your door\nAnd right now you can try three for free for a very limited time I'm offering three free Martha ... can everyone\nAnywhere imagine cooking butter basic state for sheer pork tenderloin key staff chickens and more like new recipes every week Martha Ann Marie stealing helps you pretty delicious dinner I'm your cable and around thirty minutes\n[noise] [noise] this is\nThe Fox news alert on ...

Arizona and from watching other law enforcement officers on on shows like lie PT and others um ... is that when you walk up\nYou're generally speaking don't want to put somebody in a bind I mean there really is a lot more discretion that I think I ever knew there was a but again if somebody's going to get with the program you probably have three or four or five different charges on some cases that you can lay on 'em and but they're also minor enough to know where you could still get them home tonight\nHave you bet you do that it's kinda it's I didn't know that do you hear from other people like me who say you know I had no clue you guys could deal with it that way\nYeah you know a lot of people don't realize that and we do have a lot of discretion and that's why I Try to tell people look\n[laughter] just relax you know this is going to go a lot more did a lot differently than you think if you just stay calm was work through it um and it does give us the ability to use some of that discretion but you're right and if we wanted to get stuck on a ton of charges too so it it really just depends on on where they want to take it\nFor three free meals and free shipping patched

hooked up with the um uh the chairman of the house ways and Means Committee the uh the the district that Republican Kevin Brady he's the guy working on tax code working on the tax playing with President Trump or we talk about the\nThe the bombing suspect being arrested better just happened before we spoke\nAnd uh also about what is this new tax cut plan that we keep hearing about Kevin I appreciate you how are you\nA good joke thanks for having me on\nYou know what what an incredible time we're living in right now I Want to get it to the incredible succession the positivity that came out at that rally on Monday but I'd be remiss to not today a first asked you about the arrest of is this person but police say the FBI says was this idiot but\nSent out a bunch of bombs but what are your thoughts when you see that I personally as a family man is a community member really relieved that we got um what what are you from yeah\nThat was my first time relieved a cop that that is good for you for law enforcement work obviously these guys had a history\nOf of problems you have a ... and then sending in in threatening to blow up folks and so we don't know the intent behind all of this but we do you know this is a person that ah frankly um and I don't know what to dream how much damage would have been done but can you imagine you know\nHad like a lawn right let me pick the lord they didn't they didn't know what I mean forget about it ... it didn't get into the hands of the targets but people at these ... and people at the mail rooms of these different buildings would have been you know really in dire straits here\nYeah and you know I I I took a Ari Fleischer his advice early on he said you know similar stop talking about blaming politicians and pundits let's do the investigative work and I'm Out of this is that's exactly what happened I think that's the right way to go after\nI think so too it's a Kevin Brady of House Ways and Means Committee chair what one last thing on that um is there any changing how the media is doing is they're calling you both the moderate bomber the cold and you know ... ... people did not call the guy who shot up the baseball practice\nAnd almost killed these college they didn't call him a senior shooter or some ... why is there a double standard here or there\nIs and I'll tell you a jot play baseball I played second base with Steve and I had missed the shooting by only\nA few minutes no in fact the coach after batting practice or after it took some a swing said do you want to take some ground or as a second I looked out\nSteve was take them I Know I'm fine and I grabbed my gear and left just what about four minutes ahead of the shooting so uh this is a ... yeah the media um there is a double standard here in in in I guess my frustration is\nBobby blamed president and others for what they believe are overheated rhetoric they often um are silent when you hear Hillary Clinton you know urge instability or Maxine Waters Cory Booker or encourage harassment and violence and\nThen rock Obama era ... we've got soundbites from all of them that are actually inciting violence and none of us ever said well the pilots happens they made it happen I mean we we'd like to see them camp down their rhetoric a little bit but what a bad guy shoots up a baseball practice or a bad guy since our bombs\nI I'm not going to blame the president nor Hillary Clinton I'm going to leave the guy who did it\nIf the guy yeah that's exactly right and and that's the way it ought to be handled\nSo you know I it is the the year where frankly President Trump can't even breathe right for some people you write criticized for everything but I'll tell you what what he's doing for the country for our economy for our security is just unbelievable\nI had a conversation with John Hi Bush from the region a librarian and he's the executive director there\nAnd we were comparing and contrasting what this president has accomplished to what Ronald Reagan accomplished in the fact is thirty five forty years later the media looks back at ... lovingly and and they didn't love and back then um and and they're treating from horribly and basically they've got about the same record in fact the Heritage Foundation finds\nThis president is even more conservative than President Reagan was yeah I mean it it's it's unfair but but that's why have you on let's talk about the successes\nYeah and so Joe to your point boy thank you for saying that because that that's my point look Ronald Reagan perhaps of grace president in modern times yeah probably is in my view you know has two legacies\nTax cuts that the ... the economy for decades in the United prosperity and rebuilding the military exactly what President Trump has done in just a his first year and a half really and then you put on top of that this amazing\nA record in the courts of a constitutional judges from\nThe Supreme Court on down it really is a remarkable record\nIt's remarkable success you have to you again is never going to give him a chance it's Kevin Brady House Ways and Means Committee chair or it would be the success that we're seeing\nWas fueled by what you came up with ... you worked on this night and day I remember you\nYour jaw I Want to come on but I only been two minutes and you're like you're\nYou're breaking pencils him going crazy

that success as\nWe got we got to raise the taxes again we have to hurt corporations again and drive them out of the country how is it a winning strategy for them\nYeah I don't know that it is and and and they but they are doubling down on it so appealing in tax cuts raising the taxes on businesses going back to the old a code where every month we saw another us company moving overseas are

let's\nAppreciate I had a great time you know unfortunately I made a mistake and got blown out of my seat but uh you know there were political reasons for that as well which I described in the book with a you know what I was there to help the president they're loyal to the president you know I did some a\nMedia this morning I was on CNN and try to spend what I said that I call the president a liar not what I said the\nPresident is telling it like that and he's\nCovering the truth is doing it to set your hair on fire right into a finger your eyeball 'cause he knows it's going to distract you cause you to be like a school monitor all rocker\nAnd it works every single time when you go to a CNN or MSNBC when you're walking on those doors and look I've done worked at CNN headline news on fifty over there I mean ... when you walk it it still feels good it's a nice organization but then you realize that there was a definitive spin\nWhen you walk into that ... did you know you were to get you know some some folks for now and it's hard to get you to spend the president of a certain way\nPretty much on message I think they were really hitting these horror this morning and I'm trying to sell a book they figure that could kill me with the base but let's find people that know me they know what I'm super loyal to the president say listen I got fired Fifteen months ago I was it was the President Joe you would have figured it out by now uh I wrote a very ... very funny book\nAbout my relationship with him do what do you like it like it as a guy what he's like behind the scenes and by the way that a lot of research on him and his\nEither when they were like young fathers obviously now deceased but I'm going back into the seventies\nWhen his dad was working with him and mentoring in what they were life so this was a real fun book to write a rocket called me yesterday uh she said that she she went through the books you read it a hundred percent what Bush said\nIt was great he couldn't wait to show it to her father Kurt ... one of his best friend said the same thing you know what I listen I I I Love the president I said that from the press box you know I got criticized for saying that I Love the president two or three times when I was given my press briefing\nNest too bad I'm a New Yorker I have to be an Italian I like to use the word love Joe and Joe ... guy we want me to do\nIt and again I'm from New York I'm an Italian ... or ... short for pat and we will so All right we we we enjoy I get where you where you're coming from just like everybody I gotta tell ya my mother's from Jamaica, Queens so it was the president these people are fighters\nWho come from Jamaica, Queens and I don't know that that the rest of America and certainly not the elite media in America they don't understand that do they\nKnow they don't understand it they get sent it there's micro aggressions pregnant president is that your doubt that the left wants your brain disconnected from your mouth you know you get up and emotional\nFeeling you could ever politically incorrect thing to say you are and they want that totally sanitizing edited and God Forbid you should say something that there are offended by right\nThere is a tiny bit of a micro aggressions they started sending bottle rockets off the president place than like a Stradivarius that he does a ... and that's how people from queens or from my area in your area talk and I don't mean anything by it I'm ... and says my personality\nI agree it's embodies their most of the blue collar President Bill blue collar president it's out now go and get this great book\nLet's go back to the media stuff because again you were there on The Apprentice he made tens of millions of dollars for NBC now NBC turned itself on him him almost immediately when he says he's running for president more U.S surprise I've talked him seven different times he he was actually not surprised they turned on him when he was surprised by how dirty and how nasty ... were you\nYeah I think he's been blown away I mean I I there was a scene in my book where I'm Talking about us in the oval office\nAnd he looks at me so she you know I had a forty five you're great relationship with the media will do and what happened I said there was a combination of things they don't they don't like your some of your policies and you know we we let the band declare war on the media you know that they're trying to take it out on you\nThat I and and it took him a second but he realized what was going on so he kept on going out and I think you're right\nHe purposely looked for a cost an out and tries to tell me your fake news ... editor in Anacostia eats it up he does it every time he make fools himself when you were dealing with the media and again give him a job for eleven days but again I thought that it was really really good pick up a time I understand what happened but um when you were in that job did you think that the media wouldn't work with you\nDid you think that they wanted to actually get good information from the White House when the price of\nA I thought I thought we were going to have a ... month I thought there would be some kind of a peace offering me Jonah what\nA ... and the press I turn the lights and cameras back on that first day Joe we announced era as a press secretary I did the first press conference and I'm so sorry that would be my last one I was going to focus on strategy and building the communications team\nAnd also wanted to put us in a service position if you go you can find it on the net Mike ... plan\nBut listen you know I'm accountable for the mistake I made I trusted a reporter I was having off the cuff conversation with ... everybody forgets context to\nEat was being Dario seek we than flattering to me any begging me effectively to do a profile story with him yeah ... trail me around and I'm like well I'm not Steve Bannon and I'm not their self promoting myself read my\nUse of expletives which I obviously regret she loved that got it changed ran over to CNN with it right he waited he wrote this ridiculously ... you know exaggerated article and then he really ... you know four or five days later ... and I'm like jeeze the taste sounds like to normal guys from queens talking to each other right\nWhy would you do that to the guy and the answer is well we want to they ambushed them to see if we can get him out of the White House or a you know some people thought I Would have been very effective in helping to president so\nPut say look if you went back to him but\nIf you went and checked out the pod cast after you were named I thought it was a good pick\nBecause I felt like you were a guy who wasn't ... going to be very direct\nYou're going to be very straight with the information and and you would say look if you want a relationship with the ministry Asian here's a way it's going to work but you're right I think that you got suckered into a

I was really a great time hanging out with a guy who's just really he's he's uh about as honest as you're going to find somebody to your interview about exactly what went on and about exactly how it weighed down admits the mistake and and I as I said it at the time I really felt that he could have been ineffective guy\nIt was a rough day it was a great day\nYou don't have to be perfect to be a perfect parent thousands of kids in foster care will take you just as you are for more information on how you can adopt visit adopt us kids dot org a public service announcement from the U.S department of health and Human Services adapt us kids and the\nI'm like the opposite Pennsylvania governor Tom Wolfe addressing Pittsburgh Jewish community after the suspected gunman Robert Bauer skills eleven and wound six\nPennsylvania's Jewish community is strong spy Britain and resilient\nNow's the time more than ever to come together and to support each other\nForty six year old Bowers is facing ... counts of federal crimes of violence in firearms offenses for a shooting at the tree of life synagogue today during a baby naming ceremony President Trump ordering all federal buildings to fly the flag at half staff in honor\nOf the shooting Illinois Republican congressional candidate my boss getting Saturday Night campaign help from President Trump in southern Illinois\nMy thoughts defends Illinois farmers Illinois minor\nAnd Illinois workers\nBoston is in a tight race against Democrat Brendan Kelly this is Fox News [noise]\n[noise]\nNow a year in rocks spotlight from Nineteen Seventy six Bob Dylan releases his album desire to go see them wanting to stay sane mainly just significant radio airplay for the single hurricane\n\nFinally score and the U.S with the number one single Saturday Night or\nOverseas Miller band member by gags isn't every every\n... number one with his cell phone line Allen Frances comes alive become best selling\n\n\nTires hard right now we're living with them\n[noise]\n\nAnything coming up [noise]\n... no ... that we can control ...\n... ... on an auction hide bound to come on a more of a product also bought a ... like a headlining ...\nBoth of them don't even ... our last summer cold or a bond auction right around ... will cook\nHold on and ... ... ... playing along with about ... ... ... ... ... I'll turn down\nThe original feline comments section or always having to deal with some kind of ridiculous from liberalism bond is home port\nTalk [noise]\nRent radio stations across the land Joe ... dot com Facebook Twitter Instagram email all of animal rights activists the joke is the a sublease radio and it was also\nThe blaze radio network a lot of you listening there and I appreciate you every single time it is your boy Joe packed a note about ... before I go to John I Bush a couple of things are important number one when you go do a radio show\nOr you can both be heard at the same time so do you make an allegation that I Want to comment on it you gotta stop for a second and then I'll let you can to you but the fact that she wouldn't have stopped talking she thought that she would whether she kept talking unfortunately for you I have the microphone\nAnd I have control of of what's being hurt at any given time I know I have a decision to make either both of us speak the same time and my listeners and viewers don't get to your either of us or turn you down or just hang up on you know just keep talking\nUm it's not going to be both ways though I Am a fair guy that I'll stop and let you continue but if you gotta make allegation of drug allegation about how great CNN is and not let me respond it's not going to work when it comes to\n... because there are there are a few big lives out there about Donald Trump he was trying to ban all Muslims from coming here that's not true in fact the Muslim ban or the the travel ban yes\nYes predominantly Muslim countries were involved but Ninety One percent of all Muslims around the world are allowed to come here so that's a ... Islamic pope is just not true or the second allegation is that in Charlottesville he said that white supremacists are good people\nAre very funny people he didn't say that what he said was it's a it's a a very loud debate debate an emotional debate there are very uh there are bad people on both sides they are very fine people on both sides\nThe debate we're talking about is whether white supremacy is good or bad the debate is about monuments and statues to Confederate a war heroes or soldiers\nOr leaders that's what it was about cause they're tearing down people turned up monuments cause they feel like they can and they really can't it's against the law first of all and secondly it's a debate that we should have are there are good people on the side of of course the monument should stay there it's our history of course there are\nOther bad people on that side yep or they're good people on the side of Jared Jared down sure or they're bad people inside absolutely so he's ... he's not a racist because of what he said about Charlottesville but those of you who have listen to CNN and MSNBC and\nAnd the other left wing media outlets saying get over it over a drawing on and on and on you actually believe\nThat he is pro white supremacist guy he's not he's never said anything that would that would suggest\nThat he is and this whole thing about how we mocked disabled reporter is also ally yes the reporter does have some affliction where his hands are are are are in a position on his on his arms where I I guess I don't know what to do with the ... it's called but I'm showing people on the Web cam I mean his hands are sort of like this\nAnd when he talks is huge deal like that that that he doesn't have the full mobility over here it is and it's for arms as as most people do\nAnd the president what I guess the guy wrote something bad report something bad about or negative about the president and he said do look at me and he sort of did is he ended his similar fashion and made you know you just spoke at a at a certain kind of way well eight the guy doesn't speak that way so he wasn't ... mimicking him that way\nAnd be very good just go to you to use your brain and actually see the other side of the story\nThere are are are ... several examples example after example of president Donald Trump before he was the president before you even considering running when he's on Larry King live and other places where he's making fun of himself doing the same hand motion exactly\nSo ... mocking the disabled reporter\nUh beforehand was the president was the clear boy and once he making fun of the reporter in Nineteen Ninety when reporters didn't do the report until two veteran sixteen\nOr maybe just maybe and whether you like the fact that he does this or not sometimes he acts like a dark that way the president and he does have that way and he speaks that way do look at me and double trouble um stupid so you have to make a decision\nEither you're really you're going to believe what these these fake news outlets are saying and doing or you're going to do your own research it independently decide what is it that he said and what is it that he meant what is it that he wrote what is it that he meant would hand motion to do and if you ever done that before and one not talking about this reporter\nAnd then you make the decision but if you buy hook line and sinker what's fake news media is giving you you're the person who's in the wrong\nAnd don't ever give me your four year degree crap as if I'm some lowly radio guy or TV guided know squat an angel in New York and I know more than you you may in fact the unity no more than I Do but you failed but any debate when you walk into thinking you're superior\nI'm telling you that right now I'm going to have a debate on any level with anybody at any time\nBut I'm not willing to walk into where you think you're better than I Am and you'll win the debate by reminding me of the paper that you that you got from some journalism school\nThat's not going to help you I've got Thirty years in this business\nFifteen of which were I was just a journalist I was not a commentator wasn't somebody who gave an editorial is outlook I didn't write opinion pieces\nI gave you straight news to the point to my viewers and listeners had no clue what what by politics were so bringing next time I get ... but you better bring it better than that All right let me get to John Hi Bush he's the guy that runs the or the Reagan facility the Reagan Institute I'm ... and it's a really interesting conversation\nAbout how that President dealt with the media and how this president deals with the media John appreciate sharia\nOn this great great to be with\nYou I really glad to have you back I got to tell you something you'll with wonderful but that thing behind just got my attention it appears to be a plaintiff some short and some beautiful flags waving the breeze John what is that\nYeah well we're right here at the Reagan Library that's a A R at fourteen and Jen is one of the famous jets set foot off the carrier that a President Reagan ordered to shoot down the Libyan fighter pilots are when they came after our fleet at one point in Nineteen eighty six\nI Do remember that and I also remember that the President Reagan said watch this and went back in and launched an attack on on Gadhafi himself and that
