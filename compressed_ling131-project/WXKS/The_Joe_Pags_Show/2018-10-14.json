that tax return from Eighteen years ago they tried to get a refund paid on military severance pay back then I was married to a someone that I cannot locate now are hiding from having to pay ... or\nSo I have no way of contacting her and I haven't heard from her and like sixteen years [laughter] I don't know how to amend a tax return that would join with only one signature\nAh there there has to be a way of doing that\nBecause if the law allows someone\nTo file an amended return Twenty years later Eighteen years later a there's a a decent chance at the other partner their spouse or ... is not around\nEither can't be found a somewhere out there I remarried died whatever so I there there has to be a way within the rules of the IRS\nBecause the Irish is pretty good about issuing five thousand new rules every other minute so the trick is to find an accountant straight out accountant who understands these rules and now when you file your taxes or do you have an accountant\nChris yeah yeah have you asked your accountant about this\nYes and he wasn't curve anywhere could do it then you have and I happen to have an appointment with the Iraq on friday\nAnd that is one day yeah that's the way I'm Glad you're asking\nMe because of my vast expertise with not only this is tax law or this or tax returns and of course I you know when I have a complicated problem do you think I shouldn't researcher look it up now I go to Mike counting Chris\nJust like you did not what you did is you went a step beyond and that is what I Would tell you if your account and doesn't know or several account and you make an appointment with the Irish and yet and you might occur\nJets did that I actually find it myself and a maybe a picnic or just magically appear\nNo no I I Would I don't know why I don't know if I Would do that I don't know if I Would do that what I Would say to the IRS is do I have to find her and uh then I Will then I'll go to extraordinary lengths to find her and that's when I go out\nThat many grand behind the counter right\nAnother issue in there and they made this and you and and you may be able to get\nThe whole thing okay based on the child support order so I the magical signature ah she's she's still entitled to happen\nYeah now there could be a way where and this happens all the time with child support the IRS holds off I mean it'll grab people's money\nAre cases in that that stayed right now we're actually ... book surrender\nOkay so you're halfway there definitely time to talk to and IRS agent and and if the IRS agent doesn't know that rules specifically and ... it doesn't have any experience or or doesn't really understand that you go to a supervisor and you ask for someone who understands what's going on because it's a pretty obscure stuff\nAnd it's not as the ... and IRAs Asian who doesn't I understand this is incompetent in any way I mean if you ever look at the IRS code if you've ever look at the Internal Revenue code these our phone books thick\nWith hundreds of thousands of rules\nAnd you're not normally cook ... to amend after three years\nWell they've changed the law I Wonder if you want to ask\nMe I Would have said no but if they passed\nA law that is a different than we are in great shape\nIt's for military better yeah obviously on separate All right so is there any of 'em out there to get their return\nSo we're talking about a very narrow narrow description of a very narrow group of people\nAnd so you simply need someone who understands it and you're doing everything right man I'm there's nothing more I can give you other than you're doing everything right\nAlso let me tell you about life like here's something they do right and life locked protects your identity\nAnd of course another hack this was

talking about securing the release of American pastor Andrew Brunson Brunson was sentenced decades in prison in Turkey for supposedly having ties to terrorism\nShe's made that decision and the left media the legacy media in this country listening to what she has to say and is like now giving her grades if he hears the odds then\nAnd the whole thing is odd but Louis among those involved at all but here's the really odd thing\nWhen you turn on a television network whether it be CNN MSNBC or Fox News or were you see me during the week on Newsmax when you turn it on\nAnd somebody is presented as an expert on something\nLike all have an author on are all have a geologist on are all have a\nAn actor honor and I'll say this is an actor that you might remember from this this is a geologist who's an expert on this topic that we're talking about this is somebody who is a senator former senator um the IRS the president's son you'll normally present the person and say here's why you want to hear from this person\nOn some of the networks will say that the person who's a contributor well that means is the person is getting paid for your parents or an analyst\nGenerally speaking members and got to do with the heat on presenting it wasn't a lotto and they never say why are we supposed to listen to her and address illicit mulatto says really legal rights\nAnd then they do a whole story on at USA Today I'm confused why are we doing a story enlisted below into\nI don't get it I'm confused but not as confused as she is\nFor some reason she thinks if there's an equal rights amendment which is unnecessary because we have guaranteed equal rights in equal opportunity in this country for some reason she thinks that we had an equal rights amendment then\nChristie lousy Ford would have stopped the Kavanaugh nomination an appointment\nAnd she's never really said why and again I don't really care why ... why she is not an expert\n\nI talked about this by talking about this for a while now but we just we sometimes see our top athletes and people that we really like or actors or actresses people that we see you on the tube or or on the big screen for a long time\nAnd we ... ourselves well\nWe were you for some reason project intelligence on them\nA list of a lotto is not intelligent\nShe's somebody who clearly was easily indoctrinated and she has no idea what she's talking about none she has no clue\nShe has yet to make a point that makes sense\nYou get the the legacy media keeps putting her up on high because a she's attractive and be they think that she has some political sway that will help to get their viewers in general Americans I guess where the dumb people out here like ... like me to buy you this far left wing garbage\nElizabeth lotto actually doesn't help at all not ... doesn't know better side they think she does but she doesn't want to listen to the lotto actually does is she hurt the cause\n\nMe she actually makes intelligent people arguing may say well I'm definitely not going to vote that way lookout dumb this\nThe thing is that she's saying well look at taking selfies or taking videos well sitting in a very serious hearing or look at her blindly saying you must believe every woman goes every woman who's telling the truth when we've got documented case after case after case where sadly women have lied\nThey don't misunderstand me I'm actually at this from the beginning you should take every allegation of sexual misconduct seriously but you should not just simply because it said believe it you should believe in once it's proven\n\nBut there you go you turn on the job or or you read some of these current events websites there's Alyssa mulatto and they never ever ever never say why we should believer you should believe

who lost and had to surrender to sue us rent\nAllegedly if you believe NBC News of the Washington Post President Trump last night went to Ohio\nAnd praised Robert ...\nPeriod and their story and of course that's the only period and their stories your legacy media that large to your viewers and your readers and and those who follow you on social media of course the president did praise Robert de leite on his lead up to talking about how Ohio in\nUlysses Grant kicked his ass\nHe talked about what a great general Lee was and how great still kicked his ass\nNow the media knows that but they also know you don't know that you don't know that the president said it that way so if they say the president ... Ulysses S grade are they telling the truth or praised Roberts Lee are they telling the truth yes but it's also a student of omission or reliable mission\nThey didn't tell the whole truth\nGenerally take out to a section of that and make it sound like the president went to Ohio and praise Robert he leave and left and waved to the crowd in the event that aspect it's worth it's the best thing ever going to go to my my plane do go back to Washington yeah I guess you could say that if you're a wire [noise]\nA better thing to say it might be what he really said\nUlysses Grant was so freaking good vetting kicked this guy's Ashley this guy was really good\nThat was the context but why tell the truth when you can lie and been corrected later and by the way on social media when you lie under your your legacy media tens of thousands of a ... what do you correct it a few hundred that's the way it goes to this day and age eight hundred\nFive zero one Seventy eighty one eight hundred and five zero one seven zero eight zero bottom of this hour is going to be former Governor Sarah Palin\nThe great state of Alaska what a great conversation I had whether and how we ended up connecting on my show\nThe Joe ... show Monday through friday but you've got a mind boggling if you want to see the live video feed just shot by Joe bags dot com is the topic of the page that we've redesigned the page you can also see my parodies there you can get the interviews that I Do and my monologues as well\nAs the new stories to Joe packs duck on coming back on the weekend Steyer\nMessaging ...\nBurning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country might sound impossible to fit into your work loud\nBut what if there were a business degree to further your career and give you access to world renowned faculty leaders and mentors all on your schedule one that opened doors to some of the most influential CEOs tech companies law firms entrepreneur some thought leaders\nAnd what if you could earn that degree and it's a little less sixteen months one hundred percent on line\nTo find out more text offer to seven nine six four or five\nThat's ...

in Alaska but do lose Jonah boys and girls who served village Sarah how are you\nI'm doing great thank you for having me\nThey were not be mad at me for that whole thing like friday and the people know I was actually and this was unfolding on me or live you are listening but I was telling them what was going on\nAnd and I got a random Facebook message from somebody not named Jew who said Hi Sarah Palin and pick up the kids up and dropping dropping and it was the biggest one is a good point they should ... you've got a famous name and correct me if you're a teacher was do you remember what you said you said it's really neat I promise\n[laughter] to\nGo back and forth that when I needed it oh\nMy goodness somebody is cognizant of the fact we get pumped a lot and we get along so thank you for doing that and it was funny I started getting the calls and the tax people up here in la listening I Am a I Am I trying to verify me\nWell I tried to verify it a few ways when I got the email back from Sarah going dot com I knew that it was somebody connected with you at least um but then I sent you a tweet that you guys couldn't find and then finally I just said do you have an iPhone let me face time you'll let's just settled this once and for all and it's a good as we got to go to bake you so much for reaching out by the way\nAnd then one other thing about that is yeah so I'm grabbing Todd phone work by that time out of the vehicle and we're all in all these button to try to figure out how to say that\nIt worked out 'cause you brush the boat you took my first time in ... her but you know say that's her that's ... ... you got a hold of me because you are seeing what was unfolding or in in Washington DC I still to this day sure I have no idea how Lisa Murkowski be became the senator\nAs a write in relief so that's the starting point for me and then she says as a Republican IQ support Brett Kavanaugh and the reason she says she couldn't support him was that he's not the right guy at the right time\nDo the people of Alaska except that excuse\nNo and go back even further from her writing campaign ad after he lost the primary up here remember what's your guess Senator Frank were kept yeah after having served twenty two years in the U.S that he gave his daughter the job when he was elected\nGovernor up here right there on ... and I ran against him into heat it yep that's how we got and that's how we had\nThey didn't essentially 'cause man once you're in\nAnd you have these special interest from around the country right a funding you you know you should have to it's tough to hold them accountable and say okay enough is enough time to go but no I'm\nIrrational reasoning that she provided regarding that that that vote against Kavanaugh because as you point out\nShe said he's good man it's not about qualifications and I'm like wait you know\nAbout golf courses and whether either good matter\nYes I'm so no it didn't make sense and then her speech on the Senate floor which is kind of talking in circles are very very very disappointed because Joe as even suggested as you it outright set on friday\nThe things that she's putting in jeopardy not just for the state of Alaska but for this country I mean it comes down to the Supreme\nHaving so much with in its graph having to do with our solvency our sovereignty and she was willing to play some games with that\nWell she was willing to play dream to the point that I made that I really appreciate that you are you or your wife was up in our circuit court of appeals at all over the ... of course the former vice presidential nominee for the Republican Party back in two thousand eight and of course the former governor of Alaska\nAnd just a great all wrong person or you know this but I wasn't a vote for John McCain was going right of my mother's name until you got on the ticket and then I voted for you\nShow and I think a lot of people actually did that the point I made friday was Lisa Murkowski and people like her were actually putting in the hands of the most liberal court in the United states the Ninth Circuit court of appeals\nThe the um the more issues of Alaska and everybody in the west coast in other words if the Supreme Court is eight members and it's tied for foreign almost everyone we would be for the for now it goes back to the previous court in the Ninth Circuit court of appeals will decide the first amendment Chuck amendment Fourth Amendment Fifth Amendment Pence Amendment for Alaska what does that make you think\nThat that's exactly right and Joe I was impressed because nobody else was talking about that that share what her action was was essentially bolstering the nights circuits had she had her her way and that's the Ninth Circuit out of\nSan Francisco right you know it talked about injustice and justice being delayed for Alaskans because that court a million people they are to quote unquote served it's the largest by far\nUm the second largest as the eleventh and they are only thirty thirty five million right so there is such a backlog of cases and not even talking about the ideology behind that very very partisan very liberal Korea is just a practical reasons why we don't want to give them any more power anymore say over Alaska so\nFor me to be messing around with that uh that was very very dangerous and the other thing is that\n... o F F

Nineteen forty eight with this great American hero Whittaker Chambers\nThat is the unknown mistake voice of Dr Sebastian Gorka why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies that's an unbelievable story because I ... and again I'm you and I talk about it all the time and you know they're not as smart as you um but but I Know a little less reactor\nAct [laughter] I I ...\nI Know a little bit about history I pay attention I I Do a little dog and pony show every day I Would never ever have thought in my wildest dreams that the Democrats have been doing this\nFor Seventy years you're telling me Seventy years ago that they do the exact rice said em all the same modus operandi as we just saw a bunch of indoctrinated idiots scratching and clawing on the ... of of the Supreme Court so you're saying this is what they've done for the ages for generations now\nAbsolutely but this is what happens when you make a deal with the devil when when the left decided\nThat the end that there are ... getting power\nJustifies the means [laughter] this is what you end up doing your will destroy innocent man\nYou will try and you'll use every dirty trick in the book because as far as that can set\nIt doesn't matter what I Do to another human being because I have to have the power and that was so important I I couldn't put it in my book you know why we fight that happened off they came out yeah but when the president stood up\nIn the White House two days ago in front of the world\nAnd pulled out the Democrats for the evil things they did that justice Kavanaugh and thin pronounced him innocent that was a historic moment because justice wicket chambers within his said Seventy years ago so is justice Kavanaugh eight year old man who the Democrats tried to destroy\nThe

goes back even further even before World War one and World War two where this sort of fascism has\nBeen known to be on the left we just have pretended through history that didn't happen that way but but let me let me ask you about why we're so successful and I have an idea as to why\nBut but I'll ask you more more specifically\nWas it so successful because the right always cow town gave in and again you just have a outlined it incredibly this president said I'm not giving you this justice Kavanaugh decided I'm not going to give it I'm not going to allow them to do this to me but is that why it's lasted for probably the better part of a century because the right always gives in and\nPull the nominee or or bend over backwards for the left\nI'll tell you what I saw when I was in the White House so I I I had very quickly I developed the reputation the White House a lot of people especially the press department said I I miss the strange why because I refused I just refused flat out from day one to talk to\nThe the fake news I I ... I didn't care whether it was washed the post ... ... and it I said no why would I talk\nTo people who wish to destroy this president I'm ready to go on record or off wreck or the trouble is\nThe majority of the establishment until the Kavanaugh hearing the majority of their status with a GOP Senate is that the the the bureaucrats in the in the White House they want the joke they won the approval\nOf the New York times why they want the approval of CNN [noise] this is the problem and you know why that's so ridiculous number one they wish to destroy us look at what they've done for the last two years\nSecondly who cares about CNN yeah you know I I Know just because of the White House book as you know how many people watched the most\nQuote unquote important show on CNN every night and this and ... have no you know how many people know OK so Sean Hannity crush it right he is the ... my only get ... yes he is the king millions and millions and millions of us to every show\nAnderson Cooper the star\nOf the Clinton used that work Monday Night his show gets six hundred thousand view is\nAnd that somehow they're showing record Dr Gorka how how is it that people and you're right people on the establishment right people in the swamp on the right or afraid of what Anderson Cooper will say about them\nRight we have three hundred and twenty five million people in this country or less than half a percent what's what's Anderson Cooper if they weren't paying thanks to conduct called so we now they we now do they pay if they were paying the CNN to be broadcast in America's airports that'd be three people including\nSome who are watching the show it is is what we have to break the GOP want the approval of these people but I Know what last friday did you watch the press conference by the Republican senators who ... who was actually in power and yeah\nThey were angry I have never seen them so angry at the Democrat so that is costing behave yeah so you know what I think something's changed but everybody\nBe deadly serious the midterms are the most important election of our lives don't take it for granted go to vote take your friends to but if you like the last two years and you want six more we have to win the mid ...\nHe is Dr Sebastian Gorka the name of the book is why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies one last quick question I always appreciate the access in the friendship thank you until shown I said all of her friends as well\nI'm a motive when it comes to left versus right politics I just saw an article by the hill that says that millennials overwhelmingly are liberal leaning left will vote left I also saw another recent polling I forget who the pollster was but it's a real one\nThat says that suddenly the G.

with my former governor the governor former governor great state of Texas Rick Perry he's the energy secretary for the United states of America now and you might wonder well what the heck is that person do\nA lot clearly and a lot of travel is well we talked about bad we talked about liquefied natural gas to get a ... an war as well our ... our you\nJoe I'm good thank you very much we're I'm up in Washington DC for a few days here so uh you know taxes but it's a it's what are called temporary duty\nAnd you're fighting the fight very well it's interesting as you know I'm connected with several people on your staff and I can see their travel on Facebook and on Twitter and so on you or your or a globe Trotter now is it did you know that was going to be part of a job to be over in Africa there'd be over in Europe to be over in Asia and then back home base it on your back over Indonesia\nWhere did you know that that was gonna tell all of us\nAre not necessarily but what's happened is is the energy revolution runners off that occurred in the United states it makes sense in hindsight that would be an all those markets because it's you know we're now\nSelling American a liquefied natural gas into thirty different countries on five continent ... and\nUh there there's more to be done so a bee in their\nUh I I consider one of my jobs of it obviously being a regulator making sure that\nWe're a you know were regulated at the permit process is smooth and as\nA as as transparent as it can be but it's also to be the you know a salesman for American energy whether it's a a liquefied natural gas for the rich are crude whether it's our fossil fuel whether its nuclear energy whether it's a A R renewable technologies all of that is desired around the world\nAnd the secretary of energy that ought to be their job\nIt's the United states secretary of energy Rick Perry so I'm watching the uh the terror of talk of the trade talk and the leverage that are that the president has and and he's putting it on the ... you and everybody in the left in this country ... they're all complaining you know good he's putting terrorist is going to ruin trade and in no time sweat\nYou stepped up and said we're making a deal we don't want the terrorists we want to have fair trade that in a big part of the deal was liquefied natural gas\nNow are you are you consulted as the president's doing that as you liked Rick can we do this Ellen gee thing can we make this happen can we make a part of the bill how does that go down\nYeah he he obviously talks to 'em you know [noise] extensively with his cabinet or the as the secretary of treasury\nMy notion and secretary of commerce Wilbur Ross day all have a role to play and that and so absolutely there's a there's a good a correspondent back and forth\nAnd a ... everybody's on the same team I Want to get back to you know this is what people should expect\nI mean I Know the left doesn't like him for a lot of reasons you know ... and that is what it is right ah but they're not being realistic they're just they're just they don't like him because he's not Hillary\n[laughter] that's true\nBut it's true and and and the point is that what you would expect to see out of a a negotiator a person who goes and what they really hard line I mean he he plans on winning I mean his his theory here is that listen\nIf I trade you and you agree to it you know that's your fault not mine\nUh [noise] and and that's exactly what he's doing with these trade deals where he comes to a certain really hard stuff\nI mean you think about with you and then a young and came back in here\nOr after they laid out some really tough or a sanction on on sanctions but tariffs retro a trade deals with the Europeans and they said you know what we decided we want to buy your allergy and let's let's find a way so did the Chinese ... again\nYou know hedge blew up when they announced the tariffs to originally with China\nAnd then the Chinese came back a few days later the Chinese know that they will lose a\nThey know that we will lose a a trade war or or the Chinese don't lose a trade war with us so you know\nI think those were the biggest customers they don't want to screw with us that would be dumb [laughter]\nSo we just want you to be fair we want you to be right an equitable we want you to be transparent oh and we don't want your stealing our IP either our international uh our our intellectual property\nRights of any good neighbor yeah that that's another big part of it it's a energy secretary Rick\nPerry you were in the state of Texas so efficiently and our economy here still booming onto the great guidance of of great guy but now when you get into a position where you know there's so much bureaucratic red tape\nAnd there's so much garbage so you've got to go through before you can actually get to the source of the issue when you finally got to see what these trade deals worth especially energy wise with these other countries were you surprised at how uh how completely out of balance they were we got very little they get everything it was very strange yeah\nIt it was really pretty fascinating and here's the other side of it is these things were outdated do you think about the north American free trade agreement that was put in place I think in Ninety two is when it was side that was twenty five years ago and and think about where America was twenty five years ago from an energy standpoint I mean\nCompletely a hundred and eighty degree uh we were dependent on a lot of countries that didn't necessarily have our interest in mind who ... a a developing a the energy sources that we were buying and now\nI'm you know Mexico and and and and Canada both\nVery different positions than we were twenty five years ago so it makes a button that good sense that the president would say you know what it's time to renegotiate this thing and we got an email now the uh\nAnd UK

congressman Andy bars reelection as he has done in other rallies he went after the Democratic challenger in this case military veteran Amy McGrath\nIt's Senator Ron Johnson Republican the great state of Wisconsin once that he is out there instead of the Feinstein teams saying let's get you some help and let's get a psychiatry psychologist to talk you through his figure out what happened she instead says here's the far left wing resist lawyer and this lady Deborah attach go and talk to her I mean I don't think that's the right move either were you on that\nNo I mean let's face it to her attorneys wanted a show trial you know they wanted to make a spectacle\nOf her and Brett Kavanaugh and that's when they got they they they they weren't really representing her interest as far as as far as she said what are rich resource you ought to remain anonymous she didn't want her life publicly exposed is way but that's what her attorneys did to her\nYeah it's a center on junk food right last question on Kavanaugh know what I'm going to be on affordable healthcare act and and what you guys are doing a very positive way for the American people are but one last question to you know on the court and the left are screaming and yelling give us back the house will impeach him\nI mean again it's ridiculous and I'm not really sure why any voter even somebody who lean left would say well yeah I'm going to vote for impeachment for no reason um what do you make of that that sort of their Montreal we're not going to kick them off the court because we're so unhappy that he's on the court well\nWas there an angry mob and ... they they've been they've had this primal screams since the day after\nElection when the wrong person according to them one\nI've never seen his like this Joey known in my lifetime there's always some measure of hunting room there's some\nYou know best wishes to any president who's taken enormous task right hoping they succeeding keep this nation safe and prosperous and secure that never happened there's been an effort to sabotage this mystery shop from day one in the media and certainly in the Democratic party\nYeah it's a Senator Ron Johnson Republican the great state of Wisconsin let's talk about the unaffordable Garrett character you supported the president as it all Republicans and has been all Americans because our paychecks are bigger and\nAnd do this this individual mandate went away you supported the tax change and the individual mandate change that actually helps people of the major amount of people that were paying that find that tax the an Affordable Care act were middle class people\nThat were harmed horribly you guys had a great job of lowering taxes for all Americans for corporations\nAnd getting rid of the individual mandate nobody but nobody that I Know of on either side wants to get rid of preexisting conditions although the leftist pretending to you Ron Johnson and the president on down all want to get rid of preexisting conditions that's not the case but you were a big supporter of of the individual choice and health care\nAnd the the idea that the left somehow is making it a of a political thing is strange to me why wouldn't we want individuals to have choices and competition to lower the prices fill me in on how this is unfolding and how they think this was a win for them\nWell first of all this is just another big lie remember President Obama if you like health care plan and keep it ya families who have their premiums reduced try five hundred dollars per year me was politifact two thousand Thirteen year right beside of be the two thousand Eighteen live a year or they they are pushing a congressional Review Act to reverse a rule\nWhere President Trump is just reinstating the short term limited duration plans right in the form they were under Obama right\nAnd they're saying that we're gonna take away preexisting conditions nothing could be further from the truth the Urban Institute which is a left leaning think tank said if we reinstate these things to three to four days which is they weren't or a bomb you and then in addition to that allow companies to offer me no ability okay so so you give people greater assurances\nFour point three million Americans will avail themselves of these plants because they're far more affordable one point seven that four point three or previously uninsured because they can't afford Obamacare\nAnd Joe the premium estimates and get their just estimates and in Wisconsin for example health\nEstimated that a family of three that the lowest cost or by Medicare plan costs sixteen thousand dollars a year you know they can get an insurance plan getting out the same kind of coverage but something that they would choose for about twelve hundred dollars a year that's an enormous difference other estimates say premiums will be cut in half or two a quarter\nOf the current level so in other words you're paying four thousand bucks a year you may be only pay a thousand so I didn't know where the premiums land a complete depends on the insurance product you choose right but it's your choice you putting patients back and nothing can be further from the truth preexisting condition guaranteed remains in place those protections you can always go back to the Obamacare\nExchanges if you could afford them and of course eighty seven percent of Americans are on those are subsidized with the the vast premium tax credits so they don't care what premiums caused because the American taxpayers foot that bill\nI Want to go back to something you set a second ago and you said a kind of quickly but I think it's probably the most important thing to do the entire conversation\nPreexisting conditions aren't touched nobody is saying of those with preexisting conditions can no longer get healthcare they're going to die in the streets lepers or something but just really reiterate that for me center if you can is there anything in this that the president or the Senate or the house are doing that will get rid of covered for those who have pre existing conditions\nNo absolutely not we we can't change the law we'd have to change the law we can't do through regulation right so the ... the protection terms or preexisting conditions you can always go on the Obamacare exchanges were just giving those individuals particularly the forgotten men and women that don't\nGet the subsidies that can't afford they'd been priced out of the Obamacare exchanges we're giving them an option to be out to be able to afford\nHealth insurance for once okay ... this is a this is a big lie it's a totally false what the Democrats are are peddling here in terms of of the short term when when ...\nYou have an opinion as to why they're doing it as a ... is the only because they want single payer period we want socialize healthcare period we will argue against anything that's competitive or capitalistic or or free enterprise base does that really what the argument is\nWell first of all they want to win this election they they realize if the if the American people actually believe Republicans want to take away that protects our pre existing condition which no Republican wants to do right okay the American people spoke on that\nOr they think they can win the election but no I mean there are long term goal obviously is Bernie Sanders your Medicare for all which is which gets rid of Medicare takes the Dallas dedicated to Medicare and puts it tore his single payer government run\nBureaucratic system that will ration care will reduce the number of doctors because who's going to want to be reimbursed at Medicaid rates right by the way that's the only reason only costs only\nCosts thirty two trillion dollars if we reimburse providers at current rates it costs more like thirty eight trillion dollars every buddies individual income tax at least have to double business\nTaxes at least double and it's still won't pay for it\nI urge anybody who's listening or watching the right down to number thirty two trillion they realize how much money but as a Senator Ron Johnson a one last question I run a rose reshaped the access of the time and You're welcome anytime I friend\nUm when it comes to the mid term you just mentioned briefly\nI feel strongly that bit knowing bill the Senate stay with you guys but you
