to refuted I Want a reconsideration does is Fifteen Years ago and they do have the process you have to go through all of that first okay because something somebody is making a mistake that doesn't work for\nThe new the new and said what we bought the debt so it just starts all over again\nIt's not true well that's what they told me I don't\nKnow if a new collection agency or the credit reporting agency ...\nOkay have you checked have you looked at your credit reporting out your credit report\nYes absolutely entitled on and it's still on the credit report correct\nOkay you can't forget about the collection agencies ah they just hang up on them that they have nothing to do with it or threaten them or I keep on telling people just say hey I'm recording this call is a Fifteen year old dad I'm recording this you have no lawsuit against meats and you argue consenting to\n[noise] to keep on being recorded and they'll hang up on you so ah the next problem and this is the big problem is that from Fifteen Years ago a debt that was unpaid is still on the credit reports vets that's an issue\nBecause that's huge damages so well could actually destroys your wife effectively having no credit especially in this day and age All right so you go through the appeals process you say I Want to refute it sent me the paperwork and your refuted you say Fifteen Years old\nAnd you ask them it don't you have a policy of uh after seven years I've been dropping from the credit report\nAnd what are they gonna say nope that policy has gone\nIt's crazy I agree it's crazy\nYeah I don't I don't understand it I mean I just don't understand that happening I'm had credit and I've had\nClients who had ah the issue\nWith these statutes ... with these statutes that no longer fly for your statue in California for example when on paper to ... a credit card or any written a contract and a credit card agency or collection agencies and some of them are real ... agencies have called\nAnd people know there was a four year statute\nAnd they'll say hey this was five years to go there is a forty year statute they just changed the law\nWhen they changed the law last month it's now a ten year statute\nAnd what do you do well my clients had okay just send me just give me the code just tell me what ... told me the PIN number let me look it up right now if I owed them money will start talking oh oh oh you know that sort of thing\nKind of horrible world out there with credit credit reporting I mean there's a whole is I think it's gonna be a huge huge a new area of the law dealing with it already is a\nPretty good size area and are those are people that deal with credit but it's a it has to explode just has to explode All right Paul Paul Europe welcome to handle on the law\n[laughter] hello about a year and a half ago my Seventeen year old and a clothing store and a\nHigh on the repairs and she walked up to the girl checked the items [noise] oh she checked committed something I'm not sure what she did she handed the\nFarmers factor she went and tried in on the parents want him to step device without the back cover and its laughter scratch your leg\nYeah Eighteen Inches ooh they're anything there\nI mean is there anything there are I mean he told me about the scratch or was the was the femoral Ari a artery cutting did she bleed out there is a\nNo no I wasn't I was thinking more of a the trip so we went through\nWe all know no ... no one cares about your stress that\nFor an aids test we had to have her tips\nFor HP ... wait a second in age test because one of those security devices scratched\nHer and you did an aids test\nWell how many people how many other GOP scratch but how do we\nRight okay so you did the AIDS test and of course came up negative\nYeah okay now what that's why I'm asking you\nNo matter of fact there is nothing good news is there's nothing there either in terms of the case or the AIDS or that yeah yeah no there's nothing there there's there I mean theoretically dad she go to the doctor that you get stitches uh\nYeah the emotional ... there's not an an emotional issue when you get scratched [laughter] so no there's nothing there although you know it's always interesting is there I have my knee and is there anything there in you know everybody default this is America where you default to how\nDo I get money ... how do I get money and then we start\nTalking about well what what happened and oh okay so there's nothing there well emotionally distraught uh I'm Upset because I I Want\nMoney and I can't get money and therefore can I sue because of my anticipation of getting money oh sure that's a great case oh why not\nMiss high Agnes welcome to handle on the law and get my sure\nI got a problem I have a my guy a fake that's that's what they can ... were less than half hour and they had seven how I did I doubt it I Wonder though I have a right to ask them to the investment\nFrom what I mean how much did you pay\nSeven how do I know but how much do you think you should do they fix it or not\nI think that that have\nIt doesn't matter I don't care if they fixing half an hour or did they give you a bed did they give you are an estimated\nFamily oriented you pay did you pay for the glass door being fixed and when did they did\nThey say it was going to cost eight hundred dollars or just after the ... they handed you a bill for eight hundred dollars\nNo no not\nAll right and just don't pay I got a\nWell then that's the problem you have a Agnes because you paid it and now you're saying I pay too much\nSo it's a they're going to say you accepted our\nOur bill the bill basically use verbal says I Want a eight hundred dollars\nAnd so uh and then there's the issue of uh contractors over five hundred dollars you need a written contract but I don't think that's yeah that's going to be particularly important although it might be in a in the case of a a small claims spending on the judge so ah you wanna do it's worth something Agnes right does the work they did\nNot like what do you think you should pay I\nDon't know much about it\nAnd that may be reasonable so you turn around soon for six hundred dollars and you take it to court and they are going to say you accept the deal and you're going to say it's too much money and I didn't know and then I found out that they just rip me off its predatory\nBut I think it is and then\nWhat do you mean you're not did you hear them eight hundred dollars in hundred dollar bills in cash\nNo no I didn't my credit card\nOkay so you have the points that you paid them eight hundred dollars okay and you're saying it's too much and you and you want your money back and the overcharge you okay\nAnd you didn't know the overcharge you until after the fact and they were going to argue it doesn't matter what we charge we told her I was going to be eight hundred dollar she agreed they're going to lie about it at this\nAnd you're going to go to court and tell her to a judge\nOkay that's that's all you can do\nThat before I go to of course you you have to ask them first okay that's why you\nHave to make a demand you went in writing say you over charge me I've checked around\nAnd by the way you do have to check around you just can't arbitrarily say I I think it's only we're two hundred dollars 'cause what kind of expertise you have that and there's nobody cares what you think it's I checked around and you do want to check and it's worth two hundred dollars you overcharge me I Want my six hundred dollars back\nYou make that demand they're going to tell you to go pounds Sandra pound glass in this case\nAnd you are and they'd go to sue when they say no [noise]\nNot that complicated [noise]\nThis is handle on the law [noise]\n\n\nRadio brings do you think for you to have thought in the mood for you just like your mom still have unlimited gift\nYou're listening to your favorite ... station I heard radio kind\nOf

Kavanaugh was sworn in this evening after being burned by the Senate President Trump claiming victory tonight at a political rally in Topeka, Kansas he will [noise]\nPusher on the bed laid on top of her ... her clothes off put his hand over her mouth and she she got away and then and then left she says the guy to be more judge was in the room was playing the music loudly and wanting interference for Kavanaugh mark judge says wasn't there no idea what you're talking about\nHer her very good friend late and somebody a girl said I have absolutely no recollection of that ever happening and I don't think I've ever met Brett Kavanaugh\nAnybody and everybody else but she said was that the party has refuted the quite well Christie lousy for testified in front of this panel they say the Judiciary Committee\nAnd leaving bear left and right middle everybody's Raj incredible credible witness credible which is actually true she's not credible she might be believable that she really is\nWhere she really does believe that she's a victim and something really did happen to her but it is incredible that it was Brett Kavanaugh and it's simple to to go down logically as to why\nShe doesn't know when it happened not even a year doesn't know where it happened not even the neighborhood doesn't know whose house it was doesn't know how she got to the party doesn't know how she left the party she's been incorrect about everybody she says was that the party that you actually give it a couple of different numbers as to how many people were at the party\nRed cabin on the other hand has\nCorroborating his story and he's got a a calendar that shows what he was doing every weekend and every weekday basically\nNineteen eighty two or whatever it was\nSo as much as she might have been believable that something happened to her and I hope she can smell the knees and hope the person who did it is brought to justice but it was not credible her allegations against this guy specifically\nAnd that to a point ability Asia and that the the legacy media didn't want to have\nLegacy media didn't want to say well she's credible as somebody who probably had something happened to her but it is not credible what's he saying about Brett Kavanaugh the legacy media didn't do its job and then a report that correctly the second accusation which I'm a woman named Deborah Ramirez\nWho says that at a party\nThere were playing some game that I don't know\nYou do to spin the bottle or it was a quarter as they were playing something to where if you lost you had to drink and they were purposely making her drink and got her so drunk or you're going to remember anything and then she's told wrecked Kavanaugh put her but his member are pulled pulled it out and put it in near her face\nNow she admittedly doesn't remember it\nAnd when Democrats staffers from the Democrats senators that are on the panel calls are contacted her\nShe spent six days calling old friends asking headed something happened to\nMe you remember anything happened to me and nobody remembers anything\nBut after six day she decided yeah I I guess it did happen I wasn't I wasn't sure but yeah I I Am now he did it I don't remember him doing it but I remember people telling me that he did it to which Kavanaugh said no never did anything like that what are you talking about\nThe third one is from slime ball lawyer I have an oddity is truly sweat Nick who says that for three years Brett Kavanaugh and mark judge worthy organizers of parties where there would be trains are boys partake in gang rape\nCabinet and judge she said which bike the punch with grain alcohol\nAnd quail moods\nShe knew this was going on but she was smart enough to not drink the punch then one day and this happen between Nineteen eighty one Nineteen eighty three she said but one day a one party joints ten of them in Nineteen eighty two she somehow was the victim and was gang raped\nBut continued going to the parties where there's not a full year\nAnd instead of calling the police what she said was just don't drink the punch she changed her story to NBC News at least once NBC News instead\nOf saying we can't run this because she's not viable not credible not believable they ran it anyway and then said it's important to note that the stories you're saying today is different or there are differences from the story she originally told us her story has changed a bunch of times and her history comes out that she somebody that makes you got about allegations all the time\nSo completely not credible\nBut that didn't matter to grow because Booker and that didn't matter to lay heat that didn't matter to Feinstein that didn't matter to Coons they didn't didn't matter to come up with Harris it didn't matter to any of these people\n\nHe was he's guilty Cory Booker grow because they're called Spartacus but he's admitted Grover when he was Fifteen he groped a girl he admits that he's a senator somehow he actually said at this point it doesn't matter if he's guilty or innocent\nCory Booker said that and he meant it\nIt doesn't matter if judge Kavanaugh's guilty or innocent at this point well that I Believe galvanized us as a people we said that's not fair due process it as in this country is guaranteed you are innocent until proven guilty and if that's the threshold than it is\nThen he's innocent nothing any of these women has said or the the the slimy lawyer has said or the far left wing resist lawyer cats who is a lawyer for Ford nothing they've said\nHas proven anything\nAll you have is Deborah Ramirez completely uncorroborated in fact refuted by people Julie sweating it just seems to be a ... from outer space story she's giving\nAnd of course the Ford\nOnly vase say something happened everybody else named and the FBI spent five days six days interviewing many more people came to ... didn't come to conclusions offered up evidence that there is no corroboration there is nothing more here\n\nYet the left is still today go on Twitter read your favorite website they still today have these paid protesters showing up in the Senate halls\nTheir dock sing people which means they're putting out their information their their phone number is their addresses\nIt say a violent crew of idiots\nThat are still just completely disconnected from the rest of us middle is a mulatto is your spokesperson Amy Schumer is your spokesperson\nAnd their argument against Kavanaugh they're still attempting they're still exempting these days are rapists serial rapists unified her rapist on the court it's it's a disgusting display they are trying their best\nTo change the best although flawed system judicial system on earth to to being Saudi Arabia or something or China\nCome on man\nSo Brett Kavanaugh and again as I Do the show it's not happened yet but I assume that he will be confirmed later today there are a couple of things that could happen between now and then and I guess we've gotta talk about Lisa Murkowski who is a an alleged Republican from Alaska who is going to vote against Brett Kavanaugh today\n\nAnd she the reason she gave was he's a good man just not the right guy for the job right now with what\nCome home and so I Need your thoughts on this\nI I'm guaranteeing that you would have never been this engaged in a Supreme Court nominee ever in your life I guarantee that is true but let's break it down and where are you on this even if you're on the left even a politically you're a Democrat or a liberal and somebody who

letter\nEven when she was talking to Brett Kavanaugh privately in her office didn't say a word\nHad a letter when she was questioning Brett Kavanaugh um it'd be open to hearing didn't say a word when it looked as though Brett Kavanaugh was going to be fast track because he's easily qualified for this job then suddenly somebody in her office or some lawyers somebody leaked to the fact that there was a letter and with the woman's name was\nSo no matter what you think of Christie love before she was a victim your two of the left politics\nEight hundred five zero one Seventy eighty let me go to the phone lines to see where you are on this coast were either a country divided on world country galvanized I think this was just\nAn absolute practice\nIn futility for the left and I think that it probably served to motivate bows on the right I think you'll see a lot more conservatives and Republicans do\nGo to any centrist that lead right go to the polls for the midterm whereas they might have set set at home before I think the Republicans will gain two or three seats in the Senate and we'll keep control of that body it's still going to be very close to my house but it would be able to better cheap now because now the bases riled up\nThis was a really bad miscalculation by the left in this country the political ... let me go to the ... they say hello to uh Roger who's in Spokane Roger what's going on I\nCan run and yo hey I think lake lake is appropriate name thank you and where and pay for that and I'm really disappointed in every\nYou know not sticking out stronger during

disappointed in the whole process thing that we have and needs to be elected the next the Korean court justice\nRoger I think it's a very good point the Republicans were very weak to begin to eventually go by the way I'm very weak\nIn the beginning they just didn't want her to keep decorum they wanted to keep it all up and up and I and I can appreciate that but when the hearings distorted let's go back to that a month ago\nAs soon as grassy started speaking Kamala Harris interrupted him rudely you all this fake outrage about how cabinet interrupted Feinstein and some others because he was fighting for his political and personal life and for his family Kamala Harris purposely interrupted him\nYeah Cory Booker purposely interrupted him\nI think global started\nThere were ... ... it was it was set up then you had protesters that there are some pictures out there that suggests they were getting paid to go to the cheaper in protest so all this fake outrage about Brett Kavanaugh on it and his ... and his temperament as they told me yes\nBut I agree with you the Republicans and grassy I think that in the end they did it the right way but as that was going on hey wait a second elections have consequences we won were in charge of this committee I Will clear there's room with the human interrupting than it would ... would proper protocol is where they were breaking it on purpose\nBecause they really thought they're putting on a show which somehow waiting for them he turned out it made them look like idiots will be it used to that they are wide in Lexington, Kentucky I applied what's going on\nYour back thank you very much for taking my call really you've got a I think the\nDemocrats are definitely oh now they're [laughter] they're getting worse ... about a month they're just getting worse and worse and they try to take this man down it's just it's\nVery frustrating or the other thing is I Can't understand how anybody could think that Corning a trainer at a man makes being guilty\nAnd you got a list of the most out if that's true but that's why the court case\nAnd I just think it's also what they're trying to do to Brett Kavanaugh because the guy obviously has a lot of class he's a very well rounded young man I\nCall and young because I'm sixty six I'm over the hill\nBut ice he [noise] he he's just a great\nCalifornia ban that you'll be rather

assault more than one [noise]\nUm I was in law enforcement as well and I think that if we listen and we let\nOff allegations like the um Dr Ford may have been assaulted but there is nothing to do that with cabinet right if we let women like to come forward and do this kind of damage to manage reputation it's actually going to set back women have to find like decades\nUm I I went through a horrible time in the seventies when I was attacked and it was because of women that come forward with I mean that's why we have that term crime rate because women have notoriously done at when they've been scorned or that\nOr or many other things and the fact that we would want to do that we wouldn't want judge Kavanaugh who surprisingly enough he's now in the second highest court in the country nobody came forward before now\nIt's it's just a political smear campaign and I do I do agree with the whole idea that they are becoming more socialist\nI have a friend that that would actually grew up in Argentina and came here and became of that if she is\nA hard core Republican and and try to explain to people what is truly like to live in a socialist country\nWe don't want to go that way but I just find it so hypocritical that here we're examining this person for a job in a court where he's supposed to be fair right we get that when he showed his emotion why he's being attacked unjustly\n... you're going to be more correct that he ... something one of the most unfair things I've ever seen it may be hard you know going to be here\nAnd and liberal minded about this I'm Sorry to observe it

I mean I only have nine hundred kids last year from you know a sex trafficking but they're terrible we should get rid of them I mean these people are insane and so we have to get out we have to stay motivated we have to bring our friends\nAnd you can't buy into the media stuff just look at what's going on in your business is look at what's going on your place of work looking your paycheck I mean you're winning with these policies these policies are moving the needle these policies are making a difference in America's getting respect again because we're not going to let little third world countries push us around and slap us around\nYou know I gained ... and we have\nTo remember that because they can all go away in November\nAnd people need to realize that it's Donald Trump junior and I appreciate the access let's talk about Texas or as you know I'm based in San Antonio Fifteen stations in Texas we've got a hundred and twelve around the country but we focus now on Texas because there's been a real challenge Robert Francis awoke is what I call these somehow cold really appropriating Hispanic and he's\nNot he's not at all and spending on he'll pretend he is for the road but that's a democratic ... you can get away by the way if Ted Cruz did something like that now he happens to actually be Hispanic selling for granted that something like that they would destroy really have to use it every day for ... or\nIt's not a problem when he said something about what was the voluptuous breast or whatever that that's not a problem that only one day story of Ted Cruz did that it it would be you know he should be disbarred he should be you know write it killed ... we're not fighting a fair fight and there's down ticket races that are dependent on this thing\nHas been great for Texas He's done he's fought for those values I look at the ... platform I'm like I said I mean this is in New York City mayoral candidate running for senator in Texas\nWell he's getting big support for Mellon so you know that's a good idea it's Donald Trump junior so you're in Texas you got Ted Cruz who uh I ... from ... wait longer than he's been a senator and he's always made promises that he's always done exactly what he said he would do was the first thing is your dad and went out in the primaries but they're very very similar politically in that they're not\nDoing it politically basically I'm going to do this this this this moves and your dad and Ted actually believe I should do those things I promise bigger it was just given as you know a ... puppy dogs it's weird well of\nCourse I listen I I really respect had him and it was it was a brutal primary\nAnd a little story I don't know if I'd actually even said this publicly but you know a couple of weeks after that and it was a brutal primary there was a big ... a a dinner in DC you know the usual you know this stuff\nI I went and all my friends are from tax on there all the time hunting fishing or raised a lot of money during a campaign down in Texas I'm sitting there at the Texas table and a couple of friends tests at the table and we actually have a great dinner good conversation at the end of the dinner and we say hey\nWhy don't you know we're going back to the Trump Hotel right in the middle of the sea on Pennsylvania Avenue we're gonna have a couple of drinks hanging out whatever you want to come along it came with us and that and the Trump Hotel we had a great time for three hours nice that's got yeah but you know and it showed me\nBeyond the guts if he understood down from going to be president and he was going to help support policies that he believed in that we're going to be good for America and they were going to be good protects and he was able to put all of that aside and now they have a great relationship\nBecause they're doing what's right for their constituencies and that was impressive to me that was a great\nA testament to his character and everything and I don't think I've ever told that story before but I think it's actually relevant because you're doing what's right for your constituency and I don't see that everywhere else I mean again look at where ... money is probably coming from writing\nThat probably doesn't represent the average guy in Texas right now that it probably represents the average guy in the Hollywood studios so close you know that's\nThe difference and I don't want Texas to become California\nTexas I mean just look at the economic success if it had to look at all this debt but you want to become California give me a\n... and the people from California bringing their politics but that doesn't make any sense to me it's a it's Donald Trump junior ... ... you have an opinion as\nTo why anybody would listen to I'm going to take away your tax cut ...

Senate Judiciary committee and the majority the other Republicans I gave her that um but you're right they're talking about ice and beer this week and so that's probably a positive sign we respect the process of folks like Senator flake and others wanted the FBI investigation expand the um\nExpand the supplemental investigation here since the FBI has already completed six\nVetting on Brett

Believe it was yesterday Joe to the to the odd consequences that could follow to Ford's lawyers who either neglected to mention to her\nWhich was their their duty they mentioned it to Ford that she had an opportunity to testify under oath privately and in California\nWell it ever having a common washing either for lying under oath that she didn't know that or her lawyers failed to tell her and
