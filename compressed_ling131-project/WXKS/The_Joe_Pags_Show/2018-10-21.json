A.\nBy now and I'm just saying and I follow you and your husband is maybe I'm just going to say I haven't gotten to follow but when I was perfectly fine or a fun by that okay I appreciate it I'm a you\nKnow traditionally you bring up cabinet I've been told him to the cabinet bounds but it happened so early that I feel like things might cool down before the midterms and been dying and Feinstein yesterday like gave us a golden egg\nSomebody asked her if you guys when the Senate if the Democrats win the Senate will you reopen investigations into you know justice capital lower she said yes\nYeah well that that should not surprise anyone because we thought how crazy\nThey got during natural confirmation process that\nIt's it's really terrifying it is finally showing their true colors that Democrats are they really don't stand for much that's trying to be destructive and and do anything they can to go against the president and destroy him and I'll tell you go\nOne of the reasons I think that you eat do much with your defense out there in because this president is actually winning you don't try and stop someone\nDown or losing you only try and stop someone who's winning and Donald Trump is waiting for the country again\nAnd and they know that he's draining the swamp and they're terrified because the old way of life and over and they knew before and and it's very scary for people who are living the highlights in Washington D. C. are not going to end\nPutting on behalf of their constituents so it makes it scared because Donald Trump has nothing to gain from that he's he's doing it because he loves his country round to hold him to anyone but the American people and and they never had a president like this before um which is all the more than that we need all the Republican support we can and Congress\n... Laura Trump but really great to talk to your brother in law students I asked her husband this I asked the President Bush\nWhen he made the announcement I'm ... I'm guessing the family got at first I'm going to actually do this\n... jerk reaction because as you said he didn't need for anything he could be you know playing golf every day of Scotland right now and not worry about all this political stuff but his love for country said this is my calling was my duty what was your what was your thought process when it looked like\nYour father in law was really going to take the stuff\nI he actually that all of them down and said I Want to do that and then two days before the famous athlete or a\nDay during dinner and that you guys need to know that they're going to come after me they're going to come after you they're going to come after all of us they will attack that they'll tell a lie about it obviously and there have been hard to predict it will get to this level rise up but\nBut I I said I was a hundred percent on board because I knew that my father in law and do this job he's a businessman he is so smart when it comes to negotiating seeing when he's been able to do in in so many different respect what Tara with trade um\nHe's really great at that than I knew back then that he would be great at it um so for me it was a hundred percent and again I don't think anything prepares you for for all of this um it it it's so much bigger than any of us but\nThat's why I think although we all get attacked all the time although the president and different tack every second of every day\nNone of us for a second one change any of that because we know that it is about the bigger picture and the future of the country and\nIf we have to take a couple of things going on here and there and the president or you know take that every single day more than any of that it's totally worth it because I really think this country is headed in the right direction they get an I always tell him he's going to go down in history as one of the greatest presidents and countries ever had\nA ... roof that it's Laura Trump her husband his or her father in law is the president I asked him back in twenty six teams of because you just said it was nowhere near I mean you expected that the media would come after the leopard come after you guys but not like this\nAnd I asked him was this completely unexpected he said no I knew that they would want to go hard on me probably go dirty on me but I had a lot of friends in the media you told me I made millions and millions of dollars for NBC on The Apprentice for thirty or forty years the media actually treated me very well and wanted me in the newspaper or on their television or radio show\nSo he didn't know that it would get to this extreme you've been in the media for a long time I've been in newsrooms for a long time as well yesterday to lean left but I didn't know was going to be like this\nShow when we when was the realization for you in the family that this is way worse than we thought it was going to be\nWell I actually do for a portion of the campaign working at my former job in television and I ... it became very frustrating for me to work there because I Would be\nAll different nations but sometimes ours including um the way that they would find things in and say hey that's not what he said you know what is that right arm that that was it it it wasn't very clear wind to me that I don't didn't think that I was going to be able to work there for for forever if you know he became president ...\nBut um but certainly after they started attacking all of us personally and you know when I was pregnant they they attacked my unborn child\nNeeds to make them go on and he's a idiot so crazy\nBut again I think it's because they knew before that I'm trying to became president that if he got in there there was no turning back and he was all business and he was really going to be looking out for the American people and their own way of life was going to come to an end so um I have to say that it is just another sign that he's doing a great jobs\nYou know I Would agree with you you guys were you have the ... family members you to my wife is Lara Trump irritates her husband and father in law of course is the president of United States we've got we've got senatorial races now that are starting to lean writes\nThe midterms are starting to look better in the Senate for Republicans although I can say that it doesn't mean anything unless people don't vote in Texas where I should you've got to cruise the incumbent he was doing an incredible job in working with your debt with your father in law are very well know although it was rough on the campaign trail who's being shown from a guy by a guy who's basically Obama\nAre saying you know we can work together yeah one one undivided Texas but under the surface those you know these are far left wing socialist disco ward you look at places like Michigan were Debbie ... been there for three decades and it's time for her to go now you've got a guy named John James who might actually be able to get\nThat show that Israel's seat this really use going to come down to whether we can motivate people who believe in what they see happening now\nIn the country to get off the reruns and go vote for this really what it is isn't it\nOh absolutely well as I think you're right now I'm In Minnesota not traveling estate campaigning I Will be in your neck of the woods in Texas on Monday youthful\nI Will be on your day ironically in Michigan um they do still important we we know that\nThe president has done incredible things already and not with a lot of people against and even people on his own party sometimes money and get them to\nThink about what could happen if he had a coach the people behind him that voted on by\nPresident and and really pushing the younger forward we can see so much more progress in the country and by the way I Know we talk about socialism if anybody has any question about what social and them look like the look in Venezuela right now that could become the United states of America\nIf we let people like or or take over and and put his agenda forward it's really very frightening socialism has never worked in fact that the Democrats are embracing people like that should shocking everybody to\nAgree that you knew not only are going to get out and do it in the midterms but you're going to take everyone in your neighborhood and everyone in your family to go vote\nUm it it's very area and I I Know that it felt like a fight and twenty they seem to get Donald Trump elected in ... certainly was the fight isn't over you and you can't come back we can't relax we can't be complacent we have to get out\nAnd got to vote and put people in Congress or we're going to vote with the president\nDid run if anybody ever wants to know about socialism talk to them in their shoes are delicious who's his wife was from Venezuela who tells the stories of how disgusting 'cause there are people waiting in line for foods and the government officials show up beat them up maybe even children in the streets to take care of their families first is made him in a country could as horrific\nAnd you really do have people in this country because you've ... you've got people who are actually starting this guy Gillum in Florida we are going to go the way of socialism because that's the best way to go to Florida last question\nI really appreciate your time and by the way of luxury Minnesota we go for great stations or we were very highly rated in Minneapolis St Paul MTV okay they're hearing you right now um\nWhen you look at the fact that people on the left are saying volition will impeach the president will open the border will abolish ice we will roll back the tax cuts shouldn't take more of your money away it will drive jobs out of the country that's what they're running on and the factors there almost fifty fifty right known almost every poll you see\nWhat is it that we're doing wrong you went to ... done junior the president of the the Fox News sanity what are we doing wrong but it's still so close to ... to me\nWell I don't know Joe that it's really that close I mean we thought how accurate the Cold War and ... and a great point that I don't really think that if that is out there I think there are people that are afraid\nTo tell a pollster that call them or approaches them on the street\nSaid they want to vote Republican because the media and Hollywood has done such a a number on on people whenever they come out in support of the president or as a Republican I'm so I think it does make people a little\nHesitant to voice their support sometimes but when they get in the voting booth whenever no one else is looking when they think about the ... where we come in this country and almost elected in two years under President Donald Trump through\nIt

Gillum um this is secondary of course but I've heard reports that I've seen reports I've read reports that voting might be an issue it might be not as easy to vote because a lot of the places that are traditional polling places in that region of the Gulf Coast\nUm or going to be out to use that getting to handle a jacket and taking care of who's working on\nIt is so there's a the governor's working on that some of the local folks I think what you're going to see is they'll probably be extraordinary accommodations or the people that work display\nOr ... or stay on the county but I think you're looking at having additional polling\nLocation and then I think there's going to be a consideration or if you are just ... or you can vote and other county or your vocal silk out so I think they're working on that and by that that\nThat's something that's doable and I think that they will look I mean you know a lot of these folks um uh you know are not necessarily thinking about voting on the first thing on their mind but at the same time these are resilient people I mean you know the people in Bay county I mean they're so they're very stiff minded so I think a lot of them are even though they\nA lot of this debt to deal with I think they will be\nAnd while pretending a five to cast a vote\nIt is a Republican Ron deceived is running for governor the great state of Florida wrong you may or may not notice I've got several stations in Florida very highly rated in South Florida which is where I grew up I'm I'm I grew up in South Florida who's there for Twenty one years I mean ... to go back all the time my mom was there and my sisters are there and I thought I understood the politics of the area\nI clearly don't there's there was a sea change that happened since I moved away that I didn't see coming in and the southern tier of Florida that is very heavily populated is is having a fight whether it's center writer's center left but a lot of like the school districts and school boards and and a lot of the sheriff's officers do lean left\nOr how much of a challenges it for you to get any any movement in the southern part of the state which is so populated or to understand that your your your conservative guy that believes in traditional American values that and that's a good thing for Florida\nWell look we're getting we're getting contracts and I mean I think if you look at South Florida and for the Miami Dade County\nHuge energy with Cuban Americans\nUm other Hispanics like Venezuelans and the Nicaraguan to understand the dangers of socialism\nThey don't want to see socialism in Florida they know it didn't work in their home country uh we also have a very significant contrast which usually doesn't work this way and Florida politics but you know I'm One of the leading a pro Israel leaders in the country where I had been in the Congress\nYelling at the hospital to Israel I mean he uh is endorsed by a group that dream defenders which is prominent in the bbs movement against Israel they say Israel genocidal apartheid state I led the effort to move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem I think that was a great the food at one level hosted\nGillum opposes having our embassy in Jerusalem he opposes recognizing Jerusalem in Israel\nA tunnel indivisible capital so when you look at some of the voters who that is something that they are concerned about uh we have an opportunity to make some headway in areas that may be a Republican wouldn't 'cause the Democrat\nEven though their party has drifted more and more in Israel and Florida they usually nominate somebody who's pro Israel but they didn't they find they nominated Andrew Gillum was really aligned with the radical left which\nIs really a very hostile to Israel now\nOh he's a he's like he's really he's also into our freedom and liberty he's also pro taxation and and big government he's also pro abortion me the guy's a socialist he wants Medicare for all we can get into all the problems with him but I think that it's it's even more beneficial to talk about the positives that you bring to the table\nYou know it's interesting to me run in and I live in southern Texas now so I grew up around Hispanics I now live in a place where it's a predominantly Hispanic\nOr I've never met a Hispanic person who generally speaking is Catholic or Christian who is some far left is loon\nWhy is it that the Democrats have always been able to count on that Hispanic vote and would have guys like you and me how to do to let them know that we are on their side\nWhy don't the day that they have always been able to I think that the Hispanic voters not monolithic I mean in Florida you know we have a lot of conservative Hispanics than in South Florida", "show_name": "The Joe Pags Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Newton", "day": "21"}
