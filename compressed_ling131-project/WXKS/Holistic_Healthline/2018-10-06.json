{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WXKS", "content": "It's just a series of bad habits or bad decisions that kind of\nAccumulate overtime so we're often so busy just and the kids are running around that you know when we're done grocery shopping you know somebody might be like pulling the curtains off the wall are escaping out the back door and so as we're unpacking a can might not actually find its proper\n... beans are where the napkins belong right\nOr during the proper place but it's long past expiration and no one's taking it down and throwing it in the trash\nAnd so it's just one little mistake the wrong place or served its purpose and now it needs to be just removed and it wasn't and so these little incremental things weren't done along the way such that even though you organize a pantry and you did a wonderful job I Know you know inside a three month it's going to look like a hot mess again\nYeah it's everybody else in the house [laughter] our portfolios\nAre the same way\nIn that you know every single paycheck you're usually putting money into that plan and is it finding itself in the right place sometimes that money finds itself so to speak on the wrong shells if you catch my metaphor here or you've got things in your portfolio that you probably shouldn't have any more\nYou know it reminds me about a year and a half ago I met a gentleman who came in and he was an executive of G and I think yes I'm a like a million and a half dollars almost two thirds of which were all in G. E. stock\nAnd I said listen I Know how you got here you're probably awarded a lot of stock over the years as an employee but you can't have this money all in one place you need to diversify\nAnd he said oh let me tell you something jeeze going places here we are stronger than ever you know I'd be a fool to sell now and listeners if you've been paying attention to the news knows what the story is going\nAnd I said listen it's a free country you can stay concentrated in this position but if you're a client of ours we can't possibly abide by it it's too much shelf is going to break and he said well this is probably not the right fit for me and I would say well I agree and so we never ended up working together and I wonder about that guy sometimes 'cause GE stock has plummeted\nAnd in the absence of change she might have lost half a million dollars\nSo the ideas of what's going on in your own pantry or portfolio\nWhen's the last time you really took a look at it did some spring cleaning and made sure that you have an age appropriate mix that up to the task of providing what it is it you need and retirement\nAnd like I think it's important to point out you don't have a crystal ball you didn't know it was happening with allergies talk in the future you just saw that there was way too much weight and not one bucket so we need to move this around a little Ben diversified\nRight so I don't want any kudos for like saying hey I called that one in advance that's much more of a a specific like type of situation which we now know in hindsight was particularly bothersome\nI'll tell you though like most of the time what I see from a lot of people they'll come in and almost all of their money is in like one of their four one K. target date funds\nI mean again this has happened last week I had a woman she's a schoolteacher she's got everything in her for three days I think it's the twenty twenty five fund and she said well that's what the guy at work so that I should do and I said well you understand this one particular fund completely under performs at the wrong time you've got all your eggs in one basket\nSo Megan asked about diversification I thought I wanted to back into it I think here's where it is that we are the reason diversification is so important is because again\nWhen the market eventually tumbles and it does a couple of times every decade on the average if we have all of our stuff in the wrong place at the wrong time I mean it could hit the reset button on retirement the beauty of a diversification of inevitably we might have a couple of losers in our portfolio but hopefully we have a bunch of winners as well\nAnd it's that safety in numbers that makes ... a diversification so important\nBut I think a lot of people have no idea\nIf they're diversified or the best way to get diversified or maybe and said if it's the opposite they're concentrated and what risks that they're inviting into their portfolio as a result I Know in our house just likes to do that spring cleaning with the pantry like every few months\nI think to yourself when's the last time I really took a good hard look at my retirement portfolio has it been a few months or worse maybe years\nOr longer the idea that if you're not giving that account or the accounts that you do have a lot of TLC there's probably a lot missing in terms of what you could be earning or the protections that you might have through proper diversification a little education\nGoes a long way in for you we want to make sure that you're in the proper place for word is in terms of your retirement journey so you don't have to worry about whether or not your situation is optimize\nCome in for a second opinion let's look at your portfolio and see if you've got the right diversification mix dial eight eight eight Arcadia come on in for complimentary consultation I Know me and the team would love to take a look and see what it is that we might be able to do to help\nDial eight eight eight to Seventy two twenty three forty two again that's eight eight eight to Seventy two twenty three forty to\nMike your website justice is just a great resource at the end of the of put together for our listeners it's on track and on time dot com if you're beginning to think about retirement if that retirement date is quickly approaching start they're good at the website again it's on track\nAnd on time dot com you could find out about the dinner workshops that Mike and Jess host great events to come meet my desk and the team\nFind out more about them their philosophy for retirement and generating retirement income making sure that you have that plan in place share a great meal with them as well\nGo to on tracking on time dot com we were talking about diversification and just I think you kind of let that fire under me to go clean my pantry\nWhen I get home [laughter] I don't envy the task but you feel better once it's done you absolutely do and diversification it really is about doing that spring\nCleaning making sure what you have a serving you well that it isn't ... fired that it's yeah it's you don't have duplicates everything is working in harmony with ... with each other\nAnd I want to find out Mike from you when we're talking about diversification do we need to be aware of our tax strategy as we are diversifying yeah I think\nThat taxes is probably the most under explored item when it comes to retirement planning 'cause I Know a lot of advisors there's a lot of bravado here in this industry about who gets people the biggest rate of return what the best portfolios at the lowest price points and everyone focuses on returns I mean returns or sexy\nYou look like a just that last year twenty Seventeen and a lot of people made twelve Fifteen twenty percent rates of return that's what we talk about\nAt those cocktail party you know what money coming in to you but how much of that you get to keep you know this reminds me a just used to watch that show parks and rec a lot and one of the characters Ron Swanson he's like the\nCurmudgeon right I mean governor [laughter] yeah he thinks the government so to get you and there was like a civic day or something where all the local school kids how to like chateau one of these municipal workers\nAnd ah so this case following Ross wants it around and he's like so I I guess I've got to teach teach you about taxes today huh how's it government he goes what did you bring for lunch and she does shows him his sandwich or the sandwich and we grabbed it out of her hand takes three a norm is bites and hands it back and he goes that's how taxation works [laughter]\nSo she's sitting there looking like\nHalf of or sandwiches gone right\nAnd I like to think that a lot of people listening you know they actually have a similar type of experience in store for them in the future see they don't have a sandwich that they're holding onto there's some sort of a portfolio that they've got to get that statement in the mail from fidelity or vanguard their four one K. company and they're like hey man look\nMy balance is just about as big as it's ever been and that is true for a lot of people because the market has done so well for so long so their statements say two hundred thousand five hundred thousand a million or more whatever it says\nBut sooner or later Ron Swanson is going to grab your portfolio take two or three bites and leave you with just a fraction of the difference of course we're not talking about Ron here we're talking about the IRS\nAnd we're not talking about sandwiches you're talking about you what we call that at our house what the parent tax return aren't going out for ice cream Sundays yesterday and mom and dad always get at least the first two or three by to that Sunday mhm you earned it has the government or nearby though good question\nI got to tell you I think a lot of people when you ask them where do you think taxes are going in their financial future\nThey guess that they are going up this country is in an outrageous amount of debt and just the last two weeks both Medicare and Social Security announced that those entitlement programs are running and solve meant a lot further ahead of schedule than they had planned for guys taxes are ... are going up or it's almost an inevitability\nAnd the thing is we're all just sitting there looking at her accounts wondering well\nWell is this money mine or what kind of bite is going to be taken out of this\nHow much are we just focusing strictly on returns and diversification and safety in fees\nWhile we're paying zero mind at all in terms of what we're going to be separated from in the way of tax I find that most people if they think about tax they only look backwards and they do it every April fifteenth may try to figure out how it is they can counter beans and save as much money as possible but what about the next\nTo Boston so do you have more conservative talk to your family your boss for five minutes to talk twelve hundred and I heard radio station\nThe Supreme Court countdown I'm ham\nWho's now Fox News hours from now the Senate is

from my husband uh he had tonight is uh in both ears a is there anything that would help him\nIt's tough depending on what's going on or how long have you had it\nOff at several years it's worse than the left air\nSometimes it can be a chronic inflammation in the inner ear and sometimes you can you can make it a lot better by kind of a\nClearing out the sinuses basically just so try a decongestant first and then see if that makes any difference\nUm sometimes we found is a formula called I'm nervous system\nTonic and it's made by herb farm and what\nThat does it's a combination some different herbs that helped to repair the nerves in in some ... sometimes and the problem is there's so many different actors that\nCan contribute to what the tonight is is occurring a lotta times though it does have to also do with nerve damage through the years um and so um to listen to that rock and roll [laughter]\nAh you know trying to repair the nerves is really hard\nUh because they only grow a quarter of an inch new nerves only grew quarter of an inch every six months I think it is or three months I Can't remember um but it's a it takes a long time to get nervous system up to par\nSo um but you could try the nervous system tonic along with the D. congestion and perhaps maybe a natural anti inflammatory like her cumin\nUm could be beneficial or and see give it I Would give it at least three to four months before deciding it's not working and it's not like all of a sudden it's going to go you know just shut off but you'll notice that it starts toning down more and more and more\nIf there's no or if there's zero change after all that I Would try to CBD Oil yeah okay\nOkay okay the regular over the counter it can get that yeah yep okay there's a clear nasal spray help at all\n[noise] probably not for this ... not enough okay\nYeah okay All right well thank you very much will try those\n... and having a seat\nHe's already know that [laughter] people out on it you\nKnow

could also do you mix a small amount of like a quarter of a teaspoon\nOf hydrogen peroxide iodine and uh and you can get like pro dying or something like that from like Wal Mart or whatever and um uh epsom salts and mix it in some water\nWarm water and then so gr piece of cloth just a large enough to cover the area and a applied over the area ferry boat do ten minutes that's going to help kill off but also brought out a the infection\nAnd then you can put anything on top of that uh you know once it off and then put like ... or whatever\nBut you want to draw it out in the salt in a hydrogen peroxide and again some iodine\nOr equal amounts a quarter of a teaspoon warm water uh and do that you know like a couple of times a day if you can and you'll probably notice of the you know heels up
