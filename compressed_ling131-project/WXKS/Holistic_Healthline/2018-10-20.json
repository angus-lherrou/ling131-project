D. to seven nine six four or five [noise]\nIs on track and on time with Michael and just a company\nThis is your retirement on track and on time Meghan ... here with my ... of Arcadia financial group you can reach out today with your questions eight eight eight Arcadia\nThat's eight eight eighty seven two twenty three forty two we're talking today about potential challenges that could appear as we're on this road to retirement but most importantly\nHow to prepare for them we know ingest that one of the biggest concerns people have leading into retirement making sure they have income because once you do decide to step away from the workforce you leave behind us regular paychecks which can be a great source of anxiety for people rightly so\nHow do we address that how do you make sure that your clients walk away from your office knowing that they can count on income being there for them\nCentrist thing from the perspective of when we do a lot of our seminars\nAnd we get to know people in the first time you know we're doing icebreakers just to kind of like what some of the air out of the room one thing will often times do is ask people you know who hears retired who's still working right so we can people's hands going up and down\nSometimes I'll ask who's got a pension cars so it's just interesting 'cause the the the trajectory that we're on as a country as a pensions are going away\nAnd when the hands do go up I'll ask people\nHow do you feel about that pension do you like it more often than not to say not only do I like it I Love it well why do you love that pension both the answers don't surprise anybody well because it's guaranteed money\nWe don't have to worry about the stock market we don't have to worry about the volatility of some particular investment ... plummet all at once as long as that you know employers stays in business world in that check comes in like clockwork every single month people really enjoy guaranteed income\nBut I feel like as people get ready for retirement if that's their objective often times\nThey've got their plans set up on a foundation of well maybe he's instead of short things because a pension is a sure thing um everything else like your four one K. your bank account if those things exhaust themselves that's it the income that we would derive off of them is over\nRight when the money runs out those accounts the money's gone you can't lose your pension money\nSo in the absence of a pension or even if you have one but it's not enough\nAnd said well where's the rest of the income going to come from and how do we get a clue as close to a guaranteed as possible because not in all things in life guys are able to be guaranteed but if we can get as close as possible 'cause I think ultimately what we want\nIs just to kind of have some peace of mind to know that our money and our income more specifically will last as long as we do so that just invites you know conversational way here\nHow do we position ourselves like a pension or to have that kind of peace of mind and confidence to know that our income is this going to be there for us no matter how long we live like clockwork\nMike ingest that income component cell important to people out there especially listening today who are trying to figure out how to replace their paycheck and retirement if they don't have that pension maybe they just have the IRA four one K. those things don't magically turn in the income you have to\nHave a plan you have to have a withdrawal strategy you have to be strategic really don't you might\nYeah I mean getting something to operate like a pension is or not coming easy these days I mean I remember specifically when I first got into the business\nWe get a little index cards just in the mail they had the orange bouncing ball on it you know I N G was one of the country's first like brick and mortar lists banks it's not just the ending it's a beginning and then the tagline\nAnd back then I was like saving for our first house amongst many other things you know we were young and dreaming and we would pile of money into I N G because I'm them being online base had fantastic rate\nI remember specifically you could get five percent on a checking account and on some of their CDs you get like eight or nine I mean\nLiterally you could design retirement plans based on that kind of a safe\nRight of return to the latter strategy is off of that but it didn't work when you're not getting Ninety eight percent and one to maybe\n'cause I could plunk all of my life savings into something given me a seven percent rate of return to just live off the interest right\nUnfortunately especially because of the financial crisis that we saw in two thousand and eight interest rates have dropped into the gutter and they've stayed here for like the last ten years they're starting to pick up but it's not rising very rapidly and so as a result I think most people when they look at their bank accounts\nWe're lucky if they're getting north of one percent\nSo that's invited as part of the conversation will if we can't like look it's safe types of vehicles are produced versus big rates of return\nHow is it there were going to get us ourselves the money it is that we need in retirement\nAnd there's two primary warring factions I Would say\nUm there's a lot of people who have all of their money in the stock market there's a lot of people who put a big chunk of change in annuities\nAnd it's like depending on what camp that you're in everybody's slinging barbs and arrows on the other side people who are in the market thinks the annuity people are lunatics and people who are in their annuities think that everybody's than is in the stock market is like a mad person\nMight do in spend a lot of time talking about diversification though in these folks know better\nThey just do different things right the stock market has I think better unbridled growth potential\nBut it also in the short term has more risk of loss and that can be very disruptive depending on your plans and your age and also to your anxiety level right now a new ... hollow\nThey can oftentimes guarantee certain elements of protection around your investment maybe around say principal or the income that you can derive off of them but there's catches there too in terms of maybe fees or penalties liquidity so the thing is that neither side is fully invested into something that I Would call perfect they're different\nAnd that's not to say that everybody has to have a blend of the two but I wouldn't be so quick to judge one as being necessarily quote unquote better than the other\nI think what would really serve people well as to get beyond like all the big talking point especially like the the pundit like you know a swimming in arrows and that sort of thing and dial into let's just fundamentally understand\nHow they work when there were a fit and is it right for me\nYeah and that's important because I mean these things are just they're just products are just tools and to everybody\nYou know may have some some similar products you know your next door neighbor he may have something totally different but I think we're that peace of mind comes from is in deciding well I'm ... so I Want to have all my money in a new day or I'm Jean stock market you have all your money there\nBut you can have a plan and a plan has just made up of all these individual products to get you ... your end goal is and you know we don't have any\nSecret patented solution or county over here that we're putting all our clients into its just properly diversifying your money based on what your goals are what your\nAnd you know ... achievement is that you want to have in life and in retirement and that's what the secret sauce is is making a plan that specific to you what you're trying to accomplish\nIf we can be honest with ourselves for a second we can ask ourselves and very simple question do I have that plan\nDo I have a plan that takes a look at my financial future where the money's at Kennett last as long as I Do have I have reduced my taxes have accounted for healthcare needs have protected myself legally\nBe honest you either have that plan or you don't and if you don't have it ask yourself a second question why not\nLife is busy and I know it's certainly complicated there's a lot of demands on your time but one of the most important things you can possibly do other than protect your health is make sure that your money is working as hard and it's permanently as possible for you every single day\nIf you don't have that plan invest in yourself get it today dial\nEight eight eight Arcadia that's eight eight eight to Seventy two twenty three forty

off the chart moderate amounts of mercury and led\nOkay okay yeah not too bad so he said he's trying to tell me that you cannot get rid of heavy metals unless you go into being at the G I and I don't believe what he's telling me\nWell you're right you edu intravenous TPA does work but there are other ways to know who it is probably the best way to do it yeah\nOkay and the most you know I'm\n...
