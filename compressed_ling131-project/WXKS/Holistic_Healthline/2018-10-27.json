D. to seven nine six four or five [noise]\nThis is on track and on time with Michael and just the company so\nThis is your retirement on track and on time Meghan most accurate with ... of Arcadia financial group you can reach out today with your questions eight eight eight Arcadia\nThat's eight eight eighty seven two twenty three forty two we're talking today about potential challenges that could appear as we're on this road to retirement but most importantly\nHow to prepare for them we know ingest that one of the biggest concerns people have leading into retirement making sure they have income because once you do decide to step away from the workforce you leave behind those regular paycheck which can be a great source of anxiety for people rightly so\nHow do we address that how do you make sure that your clients walk away from your office knowing that they can count on income being there for them\nIt's interesting from the perspective of when we do a lot of our seminars\nAnd we get to know people in the first time you know we're doing icebreakers just to let some of the air out of the room one thing will often times do is ask people you know who hears retired who's still working right so we can people's hands going up and down\nSometimes I'll ask who's got a pension cars so it's just interesting 'cause the the the trajectory that we're on as a country as a pensions are going away\nAnd when the hands do go up I'll ask people\nHow do you feel about that pension do you like it more often than not to say not only do I like it I Love it why do you love that pension both the answers don't surprise anybody well because it's guaranteed money\nWe don't have to worry about the stock market we don't have to worry about the volatility of some particular investment it's not ... plummet all at once as long as that you know employers stays in business world and that check comes in like clockwork every single month people really enjoy guaranteed income\nBut I feel like as people get ready for retirement if that's their objective often times\nThey've got their plans set up on a foundation of well maybe he's instead of short things 'cause a pension is a sure thing um everything else like their four one K. your bank account if those things exhaust themselves that fit the income that we would derive off of them is over\nRight when the money runs out those accounts the money's gone you can't lose your pension money\nSo in the absence of a pension or even if you have one but it's not enough it's like well where's the rest of the income going to come from and how do we get a clue as close to a guaranteed as possible because none at all things in life guys are able to be guaranteed but if we can get as close as possible 'cause I think ultimately what we want\nIs just to kind of have some peace of mind to know that our money and our income more specifically will last as long as we do so that just invites you know conversational way here\nHow do we position ourselves like a pension or to have that kind of peace of mind and confidence to know that our income is this going to be there for us no matter how long we live like clockwork\nMike ingest that income component so important to people out there especially listening today who are trying to figure out\nHow to replace their paycheck and retirement if they don't have that pension maybe they just have the IRA to four one K. those things don't magically turn in the income you have to have a plan you have to have a withdrawal strategy you have to be strategic really don't you might\nYeah I mean getting something to operate like a pension is not coming easy these days I mean I remember specifically when I first got into the business we get a little index cards just in the mail bad the orange bouncing ball on it you know I N G was one of the country's first like brick and mortar lists banks\nIt's not just the ending it's a beginning and then the tag\nAnd back then I was like saving for our first house amongst many other things\nThere's you know we were young and dreaming and we would pile of money into I N G because I'm them being online base that fantastic rate I remember specifically you could get five percent on a checking account chair and on some of their CDs you get like eight or nine I mean\nLiterally you could design retirement plans based on that kind of a safe right of return\nTo the latter strategy is off of that but it didn't work when you're not getting Ninety eight percent one to maybe\n'cause I could plunk all of my life savings into something given me a seven percent rate of return to just live off the interest right\nUnfortunately especially because of the financial crisis that we saw in two thousand and eight interest rates have dropped into the gutter and they've stayed here for like the last ten years they're starting to pick up but it's not rising very rapidly and so as a result I think most people when they look at their bank accounts they're lucky if they're getting north of one percent\nSo that's invited as part of the conversation will if we can't like look it's safe types of vehicles to produce for us these big rates of return\nHow is it there were going to get us ourselves the money it is that we need and retirement\nAnd there's two primary warring factions I Would say um there's a lot of people who have all of their money in the stock market there's a lot of people who put a big chunk of change in annuities and it's like depending on which camp that you're in\nEverybody's slinging barbs and arrows on the other side people who are in the market think that the annuity people are lunatics and people who are in their annuities think that everybody's than is in the stock market is like a mad person\nMight do in spend a lot of time talking about diversification them in these folks know better\nThey just do different things right the stock market has I think better unbridled growth potential\nBut it also in the short term has more risk of loss and that can be very disruptive depending on your plans and your age and also to your anxiety level right now I knew what he is or know of all how\nThey can oftentimes guarantee certain elements of protection around your investment maybe around say principal or the income that you can derive off of them but there's catches there too in terms of maybe fees or penalties liquidity so the thing is is that neither side is fully invested into something that I Would call perfect there are different\nAnd that's not to say that everybody has to have a blend of the two but I wouldn't be so quick to judge one as being necessarily quote unquote better than the other\nI think what would really serve people well as to get beyond like all the big talking point especially like the the pundit like you know a slinging an arrows and that sort of thing and dial into let's just fundamentally understand how they work\nWhen there were a fit and is it right for me\nYeah and that's important because I mean these things are just they're just products are just tools and to everybody\nYou know may have some some similar products you know your next door neighbor he may have something totally different but I think we're that peace of mind comes from is in deciding well I'm ... so I Want to have all my money in a new day are unseen stock market you have all your money there\nBut you gotta have a plan and a plan is just made up of all these individual products to get each way your end goal is and you know we don't have any\nSecret patented solution or county over here that we're putting all our clients in ... it's just properly diversifying your money based on what your goals are what your\nAnd you know ... achievement is that you want to have in life and in retirement and that's what the secret sauce is is making a plan\nThat specific to you when you're trying to accomplish\nIf we can be honest with ourselves for a second we can ask ourselves a very simple question do I have that plan\nDo I have a plan that takes a look at my financial future where the money's at Kennett last as long as I Do have I have reduced my taxes have accounted for health care needs have protected myself legally\nBe honest you either have that plan or you don't and if you don't have it ask yourself a second question why not\nLife is busy and I know it's certainly complicated there's a lot of demands on your time but one of the most important things you can possibly do other than protect your health is make sure that your money is working as hard and it's permanently as possible for you every\nSingle day if you don't have that plan invest in yourself get it today dial\nEight eight eight Arcadia that's eight eight eight to Seventy two twenty three

uh found that the de sciences was in the top tier of ah companies to\nBe looking at and uh but what we know why we went that direction ah what caused you to go to the direction of Stevie sciences\nWell the first experience was a great story I was with my former boss you probably both remember Dr Cary Marshall who was my boss Nordic natural she's gone on to a great career and the industry and we were shut up right next to the first booth\nSelling the stuff that expo uh the company I work for now was making the raw material for this other outfit and the one of our brokers was

there and I bought some of it I went to lunch with Dr Cary and ... who both you know who I work with and I sat there totally change I mean energetically completely change I didn't know at the time subconsciously I made the decision to\nSpend the rest of my life pursuing that ingredient now when I met the the sciences when you ask why did I take the job\nThey had a huge supply of the material ready in twenty fourteen there were years ahead of the curve\nAnd they had a lot of money and they were willing to spend it on science\nSo four years ago they started formal toxicology work with are raw material FDA read book drug development stuff I've never done anything like this Jane we determined but no hell no observed adverse effect level we introduce start extract into the U.S food supply or going through the front\nDoor of the federal code of regulations\nBecause they had a lot of money and a lot of lawyers and a lot of appetite to do it right because the company is a publicly traded company so they had to build a transparent edifice with a brand new ingredient and I was so attracted to their um tolerance\nFor the new ... that was exciting for me\nWhat you've seen 'em and I know the science do you use is evolving and coming out of all the time what are you seeing that's exciting you\nOkay the newest thank thank you because there's much to learn about the end though can nap
