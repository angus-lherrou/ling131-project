I probably wouldn't do that we there's a point in October we kind of start backing off\nOn things that are in small pots and the reason is if they don't get rooted in well there's a real good chance to get get freezing go through the freezing and thawing and get ... down to the ground\nNot do so well 'cause we're right at the top of the soil surface so we'll start to back off a little bit on those in some plants that are on a really a hearty miss borderline for your area\nYou know the earlier you can get 'em in the fall so they can start to get an established a little bit as far as route again the better off you are I'm so a lot of times things that are really on a borderline Harding is um the later you get in the season the little bit more of a risk you take a possibly\nNot doing well over the winter and of course you're in the hands of Mother Nature depending on what the winters like\nSo those are a few exceptions to the rule and I put another one out there for you and that's some of the larger evergreens and not that we stop plant the images that if you are going to plant evergreens later in the season or any time really um which is one of the tips you want to keep pushing over the next six weeks or so\nYou gotta keep watering ... no matter what you're planning you've got to keep watering and I think that's one of the things we forget about when we're planting in the fall\nUm is that we've got to keep watering these plants to make sure they have good moisture in that immediate root ball immediate surrounding area and then the plant as well especially plants that are evergreen\nThat keep their leaves and needles over the wintertime reason being is this deciduous plants that have the leaves a drop in the fall and they drop when they basically they really do basically go dormant now yes\nThey'll still lose moisture out of this stems out of some of the buds occasionally but for the most part they released shut down\nAnd so you sometimes don't see you have a really tough winter uh we have a lot of when it does a case you don't see it so much in the deciduous plants like you do when the evergreens but with the evergreens needle and leave the evergreens as we go through the winter\nIf you have sunny days if you have windy days Danny de\nUm they're always losing moisture out of those needles in out of those leaves and if you don't have moisture in the ground to replace that what happens is starting to dig within itself so you start losing moisture in those leaves and needles\nAnd now it's it's they dry out so he started to drought so then they go to the branches and they start brain trying to form or shrimp from the branches to supplement what's been lost those leaves and needles um and then that's where you actually get into some ranch damn winter damage because they start taking the moisture out of the branches as well\nBut it had they been really you know a well water going into the to winter season and good moisture in the ground or ... in the immediate root ball because remember\nIt just the immediate root ball and a few new roots are put out over the fall so it's still a pretty tight root system\nIf they don't have more should there to take back up what happens then they they can't replace that and you wind up having brown needles leaves the drop off in the springtime and branches that can die out as well that's why it's so important to make sure\nYou'll hear me always kept talking about evergreens making sure those evergreens even established evergreens\nThat um if it's a dry fall you don't have good moisture in the ground even the established wants me to have that good more is you're going in the winter so it's very very important and then a new plan of plants you got to stick with it the good thing about the fall is the fact the temperatures are cooler\n[noise] we typically get more natural rain falls but temperatures are cooler so when\nYou do go out and really soak those plants\nThey're not as active as they were during the season for right so they don't take up quite as much\nAnd with a cooler temperatures it doesn't dry out as fast so last longer for you so you're not watering as often as you would during the summer but it is important to keep good march around those plants until we get close to the holiday season once you get there then you're back off\nI even suggest and Ron Ron officer certified master certified or wrists uh same thing that if you plant a evergreens in the fall or late in the season um I Would even suggest\nOnce a month or in January and February if it stays really dry and there's no more churn ground to take a five gallon bucket\nAnd you get a day above freezing take that five gallon bucket go out there and dump it in the root ball around the ruble to make sure again at those evergreens have good moisture going through January and February if you do a live Christmas tree and you're gonna plant that you know right after Christmas which is a great thing to do\nYou've got to make sure your water in well when you're planet and I'd be carrying a bucket of water out there once or twice in January February to make sure it's got good moisture in the ruble it's really really important\nSo when you're putting your tools away at the end of the season you know and I and I and I know a lot of folks are going to say well jeez I we've turned off our irrigation system already they've come winter rise to the bone and all wow what do we do 'cause lawn falls into the same category you you go into the fall and winter with a dry lawn you come out next spring now looking so good\nSo you know if you turn irrigation system off I understand that because you've got to protected against freezing but you ... the last tool\nThat I put away the two last tools wanted to shovel because I'm Still planting and two is the garden hose\n'cause I Want to be able to get out there and water as needed right through the end of the year so those are the two last things you put away and by the way if you're going through freezing freezing nights warm days as we go to approach the holiday season\nMake sure you're taking out a hose off of the bed take it off in the evening so it doesn't freeze and then put it back on his you needed to keep it off so it's your frost proof\nOr faucets are properly working [noise]\nTrust me been there done that\nTalk about it

Wilson again that toll free number eight hundred eight to three to five five\nTalking about you already got an an article posted on our website this week and we posted last year as well and it's a great article somewhat ... always talking about mowing the leaves back into the turf\nHow important that is and and a great way to use up a lot of the leaves in your own yard and I say use them up because there's other ways to use them without ever ever putting them in a bag and putting them out on the curb\nAnd moan and back into the turf has one great way to do it sometimes that can be a little scary what folks because you're mono lease back in the key is\nI'm finally ground leaves that's the key if you're more doesn't really grind them up or you can't go back a couple of times if necessary or you don't have a multi ignore that really ... fine that's what you need and you can only do this with matured lawns you can't do with new lawns first year law I don't do this\nBut ah two years law all on our older no problem but again you know you put those at least back into the ... very very important\nBut again somebody came and said you know well what about the wildlife and leave and leaves on the ground because there was a ... a lot of wildlife that enjoy the leaves and their eggs exactly right as a matter of fact this articles what we had found about what to do with all the leaves and I love the article\nBecause it says lead to lease for wildlife and it goes on talking about a different species of wildlife like salamanders and box turtles and toads intrusion earthworms not insects that really enjoy\nThe leaf layer\nTo live in butterfly ma species over winters ... leaf litter I'm you know all of that and of course the leaf litter breaking down and I agree a hundred percent I think it's outstanding and doing their exactly right but my point is and this whole article\nAt the very very end says something about um if you live in a condo or Homer association where you can't leave 'em land then you may need a break them up or ... back into the ... into the grass was fine or you know find or ... you never want to leave leaves\nLaying on your lawn if you want to launch next praying you leave leave laying on your lawn is mothers out the lawn over the winter and you've got these barrier is come spring\nSo take those leaves and put 'em in the ... areas\nUnderneath the trees most beds places like that in the garden and let the wildlife enjoy them in those areas but on the turf you need to grind those up and put them back into the turf but the turkeys to be alone open and available for the sunlight and to be able to breathe\nIn the whole nine yards over the winter time I got to be done so don't leave leaves laying on the turf\nWhich you can leave a million and other places for a while I like I said I totally agree with the article other than the fact that you just don't want I mean you could leave them on your lawn if you want but I guarantee you you're not gonna have much of a lawn come next spring\nAnd that's my point so use them again great we're using compost them trench\nComposting pocket compost bins tumblers um you know there's lots of ways to use up the leaves in your yard and just naturally putting them out on the ground in ... in bed areas\nAnd around the base of your trees as the mulch that's what they're all about his Mother Nature drops them in the fall the nutrients back into the soil or to multiple roots are for the winter time that's what it's all about um so I agree with that but for the turf I said get the leaves off work\nAnd actually mode and back again and again if you're nervous about ... leaves\nMoammar early in the in the a leap drop time in the peak leaf talked giant time maybe you collect those up or moment then collect 'em up and use them elsewhere and then as it starts to slow down ... back into the turf again I also heard someone say this past week that lead frosted a couple of times in our area this week was probably his last mope for the turf\nWrong you keep mowing the lawn keeps growing\nAnd it's going to slow down big time because temperatures will slow down but you've got to keep mowing as you normally would and I'm only be a couple more times\nWould you got to do that until it stops growing you can't tell you don't need to mow anymore and then you're done with in the meantime if you've got leaves falling you're gonna keep mowing every week to keep the leaves under control\nAs they're falling in your yard she got to keep it up as well so don't you're not done yet mowing trust me in our area you still have a ways to go and you know further south definitely a little further way to go and up north you probably are starting to really slow down but still a ways to go so stick with it please\nAnd again if you haven't done that last that they're not last haven't federal on yet you still have time to do that\nWe're going to be looked at that last feeding in November but you still have time to feed it so don't don't pull that off okay back to the guarding phone lines we shall go at eight hundred a two three to five five run in Cincinnati mourning\nMourning Yes sir\n[noise] excuse me I have a huge tree in my yard a takes two of us to get our arms around it and um it has this year has dropped the tips of the other branches [laughter]\nYes every three or four days I have to get my writing\nOr out and collect them they cover the ground and I know I've always lost them every year sometimes I think the squirrels\nCut cut them off or the ache orange but is there anything going on with with Korea said would drop this past month you would not believe the pilot step I've collected from that\nYou all you know I and and I I always refer to my my mom's ... they've got the same way she got a couple of Penn oaks that are\nFour feet in diameter trunks and there are a hundred and ten feet tall and about a hundred and ten the war with the branches out but every time you get a really strong winds storm you always get branches of fall down and there's some of them are pretty good sized sometimes about every\nOh I don't know about every three years we have a certified harbors go through and actually clean them out but the trees are in great health it's just the way they are as they get older like that they will drop some of that you know you just get a piece here and there that that will die out so we haven't cleaned out about every three years or so\nBut this year I have noticed the squirrels just just not destroying the trimming those folks like I have never seen them do before and she's got a ton of squirrels\nAnd they're just nip and the answer those branches off like crazy and you look out there after you know your demo and and there's those you know six inch pieces or so laying everywhere in the lawn\nAnd it's it's all if you look at the end of it you'll see where they were caught like a pair of prisoners\nAnd that's the squirrels and I I don't think I don't know that I've ever seen them do as much as they have this year is a sign what the winter is going to be like I don't know but they're doing it like crazy on hers as well so you know is there an issue out there", "show_name": "Online Trading Academy", "year": "2018", "city": "Newton", "day": "27"}
