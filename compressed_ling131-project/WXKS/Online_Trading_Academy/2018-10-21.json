{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WXKS", "content": "Who we know there's about twenty nine twenty seven family's okay that are registered through here jammed out or and all the way you know when we knew of well of ... or a Massachusetts um we've become good friends with two families that will be attending and they're also local and we've seen them and talk to them\nUh but you know we're looking to gather all the families and the local area\nPeople that just want to come support people that just want to have a good time on it will be indoors being that it's super hot outside [laughter] and with this disease uh interesting enough\nThese kids can't be out in the sun the sun is a big drinker so we really wanted to make a special event ... being this was his first year happiness disease he can't be outside at the pool parties he can't be outside between ten and one oh yeah with ... and it is outside it's a ton of sunscreen\nMhm oh gosh so does the side effect but like you said about the ... the ...\nWhat were they sort of like warts or something on your body does it affect the sun effect that it's a trigger it yeah it's a trigger it can\nMake the disease flare so the sun could cause the rash than the rash could cause the enzymes that start breaking down your muscles so these kids are always just had to tell you the\nKind of close and we learned about all the different you because you could buy and then you know we need sunscreen that is very high and zinc oxide so all these things we have to learn and and just you know he's a little guy he's yeah he wants to be outside running around with his friends and\nWell now that to another question is he able to play with other children is that a problem or\nHe's make great turnaround he's really ... the treatments plan is a great one that our doctor are prescribed and he is moving around he might not have the stamina as other kids but he's running around he's having a good time you know it's almost as sometimes we\nAre a little lax on you know the hand sanitizer all that stuff but I'm\nNot that we should be but you know [laughter] it's like happened them yeah you know we're we're having a good times the family even went away on vacation so okay so yeah you were able to go on vacation\nYeah we don't keep it in him in a bubble by any means um the uh we wanted to have as normal a life is possible it's just it's just our normal you know a little bit of a new normal um the uh\nThe disease was ... you know it's very tough on him and he but he has been really resilient and he's been great it's just really social guy um and he's you know found other activities that are a little less physical that he loves loves video games loves music loves dance parties at home you know that type of thing\nYeah he really got into like a building you know it it saddens me when he was in preschool and he would want to sit out you know everyone played duck duck goose he wants to sit in a chair or everyone's running in the playground is asking people to play with him\nBecause he just wanted to sit sit there and ... everything hurt alternatively he's gotten into these things that he wasn't into before\nLike very kind of building types of non active kind of stuff uh-huh uh-huh\nSo what does some of the other kinds of things that people need to know about this disease because I Would assume that\nThere will unfortunately there were other children that might come up with the same kind of thing and so what might share with other families that they might be become aware of\nSure so I'd say it is very rare so yeah it's not going to affect every family by any means ... most uh pediatricians probably will never see a case of this oh I'd ideally you get to a point where\nThere is a broader awareness in the public that if you have a combination of a rash um it's very distinct with these butterfly kind of look to the face with purple maybe ... or as was mentioned the little ... yes yes if you see that plus you have the physical\nUm exhaustion or in all these you know he was ... you got to a point where he actually can lift up his own head you know that's obviously very severe um but even some of the kids have more severe cases so if you have those two things in combination um I Would say definitely look into it but of course talk to your doctor as well\nPersevere don't you know there are times when\nI came home I said that's it I don't want to do this anymore I don't want to know them anymore I don't want to\nAnd you know we went through a couple a pediatrician even you know a second third opinions and things like that but ah you know your kid yeah and keep on keep on trucking through and we're in a great place where in Boston on a great medical yes\nAbsolutely so it has there been any talk about any possible shield\nIs absolutely talk of it and I know there's a lot of research going on through I'm used to cure Jay I'm a a charity I'm that's what they're focuses its it's the world's leader on juvenile miles Titus research\nUm our son had juvenile ... it's a form of um J. A. M. M. and it just affects the skin as well as the muscles\nUm the\nThe the goal would be awareness fundraising getting to work your\nUm I Know that there's a lot of treatments that are becoming better because even the treatments that what we're dealing with now that's the real difficult part as a side effects you know a quarter zone of properly steroid hey I'm part of his own\nUm you thought it was a great amount of weight gain um he's a good mood swings Yemen road rage if you will that that is a real thing I'm with that we deal with but\nIn the headaches headed oh trek said even throwing up uh oh yeah he would just spend a day throwing up yeah horrible and I couldn't get the other medicine or not\nOh so he's been through a lot but he's he's ... he's just a great great guy and he's um you know really friendly and outgoing so are we even made little networking business cards for him so that when you went to the courage am conference she could hand those out to other all the nice hey I'd love to connect with you here's my oh her tags we can play on line or whatever it is yeah\nYou know a wonderful what sounds like that you're wonderful parents and do an awful lot for that little guy and so we have to hope that\nAll the you're doing and that others are doing is going to make a difference because I hate to see or hear of little children who are well I have to say suffering like this um\nIt isn't fun and it's not fun for the parents to see your little one like that\nAh so I I'm just happy that we were able to talk to you and to hear about but before we go off I Need you to tell about the he bit again on the nineteenth so that people out there will get in touch and and come up\nYeah please please join us it is Sunday August nineteenth at king's dining in entertainment in Burlington will have each ticket includes bowling\nSoft drinks pizza will have faced painting many cures\nRetro video arcade with all the coolest old games the new ones as well um [noise] well have a DJ we have a lot of media personalities in the market that I'm friends with and\nBig raffle ... really excited about that so uh you could go find more information at bull to cure jam that's the number two [laughter] ... am and you can follow us on Facebook too good\n... ... goes journey or just start your day M journey that when\nWe are attracted Liam she goes Judy I'm journey 'em or you can also just goes directly on Facebook to Facebook dot com slash a cure J. A. M. for the number for Liam I'm\nOkay with it so well I'm so happy that we were able to have you on to have you tell us about this because\nI'm sure there aren't a lot of people that I've heard of it that way and so like you didn't until it came out or others haven't as well and so I'm just happy that we've been able to have you on we we just have to offer prayers that\nIt will change things things will change for a them I mean he's a youngster so yeah if you say he's doing well and accepting woody living with\nBut we hope that we can pray for him we can help sure him find a cure for him so I Want to say the two of you\nGood parents working hard doing what you can for your child and ah so just keep it and doing it and ... oh before we sign off I think you said there's something that's going to come up in September\nCorrect yeah so September thirtieth we actually have a walk on that's completely free for the public and life and\nSo the Massachusetts chapter about George am ... has a uh the thirty and you will walk stronger church am of Massachusetts at the arboretum at green hill park\nWhich is fifty skyline drive in Worcester, Massachusetts I'm On September thirtieth so I'm connect with us if you come to the bowling event you know we'd like to have you there but\nThat'll Boston so do you have more conservative talk to your family your boss for five but we managed to keep it off well hundreds and I heard radio station\nCentral American caravan presses on I'm Pam who sales Fox News desperate measures at Mexico's border with Guatemala we're about two thousand migrants defied police orders yesterday to turn back\nIn no important for the future of this country for the foreign progress of the president's agenda to get out and vote in the near term\nIt's Lara Trump but we love having Ron each at Laura Lee Trump on Twitter right\nThat's correct L. E. A. right now\nI'm just saying and I follow you and your husband is maybe I'm just going to say I haven't gotten to follow but when I was perfectly fine it's fine\nTo buy that okay I appreciate it\nUm you know it's interesting that you bring a cabin are being told him to the cabinet bounds but it happened so early that I feel like things might cool down before the midterms ... dying and Feinstein yesterday what gave us a golden egg\nSomebody asked her if you guys when the Senate if the Democrats win the Senate will you reopen investigations into no justice Kevin a large she said yes\nYeah well that that should not surprised anyone because we thought how crazy they got during the actual confirmation process that\nIt's it's really terrifying it is finally showing their true colors that Democrats\nYou know they really don't stand for much that's trying to be destructive and and do anything they can to go against the president and destroy him and I'll tell you do one of the reasons I think that you eat so much with your defense out there because this president is actually winning you don't try and stop someone\nDown or losing you only try and stop someone who's winning and Donald Trump is waiting for the country again\nAnd and they know that he's draining the swamp and they're terrified because the old way of life\nAnd over and they knew it before and and it's very scary for people who are living the highlights in Washington DC not go in and and voting on behalf of their constituents so it makes it scared because Donald Trump has nothing to gain from that he's\nHe's doing this because he loves his country round to hold him to anyone but the American people and and they never had a president like this before um which is all the more reason that we need all the Republican support we can in Congress\n... Laura Trump but really great to talk to you if your brother in law students I asked her husband this I asked the President Bush\nWhen he made the announcement I'm ... I'm guessing the family got at first I'm going to actually do this\nWhat was your knee jerk reaction because as you said he didn't need for anything he could be you know playing golf every day in Scotland right now and not worry about all this political stuff but his love for country said this is my calling was my duty what was your what was your thought process what it looked like\nYour father in law was really going to take the stuff\nHe actually that all of them down and said I Want to do that and then two days before the famous athlete or a\nDay during dinner and that you guys need to know that they're going to come after me they're going to come after you they're going to come after all of us they will attack that they'll tell lies about it\nObviously it would have been hard to predict it wouldn't get to this level rise up but\nBut I I that I was a hundred percent on board and because I knew that my father in law can do this job he's a businessman the is so smart when it comes to negotiating when he's been able to do in in so many different respect what hair of the trade um\nHe's really great at that than I knew back then that he would be great at it um for me it was a hundred percent and again I don't think anything prepares you for for all of this from\n... it it it's so much bigger than any of us but\nThat's why I think although we all get attacked on the time although the president and get the tax every second of every day none of us for a second one change any of that because we know that it is about the bigger picture and the future and the country and if\nWe can take a couple of planes and arrows here and there and the president or you know take that every single day more than any of that it's totally worth it because I really think this country is headed in the right direction they get an I always tell him he's going to go down in history as one of the greatest presidents and countries that were had\nA ... roof that it's Laura Trump or her husband his or her father in law is the president I asked him back in twenty six teams of because you just said it was nowhere near I mean you expected that the media would come after the election coming up for you guys but not like this\nAnd I understood it was just completely unexpected he said no I knew that they were trying to go hard on me probably go dirty on me but I had a lot of friends in the media you told me I made millions and millions of dollars for NBC on The Apprentice four thirty and forty years the media actually treated me very well and wanted me in the newspaper or television or radio show\nSo he didn't know that it would get to this extreme you've been in the media for a long time I've been in newsrooms for a long time as well yesterday le left but I didn't know was going to be like this so\nWhen we when was the realization for you in the family that this is way worse than we thought it was going to be\nWell I'm actually still for a portion of the campaign working at my former job in television and I ... it became very frustrating for me to work there because I Would be\nAll different nations but sometimes ours including um the way that they would find things and and say hey that's not what he said you know what he said um that that was it it it wasn't very clear wind to me that I don't didn't think that I was going to be able to work there for for forever if you know he became president ...\nBut um but certainly after they started attacking all of us personally and you know when I was pregnant they they attacked my unborn\nChild and he drew me to talk about it is an idiot\nSo crazy but again I think it's because they knew before that I'm trying to became president that if he got in there there was no turning back and he was all business and he was really going to be looking out for the American people and their own way of life was going to come to an end do\nUm I have to say that it is just another sign that he's doing a great jobs\nYou know I Would agree with you you guys were you have the ... family members you to my wife is Lara Trump irritates her husband her father in law of course is the president of United States we've got we've got senatorial races now that are starting to lean writes\nThe midterms are starting to look better in the Senate for Republicans although I can say that it doesn't mean anything unless people don't vote in Texas where I should you've got Ted Cruz the incumbent who is doing an incredible job in working with your debt with your father in law a very well know although it was rough on the campaign trail who's being Jones from a guy by a guy who's basically Obama\nAre saying you know we can work together yeah one one undivided Texas but under the surface those you know these are far left wing socialist disco warn you look at places like Michigan or Debbie Stabenow was been there for three decades and it's time for her to go now and you've got a guy named John James who might actually be able to get\nThe senatorial seat this really used gonna come down to whether we can motivate people who believe in what they see happening now\nIn the country to get off the reruns and go vote for this really what it is isn't it\nOh absolutely well as I think you right now I'm In Minnesota not traveling a campaigning I Will be in your neck of the ... in Texas on Monday youthful\nI Will be onto your day ironically in Michigan um ... it's so so important we we know that\nThe president has done incredible things already and not with a lot of people against and even people want and don't party sometimes money and get them ...\nThink about what could happen if he had a cohesive unit of people behind him that voted on by president and and really pushing the gender forward we can be so much more progress in the country and by the way I Know we talk about socialism if anybody has any question\nAbout what they're showing them look like the look in Venezuela right now that could become the United states of America\nIf we let people like or or take over and and put his agenda forward it's really very frightening socialism has never worked\nIn fact that the Democrats are embracing people like that since shock everybody to agree that you knew not only are going to get out and vote in the mid term but you're going to take everyone in your neighborhood and everyone in your family to go vote\nUm it it's very area and I I Know that it felt like a fight and twenty they seem to get Donald Trump elected in ... certainly was\nThe fight isn't over you and you can't come back we can't relax we can't be complacent me half to get out\nAnd got to vote and put people in Congress or we're going to vote with the president\nIs only one if anybody ever wants to know about socialism talk to them in their shoes are delicious whose whose wife was from Venezuela who tells the stories of how disgusting it is there I mean there are people waiting in line for foods and the government officials show up beat them up maybe even kill them in the streets to take care of their families first is made him in the country could as horrific\nAnd you really do have people in this country or tells you a ... you got people who were actually saying this guy Gillum in Florida we are going to go the way of socialism because that's the best way to go to\nLaura and Laura's question I really appreciate your time and by the way I'm Glad you're in Minnesota we go for breach stations or we were very highly rated in Minneapolis St Paul and keep your kids are hearing you right now um\nWhen you look at the fact that people on the left are saying volition will impeach the president will open the border will abolish ice we will roll back the tax cuts shouldn't take more of your money away it will drive jobs out of the country\nThat's what they're running on and the factors there almost fifty fifty right now in almost every poll you see what is it that we're doing wrong you went to ... done junior the president of the the Fox News Hannity what are we doing wrong but it's still so close to ... to me\nWell I don't know Joe that it's really that close I mean we thought how accurate the\nWhole word play a great point that I don't really think that if that is out there I think there are people that are afraid to tell a\nThat call them or approaches them on the street\nThat they want to vote Republican because the media and Hollywood has done such a a number on on people whenever they come out in support of the president or as a Republican I'm so I think it does make people a little\nHesitant to voice their support sometimes but when they get in the voting booth whenever no one else is looking\nWhen they think about the ... where we come in this country and almost elected in two years under President Donald Trump through\nYou advocate volunteer living on a good living on a downward buckyball United Way\nFox News on that he had like President Trump
