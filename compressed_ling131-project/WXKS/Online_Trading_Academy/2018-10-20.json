{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WXKS", "content": "So that would\nThat would be another option for you and I would do it while it's still dark\nBecause they're not acting when it's dark and you know you get that hose and slip it up she ended up to the to the whole get back and turned out on us you know and let us fill that hole up and that's where that's a good step in the right direction right there and then hopefully once it goes down you'll be able to take a look\nSee where you are and then take it from there if you're you know otherwise if you're hesitant you call the tournament in the exterminators haven't come out and take a look at somebody else deal with it for you\nYeah but if if that would mind today I'd be I'd be out there this morning before it gets daylight and get I get a hose right next to it and and feel that thing of of water and that way\nThat way you think I mean what are they going to do they know they can come through the water obviously but what's that's filled with water now you've got you've got them a barrier there without water you going to drown what's in the ground and you're going to stop anything else from going back in because they're not going to go through the water\n[noise] well that sounds like a good idea that a shot but being very careful yeah it'd be very very careful\nIt's it's an unfortunate thing but you know we haven't had enough cold weather yet to take care of any of that stuff\nSo unfortunately they are still very active but yeah when you can't see the whole you can't tell where the nest is a that's a dangerous situation\nOkay ah but if you're going to have a buggy go I later I'd appreciate it could bring it up\nTo and will the book and they'll have a right\nWill bring it up the um also and and and see what he says I'm but I but I like I say that I think the phones are one of the best things to go after any of those because it really is a nice knocked down and secondly that that water may be rich you you know you can you can go out there you could give you a hose in prayer and connected with some\nOf the seven something like that and spray the area again that do it while it was dark\nUm what's his daylight you know you're now you're facing may all you are\nNow that's a good idea that that that'll give me broad coverage because they were I mean they were hovering ten Fifteen square foot area all over the place yep\nYep and if you do that and he'll get on the on the hose and that way you get that wide spray a battle that's a possibility for you also I I think my first step I'd be thrown a thing of the water but that would that that's my opinion\nShould just be careful and we will bring it up the bug is you know alright alright thank you\nAll right John good luck with it and again those are things you don't want to mess with but um where I've had or you had to deal with it I still think those phones and they'll shoot Fifteen or twenty feet if you can see the opening\nIf you can see the whole um that you know that you can spray with that really does work nicely I've gone where they've been in a light post lamppost you fill it up with the phone with that stuff just it is\nTerrific but again very dangerous\nIf you're allergic to that or you know you don't want to take a chance to call the exterminators that's what they're all about flip them take the chance to get stung not you still keep\nIn mind pleased would be very very careful anytime you're dealing with things like that um but seven ... it'd be I enter very usually very toxic to bees are and ... and ... so that is a as a general spray could be a possibility for years well a dusting a whole sometimes where you know the whole is\nYou can flag and dust around it with something like seven or around the top so they take them take it back in with them that's a possibility for you um but um again be very very cautious water can be ... you know you real good friends for driving them out

I'm Sorry the\nSociety municipal are wrist I Believe it is anyway they chose their tree of the year they do every year or urban tree the here and that was their tree of the year\nAnd it really brought out a lot of attention to these new hybrids that were coming along autumn blaze being one of the first\nAnd continues to be probably the most popular that's being sold out there today\nAbsolutely wonderful tree but then there are other varieties that came along all they have\nA little bit more you know there's a distinct something about each one of them I'm a little different than the other\nAnd so today what I've done is on our plans of the week on run was online dot com a feature both on and blaze and CNN go in which I Believe was the second one that was introduced\nAfter autumn blaze um any CCN ugly and but then there I've listed about six or seven other Freeman's selections that you will find that your local nurseries and garden centers\nThese hybrids are not something that is hard to track down I'm becoming very very common place in the nurseries and in the garden centers so if you're looking for that\nUm medium to large are growing shade tree forty five fifty feet plus some more upright than others more rounded hasn't again you have to learn about each one they have their own little thing about them take a look at these Freeman I selections\nAnd again I've listed the I think about five or six on there for you to take a look at a couple of pictures on there for your bottom blaze in Sienna Glenn but I think there are actually choices for you as far as that larger growing with a little bit of speed to give you something in a reasonable amount of time\nShade tree or in that yard garden or can be used as a street tree it can be um if it's in an era I don't like playing any thinking that narrow area between the sidewalk and this and the side and the street\nUnless it's about eight feet wide less than that it's just not a good thing you're always going to be I don't care what tree you put in there it always has a potential of lifting up the sidewalk overtime or filling up the area because it's such a small area it's I don't care what you put in there even ornamental trees\nAlthough takes them longer they could still have those issues as well but again great tree overall tree for again lawns shade tree a street tree again it's called a seer Freeman

you're looking out there and you say man I'd really like to change it around a little bit change it up renovate a little bit but you just not sure where to start and you watch some of those TV shows or the or\nThe what shows do it yourself shows the Iowa I'm Sorry and you know they just go in there and a tear everything up and start all over again\nWill you know not everybody can do that as a matter of fact in many cases you don't need to do that you can actually work with what you have\nWell I found a book that can help walk you through the process of garden renovation you can evaluate what you have to say what you want and put your plan into action and transform your yard into the garden of your dreams the name of the book is garden renovations written by by good friend Bobby Schwartz and she's with us this morning ...\nGood morning Ron good to have you on a show with us finally lovely to be with you well you're such a popular person out there always speaking to everybody and tell them how to do this [laughter] we're ... we had to wait in line to finally get John here sure great first of all great book very well done thank you I'm looking\nAt it did call on everything I've learned in over forty years of gardening and landscape design\nForty years oh yeah you started when you were five but of course while [laughter] so you started as a kid\nI actually did not no one in my family was a gardener yeah but when we bought our very first house it came with a garden and my next door neighbor came over introduced himself and proceeded to name every plant and counting how to take care of it\nAnd then I started reading and try and link plant I got hooked\nAbsolutely obsessed with plants and now you could say that I turned into a plant and John than having so much fun with plants ever since and eventually I had friends and neighbors ask for advice\nAnd I realized I really did more than they did\nSo I started a business uh by picking a name buying a vendors license so that I could buy a wholesale cell retail\nAnd we're talking forty years ago I was charging ten dollars an hour for my consulting surfaces wow [laughter] and then I started taking courses and landscape design\nAnd joining professional associations that that I was always attending seminars and workshops and networking with other people in the industry and the rest is history\nThan the rest is history and of course then you were smart enough to take pictures of things that you've done over the years\nI was always photographs and there are two hundred and Seventy five photos in the book and two hundred and sixty of them are mine\nWell that's that's phenomenal body Schwartz is with us this morning the name of her book is garden renovation your website is ... dot com correct that's correct\nBy so you can go to a website as well and check it out to be G thumb a dot com the book is garden renovation 'em and you know this this really does make a lot of sense because what you like you were describing what you see you and when you get called out to do is probably you know the clean slate the the clean pilot\nDoesn't happen that much you know you heard does but you know it's it's the folks that have an\nAn existing landscaper had an old landscape and one right do it to to make it to ... up or make it a little bit better and you do watch those shows you only go in there just rip everything and start all over again\nWell not everybody has that kind of a budget and in many cases which is what you do to help and that's what this book helps as well there are so many things you can continue to use and incorporate into changing in a room\nYeah there's generally speaking there is no need to rip everything out and as you say it's very expensive to do that so I generally do not work on new homes because there's nothing there to start with\nA instead I work with owners are the existing properties and I I have found two things that you mentioned evaluating the landscape and then figuring out what you want I Would have reversed that water I Would say it down\nAnd write down what your goals are mhm um watch\nDon't like about what you have what do you wish you had that you don't have\nIs there any way that you want to change the style is it to form or do you want to make it less formal\nDo you have something that isn't working for you for instance a patio that might be too small for your family or for entertaining and once you set your goals\nTakes you won't be able to do everything at once [laughter] set your priorities and then figure out your budget because there's no sense designing the Taj Mahal if all you can afford a log cabin\nSo then you're ready to take pen and paper and walk outside and look at your property as now almost as I had never seen it before\nAnd say I like that I don't like that that's too big it's covering the plant it's covering the window\nOr or it's hiding the door or you could ask yourself is the walk to the front door\nWide enough for two people to walk side by side say um is it just a straight shot either from the driveway or from the public sidewalk\nThat enables you to get basically from point a to point B or does it
