E C C C a s wants HIS Video he goes to the rallies he goes to the you know dumb Trump rallies and he goes to the camera and to use these millennials\nAnd he asked them you know all these amazing questions and then he says so did you vote and sixteen and they always say no\nThey don't vote they'll they'll go out in ... city yeah they well they don't vote for some reason so I'm not too worried about that and also I'm optimistic because look what happened in sixteen you know what the old told us Hillary Ninety three percent shoe in\nNew York\nPost I saved the tweet Ninety five percent big\nIt makes me laugh every time how stupid they were about beyond our thing\nThat I think he now we're going to see even more people who don't admit it publicly but we'll go and vote if you've seen your four O. one K. increased by ... percent yeah if\nYou know are they what Robert it'll go out of your face but because he's got a job who is going to vote for their going to vote for the people who ... who wants to ban\nI the people who want to touch you more what is the Democratic message bring back I said no I called ... but don't take anything for granted going to vote to your friends and your family to book\nNow a year in rock spotlight\nLast News I'm ... trying to get out the GOP midterm vote for president lambasted ... over the immigration rally the all the immigration law and the other ones that\nArea right and you're really in our\nAnd then\nThe\nNice view I we don't\nRuns free from a Turkish prison on no strings\n... we do not pay rent and this guy\nOtherwise you're being ...\nHad been jailed two years as a minor charge you ...\nReally [noise]\n\n\n\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise] hey\nGreat radio stations across the land Joe Heck dot com [noise] all the goods there we redesigning the website Go check it out also\nThe blaze radio network it is the weekend with Joe ... glad to have you you're always glad to catch up with my former governor the go for governor the great state of Texas Rick Perry he's the energy secretary for the United states of America you know and you might wonder well what does that person would do\nA lot clearly and a lot of travel is well we talked about bad we are talking about liquefied natural gas we go to an war as well our ... our you\nJoe I'm good thank you very much we're I'm up in Washington DC for a few days here so you know taxes but it's a it's what are called temporary duty\nAnd you're fighting the fight very well it's interesting as you know I'm connected with several people on your staff and I I can see their travel on Facebook and on Twitter and so on you or your or a globe trotting now is it did you know that was going to be part of the job to be over in Africa\nThere'd be over in Europe and be over in Asia back home base it on your back over Indonesia where did you know that that was going to do all this\nAre not necessarily but what's happened is is the energy revolution runners odd that occurred in the United states\nIt makes sense in hindsight that would be in all those markets because it's a you know we're now selling American a liquefied natural gas into thirty different countries on five continent that's great\nAnd uh there there's more to be done so I'm being there\nUh I I consider one of my jobs of it obviously being a regulator making sure that we're a you know were regulated at the permit process is smooth and as\nA as as transparent as it can be but it's also to be the uh sell them for American energy whether it's a a liquefied natural gas for the rich are crude whether it's our fossil fuel whether its nuclear energy whether it's a\nA R renewable technologies all of that is desired around the world and the secretary of energy that ought to be their job\nIt's the United states secretary of energy Rick Perry so I'm watching the the the terror of talk of the trade talk and the leverage that are that the president has and and he's putting it on the ... you and everybody in the left in this country ... they're all complaining you know good he's putting tariffs who's going to ruin trade\nAnd you know time sweat you use stepped up and said we're making a deal we don't want the terrorists we want to have fair trade that in a big part of the deal was liquefied natural gas\nNo are you are you consulted as the president's doing that as you liked Rick can we do this Ellen gee thing can we make this happen we make it part of the bill how does that go down\nYeah he he obviously talks to 'em you know extensively with his cabinet or the as the secretary of treasury my notion and secretary of commerce Wilbur Ross gale have a role to play in that and uh so yeah absolutely\nItaly there's a there's a good a correspondent back and forth a and a ... everybody's on the same team and I want to get back to you know this is what people should expect I mean I Know the left doesn't like him for a lot of reasons that I you know ... and that is what it is\nA but they're not being realistic they're just they're just they don't like him because he's not Hillary\n[laughter] that's true\nBut it's true and and and the point is that what you would expect to see out of a a negotiator a person who goes in what they really hard line I mean he he plans on winning I mean his his theory here is that listen\nIf I trade ya and you agree to it you know that's your fault not mine\nUh and and that's exactly what he's doing with these trade deals he comes to a certain really hard stuff\nMade me think about with you and then a young and came back in here\nUh after they laid out some really tough or a sanction or not sanctions but tariffs at retro a trade deals with the Europeans and they said you know what we decided we want to buy your allergy and let's let's find a way so to the Chinese ... again\nYou know the heads blew up when they announced the terrorists originally with China\nAnd then the Chinese came back a few days later the Chinese know that they will lose a\nThey know that we will lose a a trade war or or the Chinese don't lose a trade war with us so you know\nI think that's where their biggest customers they don't want to screw with us that would be dumb [laughter]\nSo we just want you to be fair we want you to be an equitable he wants you to be transparent oh and we don't want your stealing our IP either our international uh our our intellectual property\nRights of any good neighbor yeah that that's another big part of it it's a energy secretary Rick Perry\nYou're in the state of Texas so efficiently and our economy here still booming onto the great guidance of a great guy but now when you get into a position where you know there's so much bureaucratic red tape and there's so much garbage that you've got to go through before you can actually get to the source of the issue when you finally got to see what these trade deals worth especially energy wise with these other countries were you surprised\nAt how uh how completely out of balance they were we got very little they get everything it was very strange yeah\nIt it was really pretty fascinating and here's the other side of it is these things were outdated do you think about the north American free trade agreement that was put in place I think in Ninety two is when it was side that was twenty five years ago\nAnd and think about where America was twenty five years ago from an energy standpoint I mean completely a hundred and eighty degree uh we were dependent on a lot of countries that didn't necessarily have our interest in mind who ... a a developing a the energy sources that we were buying and now\nI'm you know Mexico and and and and Canada both", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Online Trading Academy",
