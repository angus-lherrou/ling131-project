A. G. make America great again hat\nBut on social media I've seen like verified people the little check mark\nSaying things like the atmosphere the Trump makes is what causes this said that Trump's language he uses radicalized those people like this or they're trying to figure out a way to say that the president of the United states is somehow the cause of this\nWhen the reality is like what's the baseball shooter like with the bomber and now with this guy\nThese are just not jobs these are bad people doing bad things ... whether it be\nYou know utilizing pipes and trap no and and bomb making materials or a gun or a knife or filling the blank\nThese are bad people doing bad things they're convinced what they're doing is for righteous reason when anybody who's a logical rational reasonable person would never even consider this\nNever\n... ladies that we have a out of Pittsburgh again if you're listening to the program at a later time good when we do live on Saturday morning slash afternoon you're probably going to have more information I'm I'm I'm Glad he's in custody I'm Glad nor people are in harm's way there but the fact that he was able to get in there and make that happen is is disgusting it really is\nYeah there was a time in this country not very long ago where you could leave your keys or the car and oh you leave it running of it was a cold day up to do to warm things up didn't have to lock your front door well this day and age I don't want a police state oh a martial law that's for sure\nBut what I Do want is for people to be smart because the bad guys the the fringe moons out there\nWill take advantage of our welcome are welcoming nature of our openness of our togetherness of our want to be one community that gathers the synagogue did nothing wrong so don't misunderstand me\nBut I'm at the point to where I Want where people congregate and gather to have protections in place\nUntil the point to where if you're going to have a place where people could access innocence you should have somebody there were some mechanism in place to guard against a piece of garbage like this guy is alleged to be\nI don't think that's asking too much I really don't whether it be a school\nOr a movie theater or a church or synagogue or mosque or whatever it happens to be there should be a for a pretext a protective mechanism in place whether it's armed guards or bulletproof glass or you can't get in unless you're busting it'll be something has to happen\nBecause you can go down the list of all these places looked at and we're talking about soft targets the movie theater where somebody can walk in the exit door or the movie theater that says you can conceal carry your that's the beauty of this chosen or the high school that\nThere's some stairwell door is easily accessible from somebody from the outside it was just dropped off by over\nAnd the guys carrying a rifle back another synagogue how does this guy get in there\nWell Saturday morning we have congregation we ever services we there should be a mechanism in place to wear a bad guy can be identified and if not stopped in his tracks at least deterred\nTo wear a good guy can get there and brings safety\nAnd sadly that's where we are\nThe idea of just open doors and everybody's welcome into somebody shoots than you know than they do know or somebody bombs that they do not know it can't be that way let's now get to a place to where we are we're ... to have the ability\nTo resist to reject a piece of garbage like this or the bomber all remember it's a one eight hundred and five zero one Seventy and when he should have a ... and are you at the point now where you no longer take CNN or MSNBC or for some of you Fox\nSeriously that you think that there's such a slant but you're not getting the straight story\nAbout the way you think Fox does a very good job I by the way the Newsmax de Vito is very good job where you'll see my show Monday through friday seven pm eastern time\nBut MSNBC and CNN ... they're off the reservation right\nOr do you have to retake one hundred and five zero one Seventy eighty Joe packs dot coms the writer\nMethod ...\nBurning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country might sound impossible to fit into your workload but what if there were a business\nDegree that further your career and gave you access to world renowned faculty leaders and mentors all on your schedule one that opened doors to some of the most influential CEOs tech companies law firms entrepreneur where some thought leaders and what if you could earn that degree in as little as sixteen months one hundred percent on line\nTo find out more text offer to seven nine six four or five that's o F F E R to seven nine six four or five\nStar cheer on line MBA information management or business analytics master's program from the W. peak carry school of business at Arizona State university today learn more about the W.

Republican Kevin Brady he's the guy working on tax code words ... playing with President Trump or we talk about the the the bombing suspect being arrested better just happened before we spoke\nAnd also about what is this new tax cut plan that we keep hearing about Kevin I appreciate you how are you\nA good joke thanks for having me on\nYou know what what an incredible time we're living in right now what do you get into the incredible succession the positivity that came out about that rally on Monday but I'd be remiss\nTo knock today a first asked you about the arrest of is this person that police say the FBI says was this idiot that sends out a bunch of bombs but what are your thoughts when you see that I personally as a family man is a community member really relieved that we got um what what do you think yeah\nThat was my first time relieved a cop that that is good police law enforcement work obviously these guys had a history\nOf uh of problems you have a ... and then sending in in threatening to blow up folks and so we don't know the intent behind all this but we do know this is a person that ah frankly um and I don't know what to greet how much damage would have been done but can you imagine you know\nHad to go on right now he picked or they didn't they didn't know what I mean forget about it I get it didn't get into the hands of the targets but people at these ... and people at the mail rooms of these different buildings would have been you know really in dire straits here\nYeah and and you know I I took a Ari Fleischer his advice early on and he said you know so much stopped talking about blaming politicians and pundits let's do the investigative work and find out who this is that's exactly what happened I think that's the right way to go after\nThe I think so too it's a Kevin Brady of House Ways and Means Committee chair ... one last thing on that um ... is there any changing how the media is doing this or ... the ... bomber they're calling you up or how good bomber speak to people did not call the guy who shut up the baseball practice\nAnd almost killed these ... they didn't call him a standard shooter or some ... why is there a double standard here and\nThere is and I'll tell you a jot play baseball I played second base with Stephen I had to miss the shooting by only\nA few minutes no in fact the coach after batting practice or after I took some a swing city one take some ground or is the second I looked out the was take them I Know I'm fine and I grabbed my gear and left just about four minutes ahead of the shooting so uh this is a ... yeah the\nMedia um there is a double standard here in in in I guess my frustration is\nBobby blame the president and others for what they believe are overheated rhetoric they often um are silent when you hear Hillary Clinton you know urge instability or Maxine Waters Cory Booker or encourage harassment and violence\nAnd then rock Obama and Eric Holder a media analyst we've got soundbites from all of them that are actually inciting violence and none of us ever said well the violence happens\nThey made it happen I mean we we'd like to see them camp down their rhetoric a little bit but what a bad guy shoots up a baseball practice or a bad guy since uh bombs I I'm not going to blame the president nor Hillary Clinton I'm going to leave the guy who did it\nYeah it's the guy yeah that's exactly right and and that's the way it ought to be handled so you know it is the the year where frankly President Trump can't even breathe right for some people you write criticized for everything but I'll tell you what what he's doing for the country for our economy for security it's just unbelievable\nI had a conversation with John Hi Bush from the region a librarian and he's the executive director there\nAnd we were comparing and contrasting what this president has accomplished to what Ronald Reagan accomplished and the fact that it's thirty five forty years later the media looks back on a regular you know lovingly and and they didn't love and back then um and and they're treating from horribly and basically they've got about the same record in fact the Heritage Foundation finds\nThis president is even more conservative than President Reagan was yeah I mean it it it's unfair but but that's why have you on let's talk about the successes\nYeah and so Joe to your point boy thank you for saying that because that that's my point look Ronald Reagan perhaps the greatest president in modern times yeah probably is in my view you know has two legacies\nTax cuts that to ... the economy for decades in in the United prosperity and rebuilding the military exactly what President Trump has done in just a his first year and a half really and then you put on top of that this amazing\nA record in the courts of a constitutional judges\nFrom the Supreme Court on down it really is a remarkable record\nIt's remarkable success you have to you again is never going to give him a chance it's Kevin Brady House Ways and Means Committee chair or the the success that we're seeing was fueled by what you came up with ... ... you worked on this night and day I remember you\nYour jaw I Want to come on but I don't even know two minutes and you were like you you're you're breaking\nPencils him going crazy with ah with 'em all sorts of what how do we make this happen and you did somehow\nAnd all of us every American who pays taxes got a break every American who pays taxes has a bigger paychecks many Americans three four five six million either got bonuses or they got raises companies are are no manufacturing stuff here again or promising\nTo start doing it so the other side Kevin seem all that success says\nThat we got we got to raise the taxes again we have to hurt corporations again and drive them out of the country how is it a winning strategy for them\nYeah I don't know that it is and and and they but they are doubling down on it so appealing and tax cuts raising the taxes on businesses going back to the old a code where every month we saw another us company moving overseas now our manufacturing overseas or jobs overseas and in in in a period where President Obama\nYou know that was the weakest or economic recovery um since World War two right and he never had a year never had a year he broke three percent", "year": "2018", "show_name":
