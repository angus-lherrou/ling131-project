Sherman and we remember their names and their contributions to this day\nThere are a number of other patriots who find just as hard and were every bit is counting as the men we remember but who are all but forgotten in history\nHundreds of women yes women from both sides risk their lives fighting for their beliefs but none is memorialize my name\nIs Karen Abbott decided it was time to change that her book liar ... Soldier Spy tells the story of four of them to union and two Confederate who use strength imagination and intellect to help their side\nBut why is it taking so long to bring them to the public's attention where was Ken Burns and all this\nActually to be fair to Ken Burns he mentioned one of them and his ethic that war documentary great how ill of course the famous Confederate spy but I think the answer to that is you know women weren't the ones writing the history books and history is written by men and about men\nAnd yeah it was sort of on and and a pleasure to try to get the woman at the end of the credit they deserve now\nHabit mentioned rose O'Neill greenhouse a widow who spied for the south despite her personal loss sadness and anger\nWithin a very interesting and difficult and when the war broke out in the years leading up to the war she had locked five children and for years had lost her husband and a freak accident and\nHer access to the White House this was somebody who had had for Twenty years very close relationships with many democratic politicians she was even an adviser to president James Buchanan so she lost all of that when Lincoln was elected and the Republicans came into power and she was desperate to get this back\nThat when the Confederate cap that approach has her in the spring of Eighteen sixty one and ask her to operate and form a Confederate firing in the Washington DC the capital\nTo disregard the danger of that and jump to the chance and you know goes on to get a safer and deliver some very important information to the Confederate Army and make quite a name for herself\nNot only was greenhouse by she was what we would call today a spy master\nOne of my favorite addict and the book is on the eve of the first battle of Bull Run she come into one of her carriers and she had assembled quite a team of couriers as you said\nAnd one of them is a sixteen year old girl by the name is Betty devolved\nAnd she hides up a secret dispatch and Betty's hair and roll it up and talk on and tells her just to go across the lines and to write to Confederate headquarters and delivered his methods and and but he does exactly that and let down her hair and you know romantic dramatic fashion and had there with his notes\nAnd of course ... important information for the confederates on on the first battle of Bull Run and rose or you know assembled her team and and kept on buying after that\nGreenhouse a Confederate spy living in a federal capital hadn't counterpart Elizabeth then Lu for the union\nShe was very shrewd I think she was probably the smartest the most effective spy of all of them\nShe was sort of direct opposite of red green how rose was you know of course the Confederate by living in a federal capital and Elizabeth was against by living in the Confederate capital and whereas rose was brazen and outspoken and very bold about what she was doing I'm Elizabeth was quiet and decadent and very discreet\nAnd he I think her biggest accomplishment was placing a former family slave and the Confederate White House\nAnd Abbott says that he was the stereotyping of slaves as illiterate and unsophisticated that helps Fannie Lou in surgery made into the heart of the confederacy and steal some very important secrets\nArena Davis the first lady of the confederacy made an announcement that she needed help he needed to stop the Confederate White House and does anybody have suitable serving she could borrow\nSo Elizabeth hair sis and pays a social called arena and says well have somebody for you I have a girl and she's not too bright and she stumbled in the kitchen but she should serve your purpose is fine\nAnd says she sends over a former family slave by the name of Mary Jane ... and of course nobody knows that Mary ... not only literate but highly educated and get hit with a photographic memory off his dusting Jefferson Davis his desk and cleaning up the children's toys\nHe's also managing to sneak peaks that maps and fortifications and letters on his desk and eavesdropping on confidential conversations and of course reporting all this back to ...\nDell boy was a Confederate spy who is credited with supplying important information to Stonewall Jackson during the war adage says Boyd was older than most southern belles at the time and wasn't afraid to shoot first and ask questions later\nThat was so interesting to me first of all she was only Seventeen years old when the war broke out she's all it it you know she had no filter and she was really incredibly over with both her opinion that her sexuality for the time period and for being Seventeen years old\nBut I like to say if if you know Sarah Palin and Miley Cyrus headed nineteenth century baby it would have been bell boy you know she just was really out there on all fronts\nAnd he takes things off and and to live Eighteen sixty one she's living in Shenandoah Valley Virginia\nAnd union forces are marching down and they're planning to have a big fourth of July parade in her home town and bell is waiting for them and she's waiting for them with a pistol by her side and so it wasn't one of the union soldiers threatens to raise that flag over her home of federal flag\nJak to this and decided to shoot this fellow dead and she gets away with it and goes on to become a courier in spy for the Confederate Army and has quite a few adventures in the war\nFinally Abbott profiles a real female soldier Emma Edmunds she joined the union army after escaping from an oppressive life in Canada\nShe had grown up in Canada with an abusive father and he threatened to he was going to Iran to marriage for her with an elderly neighbor\nAnd she has seen with this sort of arranged marriage had gone to her sister's sort of stopping all their spirit and she wanted something different for herself she wanted a life of adventure and so she cuts her hair and binds her brats traits her dress for a man's suit me calling herself Frank Thompson and living as a man\nAnd she migrated to the United states right before the war and start hearing about the abolitionist John Brown\nAnd all the events leading up to the war and decide she went to a piece of this uh she wants to lessen the army and it's quite surprising how all of these women are about four hundred of them were able to disguise themselves as mad and list and and the army's but north and south and\nAnd of course have to go on to have quite a few harrowing adventurous during the war\nBut how could a woman pass herself off as a man when living in close quarters with soldiers and then during the required medical exams\nThey just sort of happiness cursory\nShows provided for entertainment and general information

Larry is out this week Larry is out this week he's the director of instructor development but I have a chief knowledge officer here John O'Donnell I've known John for a long time so I like to come Johnny ... or one of my favorites is the rain maker he is the man and I'm excited have John with us today\nWe are having a lot of fun we were just talking a little bit about how to generate more consistent come in the market and that's always that three part conversation\nHow to generate money as the market's going higher how to generate income as the market's going lower and how to generate income as the markets are going sideways and we really wanted to stay on that topic and it's really one we could spend the whole show on generating income\nThere's primary income there's supplemental income there's so many different ways that we could talk about income there's so many different ways to generate income in the financial markets that I don't even think an hour show would give us enough time to do it\nBut one of the things Jon ... that our listeners are looking for is whenever I talk to you I hear a lot of this they're looking to replace their income with trading investing\nSome of them are just looking to upgrade their lifestyles with a little additional income some are looking to supplement their lifestyle they're looking to supplement their income you know just adding a little bit on maybe they don't hate their job they're not really trying to replace it they're just trying to you know reach that New Year's resolution of making a little bit more money but I have talked with others who really are looking to fire their Boston\nBut before I just kind of let you go with this one I read an article I don't know three or four months ago that that we've talked a little bit about on the show how talked about the average the average millionaire has over five streams of income and that's\nWhen we start talking about different streams of incoming side of the financial markets in different ways we can generate it\nYou know those multiple streams of income or what really start to create that financial freedom I guess I should say in my opinion\nThe multiple streams of income uh really start to create that financial freedom\nBecause it ends up making it so you're not reliant on one and that's where we get that acronym that J. O. B. just over broke if we only have one source of income we have a lot of risk in our life because if it goes away what are we going to do so I'd love to hear some of your thoughts are on multiple streams of income\nEven the difference between primary and supplementary income and some of the things here it online training academy that we really focus on to help the students really get into that financial freedom space\nWell incomes important and multiple sources of income that are sustainable\nIs what you're really looking for it's one thing to you know have a gig on the side that temporary but sustainable income is what we're all looking for that's diversified let me give me an example there was a study put out by McKinsey\nOr an MIT that suggests over the next Fifteen Years as many as fifty percent of the jobs as we know them today Ryan will be ... by robotics\nAnd they make the case and at first you think it's a joke but when you really think about it perhaps it's not they make the case at the factory in the future we'll have a man a dog and a robot\nNow the man is there to feed the dog the robot is there to do all the work and of course the dog is there to keep the man away from the robot [laughter] but if you really think about this thing about sustainable income\nPeak around the corner do you have a job from hell do you have a boss from held that you are dissatisfied with then you need to source\nThe skills that are necessary to produce for yourself and your family multiple streams of income and less and one other characteristics to this stream of income that we can talk about Ryan and that is mobility\nWhat if you had a source of income that you could bundle onto a laptop\nAnd you could travel anywhere in the world and be engaged in the capital markets many of which like for X. futures trading et cetera and some equity and bond markets that trade twenty four hours a day and you can have\nAccess using our scored or course strategy to identify high probability turning points in the market\nThink about the power of mobility\nThink about the power of having various forms of income coming to you by when it's appropriate being either long short or even in flat markets having a strategy that well that that that can help you source high probability turning points in the market\nAnd you can do this from anywhere in the world where you can plug in and get a little bit of ban with\nYou and I love that 'cause it's all about generating more income no matter where you are right it gives you that flexibility now you said two words\nThrough there that I Want to smash together you said sustainable and then a couple of seconds later you said skills and sustainable it can't be one and done we can't be a one trick pony it is very critical I Love that you said that it has to be a sustainable income then he said you use the word skills\nBecause skills are what really make it so it can be sustainable we all have that friend we all have that person in our life the knows everything about everything but somehow makes no money on any of it\nRight this isn't a knowledge based market it's a skills based market or I should say the income from these markets is not knowledge driven it's skills driven and it's one of the reasons why we always talk about the financial markets can never be approached as a get ... get rich quick type of program because skills don't happen overnight\nA knowledge base can be built a lot faster than a skill based you have to have the knowledge before you can really start to build a skills you have to know what you're doing but so often that skill portion of it is overlooked\nAnd one of my mentors a long long time ago he he used to say to me all the time don't worry about the money don't worry about so many worry about the skill you have to generate the skill before you can generate the money and you always say if you're focusing on the money you will never gained the skill because you'll be so distracted\nBy kind of the lack of consistency and always looking always looking at the money he was like you got to focus on the scale the skill comes before the money and so many times that's overlooked but that sustainable\nSkills sustainable skills equals consistent income whether the marks are going up or the market's going down whether the marks going sideways now one of the things that we can do to help a few people get started with this if you're up for it right now John how about we do another give away let's do it man\nRight now we've got to have their class coming up in your area that have to add classes where you'll see exactly what it takes to generate more income whether it's passive income whether it's active income whether it's supplemental income or whether it's primary income inside of these financial markets now just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes the one of these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you're driving now is a great time to pull over\nIncluding with your passes as our professional insiders kid that's packed with lessons from some of our top instructors lessons on topics like in ... retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currencies and much much more\nThe professional insider kitten makes it so you can get started right now we have to free passes one for you one for a friend or throw it in that professional insiders kit just for getting registered but to get them you need to be callers center twenty ... twenty we need you to call now and reserved those seats the number's\nEight eight six six one eight seven to three that's eight eight eight six six one eight seven to three if you end up being college nine or Twenty one sorry about that they hit us up at\nThree bocce a clash dot com and see if you can score some passes there now like to take it a little different direction we're talking about multiple streams of income so still falls under that category and we've talked a little bit about primary income a little bit about supplemental income firing the boss different things like that doing this from wherever you want generating income\nNo matter where you go right but one of the things that I Want to touch on with this too\nThe difference between passive income an active income and when I look at the difference between passive income an active income really everybody starts with active income even the Warren Buffett\nRight and and saying that we can go to my house right now my house is not on fire now ... imagine the market starts to fall apart essentially that means our portfolios are now on fire\nHow much more expensive is fire insurance when the portfolio is on fire and they always you know or when the house is on fire if the insurance company comes over and they're like it's on fire or the flood insurance on the east coast absolutely during the time when we need it we have to buy it my point with us as we have to purchase the insurance before we need it\nYou have to buy a life insurance before you die you got to be proactive absolutely and that's something I Can't stress more and I love that you went down that kind of path on this\nIt is so important that we set this stuff up ahead of time and it's just like the insurance on my car I didn't buy insurance on my car because I plan on wrecking it\nIt's they're just in case one of the things that we can do to help a few people get started with this is where you can really we've got a few more is that the tickets here what if we do another give away a few more individuals out there really get rolling on this stuff sweet\nIn just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes one of these half day classes to get your phone's reading if you're driving\nNow is the time to pull over how does it have to classes where you're going to see exactly what it takes really protect that portfolio but not limit the upside and that's really what John was touching on in their how can we buy insurance on this but not put a cap on the upside of it as well so we can still growth market continues to move higher imagine\nHow well you would sleep knowing that\nIncluded with your passes his are professional insiders kid that's packed with lessons from some of our top instructors lessons on topics like enhancing your retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currencies and much much more\nThe professional insider kit makes it so you can get started right now we have to free passes one for you one for a friend or throw it in that professional insiders kid just forgetting registered but to get them you need to be callers tender twenty ... twenty when you get a call now and reserved those seats the number's eight eight eight six six one eight seven to three\nThat eight eight eight six six one eight seven to three if you end up being a college nine or Twenty one sorry about that the hit us up at\nThree OJ clashed dot com and see if you can score some passes there John you touched on a little bit about tax deferred right tax deferred these tax deferred accounts and all over the world we have different tax deferred kind of vehicles that people can use it got the IRA there's RSP there's there's all sorts of different accounts if we can get into\nNow one of the things that we spend a lot of time on what the students is really building out inappropriate plan for them and everybody has\nDifferent account types different accounts sizes different risk tolerance but when you talk to everybody get that same common thread of\nBut they also want to generate more income and whether that income for today or whether that's income for retirement that income we're always just shows up over and over and over again and I always like to say what if it's your retirement account that's just income for tomorrow if it's your your cash account is just income for\nToday but what are some of the things inside of these retirement accounts we touched on a couple of them but what are some of the other things people can be doing to really to really start to generate more income for themselves down down the road\nAll the first thing I think everybody needs to be conscious about needs to be coached on and to execute in a decisive discipline way is capital preservation first your biggest enemy is time so if you lose capital and if you're a baby boomer and you you're a Q U been accumulating assets\nYour whole life through savings and various other methods to create either income or capital gains\nWe really need to focus on Capitol preservation but once you preserve the capital you still need the capital to give you a respectable yield on what's called a tax deferred basis\nUm or attacks advantaged bases there are many assets that we can talk about it the seminar that in fact our tax exempt\nMost people overlook the ability to create not only capital gains but income that is exempt from both state and federal taxation so there's many many strategies that one can apply in managing their wealth income is very important probably the number one\nIncome productions strategy is to find the company\nThat's paying a dividend now that assumes there's been enough research done to come to the conclusion that the evidence is sustainable we're seeing major companies now that are starting to struggle financially and the board of directors can cut the limited\nSo the sustainability of income from David in paying companies\nWell case in point General Motors or General Electric very well could become quite suspect so the number one income production strategy that we teach is the prudent use of options options give one\nAbility to bring in premium income be patient get paid while your weight for price to get to the level you expected to get to it's a very very powerful model that everybody needs to learn especially baby boomers\nAnd as you were talking about time decay you're saying you know ... you're talking about it in a sense of of it's always going away and it's also an important element when it comes to generating income inside of these options strategies it is a portion of what pays you as a cellar\nWhen you sell time every day you're collecting that money off of it but the other thing that I was like to bring up about time to ... just about time in general is a ... it's very normal to be in a conversation and somebody said time is the most precious commodity that we have\nAnd and they say you can never get it back and I always even like to take that step further and say time is the the the one constant decaying asset that we always have to and that's one of the reasons why we put such a high value on it there's never a way to get it back and there's never a way to slow down to decay and so even going back to kind of Larry's famous Akron and he always liked to throughout that passing\nOver opportunities repeatedly that is usually what keeps somebody keep somebody from making the goal from reaching that kind of financial level that they want to attain is that fact that we are creatures of habits\nAnd if we are procrastinators by nature will always be procrastinators by nature and if our goal is to have a specific amount of money by\nX date and maybe ... date as retirement\nEvery day we have less opportunities to make that money because every day we get closer to that point in time where we're supposed to retire even sometimes we talk about that point on the timeline of death and every single day\nWe're closer to that as well so everyday we lose another opportunity to generate more income and it's that passing\nOver opportunities repeatedly that ends up being probably the most costly mistake anybody can make investor not invested professional non professional it's taking advantage of those opportunities and giving ourselves the opportunity to actually\nMake the money you know there there's a famous quote by the great one Wayne Gretzky and it goes something like you miss one hundred percent of the shots you never take right now we've got a half day class coming up in your area and I want to give away some passes to this but I got asked John if it's OK with him\nFind me let's do it All right well right now we've got to have their class coming up in your area now have their classes where you're gonna see exactly what it takes to be able to identify these opportunities take advantage of these opportunities rather than just passing over these opportunities now if you are driving now is a good time\nThey pull over and get your phone's ready including with your passes as our professional
