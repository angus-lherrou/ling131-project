our power to prevent this kind of a mask or from happening to help anyone who was caught in such a horrific circumstances this and now we do what we can with in some cases direct aid and assistance but also just just prayer\nAnd uh and words of support and everything else that we can do for the Jewish community in this country\nAnd yet it immediately turns into a political issue\nAnd without a moment self reflection without taking just to be sure let the American people more than\nThey make this about Trump\nThese people who do this every day on every issue at all times are are sick they have a problem they really do there are no longer capable of being objective\nLast week we were told\nThere was a bomber who Trump is responsible for because this guy would already called it a bomb threat you know over a decade before Trump's presidential run and at a uh a career criminal clearly you know psychological problems But Trump's responsible because he criticized\nThere's people in the political arena and those are the people that were being targeted they can't point to Trump ever ... ever inciting or or calling for violence against any of those individuals\nBut they say that Trump is basically responds\nWell did they use these kind of weasel words they'll say oh well he's he bears some share of the blame and you know 'cause they know the Trump didn't pack the bombs himself you know Trump wasn't wasn't crushing a glass to use the shrapnel for they're not that crazy I suppose they're not that\nStupid but they'll say that Trump was the reason for this in some way and what the point you as well he had his van this guy had this van say oc covered in Trump's stickers covered in all this\nPro ... paraphernalia\nAnd so we had to deal with this last week we talked about on the show now here we are over the weekend there's the terrible shooting on on Saturday on on the Jewish Sabbath\nAnd\nWe are told that even though this shooter it is clear did not like Trump because specifically Trump was too friendly and too favorable and too much of a friend to the Jews\nIt still Trump's fault now\nIf we take this theory at face value this theory that Trump has just raised hate in America let's be clear that means that now Trump is responsible no matter who in gauges in a hate crime against anyone else\nYou know if there is an anti Christian an anti Catholic you know hate crime in this country let's say you know be ... or ... you know if there's if there's an Islamist extremist let's just put it this is a jihadist kills a bunch of people in his that Trump's fault\nI Want to know where the lines are drawn here and I think the answer by the way they would claim it's Trump's fault because you see somebody from the Islamic community if they were to radicalize it would be because of Trump's anti Muslim rhetoric so he would bear some of the share of responsibility for that too\nIf they you know neo Nazi white nationalist kill somebody somewhere it's from fall because she as implicitly encourage them they'll say if a anti Semite who is anti Trump you know you're going to slip doesn't matter who does Trump is always responsible\nNo matter what the situation if it's a terrible circumstance if there's violence and bloodshed here in America and there's there's hate and there's venom and there's nastiness\nAdage at the root of it all ages crumbs fault they say this is delusional\nAnd it's really destructive to how can you have a conversation with somebody about Trump's policies when they really believe that he's dog whistling to white supremacist all the time in ways that\nI Can't even begin to fathom\nI I'm I'm paying attention to politics all day I'm hearing the swamp I this is I live eat and brief politics and national security and I have no idea what some of these other pundits and and anchors and such are talking about sometimes no I'm like what are they what it will play something for you later you'll here's what is that even me\nWho are these idiots\nWho's paying so much to be so stupid on TV all the time and so they they talked about division as they are creating divisions vicious how you know that the left cannot be taken seriously on this\nThey will try to escalate rhetoric while saying the rest of rhetoric needs to be de escalated they'll say the reason we have terrorism and hate in this country is because of Donald Trump so Donald Trump needs to stop saying that the other side is bad\nOh\nThat seems like a brilliant idea for Trump why not just caved your political opponents\nLet them be chew into submission\nBludgeon you into silence on issues that matter to you by attaching all these issues all these problems all this violence is nothing to do with\nTheir calling President Trump an anti Semite I mean President Trump grew up in New York City\nHe's served as did I which is a city that has\nI Believe the largest Jewish population anywhere outside of Israel in the world Trump is is has had countless friends who are Jewish his personal lawyer Michael Cohen I Know they've had a falling out but you know he was Jewish son in law's Jewish bonkers converted to Judaism is grandkids are Trump is not an anti\nSemite not even a little bit not even close but\nThey say this the media says they pat themselves in the back oh that's right yeah we're speaking truth to power know\nYou're a bunch of destructive little individuals that are saying this it's immoral to make these claims it's immoral to call someone an anti Semite was blood on his hands because somebody else who hate the president who despises his position for Jews\nDecides to be violent engages in this in this replicate crime and he's now facing the death penalty and good this guy should get the death penalty for what he he did and that's in a guy\nTrying to track attach Trump to this though it's just so intellectually dishonest each show unfair and\nIt just goes to show you that there's there's no effort in good faith there is no let's have a real you know last week was all okay let's let's tone things down let's have a different a different kind of conversation going for it let's talk about policy let's come together as America it's All right you know the press is under assault\nBy the press drives I I agree with Trump and at the press does drive a lot of this because the press is full of a bunch of training self obsessed self righteous jerks\nNot all of them obviously and I know is ... I'm telling you what Ninety percent of the media is like\nThey are not good people\nThey're not honest or not ethical it's all about the self it's all about the agenda they are activists\nPosing as truth tellers eighties destroying this country from the inside they're the ones undermining institutions they're the ones undermining public trust\nAnd they turn around and accused everybody else it exactly that they tell you that Trump won't take responsibility they take responsibility for nothing\nWrong story after wrong story are critical of Trump oh that's just a coincidence as if we're idiots we're really supposed to believe that yeah sure it's just a coincidence\n\nThey are disgraceful and they're tearing this country apart and I have to say that it's very frustrating as well because if the if we were able to focus on what's really happening in America and the than the direction of the country right now and how we're all doing this country is doing very well\nIn this country is on the right path\nBut the left can't make a fair arguing about why it's not so what do they do they make it about a motion to make it about anger and viciousness and destructive politics\nAnd lots and that's what they're doing that is what the name of the president\nUm we're gonna continue to see the sun for short we're going to talk of the way that the caravan coming up got some big updates on that for you as well as um some more following the last week with a bomber and and we we got a a whole bunch of show planting so stay right there I'll be right back boss [noise]\n\nWith all the recent news about online security breaches it's hard not to worry about where my data goes making an online purchase or simply accessing your email could put your private information at risk you're being tracked\nOn line by social media sites marketing companies and your mobile or Internet provider that's why I just wanted to take back my privacy by using express VPN express VPN has easy to use apps that runs seamlessly in the background of my computer phone and tablet\nTurning on express VPN protection only takes one click express ...

license or certainly unbalanced people certainly people on the fringes of American Life but it is telling them that what you're doing a is okay and that's why yes there are always been an anti Semitic incidents in American history\nNationalism go hand in hand with the anti Semitism the entire idea of anti Semitism is to put shoes outside the body politic outside the definition of a ... and that's what Donald Trump does that theme that is what his party is now committed to doing\nA lemon nation is rhetoric and the president has not been dabbling in elimination his rhetoric at some point she doesn't dog whistle continues there's megaphones to tell these tribes that they belong to him and this is waiting to violence directly\nDirectly leading to violence they say it is not\nSomewhat or partially Trump's wall I mean I saw a a an editorial about this over the weekend in the Washington Post no less saying that uh it is directly somewhat you know that ... they'll always put his paw fire each Trump's bowl chewed extent\nOr you know Trump Trump should hold some some level of of the blame here\nUh this is this is disgusting it's disgraceful but when you have the\nIndividuals in the media who have taken Trump's entire presidency so personally as an affront to their greatness and their values and how wonderful they are are there are no limits really on the bio what they will throw at this present there are no\nThere's no good faith there's no decency whatsoever that they will extend to him\nAnd to his supporters to all of us remember it's not just about Trump underneath all of this there's always this seizing\nHatred of the Trump voter to a that's a part of the anti Trump movement they they despise the voter they don't cause they don't think that really we've been fooled\nThey figured out enough now I Believe the left is in the media and the Democrat Party I figured out that we've made this bargaining weren't good with it were like yeah I like Trump I I Know he's not perfect I Know we make mistakes but I think Trump is actually the right choice for America right now so they hate us\nBecause of all of that and that's why they feel completely justified and saying just the most despicable disgusting things I mean here's here's a another Washington Post personal over at MSNBC play three\nThere's always been the old right or its equivalent the difference is it was always on the French and the mainstream elements of the party and certainly the president's ah never validated this\nAh what's happening what's so extremely dangerous about this issue now have the man with the largest megaphone and the world\nGiving a nod in a way sometimes outright praise or to the folks who are carrying on these conspiracy theories edited is telling them these people that it's okay that they're getting a a blessing to do this\nYou know it's it's interesting that that you can go on TV that that Dana Milbank Washington Post and say that Trump gives them a blessing right after he is explicitly openly repeatedly condemned this\nBut you see this is one of the games that they play they'll say why doesn't Trump ... why does in Trump condemn white nationalist\nAnd people will say okay well he did he just condemned them a couple of days ago ... well he hasn't denounced it enough and then people will do a little Google surgery and I will say well we're on a second Trump is called white nationalist losers he said there's no place in America for hate he said this many many times and they'll say well the Trump talk about white nationalist so much\nYou can't win folks you you know there's there's nothing he can do that will make them stop calling him a racist stop calling him a white nationalist they they do not extend the most basic\nLevel of good faith do them in any of these discussions and and they love to try it out these these fake conservatism is fake Republicans like Jennifer Rubin who is that she is the queen of fake Republicans Washington Post still list or as a Republican when she writes thing which is just amazing\nBut you know she she blames Trump not just for\nWhat happened over the weekend what happened last week but for the overall increasing hate in America she says like the poor\nAnd that kind of some sort of a shower side of downtown flying but I Will say that we had at fifty seven percent tax and they'll ask hair and anti snack hate crimes\nFame and anti Semitism is that here's our outsiders they are Atlantic they define a nation by\nYou are the ones who willfully violate the meaning of a dream that is America [noise]\nAnd this country because of what it stands for\nWill not stand for your time to [noise]\nThe greatest president my lifetime with the possible\nException of Donald Trump will see how it how it goes we'll see how many years in office he has hopefully eight and we'll see what\nThe full measure of his accomplishes look Reagan defeated Soviet Union and probably save the planet from annihilation so\nThat that's a ... that's a tough one to that's a tough one to be that's a tough record to compare against\nBut Trump so far is doing a pretty remarkable job in his own way but I play that for your just because I I think that it is helpful for all of us in fact I I Would argue that it is necessary for all of us to remind each other and those of us who are conservatives\nThat our movements and our ideology our belief system our principles\nAre rooted in a respect for the individual individual rights human dignity human life liberty that's that is the foundation of our of our belief system that we're all star and so\nTrue anti Semitism and true racism and I see that with a qualifier true because we know the left calls everything I Do some of the calls everything racist I mean they're they use it as a political ...\nTrue anti Semitism and racism and uh and and and bigotry is not just non conservative ... that a goal to conservatism\nBecause if we are not all God's creation in doubt by our creator with the nail unable rights and if we are not all equal in the eyes of God and in the eyes of the law then there was no such thing really us conservatism edit conservatism as we know it in this country does not exist\nIt it it is not possible to be a conservative and believe that a white person or any any black person or a black person than a Hispanic person and a white person that that that they do not all have equal dignity equal rights equal work as human beings and\nAs citizens of this great nation\nSo when the last try so hard to create this perception that people who are conservative I I Can't speak to the right I mean the right\nIt would mean meaning all of it I was going to be the right in general terms but you know there are some fringe elements of the right that you that that they consider themselves in the right and you'd say well hold on a second in what meaningful way are they conservative though you know this is where you start to really get into what is right wing or left wing even mean\nYou know if you are more in favor of individual rights if you were about the individual instead of the collective right the left in this country is all about the collective and they're about collective guilt collective identity collective economics they are collective is\nThey believe in groups they believe in the common good as defined by a core of elites that all speak in the language of equality in commonality but leaves\nAs elites in separate from the masses but use the envy and antagonism of the masses in order to\nBeat the other side politically which would\nBe ... we are the individual is we are the individual rights we're all God's creation we're all human beings in this struggle together and should help each other and respect each other at each other's rights and dignity and life and that has an obligation on all of us\nI'm the one that when they try to make this case that racism and anti Semitism and these different ... and bigotry exist on the right I just I have a a real feeling of uh of outrage at that because it's\nShow on true and so unfair and I think that the reason they push it so it's not just because it works it's dirty politics but it is useful for them\nA it is a shame that so many of the\nClasses that the Democrats view as victims whether it's just the working poor or African Americans or a or Hispanics Latinos women whatever the group maybe it's a shame that so many of them have been propagandize to such that they they really\nBelieve that I Know this from talking to them they really believe that conservatives are racist they believe that and you and I said you knowing that that is a lie it's not true we're not racist in fact we're the ones that are always advocating for people of all races to be treated equally under the law is the left\nThat advocates for disparate treatment in the eyes of the law based upon race based upon skin color based upon not even real but perceived gender they're the ones that want\nThese differentiation and then they turn around and say that we're the ones who are obsessed with with race and gender on these other differences among among human beings\nAre when at the end of the day I I think it couldn't be any more clear that our side\nThe side of conservatives unconstitutional it's are the ones that advocate for individual rights and the dignity of all people\nAnd\nThere has always been this effort to rewrite the histories of the ... the two parties this is why Democrats you get show there I say triggered when you just brought up that they are the part of the Democrats are the part or a party of slavery segregation Jim Crow just go down the list it was it was historically always the Democrats\nDemocrats have been and are the party of the mob mob mentality the mob feeling how does the mass feel how does the masses view an issue what did they demand what did they show what where's their rage direct that has been the aid that has been at the core of the Democratic party\nThere's always been an intellectual straining conservatism that has been first and foremost about the American founding the constitution and\nThe rights of each and every individual and the natural law that underpins all of this but it's not really just about what the founding fathers said if at the founding fathers were able to harness a sense of what is a universal and eternal truths about human beings\nWhat is always true about people what is always good for society to promote and what does always necessary for society to try and prevent it to condemn\nThose universal truths are at the heart of conservatism\nAnd so it's just these exact opposite of conservative [noise] to believe that first in less than because this is a person is less than his agenda [noise] less than because of religious [noise]\nThat is not who are [noise]\nAnd I know that you know that as I Know that that I Do\nThink that is worth sometimes taking a step back and just\n... exactly why that is the [noise]\nThere's a lot of ... and frauds out there and a lot of very easy and clever ways for people to try and falsify records and who they are that's why if you're hiring or
