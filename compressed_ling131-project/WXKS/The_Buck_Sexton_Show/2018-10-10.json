this discussion which is that they think that climate change that pushing climate change hysteria is a way to get\nCloser to a one world government and and I know that's that sounds like crazy jog but there's also why ... why do liberals have such an affinity for the United nation the United nations has\nProven itself ineffectual so many times over at its core missions\nUh it it has not prevented genocide despite UN Mandate to do so it has not prevented armed conflict despite you know un efforts to do so and it often give some of the worst most offensive and oldies regimes on the planet cover

the truth\nIs that there are some there are some there I say crappy governments out there there were some crap hole governments and then there's some pretty good governments\nOr at least in comparison to the other governments pretty good oh and we shouldn't have to treat them all like they're the same but Sanders year when he talks about promoting a shared prosperity and solidarity that goes beyond any one nations sovereignty the now now you're getting further along into what the progressive\nAnd state is with regard to climate change and and these activities the the fixation on multilateral isn't that you see from a body like the United nations\nI that's why I was all because they view the UN is essentially a democracy of countries and democracy is a is an almost fetish eyes word I'm On

be able to vote in Athens in a very small percentage overall so you know the notion of democracy as just everybody gets to vote and they get whatever they want by whatever the majority\nAre ... by

secret gang rape is from your teenage years and nobody figured it out until right before you're going to be Supreme Court nominee only idiots can't believe this\nOr people who have been brainwashed people who have been so thoroughly propagandize too that they can't find any\nWeight or region through these things they really think that Trump is a threat to the republic they're really think that Republicans want to uh set up concentration camps on the border for people that aren't from this country but these this is the kind of rhetoric that they keep using and we say OK okay this must be\nVicious must just be the Democrats trying to fire up the base trying to get people enthusiastic about politics on their side\nMaybe we really just need to take them at their word maybe they actually do believe this stuff or at least enough of them believe it that the party has taken a turn from just being wrong on issues\nTo being dangerous it's one thing to say the Democrats are ignorant of history and refused to admit or allow evidence contrary to their closely held belief is another thing to say that\nYou can't even have a conversation with them any more about this they're living in an alternate reality and they're aggressive and they're angry and they're being encouraged by their most prominent members to\nTake this out on you I I've been asked the question is I said what do you do when someone says oh you're a Republican you must be an opposite the answer is not oh try to convince them you're not not the answers get away from them we are now entering a phase in political discourse\nWhere for reasons of self preservation and safety I Would tell you\nDon't engage with these people don't don't talk to them and probably 'cause you just don't know you just don't know it's definitely going to be ugly or going to say terrible things do but you can handle the harsh words I Know but it's\nA very small margin of error between someone getting up in your face because they don't like your politics and screaming at you in front of your wife or your husband or whomever\nAnd all of a sudden a scuffle breaks out and now there's real violence and not only has to happen once\nBefore then the temperature gets raised even more and now the next time people square off in some kind of a public dispute over politics the impulse to become violent is even more apparent right the impulse to take this to a level of\nHitting people attacking kicking people and perhaps even worse do not forget that the Democrats\nPushed the lives of the black lives matter movement in there were many many lies I heard them I can tell you what they are among them that there was an epidemic of killing of young black men by racist cops who have their or for whom there's no accountability that's a lie\nOut but among among the many lies that were told to this day as well it didn't lead to any violence that the anti corporate or did not lead to violence whether they're five dead officers from Dallas texas ... in Texas\nOr who clearly their families their departments their friends would disagree with that notion very strongly\nAs well as ... instances of other violence against cops cross gotta chew killed sitting in a patrol car here in New York City where I'm currently doing this show\nLeft wing rhetoric has led to violence including lethal violence where's the correlate we we are so much weird that CNN anchor talking about Charlottesville\nAnd we will continue to hear about a casualty at Charlottesville whenever this conversation about political violence but yet they are so slow to bring up the many many more casualties\nThat have been caused by political rhetoric from the other side\nBecause ultimately they can't win these arguments that they're having with us their arguments are not prevailing in the quarter public opinion their arguments about cabin or did not prevail\nAnd they are frustrated they are angry and when people become frustrated and angry but also think that they are righteous in that anger they can become dangerous take senator polls warning to heart\nThis tone does not change if there is not a willingness among those and media say mob violence mob destruction mob threats are bad a group of people menacing and individual or a couple of individuals because their politics is wrong this is not who we are in show

got more than three people work together\nScreaming in your face and acting like maniacs because they're trying to have dinner with your wife 'cause they don't like her politics they don't like her political party that's getting in the ... when you get twenty or thirty or forty people that are doing it which is what we've seen in these restaurants at a minimum\nThen it's definitely my behavior but that that is the word used to describe it but you see there are very sensitive\nAbout using that were there very sensitive about saying it because they know that their audience is all a bunch of lives and they don't want the lives that feel like an even sending me about the really devoted lips\nYou know there there's a sympathy just because people don't go out and you know where all the black stuff and act like anti ... doesn't mean that they despise anti fun fact I think there are way more Democrats and you're seeing this now who\nDon't necessarily agree with that if it was methods but they agree with the message\nAnd they know that the audience the CNN audience does not want to be told hey are there are there's a problem on the left ear and people are acting like maniacs mob maniacs no less\nThat's not what the audience wants to hear so they stay away from it it reminds me so very much\nOf what was being or what was happening back in the days of black lives matter you guys know what I'm Talking about um black lives matter days there were all these incidents the most from it well actually the one in Baltimore was really well known and then there was one in in St Louis Missouri\nLater these incidents where you had a mob that followed onto a protest of some kind and they were\nBurning down buildings they were looting stores they were throwing rocks at cops and CNN would go from there showing burning building one moment to political analysts later on doing what\nWell is mostly peaceful protest it was mostly peaceful protest\n... mostly peaceful protest what is it even mean ... can you imagine if if you just did a very simple thought experiment if you looked at a Tea Party rally circuit twenty ten\nAnd there was anybody throwing rocks at cops there was anybody who was letting buildings on fire they were like oh my gosh look the country has been in turmoil look at the rioters and yet when you flip it around and you have people that are saying they're part of this black lives matter movement\nThen all of a sudden you know they're they're not ... you can't afford them is riders you certainly wouldn't ... what was going on even though it was about race and racial animus and claims of racism and never allowed to call it a race riot on TV\nYeah I I got to say I I don't know how it\nIs that that segment on CNN is considered up to ... in any way up to that network standards that that's acceptable\nI how how that how it is allowed to happen on a cable news show when when keep in mind there is a guy who I interviewed a what was it maybe a few weeks ago who was a sports caster\nAnd she said something about about boots on he said that he you know I forget what it was executive he made some reference to the female organ that is\nCalled by some uh books and it\nWas a big like oh my gosh you can't say that I don't see another excuse me so this is like when she was all over and it was a big problem\nBut then you add what just happened there where there's obviously very\nRacially inflammatory language being used in and people laughing and and mocking\nTanya west to look I Know that he's a provocateur tour of people have all these very strong opinions on it but I I think that there was a line crossed there and I'm I don't understand how anyone doesn't feel like there was a La Crosse there\nBut you also get a bit of a window into how the left at this moment in time as their grasping\nFor reasons that are grasping for for ways to justify\nA their intolerance of other ideas the the rabid way which they approach trying to destroy their enemies you know we we have so few celebrities on the right that speak or soap operas alright period and we have so few people that come out and and espouse conservative principles\nThat with someone of ... a level in celebrity land\nSays anything about being pro Trump each there's this mob yes there's that word again this mob mentality to tear him down immediately\nIt's one thing that they want to say who cares but think about what a disparity there is in this realm you look\nEvery idiot celebrity I Know we talk about you know I'm not saying she's an idiot but we're talking I don't know we're talking about Taylor Swift and uh you know her effort to help the Democrats in Tennessee in all these different celebrities out there you know George Clooney I mean name one Tim Robbins and Susan surrender these these people were\nAll just absolute hardcore left these Alec Baldwin\nAnd it was a really good actor I Wish he wasn't such a common ... all of them are on this one side and any of that and all the music artist you know this is always the big joke with whenever there's inauguration parties like the Obama inauguration parties where the the top recording artist in the world and the Trump recording artists were\nI don't know who's that guy told me he wasn't he one of them will put a boot in your is that a ... that's a different song actually the different artists I don't know\nUh I also I like I think it's Clint Black Iraq 'em up and I roll I don't know there's some great some great country and things that I still remember up there I should listen to more country music that's that's one thing that's\nThat is that's come out of this conversation that I Can't think of any like if someone is your favorite country artist John I'd ... I'd have to go with I don't know Garth Brooks just 'cause usually when I think of off the top of my head no no she economy is Garth Brooks no come on and he but\nUh well we don't have any of these artists and Kanye is out there and he said people are what are you talking about like yeah look I Adam Baldwin Nick Searcy\nA James Woods is Twitter account is awesome I mean there's there are some conservatives out there for sure but we have worn high level music act like this\nAnd really more of a cult look he's more of a cultural icon not that I'm some big cognac fan or is it ... or ... John the recall and with the shorthand it must be a when it's just why eat right yeah that's right I work I mean technically I worked for our media so I feel like I Need to\nKnow more about the music industry lingo show but it but they're they're piling on him and why was because they\nResent any loss of their ability to have a total echo chamber on the left when it comes to or echo chamber of fact in ... when it comes to any cultural\nA music Hollywood figure\n... they they cannot abide it they cannot deal with it and I mean I Can't deal with 'em like they cannot psychologically process at an eight eight concerns them at worries them they don't they don't know what they would do they don't know how they would handle it if they didn't have all the celebrities that they know what I'm saying oh you're so great and climate change is terrible and\nOh all the stuff people really really do need to get it need to get a grip and uh that's that's my that's one of my main takeaways from all this by the way um I Would just note that the\nIRS or for a moment we have a some others but so the hurricane Mike is made landfall right do we hold on to the IRS where we've got on this so far\nThe biggest concern is if everybody that uh the the people they just chose not to evacuate I I spent time the last few days going up and down the coast getting people to evacuate but this is a horrible\nHorrible storm a hundred and fifty plus miles an hour\nA disease twelve inches of rain but the thing that people I think don't realize is the storm surge whether the ... thing or fourteen feet it's all deadly\nAnd I'm very concerned that people are not taking any consideration so we are ready to respond if we can help anybody now that chose not to evacuate ah they have to hunker down and take care of themselves or we have Nineteen thousand or people that are\nAlready free physicians that get the power back on that I Am scared to death and people that chose not to go back in fact the way this is they just say her when a storm and\nThat's the Governor Scott and Florida numbers or Mike first of all obviously thought suppressed everybody's affected I Know we've got a lot of great listener as a lot of folks down in Florida and we just hope everybody\nEveryone down and and and it said is is gonna be All right through this whole thing it feels like this storm was kind of a kind of snuck up on people right because the the hurricane before this there was a lot of\nOh this is going to be a huge and we we I mean I remember seeing it way out in the Atlantic I'm like it that you know is that the Canary Islands like what's going on over there and and then this one though got really big really fast one was already close to ... am I Am I mistaken him that notion\nYeah no this one came out of nowhere and usually don't get many hurricanes up the Gulf Coast right I mean it's coming up to a point where it they're not used to seeing it like Clearwater Beach Naples like that area I've been say usually\nSomebody usually from the Atlantic ... right in the ... the east coast of the four oh well I Hope everyone is All right I I'm surprised I'm hearing that there's been a lot of lot of people decided not to evacuate and we just like I said doesn't preserve it but what more coming up here in a second on the continued fallout from\nKavanaugh left is still just [noise] living in this fantasy land of of they're going to raise this whole Kavanaugh situation they're going to find a way to to make it like it never happened and I just got to tell you I find that a distressing [noise]\nUm but I have a solution for everybody I have a way I think the shutdown that tall [noise] not just going to complain about them complaining about cabinet I'm gonna tell you how we can get them to shut up about Cavanaugh\nI was visiting with buck about his show on home title fraud\nWhere the retired FBI agent demonstrated a crime dislike everywhere it's called home title fraud\nIn his simple because all home titles are kept on line in fact the FBI guy in home title locked found the title to bucks family's home they forged id and showed him how easy it is to transfer title and lose your home had of been real this is the foot of taking out loans using bucks homeless equity\nThey wouldn't even have known until late payments or VIX you notice is showed up\nIn that identity theft protection we have it does not cover titled fraud\nLook if you own a home or rentals or have elderly parents get home title lock for pennies a day home title luck puts a virtual barrier around your host title the instant they detect sinister activity there on it helping to shut it down you know what I'm saying don't be already be compromise you don't know sign up and get a free title scan and report\nIt was a hundred dollar value free at whole title luck dot com home title locked dot com\n[laughter] Boston do you have more conservative talk with my family even bought Ninety four or five at

Fox News the worst of hurricane Michael has already passed Florida governor Rick Scott warned knock it out on the roads\nUntil you're told to just say we need the roads to be open for first responders and search and rescue to do their jobs and save lives and he said we'll be sending help from air land and sea\nThis includes thousands of responders for power restoration medical search and rescue law enforcement food and water distribution and every other critical resource\nBut now you started to get into the weak points in our whole system the weak point being that if you have people were operating entirely in bad faith\nThere really aren't any limits on it really ... there aren't any limits on an investigation\nYou do have a right to a speedy trial and hopefully a judge would enforce that although these days who knows oh but you do not have the right to a speedy investigation in fact in an investigation\nCan go on at ... at for for years on it and bankrupt you some people I Know there's some people have actually taking deals meaning they've they pleaded guilty to something just to make the investigation just to make the investigation and the process and the the trial\nIt's all stop because they they're already\nThe process is the punishment so the same way that also and Obama did this rather speaking about shredding constitutional north Obama decided that using prosecutorial discretion he would effectively abrogate immigration law\nAnd say that if you're here legally you're not going to that you will not be deported we will create an extra legal process for you wonder you know the following conditions and he did that all under what is effectively prosecutorial discretion\nThere are lots of ways that the system can be abused if they are going to abuse of I used to be of the mind more of a I guess it's a traditionalist William F ... style can serve I used to be the mind if you know we have to we have to maintain the principles that ... that they show quickly abandon\nBut from what I see happening in our politics today I take a position of you know we we've got actually beat them we've got to win otherwise we just suffer and hope that there'll be better times when there's\nPlenty of reason to believe that actually things will just keep getting worse\nAnd that's why yes there is there is a part of me that especially in the aftermath of capital and on any issue related to Kavanaugh says you've got to fight fire with fire and in this case that means\nIf they want to do this thing with Hillary we're going to have the da da da da de la ... told me who was fired let's remember that was fired from the FBI and is also I Believe under investigation for possibly leaking classified material\nLet's let's take a look at ah at what the FBI determination would be or rather the deal Jay ... actually makes the decision not the FBI but whether to bring charges let's see what the deal determination is about Hillary's emails this time around\nAll blocked no we we shouldn't drag the country back into the they wanted\nThe Democrats are openly advocating for dragging the country back into that mess that mess speaking the FBI by the way you know Rand Paul is that a tough year year and a half\nRand Paul was holding the FBI feet to the fire a little bit on something that used to be a lot of attention including in conservative circles and that is all this warrantless spying stuff you'd think they'd given all the Russia collusion insanity this would be a bigger topic here's what here's what Rand Paul to say\nWhile the FBI by and large is full of good people yourself included you have had some bad apples you had Peter Struck and his girlfriend talking about trying to bring the president town you've had people bringing their politics to work\nThe concern of us who want more control over what you do and how you look at data\nIs that as Madison said men are not angels that's what we have the constitution that's where we asked you to get a warrant the information you gather in the foreign database is not constitutional and the sense that has gathered with no bar there is no warrant there is no\nConstitutional manner to that matter to that data and yet you once and then use it on domestic crime that has been our complained for years and years and years that you should not be allowed to access that data without a warrant\nI agree and I have to say it's a little concerning that given that now on the right we are very aware of the fact that the FBI deal Jay and the intelligence community were in part weaponized against Trump\nThat there has not been any real change in how these prophecies work or certainly there's been no legislation to prevent this from happening again\nIn remember this all happened after we already had the IRS targeting of Tea Party it is this all happened after we should have been aware\nThat or political opponents in in our own country we're willing to abuse the apparatus of government reporters and purposes and there's been no real change there's ... and said you have Democrats pretending like none of this really happened\nThey thought they were going to prove Trump Russia collusion all they're really proven is that the government is full of some deep state leftists who are completely and utterly willing to abuse whatever authority they have to achieve partisan end so you'd think it calls for more oversight and maybe some legislation but uh apparently not\nTeam it is an honor and privilege debris my thoughts on all the things that matter to

suggests this is the case that people are likely to cast votes based upon their perception of health care what is\nReally going on here what is the state of health care right now as it relates to the midterms and just in general what's going on but got somebody can answer this question for us over Roy is with us now\nIs the president for the foundation for research on equal opportunities also a Forbes\nEditor over great to have him\nA book so a ... first of all is this is this concept what'd you say it's accurate I mean are are we are we seeing data suggest that people as much as we all get told by the media it's all about\nTrump's tweets and Russia collusion and Kavanaugh that it actually might be health care the tips the balance of the of the house and the Senate to one or the other side of the ...\nWell I I haven't seen any polling data buck and I look at it pretty closely at that particular question I haven't seen any polling data to suggest that health care right now is\nMotor motivating people to turn out ah for November having a obviously is a much bigger driver but I Will say that if Democrats are successful\nTaking the house or whether or not to take the Senate if they just take the house\nUm and even if they don't somehow whatever happened the midterms are going to be over you know this is talk to your listeners know this was seen as the midterms over literally within hours limit turns being over what are we going to start talking about\nThe twenty twenty presidential election in particular in this case the Democratic primary for who's going to challenge Trump and what that primary is going to be all about but it's all going to be about\nWho is going to outbid who who's going to be the true blue purists on single payer Democrats in the primary for president are going to fight over this issue and what Trump is doing in this op ed is he's firing his initial salvo for his reelection campaign\nSo ... where is the healthcare debate right now for between Republicans and Democrats as it stands today I mean you're you're mentioning or you're you're talking about where the left will go after this election where is the last positioning itself but where Democrats position themselves right now and and what is the Republican pitch on healthcare\nYeah one of the things that's been fairly interesting and you may have talked about this on your program in the past is that democratic ads about health care and the midterms are actually they're spending more money on health care as the Republicans are they're\nTalking a lot about this Texas lawsuit which aims to overturn Obamacare the\nOut by attacking with a preexisting conditions provision vomit care\nAnd so what you have a lot of democratic congressmen and candidates saying is that Republican I'm running against he's against protecting you from a high insurance payments because they're pre existing conditions\nOn for protecting you from that from me so there is a lot of these races a lot of talk about pre existing conditions in when I'm On Capitol Hill I hear that all the time members asking me like you know why should we do about pre existing conditions\nSo that that is that's the thing you're hearing a lot of it you're not hearing so much about single payer the single payer thing is really about twenty twenty\nSingle payer you think is now going to or I should say is going to be the Democratic party official ... an official position on healthcare once we're heading into twenty twenty you're you're confident of that\nI'm certain of it's just like repeal and replace for the Republicans right like what Republicans wanted to be against repealing Obamacare running in elections in the last\nTen years right similarly progressive to dominate the left wing primaries on Democratic Party if you don't say you're for single payer you're not going to win\nAt all you're going to have a primary challenge to every Democrat feels that pressure from the left and frankly most of them genuinely philosophically want single payer even though they believe most most intelligent Democrats believe it's unrealistic and could never happen\nThey do philosophically would they would prefer government takeover of health care system so yeah they're not gonna they're not going to deny that therefore single air they're going to say yeah I'm for single or they're all going to climb over each other to talk about how pro single payer there\nHow how accurate worthy early GOP projections that I always you know over you've been involved this discussion stretching back for a long time\nBut how accurate were the projections are of how damaging and bad Obamacare would be you know I remember this was like the fiercest political discussion in the country back in the early days the Obama administration has it been\nWhat the Republicans said it would be or is it something more mixed\nWell uh you know I ... it's not that to my own horn or anything but but yet you know you fall I worked really closely I mean the main thing that I talked about a lot with Obamacare in two thousand ten and two thousand eleven was how the premiums would go up\nPerpetrated by one of Raleigh who went on to lose\nIn court a defamation case they settled this that she than a sexually refuse to pay\nAnd it has since moved into obscurity I forget they did some update on to want to Brawley a few years ago and found that she was living somewhere and just trying to avoid having to pay anything on the defamation settlement that she uh she lost so you can imagine when you hear today from people say oh are you\nBlaming the victim well the court blamed the so called victim there are these so called survivor 'cause she wasn't a victim or survivor's we found out\nWhat what let's say focus for a moment on stopping first point is Trump brought this up he gave a speech what was I wrote in a week mentioned stop and frisk for Chicago and here's what they say about this\nThey claim that New York the most visible\nSingle place to have instituted a stop and frisk policy and it was done under Mayor Bloomberg was made out from today Democrat Bloomberg was Democrat he was an independent member remember when he ... those those uh those speeches about the snow\nAnd then and then they would they had the interpreter and and and but\nBloomberg would go into a little like he'd be like yo soy Mayor Bloomberg God blessed that you all you do as little Bloomberg Espanol ...\nI I that was great that was great those are similar tires producer Mike\nMayor Bloomberg would slip into his hundred words of Spanish that he spoke in order to just let it let New Yorkers know that the euro the snow is cold and they will move it we we wrap you know that was only a scene the Blasio common I Know we we didn't know what we had\nYou see the Blasio are read by the way he's so there's the mayor of New York city and gave everybody a needs to be told that a major city yet somebody ... was talking about housing for the homeless he's like I'm Sorry I'm In the middle of my work out it's like oh you mean to work out that you do at the gym that requires a fleet of SUVs to take you an hour from the mayor's mansion\nIn cars you like that Jim in Brooklyn but this guy doesn't do anything all day it's an hour to get there an hour to get back he works out I guess for our we know that he spent all of his time on the elliptical let's be real lot of stretching it a lot of electrical\nAnd you know ... that he would somebody comes up to him in the gym is a public official\nHe gets all Snoopy about it he's a he's a sniffy system the math anyway um I just I'm just saying Bloomberg maybe running as a as a Democrat or he was the one or he's gonna run it's\nA Democrat at least that's what people are saying as of today run for the twenty twenty ...\nHe had stop and frisk what a stop and frisk alright it allows people to allow law enforcement to on\nA reasonable suspicion\nStop and talk to you and then if they think it is necessary for safety they can pat you down now they say that this is inherently racist and the reason for that is that you have\nA large number of these stop and frisk hundreds and thousands hundreds of thousands of these stops that occurred over a period of many years in New York they say oh well you have a disproportionate number of\nA black and Hispanic
