I'm probably the gator I work with law enforcement when they're in the system they are convicted that maybe they serve ten years when it comes time to come out there is it the pain or requests from

pretty he's pretty open about he wants single payer he wants to raise taxes will be will say that your last Matty papers a bunch of things and you know we'll find some way but just that just was pushing them here on the issue of ice detained request\nAnd notice a villain would not answer because\nIs what this really is is a question about sanctuary city policies sanctuary cities do nots and now there's some variations year depending on which jurisdiction of the ... century city as a as a general rule do not\nAdhered to or do not on her eyes to ... what that means is when someone is already\nIn custody of law enforcement and immigration and Customs Enforcement is informed that that person is in custody they send they detain requests if they want that person to be turned over to them for the purposes of deportation\nThey\nRefuse century city jurisdictions refused to do that and what descent just knows and he had been a prosecutor is it that means that there are people who are a danger to the community who are convicted criminals people who have served sentences including sometimes for violent crimes\nAnd local jurisdictions because of the politics around illegals and because of the pandering to generally the Latino community by Democrats\nJurisdictions will not honor these chain of requests which means that people who are criminals and illegal aliens get released back out into the general population and can become repeat offenders\nAnd this is really a question of do you believe\nThat law enforcement should work together you know I cannot think of another issue where if the FBI requested uh for example the FBI requested help from a sheriff or local law enforcement they wouldn't just knock it help they will be stonewall we refused to help you as a matter of policy\nOn it and people realize that there's a lot of crossover there's a lot of ways unfortunately but it is true that even local crimes can get tangled up in the federal Web\nSo there are ... and just the FBI's viewed as a legitimate law enforcement body by most folks and so there's a lot of cooperation between those reading I here here's a verb example I work in the NYPD intelligence division I was sitting in a city with seeded with pardon me a\nSuited with an FBI agents DEA ... ah people from all these different federal immigrations and Customs Enforcement all these different agencies were all singing to gather because stuffed I'm calling my radar would also be on their radar and we worked together as a fusion center that's what I was doing that's my ... and of course also it\nOn the federal counterterrorism side in particular but we understand that there's a lot of crossover law enforcement will somebody who is a drug dealer who's also illegal alien is\nCausing problems for the law and multiple ways and one law enforcement agencies should support the other law enforcement agencies legitimate law enforcement functions\nWhat gives them is telling you without telling you is that he prefers lawlessness because it is politically advantageous\nHe won't say it but just Sanchez was right to push him on this one and this then goes to a a refrain that you heard a lot from the left and I really hope becomes a huge problem for them in the in the midterms which is remember when\nPossibility of this race going for the Republicans Kim Strasser will join just not talking about what's going on in New Jersey she's a peace up on the wall Street Journal where she is on the editorial board smiling at corruption\nDemocrats tried to save Bob Menendez months after his bipartisan as admonished bitch a Kim great to have you back and it's great to be here\nAll right what's going on in in the Garden State which I always feel a certain love hate relationship for the New Yorker what's going on up there\n[noise] yeah well you said you know what's notable here that while the entire media felt obsessing over Texas where those numbers look Ted Cruz is is that not like pulling away from it all worked as a racist even within a smaller margin of error and in New Jersey where a Democrat Bob Menendez\nWhen you mentioned um he was answered by his colleague rather launched by his colleague back earlier this year\nI'm after she had been found to have accepted all sorts get from a man who was convicted felon who ran one of the biggest Medicare fraud on the government an all time\nI'm not only was he accepting a lot of gifts from this guy and not acknowledging that under Senate Ethics rules but he was working on behalf of the guy to help them with his business interests in Washington including gone so far it's a lot of health and Human Services secretary on his bat\nSo um he he was actually indicted for this uh the the FBI ultimately I'm Sorry the department of justice ultimately dropped the charges after the Supreme Court that changed the standard\nUm on what it would take to convict him but he wasn't honest and he's now facing a very tough race against Bob Cuban Republican businessman who's been highlighting this and it it's really driving a favor\nHow did you say there's a a deafening silence Kim\nFrom so many of the au Jared Kushner must have some shady relationship with Saudi Arabia I hear this people to be able to Tom and I said okay well what is it and then there's this was nothing there there's all these whispers of corruption around Trump\nMeanwhile Menendez who whether people want to just parse out the legality of what he did or not what he did was gross and the guy he was associated with even grosser and there does open a Bush has got to go on for the Democrats\nYeah many Democrats are actually out there running a campaign focused on so called Republican corruption Nancy Pelosi that are actually handed out to her members eight to ... a talking point about how they supposedly go after Republican corruption Trump and and all sorts and butter\nIssues none of which as you said there was any real evidence for but in the meantime they just close their eyes in some cases\nActually are outright helping I mean well the Democrat that's why I call the called smiling at corruption\nAt the biggest superPAC out their majorities superPAC helping Senate Democrats just decided to re route million dollars to help Bob Menendez in his race I might or taking away from even more important races for them or where they're trying to unseat\nUnemployed says what Trump won um because he didn't so much trouble but in essence this is the Democratic party say hey you know what we're OK with corruption\nI guess they're adult trail of evidence that very clear at the fact that senators on record saying that he engaged in corruption but we're still going to do everything we can return to office\nYeah and I have to say that there are two areas where I see a tremendous or boxing loving to one of them is on this\nOr is on the notion of corruption much as you pointed out is is a talking point against the Republicans but you have so many Democrats you start to think of it all the Democrats that have gone to prison in the last oh four or five years for incredibly obvious a very shady corruption and that never gets brought up\nBut in any of this discussion as I said there's always this big old Trump most you know someone starts telling you about the mall humans calls get 'em you know that that tends to be what I hear about\nA but also on on the notion of mobs I I have to say I am I have been surprised and I take it very dim view of much of the of the journalists class which I Know technically you definitely are a journalist on something else but I'm pretty close to journal led\nA but most journalists I think act in a way that is really surprising to me but on the mobs Kim I'm seeing a lot of people would say you know they have no other they have no other way to make their case and these are people that write for the Washington Post\nIt's it's crazy look it absolutely unacceptable okay the whole reason we have civil\nSociety we have to face it so that we don't have mob rule just because you're citing when an election just because your person didn't get in office or just because you lost your Supreme Court nomination\nThere definitely nothing written in any of the formal or informal rules that our society they give you the right to shape Mitch McConnell or Ted Cruz added ... hound them at a restaurant\nUm is it the fact precisely why we have a ballot box and elections and anybody out there whether it's on CNN I eat a couple on there and well eight not ma and be they're just saying what they think we all know that's not\nTrue I'm saying what you think is when you write an op ed or a letter to a newspaper um or you go to vote\nOr that you know harassing people on the street is not and that's the best it got and conservatives should actually feel pretty good that they're winning on the policy merits\nNow I Know that it's it's really tight and so to to ask you to make her production and who really knows but just in in a minute or so we have your Kim how to eat where what's the main dynamic you see right now in the house race that's going to determine whether it ends up being the Republicans the Democrats win the day\nBut I think the most important thing which they weren't hearing on the mainstream media is how different it is today than it was just three weeks ago okay we can say with complete definite proof\nThat the Democrats blown it to a certain extent or they were talking about a wave three weeks ago they messed up with Kavanaugh it's not going to be a way I think it's going to come down by the one way or the other right on whoever does when an going to have a huge majority but I think Republicans are still and\nAll right give us Ross everybody on the wall Street Journal check out her columns also her book the intimidation game Jim always appreciate you make the time for us come back soon\n... back\nYeah I I think he was caught on there with the it's going to be five seats it's going to be such a narrow margin I I don't think that we're going to know we're certainly not going to know who controls the house by the time I'm although you should listen for all of the show election I obviously a but we're not going to know who control the house I think I'm by\nThe time this show is is over um I think it's going to stretch well I guess the polls closed around age there's no way we would know okay yeah this is not even close but we might not even know till maybe the next morning it's going to just going to be drawn out [noise]\nAnd it's going to be very very tight which goes to tell you\nYou know they've been telling us the Trump is a fascist and destroying America and now they're praying and hoping that they can

Fox News President Trump expressed the optimism was just over two weeks into the midterm election I think\nBut we're not going to prosecute anyone we don't have any mechanism even for prosecuting anyone a this was a crime committed on Turkish soil so we don't have any jurisdiction here to speak up it was also donate a conflict so it was done on Saudi soil on Turkish soil\nSo this was a diplomatic issue this is between nation states guy was not a U.S citizen now I Know he was a green card holder he was a permanent resident a lot of people focus in on that but\nDo you still not a citizen or he held foreign citizenship show why is this\nThe president's situation primarily to handle you know why is this something where the president of the United states is the one guy who is supposed to take definitive action and we do we know the answer the answer is that is because the left wants to play this game of you know Trump is terrible and Trump is a dictator and\nThis other stuff uh and he loves dictators here's Obama's former public relations propaganda czar from inside the White House Ben Rhodes and this is how dirty he's willing to be played a clip five\nWhat we're seeing here Chris this is really the continuation of a profound re alignment of American foreign policy under Donald Trump\nWhere we no longer speak up for democracy and human rights we no longer speak up for a journalist and said we call them the enemy is enemy of the state and we're giving a green light not just to this Saturday regime but ... any regime around the world who wants to harm dissidents harm journalists because the most powerful democracy in the world is no longer on their side\nI think it has with Jared his son in law he's been sort of his vice Roy when it comes to dealing with the Arab world I think he feels that somehow he's in bed with this royal family over there that is a sort of Romanoff phony a family\nAnd their families seem to be locked together Jared yes it is and his crown prince seemed to be in bed together politically\nYeah ... where are we met he\nOh my gosh I don't know why anyone I don't know I didn't listen to that guy just showed desperate to hang on and be relevant he must be good friends with the management MSNBC I don't know why people listen to him I really don't\nKnow among one of the worst analysts on TV or a total I Believe it used to be a conservative to say whatever you have to say to try and be relevant at any point in time\nBut you you had there are two different versions of giant bull crap\nA bull crap coming from Ben Rhodes is that this is Trump's fault that the ... the murder is because Trump calls CNN you know the enemy of the people uh I I hate to break it to you but you know there are journalists there are propaganda apparatus sigh in countries where\nJournalists are the enemy of the people straight up is the north Korean ministry of propaganda the enemy of the north Korean people yes is North Korean state media the enemy of the north Korean people with in order not yes same thing is true in Iran saying there's a lot of countries\nJust being a journalist does not give you some\nMoral superiority which I Know is a shock to all the swamp dwelling journalists around me here in Washington D. C. and they really think that there's ... and they don't want anyone to tell them otherwise\nThe initiative and she always I always get the sense from all these journalists that this is the only profession they could ever even consider having you know that that the notion of showing up to a job and just doing something else to them once they once they tasted a certain level of success in journalism is just oh it's horrifying to them\nWork with the pleads again oh no many of them have never done that by the way\nThey go right out of right out of school right into some J. program somewhere and that's that's the path anyway\nUh this is just idiocy though from roads and then you have this whole conspiracy theory about pushing her and ... where\nThey could get cushion the Saudis are very important strategic player in the middle east right now that's a fact\nWe don't get to ignore that's a fact\nNew administration no administration has ever stood up to the Saudis any meaningful way for running one of the crappy as countries on her despite all of its oil wealth\nNo administration no president including Obama who's battling literally bowing to the Saudis okay so everyone needs to just blow their role and chill out on this\nStop making this about cheap partisan points against Trump that's all they want to do I don't care about this guy to show the they have a little more solidarity with them they would otherwise because he was not even sure he's a columnist\nThe guy was and it is an opinion writer for the now I'm not saying that means that you know anything as sort of happened to him but the way they're talking about him and it's like he's ... you know he he is one of them meanwhile has anybody ever writes that opinion column anywhere somebody that now get special treatment\nIn terms of the media's view of them I can tell you this much if it were a conservative who had been attacked I mean ... an American conservative Web and attack somewhere else in the world you hear a lot less\nOutrage about this just the fact it is just the if if it was someone who are critical of fundamentalist Islam and that was the primary attack that Islam in Saudi Arabia is a destructive oppressive tyrannical force and the Saudis took that guy out that say well\nYou know there's a lot of Islamophobia going on there I mean you know they shouldn't they shouldn't have murdered in but they're you know there's a lot of Islamophobia meanwhile if you've been bring up the cause she'll be was and this is a fact and Islamist meaning he believed in political Islam and was very friendly and cozy with the Muslim Brotherhood\nIs like your trampling on the man's great that's that's just telling the truth he wasn't Islamists nobody he wouldn't\nDeny this if you were alive nobody denies it doesn't mean you should have been brutally murdered oh I I almost left out that he\nAlso a ... they dressed somewhat up as a body double in his clothing after they killed him to try to create footage of leaving so that was the plan they they were going to try to and they must not have known that the fiance was outside because they were going to try and say that he left and that they had no knowledge and ... they were going to disappear and\nThat was the plan to disappear him and they are just really really dumb about it\nLet me give you a little bit of in jail agency inside here in terms of what I what I learned when I was in the CIA about how foreign intelligence often operates there this is a little bit of an inside baseball for you to like that kind of thing\nThere are a lot of countries that are very effective their services are very effective at surveillance and at a certain regimes security issues that that's generally what most intelligence agencies are\nTheir primary concern is ride regime and keeping the people in power in power and stopping any threats against them most countries aren't really worried about foreign invasion most countries are worried about toppling from from the inside um and\nThey get very adept to dealing with that\nThreat but they also often operate in places where they can be really ham fisted I guess that's kind of at the wrong term for Saudi Arabia but you know what I mean they can be clumsy and sloppy and get away with it\nAnd that's what I think happened here the Saudis the Saudi intelligence services the Saudi police state can be selfish in Saudi Arabia and can be thug issue in other Middle Eastern countries where they have a lot of sway\nCan't really be self sufficient turkey and that may have been to miscalculation here they thought that they could get away with\nThis and they're not used to operating on foreign soil where there is also a very by the way sluggish intelligence apparatus apparatus that is at work so a lot of intrigue\nHere we'll be right back\nThere's been a change in the last few months people have started to realize that social media platforms are not a public utility they're not they're just for the free exchange of ideas they are Internet companies but they're also media outlet they are platforms and they make editorial decisions all the time and guess what\nThe big ones out there are making editorial decisions that favor Democrats progressive and the left and they're doing it on a regular basis you know this you heard about the
