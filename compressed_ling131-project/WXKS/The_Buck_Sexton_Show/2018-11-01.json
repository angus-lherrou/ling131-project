issues you have to be willing to when you have to be willing to defend them as as a serious person and not hide behind oh man I just have I just have fake puppets\nCalling into my show beforehand you know it's all just a big joke man that's dishonest and Stuart's done lots of that\nYou know shows all jokes and then he has on a serious guest and if it's a conservative he tries to drill them and if it's a a liberal it's all a joke joke the rights so dumb ha ha and that was what he did I mean he really just\nTook what you already have in mainstream media a step further the mainstream media is an echo chamber for left wing beliefs in ideology and what it does is create a forum and this is whether you read the pages of the New York times or watching CNN we're liberal ideas when\nThat's the whole point that's the whole purpose yes they give you information you know yes there's reporting all others reporting and you know breaking news and all this but the live idea always\nComes out on top and that's the ... well that's what those\nOutlets do to really serve their audiences and have a loyal audience because people want that they want to believe that want to believe that their side is his base winning\nBut the way that the left does it as dishonest they don't say we're labs your idea they say this is just reality this is just the truth and that's why I say that CNN for example launder Z liberalism through a false prism of neutrality\nAnd that's the secret sauce behind with the mainstream media in particular has been doing for a very long time oh no we're not liberal we're just we're just the facts man CNN apple and banana slogan no that's nonsense\nThey should just say yeah we're we're in a package of the DNC we believe in the Democratic party we're going to bring your news but we're going to give it to you for a Democrat perspective that would be honest instead of liars they're liars tapper liar\nBlitzer liar I mean what they're doing is they live on a regular basis Cooper\nAll all I mean Don Lemon and like all other that's a whole other level but\nHe's right about that as George right about the narcissism point and it's so clear and quite honestly I think it's pretty obvious I don't think the steward has come upon some bit of brilliance here yeah the narcissism is what\nThe narcissism is what the\nTrump taps into of because look he understands\nPeople with big egos Trump is a very very big ego with I don't think we have to dance around that Trump is a very typical guy\nHe's also the leader of the free world and pulled off the most incredible election victory that will ever see ever there's there's never going to be anything like that they use all the most unbelievable election of your lifetime I saw of my lifetime that's it there's nothing that's ever going to be like that because even if something else\nIs kinda like in the future will be like well remember that time when Trump did that thing that nobody believed could happen so I think the guy is kind of earn the right to have a bit of a you know you got to earn your ego I think that's an important thing for everyone to remember\nAnd then you know\nBe humble too but that's one part that I don't think we're going to too much from a from Trump but nonetheless he understands people's oversized egos and and this is where the media just really has no they have no response whatsoever there's there's nothing they can come up with as an answer because it's so once you get told the oh yeah that's right\nWhy is everyone else press briefing about Jim Acosta wires every a criticism of CNN by the president of a threat to our democracy\nBecause these people have really over inflated senses of their importance let me tell you this and you know you hear this from me all the time I\nAm lucky to be in this business and I'm Better at this than\nA vast majority of people were in the business and I don't say that to be a modest and just being object and being

to do this but I I have no expectation that oh well you know I'm American books\nSexton or else of course not right that's that's just that's just silly that's just nonsense but do you say\nThat a lot of these other big journal types that that some of these big outlets they really\nThink oh my gosh without us talk of the republic style him probably be better off that's the real power that's why when Trump calls him out that's when they get so upset\nBecause again they probably would be a you know easier without some of these outlets out there I think some of them do act in\nBad faith and do spread misinformation and propaganda and and don't have a good ethos and an artful of honest people and I mean some of the big the biggest players in the space but it's it's such an important thing you should always feel like anyone that you see in in media anyone in journalism especially on the TV side of things\nThey should feel blessed and lucky and be always exuding a sense of\nSanctions and gratitude to the audience that gives them their job and the moment that they lose sight of that you know that that then\nTurn into one of these overpaid CNN cry babies you know the moment they lose that that then you start getting this mentality you see what you know the the Acosta effect of\nLike oh I'm just I I Want to ask policy questions but first I Want to ask like what the president hurts my feelings and like let me just to the story about me\nThat that's the ... the Achilles' heel of the media Trump knows it and he keeps going after it and he should and that's why he keeps winning

having me buck\nOr when the first to start a ... I Know you spoke at American University so you went into the campus gauntlet recently and had to deal with all all that craziness and there was even a little bit of backlash after you spoke about before we get to that just told me a little bit about some of the the hateful rhetoric that's used against Trump in your piece\nDefinitely so I decided to take a look into this because the media has of course\nAnd blaming Trump's rhetoric for the recent on scores of hate crimes including the hype on such a democratic officials and then on the anti Semitic attack on a synagogue and Pittsburgh\nAnd I thought to myself I've been covering the media for about a year and a half now and I can let ten things off the top of my head that they've set about Trump better just hateful and in some cases even violence so on this list you'll find things like\nUh Nicole walls and MSNBC saying that she wants to ring White House press secretary Sarah Sanders his neck you\nHad a CNN gas or just yesterday saying that she believes Trump has I'm radicalized more people than ISIS which is a literal terror group that has a hundred thousand members uh and just the list goes on and on Rick Wilson threatened to got a panelist on CNN like a fish\nSo my plea to the needy as if you're going to blame that Trump's rhetoric for insight that they need to take a look in the near and think about the things that you're saying is well\nIt is an amazing phenomenon to have seen the last couple of weeks and we've been talking about it a lot on the show\nThat there's a there's kind of a refrain of dealing when it comes to the media that you know they basically just saying that conservatives hey evil fascist races terrorists why don't we all just stop using mean words\nThat's exactly right they they are not London I think it was a perfect example of how the media talks about the other side I'm On Monday Night on his show he urged not to demonize people\nAnd then immediately demonize people saying that white people are responsible for terrorism in this country in the literal same breath\nSo these people they talk about respecting the other side and rationing down discourse and being respectful but they're often the worst offenders\nKnow told me about your foray into a into a campus speech here in the swamp area recently it go through that quite a bit of bugs\nYeah it got pretty sloppy so I spoke at American University\nAnd I was talking about due process on specifically in the air as need to and of course the cabin on hearing that took place several weeks ago\nOr he was accused of gang rape of all things and as soon as the event with a noun probably within thirty minutes to an hour students started posting on social media about how they were going to try to shut down the beach they had a plan they face\nTo physically I themselves from what I was going to stay on and then after the event that group that invited me young Americans for elaborate actually denounced my talk altogether\nAnd said that I was being inflammatory by defending the content of my faith in talking about it on social media\nSo all around this was just another example of how college campuses nowadays\nUm have no interest in listening to opposing viewpoints on and when they do have to listen to opposing points they haven't knelt down and act like children and colleges just aren't a place anymore where dissent is a welcomed and where people like to challenge their own views now place where people have to be physically shielded from anything they disagree with\nAnd I got to say this is the first time I've heard of the the conservative group kind of back stabbing the conservative who's been invited on campus that that's a bit of a weird wrinkle\n[noise] yeah I certainly was not expecting that is the first I've heard of it as well on and I was definitely disappointed because\nIf these people expect conservative ideas to win out on campus and they have to be willing to defend them and just by nature at twenty to thirty students showing up to protest that they immediately back down in through the under the bus\nVery very weak sauce I got to say [laughter] but yeah I bet conservative called\nYeah expected jurors I haven't been back with especially on campus about this stuff because a vote and I guess they wanted to get invited to the stigma signify party or something and it can be ... everywhere else working on this week it goes and your sides obviously the election but what else are we going to be seen you write about at the core", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Buck Sexton Show", "city": "Newton", "day": "01"}
