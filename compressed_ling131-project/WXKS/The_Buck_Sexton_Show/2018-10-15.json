or the other I'm not sure which I'm going to go with that keeps happening today but she released the information from her her test today\nRight or she has decided to let the world know that her long scrutinized and uh many would say the bong\nNative American heritage\nIs now back in the headlines because the analysis reported on by the Boston Globe where the quote vast majority of warns family tree has European is it says that she has a date of American ancestry code in the range of six to ten general [laughter]\nSix to ten generations ago so this is a really a non scientific\nBackground and heritage analysis of of Elizabeth Warren but six to ten generations ago that would mean she is getting ready for it between one sixty fourth and one one thousand and twenty four\nNative American and the Boston Globe initially did the math\nWrong on that one uh so I'm I'm\nTo to to fact check the Boston Globe's math among among many other things that we have to look at here\nAnd this was this was a truly\nJaw dropping moment today this this whole phenomenon because\nThis was not some analysis that was released against Elizabeth Warren's will this wasn't a some surprise that a competing campaign or somebody else a decided to drop and make it difficult for her to get elected\nTo the contrary Elizabeth Warren\nTook the position that this would bolster her claim I don't know which is worse here\nUh that Elizabeth Warren is show delusional she thinks that this proves her case or so tone deaf as the as to think that this will stop\nContinue mockery of her for racial fraud\nI mean the hill where I work in response to this ... wrote that Elizabeth Warren DNA test shows quote strong evidence of Native American ancestry but the the real headline here if I may finally be civil\nIs that there's strong evidence that she may have had a Native American ancestor a couple of hundred years ago and since then it has been one long on on on interrupted line of white people\nIn fact if you look at the percentage that Elizabeth Warren is likely Native American compared to the general white American population she is less than average\nIn her connection to the Native American population meaning you and to me listening is if you happen to be white and an American and a lot of you or not but if you have any weight an American\nIs likely you are more Native American that Elizabeth Warren\nAnd yet here we are\nHere we are she she must have thought that this was going to\nUh give her some degree of of credibility I I don't know what she's thinking I mean ten generations ago there's no realistically there's no way to know if even the ten generations ago if this is accurate and then when you when you look at the Boston Globe analysis\nAnd you start to read some of this you realize that this is all it's all kinda hazy and nonsense anyway\nQuote the this is from the Boston Globe ... the analysis of orange DNA done by Carlos Bustamante who's a professor at Stanford a really he tracks DNA Analysis via population migration\nHe quote concluded that the vast majority of war and ancestry is European but the result strongest support the existence of an on ad mix a Native American ancestor\nA six to ten generations ago\nUm fish folks if Elizabeth Warren what this tells any normal rational person\nIs that if Elizabeth Warren is in fact able to call herself Native American\nLiterally any white person in the country could credibly claim to be Native American for professional purposes for the purposes of advancing oneself and therefore it would no longer even matter if you call yourself\nNative American it would no longer make any difference if you consider yourself to be in America's everybody's every but we're all Native American by their standard\nDisease completely nuts it's just\nCompletely nuts and the fact that Trump was able to get so in her head by calling her Pocahontas as we know he does time and time again the fact that Trump has managed to to force this incredible uh on for stare on on her part\nIs just astonishing really is this is somebody that is getting\nIn the top four or five of early support from the Democrats for running for president and most of the polls that I've seen in fact as being CNN pull out where I think she came in for third or fourth place um and and\nWhen you look at this analysis when you look at what's going on here uh eat is\nAmazing to me that that anybody could read this and this is what's so crazy folks people in the media took this as evidence that she was right [laughter]\nI mean she's she's like one one thousand Native American maybe and it's not even really Native American it's based on population migration from South of the border into the United states\nSo she doesn't even ... it's not even clear that that this one one thousand or one sixty fourth or whatever it is is truly from a Native American tribes\nYet people in the media were saying sushi proved it Trump is wrong Trump needs to pay up now\nWhat what\nAre they had desperate I think there's a little panic right now on the left because they realize oh my gosh Elizabeth Warren\nHas completely clown herself here I mean it just made a complete mess of things and so there that the media has to go even further and they have to somehow pretend like yeah that's right you\nProve things that's crazy she didn't prove anything and everyone knows it but what what else are they going to do I mean this\nIs a this is telling us that that that pigs are flying folks I mean this is complete detachment from reality by the lips\nEighties bonkers\nAnd on this notion even that that she has any Native American ancestry let me just give you this is from his post a this analysis and in the Boston Globe quote detecting DNA for Native Americans is particularly tricky because there was an absence of Native American DNA available for comparison\nThis is in part because Native American leaders have asked tribal members not to participate in genetic databases\nTo make up for the ... a dearth of Native American DNA bustamante guy during this analysis use samples from Mexico Peru and Columbia just stand in for Native American\nThat's because scientists believe that the groups Americans referred to as Native Americans came to this land via the bearing straight about twelve thousand years ago and sold them what's now America but also Margaret further south\nHis report explained the use of reference populations genetic material has been sequenced for was designed for ... accuracy\nOr so folks he's using South American DNA on this theory that oh well because they all across the Bering Strait\nI mean this is crazy this is crazy he's not even using native\nAmerican DNA to look for DNA that crosses over with with Elizabeth Warren's background out I I there there's more here there's more here there's more in the in the why it matters and are you hearing all these pathetic justifications about uh lives with

Warren decided that the best thing for her to do would be to actually create some kind of a a little propaganda film for herself where she would have different members of her family and they're different people all involved in this and I\nFeel I feel like there should be some degree of\nOf embarrassment here\nOr there should be some oh my gosh what am I doing but then again when you when you look at what's really happening on ... across the board right now with with the media and with the effort to take down Trump anything is acceptable as long as it is for\nThe cause I mean anything is going to be considered okay here as long as it is a evidence or ... useful in the anti Trump cause I just\nI I've reached that kind of a new a new level here at a new degree of understanding of just where the media is taking all the shopping and what they're willing to do and what they're willing to put the American people through a in terms of\nPropaganda and and the whys and there's no worse than could have read that Boston Globe report today\nAnd come away from it with anything other than wow that is a massive mistake that Warren has made here and she's clearly not Native American she never should have claimed to be Native American there's nothing about her that justifies this notion of Being American\nAnd yet you know all I see right now on the on the front page of CNN here's a perfect\nSee nothing in their main headlines is all about the Saudi guy got which we'll talk more about your market show you later but nothing about that you go down one two three four five six seven eight eight stories down the CNN front page right now and you get quote warns DNA never met her the Trump\nOr how\nIs this Trump's fault in one world is this is the takeaway here that Trump isn't a you know accepting her DNA results or something these people are insane they really are\nI ... it's just impossible for them to be a ... embarrassed here's another eat another version Huffington Post trunk denies this is their top\nStory about this Trump denies making charity pledged tied to Elizabeth Warren DNA test Trump shed and was it was very specific Trump said that if she made it through\nThe primaries and is the Democrat and now the knee and then and then she proves that she as Native American heritage in that case will get a million dollars for favorite charity so that's what he said okay he denies what they're saying he said which is he would just give her a million dollars if you Bruce you Native American\nAnd not even is not the point because\nIf she Native American everybody's Native American\nAnd anyone who's trying to be honest anybody who's looking at this from the perspective of I Would like to really present the facts and and get to the truth here would automatically understand I vicious just pathetic it is\nAbsolute nonsense that I'm seeing here from all these different all these different sources the way that they're covering this I mean they're they're trying so hard to actually cover is the right word because they're really covering for Warren\nAnd this is because what they think happened today is uh that would they thing happened today is that she's no longer really going to be a serious contender for twenty twenty this is laughable she's a clown she's a joke\nShe was a joke she should be at least\nHere's ABC News which is supposed to be unbiased Elizabeth Warren releases DNA results on Native American ancestry a Trump says quote who cares that's their headline\nThat the headline to see this is a perfect case of media bias at work they think that they're progressive great hope for twenty twenty is in jeopardy right now because of her own just bone headed stupidity I mean this is just on cinco de dum on think of lead them\nAnd they're going to do whatever they can to try and and lessen the damaged or they're going to try to keep her brand keep her hopes for twenty twenty going\nAntifa are you guys are antifa right I used to be a big thing they used to get a lot of media attention at least conservative media would sometimes talk about the left doesn't seem to want to talk about them that was some audio and we play for you or do the latest\nAnd the incidence out on the uh\nI don't do it as well as Trump Trump's anti ... better than mine do for a but I don't do it as well as he does\nOut on the west coast in Portland\nWhich it strikes me as a strange place for that it'd be quite so much\nPolitical extremism but but that's I suppose it is what it is right that is going on there\nUm but and you got these people with with cheaper group that were squaring off against some I think it's called the group for patriots in prayer or something I I forget exactly even what the what the group was called um let me do a quick refresher on that one but you are you sure enough you had\nYou had this uh this violent\nIncident where your protesters and counter protesters your ego bears spray\nAnd bloody brawls at patriot yeah patriot prayer law and order march\nIn Portland you have to be very careful my friends when you see the way that these kinds of stories are covered you have to pay really really close attention because there's a lot of a political\nHedging that goes on there's a lot of usage of kind of weasel words\nAnd what they leave in what they take out these descriptions for example\nJust because the ACLU and by the way I Know nothing about this patriot prayer groups I Can't keep up with all the other group it's called patriot prayer and has a lot of American flags sounds cool to me but I don't know that could be wackos I've no idea there too many of these\nAre little you know local political\nGroups for me to know every single one of them but I just would I Would caution you all at the ACLU is not a reliable source at all\nOr I'm Sorry peace deal you Southern Poverty law that the truth of the ACLU as well so yes you keep that keep that in\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center is not a reliable source when it comes to deciding who is a a a political extremist or a right wing extremist a white nationalist any any of those things you cannot\nTrust the Southern Poverty Law Center it has become a massive\nFundraising organization and a left wing really a left wing hate group and a lot of cases\nIn any group that has to pay ... multimillion dollar settlement too much it was\nA for being an anti Muslim extremist when he's a Muslim is a group that you probably want to take with a grain of salt whenever it comes to these uh these different demonstrations in and how they're reporting on who's there and what's going on so that that's one part of it but then there's the other which is just\nThis idea that either the normal thing to want to show up and do these counter protests and they call them counter protests but when people show up to a demonstration right and they're all wearing black\nAnd they have gas masks and shields and and and homemade weapons they're not showing up because they want to engage in a battle of ideas they want to engage in a battle\nThey want to fight people and the fact that they showed up with their spray and these other things tells you all that you need to know um but I just think it's so interesting which media outlets will and will not covered this makes for really compelling footage\nDishes a story that you'd think they'd want to tell you how are almost entirely white by the way antifa radicals who are attacking this this patriot\nPrayer group over there they're called the law and order group rather they weren't a march for law and order I I've got an I've got to wonder\nIs is that just stay is that a euphemism are they actually white nationals I I mean I have no idea and I know that I Can't trust 'em I I Can't trust the media to produce honest assessments of this and tell us what really happened for a job\nIt's just that they accept that there are counterprotesters and that you know the kind of approach is just like showed up and like they didn't want any problems man but you know there were problems\nWell maybe it's because they showed up in the whole purpose of their presence was to ignite some kind of a confrontation right\nYou get in the game in ... you know ... you\nKnow they're showing up and they're screaming about fascism and Trump being a Nazi and they want it they want to hit people and they want to attack people and they want to do these little home videos or this because\nThese are radical their political radicals and you know you could argue that the only thing that really separates him from a domestic terrorist organization\nIs that to date ... has put a limit on the degree of their violence where they have not engaged in to my knowledge I might be getting something lethal action against Syria but they have engaged in violent action\nAnd keep in mind that that violent action if you have a very different very different political circumstances that could escalate it could escalate rather rapidly and all of a sudden a group that has\nIssued lethality in the past when it comes with violence may maybe in a position where they feel like that is open to them and in fact that's\nThe path that they take so I I Would just note that that's something that that I Want everyone to be aware of the ... has not been to this point\nA group as engaged in straight up terrorism it used to be that the energy to remind me a lot of anti for uh the anarchists in this country we're the real terrorists I mean that there's this sort of what I mean real terrorists I mean they were the primary terror threat they're the ones who are assassinating presidents trying to blow up a stock exchange\nThat's right it was anarchist not Islamic radicals\nThere was another incident by the way I I Know I Would get hit if I didn't bring this went up there was another incident on\nA friday in New York City actually right in the neighborhood I think where I grew up in fact when I looked at the videos I could tell even the videos didn't show you much what street I think they were on when they had this fight a there was this this group that the Proud Boys\nAnd I've never really understood ...\nWho they are or what what they are I I heard that they have they have some I should actually probably just call Gavin McGinnis and ask\nHim and the metropolitan Republican\nClub invited the Proud Boys are which is called it quote right wing fraternal organization in this in this one piece from reading and there\nWere two or three counter protesters that were beat up now\nI don't know I wasn't there and I haven't seen much I've only seen a little bit of footage but were these counter protesters who were just there to have a discussion I I think if you show up ... if you think that these are right wing radicals which obviously the counterprotesters do and you show up at one of their events\nAre are you planning to antagonize them and try to incite a confrontation or you really just want to share your thoughts do they think that they're going to scare the proud\nBoys I mean this is\nThis area that's question what are they really doing that

credit for Iraq well if he gets all his credit for Iraq we also have to look and see the situation in Afghanistan and understand that he's not ... was not this\nUh men beyond reproach when it came to his ... certainly not beyond approach period but also when it came to his record\nSo that's my that's my thing I Need to do a little more I Need you a little more analysis\nOf what's going on here with or without ... that caught me off guard because I've heard so much positive stuff about matters for so long\nAnd maybe he just rub the present the wrong way recently and he just wanted to call him a Democrat I also they've kind of funny that the president uses calling somebody a Democrat as kind of a a little sly or you know\n... you know as ed guys kind of a Democrat yeah it's like when I say in my in my media life my guys okay it's kind of a communist\nSo Trump's as a kind of a Democrat he also says you know that\nTrump said that he does not trust everybody in the White House and this is this falls into that category of oh my gosh the palace intrigue here you know we we we need to\nWe need to make sure that we run all these stories about Trump can't trust the people around him and there's all this stuff about how Trump is you know\nUnable to manage and he's bringing in all these people that don't have\nThe right requirements and backgrounds and skills and everything else they love these White House dysfunction stories and anything that plays into that we tend to hear a lot about a so then I take a step back then I say hold on a minute given what we know about\nAll the different leagues and all the people that are in the White House including\nRepublicans who are holdovers from the Bush I shouldn't say from the Bush administration but from the Bush era of the Republican Party people that are not on board with Trump at all we know that there's somebody right now who roads if you if you believe in New York Times and I don't take that for granted\nBut if you believe in New York Times there is a senior White house administration official right now who wrote an op ed effectively saying that we're working against the commander in chief behind the scenes to for his decision making to act like he's not really the president\nAnd to go to these if you go to these extreme lengths because we know what's best for the country we will undermine the express will the American people through their elections because we know better\nAnd that's really the position that's really what they're that that's really what they're they're saying about that and this guy wrote this editorial we never found by the way the uh non editorial as we never found out of this guy was\nThe anonymous editorial writer but then of course Trump of course Trump shouldn't trust everybody is White House of course the ... to do that and that's also a I give him more leeway than I Would then other circumstances and maybe you can say that's a little bit of you know self justifying here are that's\nConvenient not self justifying ah but I understand why he wants to have family members around because he feels like at least he can trust them\nAnd if you're a Trump and you've seen what's going on with a lot of not just the opposition but the people that are ostensibly supposed to be on your side of the fence people who are ... opposed to be Republicans helping you out you know your your battle buddies so to speak and how many of them have become turn coats on it\nHow many Republicans have we seen including people with some\nPretty decent recognition within party circles I mean you talk about like Bill Kristol the Weekly Standard and conservatives right wing or whatever you want to call them that have openly said yeah I'm actually just not even opposing trumpeting Moore I'm a Democrat in that kind of an environment which is the environment President Trump is in\nI think it would be insane\nFor the President's Day yeah trust everybody in the White House of course he doesn't trust ever in the White House this reminds me of some of the politicians that I've I've been able to interview in the last few months and\nI Love when they do the you know OK off the record and I'm like you're not telling me things really are some of them you know that something you know to me it's really off the record what they're doing is saying off the record to create the facade\nOf you know I'm really giving you some access and inside here and I'm trying to build this report\nAnd then they say things that if I were to violate off the record which I never would but if I were to violate off the record it would make them look even better you know they're like\nOff the record I volunteered at a soup kitchen last weekend and save some puppies from a burning building like is that really does that does that really has to be off the record senator so and so\nI guess so ah and then you know the the one that really contentious exchange the really contentious exchange that Trump had here with\nLeslie stall in this interview uh had to do with immigration because I think that is the one area where the left and the the media allies that they have have felt like they've been in the strongest position\nA since the summer to just just pound Trump on this and what I think it's so so fascinating here is that uh you know still the same thing they always do well it's your policy\nIt's your policy to separate parents from children the border you did it it's on you it's your fault and Trump says but now it's the law\nAnd I don't think that they even I don't think he's media critics even really understand that\nTo say that it's the law is to say that it's actually the Congress\nThat does bear some of if not the lion's share of the responsibility for this whole situation that that that that the Congress is either a napped or cowardly or for whatever reason just unwilling to do what they're supposed to do in these circumstances\nWhich is to find a way to adjust a law\nThat it's a bad law or to repeal it entirely\nIsn't really the president's role I mean this is how much damage I think Obama did to the rule of law as a concept it became normal during the Obama administration\nFor him when he felt frustrated with Congress ... ... ... I don't like the letter what am I sorry\nOr he would go around them and do this whole executive order routine which was an abuse of executive orders because what he was just doing was usurping the legislative branches authority and pretending the laws were what he wanted them to be and saying well it's just about enforcement is not just about enforcement when you don't enforce something at all\nIt's not just about enforcement when you exempt an entire class of people that are explicitly not exempted by\nCongress and I think that's\nPart of this that just immediately that the\nThe press puts aside pushes aside and they really assume I mean they really thought that they would uh they would be in a place where\nTrump and the Republicans would just get hammered on immigration they would be\nOr they would be just crushed because of what had been going on at the border and I think that they miscalculated that for a lot of Americans enough is enough they don't really want to keep being told\nThat you know immigrants or do jobs or what time it illegals now folks not immigrants illegal immigrants do the jobs Americans won't do that illegal immigrants are nothing but a net positive for the economy\nAnd they would like to have some re\nEstablishment of the rule of law when it comes to the border and I know that Trump has and build the wall yet and there's a lot of stuff that remains a remains to be done and I have a lot of of concerns or whether it will even happen especially if the Democrats take the house\nBut on this on this issue of the border you can tell lovely so she just wants to oh the parents being separated from their children happened under Obama it's a law that still on the books\nIt was all all when Obama was an office and oh by the way the people that were getting separated from the children the border were overwhelmingly explicitly trying to break US law they were being picked up after crossing illegally then claiming asylum\nIt's where robots or

because when it comes to the place we're never saw\nSomething really terrible and disgusting about that if that were the case so we're going to have to say we're going to get to the bottom of it and it will be severe punishment\nWhat happens you journalist Jim all showed the\nEntire world seems absolutely sat on trying to get an answer to that question what what what happened to this man how how was it that\nHe was able to uh disappear from the Turkish consulate in in in ... were there for me it constantly Saudi consulate in Istanbul\nAnd now we have this very real looming international relations crisis on our hands or how did we how did we get to this point how do we find ourselves in a situation where we have to deal with this you know the the president has raised the possibility of rogue killers\nBecause the president's I'm sure he said that he spoke to a king Solomon behind the scenes keep in mind the king of Saudi Arabia is a pretty\nUh what's the word in for old men at

we do know we can't we can't have the Saudis funding trips for us anymore\nAnd and there's there's the reality of what their soldiers of Saudi Arabia which is interesting and I don't get to that [noise] um and there's also the pending probably will be the case at some point when you watch the ... when you listen and I'll watch when you listen to the show I Will have confirmation of it but as of right now it sounds like\nLike they are planning to say that this was a rogue elements within the Saudi Government that's the latest reporting here\nAnd the plan is for the Saudi Government to throw some intelligence official under the bus\nI've also seen early reports that it may be a maybe the Saudi government's position that an intelligence official decided to interrogate and it went over the line um but the Saudis can hide anymore that this guy was killed was killed in their\nCustody they're calling it quote an interrogation that went wrong that's that's the latest on it so it doesn't really seem like a there's any room for the Saudis to keep the assembling on is that they're they're caught the Saudis are in a jam here I'm as they should be the Saudi regime is\nA terrible and ah and disgusting government but we're not really often told that because they have a tremendous amount of sway even our own media they own a lot of shares a lot of very important media companies\nBut here's what you see the ... and then the payment that's going to happen it's already started to happen because you have this issue of a repressive fatalities Harry in\nMuslim how often you hear about that a Muslim majority nation not just the Muslim majority nation entirely Muslim nation the most Muslim country by percentage I Believe in the world maybe Somalia I mean there are a couple of other countries that are right up there but the Saudis do not allow non Muslims\nTo beep we do citizens of the peninsula I mean the Saudis are did they do not allow Christian worship or

there's all this complexity on the issue but but here's what what's happening right now\nThis is going to quickly become a crisis that ... that is much more about what Trump does for our media than what it really means I'm already hearing you know\nBecause Trump ... up with dictators that's why this happens this is the line you're there's all the time Trump is so is coddled dictators here here's what I Want to say to anybody in response to that cause you'll hear this all over the place the media next few days I don't think it's possible to call dictators\nMore than Obama did I I think it'd be very hard you'd have to work really hard to do so because Obama made some very clear errors in dealing with authoritarians and strongly for one is his word didn't mean anything\nWhen it came to consequences be erasing of the red line in Syria led to a free for all by the Assad regime but also by the Russians that were backing up the Assad regime by the Iranians are sending troops into

full facts and the stories ready to go\nMedia didn't want to cover that you see this is where I I I just I I take a moment because I Want to step back and make sure we all are on the same page when it comes to the narrative of the moment here\nShe the narrative of the moments in the lab is that oh what Bill Clinton did\nThen she would never be able to do now you see it's different because of this me too movement it's different now Bill Clinton's ah what will be called the ... what does it look like to call them his his personal failings very common way of saying Bill Clinton being a predator\n... also but I'll just you know I'm an auto cardio showed a curse word the oval office but all too much much worst up in the oval office you know Bill Clinton's\nThis great ah it's something that the left was not just they didn't just turn a blind eye to eye they aggressively\nAggressively and with all they could muster with all the help they could get in the media and you know people
