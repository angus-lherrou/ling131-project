{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WXKS", "content": "And when you actually crunched the numbers on that you find out that as a as it relates to the proportion in New York City of crimes committed by people who fall into the demographic of black or Hispanic males they were actually stopped bless\nWhen you control for the number of crimes committed by people in different categories less than their share overall but still people say it's bad optics and they say that it looks bad and the and then they they point to the fact that New York is in a crowd it continued downward trajectory on crime part\nIs that reality for America's biggest city has been ongoing for a long time you know this is like showing up in in the in the final\nStages of something and saying well this is this happened because I showed up but it's like it was already happening in the ... he was already happening\nThe only point I think that's very fair to make on this is that conservative a lot of them did say to get rid of stop and frisk there'll be a big spike in crime and we haven't seen that in New York City okay so that's a little bit of the background on stopping for Trump is saying let's just stop and frisk in Chicago\nAt ACLU types at all and they freak out of a stop and frisk but here's the thing about doing stop and frisk in Chicago nobody\nHas any ideas for how to make Chicago a\nLess crime ridden place I mean that's the number of shootings people think if a ... and I looked at it obviously is going to get the most headlines because\nWhen you have a weekend in Chicago with twelve people killed or you know more than that in some way to get whatever it is I mean they've had these these weekends with forty fifty people shot you look at the numbers shot it in a low it's in a low thousands in Chicago all and people getting shot or stab than any given year\nThat's a lot of people\nThat are getting shot no one has any solutions or any ideas for this all I hear from lives and I get to talk to them when they come on on the hill TV show\nOh you're from lives is we need to invest more in schools I'm like yeah 'cause that's why the gang bangers selling drugs it it's it's because there's not enough investment a local public school and come on this isn't serious but they they have no idea is no solutions for whatsoever and what you find is that\nYou know they don't want to talk about real structural change like why do we\nAll the studies show that the the biggest single terminal whether a neighborhood if you know how many single parents are are in a neighborhood statistically speaking you have a very good sense of what the crime rate will be\nAnd that when you control for intact household meaning you know a a mother and father both in the household the crime rate is essentially the same across all\nAh all all cultures and all I think back roads\nSo you can't have the structural conversation about why this balance the place of Chicago you can't talk about more aggressive policing and say that's racist and at the end of the day this is where you see one of these liberal policies that they think they're being do good or is there protecting the civil rights of minorities\nBut you're just getting out of having more people getting shot and they have no answers to it and that that Sharpton he's running around\nAnd demagogue ing well this sharp as what he does struggling runs around and and demagogues on things but that that he's willing to do it on this issue with so little pushback from any one of the media just goes to show you that\nSome of these old paradigms just ... just don't go away you know liberals would prefer to call Republicans racist and as sharp and to to say their dog whistling then to seriously consider proposals that would save lives and this was that\nThere was a breaking point in New York you know Giuliani came in\nYou know a number ... ... numbers based policing a concert that\nAll that was done and the liberals were howling and shrieking or that too but then they realize oh you mean the city is going to be a lot safer I Hope the same thing can happen for Chicago\nI Hope they met as you get this violence situation

taxing down as a university\nBased on the average rate annual rate of growth of these in dominance over the last Fifteen Years they can afford this tax do everything they do today and their dominance will still grow\nManage to hold onto their majorities will see governors races by the way geo piece looking pretty good there too\nSo despite all the things you hear right now I I think that we should just remember not only does history show us that this stuff can be wrong I must say it will be 'cause I don't believe anybody can predict the future is you know I'm very consistent with that I think that you can\nYou can have some fun with your speculation on prognostications especially as a political pundit because no one ever\nYou get your losers producer Mike it's like the secret of being a good stock broker just got to make sure you focus on your winters meant if you're right fifty percent of the time but you're really charming guy who tells everybody about all your winters very successful stockbroker one remembers all losers they don't pay enough attention\nSo in politics than the there's got to make you make a few bold predictions you get one or two of them right and all of a sudden you are the sheer of all things political\nOr the fact that by the way uh you got the Senate race in New Jersey we Menendez the fact that that's even competitive I Know it's Jersey and I know you're a Jersey resident producer Mike\nI Know you're you're you're a you're a sophisticated Jersey fellow by the way John we liked the Mike beer do eat the my beard is good you guys got a real got some real facial hair going on now\nEverybody loves it except the parents\nWhat is it with parents not like not aware of you know what it is you're their little their little my you know you're always little Mike yeah so you know they they think of you as being the same thing with me my parents don't like facial hair I mean either\nSent my parents' picture last night I was out some friends in the Senate pictures you know shown where I was and get their responses went from one for that [laughter] they're both\nLike what's the what's going on my mom's like I said I'll send you a raise or how they are\nYeah but this is the stuff that I'm going to call them is in the office so I'm keeping it and ... and the officer all fence and they think the beer\nThat can be very very distinguished like but you know it's a generational thing two beers or in right now yeah you go back to the seventies and everybody had the uh the the airline pilots stash\nWider airline pilots they'll keep just stash never got an answer to this though whenever they have some kind of an airline related incident and all of a sudden you get these former pilots on TV they they all have the stash Kelly ... the ... they've all got this all these stash which you know hey look they pull it off I I give them credit for it but are this generation right now of\nPeople that are thirties forties lot lot of beers lot facial hair a lot of tattoos also\nI remember when you add tattoos if you were a biker or sailor and now everybody's got that too I just came back from Vegas you can't you go down by the pool and it's like a catch ... for for 'em or would I mean it's it's like a museum of tattoos when you're out there everywhere and all over the place to look\nI mean I'm fine with it I'm just I don't have any I don't know\nNine out of ten of people that I've talked to that to regret at least one of them or something about it I always get that view\nUm no I get ... everyone I Know that series is is pretty much\nAll it'll really yeah I I don't know anybody unless they've got the full ... leave them wrong on\nRoads down and painful yeah there you go Mike and they're going to take the are they going to hold the house what do you think Republicans I got a shot\nAbsolutely and when I like it absolutely you're that you hear that producer John ... as you know buck is to shape public opinion yes and in a way off and as\nWe get closer it gets more realistic or the pollsters don't look like fools and they're\nGoing to win the same thing over as was two years ago\nI I certainly hope so because if nothing else just dealing with the liberal reaction to having Trump with a majority in the house and the Senate and going for that's going to be amazing\nWhat ... what do they tell themselves what I tell themselves then but what do they say\nIf Trump is president for two years and he and his party stays in power\nMaybe the lips have some a spleen into do\nYou ever find yourself watching at the weak

[noise]\nHe's holding the line for America bugs accent is back\nForget that a little while ago I wrote a story\nAbout how woman tried to bring an emotional support peacock\nOn an airplane with her and I thought you know as crazy as that is at least give her points for creativity because you yeah you can obviously bring your emotional support elephant on the plane too big not off like a lot of leg room but could you bring a peacock theoretically on a plane with UPS you could\nNow people are starting to crack down on this and and I got to say that there is a I've got mixed emotions about it\nThere was a woman who tried to get on a flight from frontier airlines in Orlando, Florida\nOr just a few days ago and she held this flight up for two hours you know why John she wanted to bring on her emotional support squirrel\nAnd sure enough they had a problem with that because there is a policy that frontier airlines does not allow rooted aboard flight so they they are anti wrote in at frontier airlines little harsh harsh\nBut I've got to say if you're trying\nTo expand your your horizons for what could be a ... a good pet turns out that I Know that rats believe it or not and it's just really this is weird for some folks rats are pretty smart and can make good pets\nWhich when you see them in the subway to do here in New York City you think to yourself why would anybody ever want to have one of those they look terrifying to carry all kinds of diseases\nBut if you keep rats clean they are pretty smart and can make affectionate pets so I Would think a score it would be in the same category so that she does a part of me John it's like hey maybe she's got a really close bond\nWith this world maybe this world is very meaningful to her and you can't separate a person from their emotional support squirrel\nThen there's the other side of me that had to wait for hours and hours just last week for Southwest Airlines flight that was delayed John it was supposed to take off as a one hour flight from Las Vegas to San Diego\nAnd it was going to take off at eight thirty in the morning do you know when that flight actually took off seven pm at night almost eight twelve hour days\nPlay for not for weather weather as weather right that's that's a\nThat's got deciding that you're going to have a bad day or no for mechanical issues and I can tell you that I lose patients very quickly when I'm In that airport lab not lounge airport area\nYou know the little chairs they set up at all face each other it's kinda creepy sit there you have to look at somebody else you tend not to be staring at them but you're staring at them and they don't want you to obviously you don't want to lose your temper\nUm but what can you do there's not much you can do show on the one hand I feel like emotional support squirrel I'm sympathetic on the other hand I feel like\nIf I were there and I was told that somebody was holding up my flight for a couple of hours so that they could have their emotional support squirrel handy or I might make some squirrel could Bob I might just lose it\nAnd I bet squirrels probably not a particularly tasty meat but I Would figure I'd find out one way or the other that squirrel that emotional supports world probably be toast and I'm going to get all the hate bell for Peter now but we eat we eat out all kinds of animals you know I\nObviously cow and paying pigs are smart I've actually hung out with pet pigs before well micro pigs are kind of a fun thing ... why do we draw the line John at squirrels why do we discriminate against emotional support squirrels\nBut we think that catch somehow or the superior species I don't have an answer for you the\nTruth is you give me the choice between the pets growing pet cat I don't know squirrels much more portable or they are good at\nHoarding their own food you know they bury the little acorn and stuff there there's a lot to recommend squirrel anyway have you know the emotional support animal scam is looks like it's come and do it and I have friends who have gone through the whole process of getting a little best for their dog did you get an emotional support best or that's what it says a service dog\nYou have to be allowed in everywhere with service dog because of people who have\nReal issues that the service dog is addressing now there's been a little bit of a of an explosion of people that say that whatever their dog like they have a service Chihuahua and they put a little ... it'll say\nService dog when really they just mean it serves there need to have their pooch with them at all times that's not really what they're going for service dogs\nSo emotional support squirrel held this thing up for a couple of hours people were obviously very upset about it they did it scored her off this this plane um and uh the the ... she got into a little bit of a little bit of trouble with this but you know I think your producer Mike\nGun owner and believe in our Second Amendment rights to

she wants to propagandize for Democrats she's totally free to do that\nBut just say that ... has set back\nUh I I guess when she says set us back I wouldn't want to put words in her mouth but I'm assuming she means the black community\nSet us back a hundred and fifty five years well this one does the math on that it seems a lot she's making a pretty pointed reference there and how is that what a reasonable rational person would say here you have\nA world famous black millionaire in the oval office\nEmbracing the president of the literally embracing I'm giving him a hug\nAnd sharing ideas with them and sharing lunch with him this is the leader of the free world this is a man talking about Trump now Tanya probably thinks he's the leader of the free world among other things among being a deity ah but ...\nThere's no ... there's no way\nAny ... normal human being could look at this and so yeah that's degrading for any group of people never mind for black Americans I mean this is just the oval office and I think that the way they get to this is is twofold wanted a they hate Trump so much that they're blinded with rage about him all the time but also\nThey don't really accept the Trump is the president they they have\nThis is this is true about the less now and it explains a lot explains a lot of their mob mentality and the mob actions and the way that they've been willing to cast aside basic decency and decorum and to justify this behavior to themselves and to others in the media and\nIt's because they don't really think that he's the president they think that he is a fraud\nOr he is a ... an interlopers he's a pretend or to the throne if you will and so he doesn't deserve any of the respect that one would give president he doesn't deserve any of the deference to the office if not to the man himself\nAnd so if that where your perspective if you were that\nDo looted with with rage uh not disconnected from the truth then I could see how maybe you'd feel that ... hugging this man that they think is such a fraud in the oval office and having this very warm report\nIs demeaning but to any normal person that's just ... it's just crazy that is the most accurate way\nTo describe it and there were some meltdown today there were some meltdowns that were incredible I mean ethic\nMeltdowns where is that John do we have that MSNB ... oh my God\nVal she and ... and

oh it's not a legal process it's whatever we say it is and it's\nIt's all about what we can convince people to do because it's it's really just a battle of rumors right it's just what people say things there's no evidence there is no there's nothing to do is we can't we're not going to subpoena any evidence from these people\nIt was all meant to create a parallel process to the legal process that the less control now impeachment is in fact a parallel\nProcess to the legal process that the left can control if they take the house\nAnd that's what they are gearing up for\nSo whenever we tried to have the argument that\nTrump was not found guilty when it comes to Russia collusion of anything they're going to say it doesn't matter this isn't a criminal trial Trump is guilty of malfeasance of high crimes and misdemeanors while in office\nA which is essentially whatever the house of representatives decides he is guilty of\nNow they can't remove him from office but the biggest feather in their cat they think going into the twenty twenty election is going to be that President Trump was impeached by the President Trump visited impeach president we have to remove him get rid of the corruption\nGet rid of the uh you know the racism and massage any and sexism and all that stuff that's going on because of Trump's they say\nAnd that's a way to the left to avoid the fact that they don't have compelling arguments on policy matters they can't meet us on the battlefield of ideas when it comes to policy so what they do is turn this into\nA battle of reputational or a reputational fight or somebody's\nYou know the the perception of whether someone is racist or not or perception whether someone's a massage or not and just oh he's eighty don't vote for him he's icky which is really what they want to convince everybody got Trump all along but there there's a development and his whole Russia I think today or this is what made me think of this\nThat a lawyer for one

that this is where people will say based on their politics well if you take the fifth you must be guilty that's not fair to visit a procedural protection\nAnd there are times when I assure you there will be people that you and I are much more favorably disposed toward\nWho would take the fifth and we would say that's absolutely the right thing to do so it's not just that he's taking the fifth but it's that there is such a clear pattern in general of people who are tied to the da da ... who were early on big advocates\nOf the whole Russia collusion theory with regard to Trump and the election\nWho want to make sure that that the information does not get out they don't want to testify they don't want subpoenas to be declassified they don't want the release of the ... information they don't want the full scope even of Mueller's probe\nTo become public well when that the situation I think you do have to ask yourself what the heck is going on here you never see a greater

and smeared\nThey're the ones they're the ones who want more information out there they're the ones who want us to be able to get the facts and get the truth so I just would note that they are back in

going to actually sit in a courtroom\nThat would look really to borrow word from before achy ready for the election so it won't be till after the election let me get more information but the the Democrats are all in a little bit of a of a little bit of a bind here\nBecause they don't want to over promise and and they don't want to make it seem like they're trying to throw this mid term based on all the work that they've already done against Trump\nOr I think it's too obvious for them you know so they're they're laying a little low on the Russia collusion stuff\nAnd ... the primary you know that the primary narrative against Trump is very much personal and I think they go more for the twenty Fifth Amendment lane here than anything else you know they're trying to say that Trump is just unfit for office instead of Trump is a proven puppet but\nI Will keep an eye on this and my colleagues at the hill who have been breaking a lot of these stories are they've got more coming up I

Boston dot [noise]\n\nBack when you know because when it comes to the fight for so long and never saw [noise]\n\nBut it would cost me you know I see these people say oh Trump gets rich being president I'll bet you I've lost billions of dollars it costs me ... is one of my friends are very wealthy friend said you know I'll bet you it cost me two or three million dollars and it's worth every penny of it I don't need the money\nAnd it's worth every penny because I'm doing so much for the country yes it's it's nasty\nIt's a vicious it's incredible the false reporting is so incredible but honestly I'm doing a great job and that's why I have huge crowds these crowds are showing up of I don't do a good job they see the difference\nWhen they pick up to three thousand dollars more from taxes all of a sudden out of nowhere they getting ... thousand dollars ... that's a lot of money to people\nAnd I I think that there are a lot of a lot of people who hate Trump\nAs I've said many times because he is so far a successful president meaning that that they they hate him even more now that it is clear that he's actually up to the task I mean they they can say as much as they want about oh a drop it's one or two at the moment we should get rid of him\nBut they really despise this man because he's been\nAble to do such a strong job in that position now forget about don't say his tone is terrible user races and oh my God you know bring up all this stuff\nThe country and how it functions right now is strong it's going well everything is moving in the I should say everything but in general there was a feeling of optimism about the nation are certainly optimism about the the economy but they they despise dropping I I also think\nThat when we start to value why is that we've had some of the ... there was a couple of Saddam and these are related and and I'm just ...\nThinking out loud on this one but it's something that's been on my mind for a while teams all share with you you know you have these these never Trump or types\nWho have some of them have gone straight up Democrat now they have actually switch teams officially although a lot of them might as well a switch team or that they can say they're not never Trump but for all intents and purposes they are a but why is it that they um\nThey hate this president so much and that there are so many people who come from ... not exclusively government backgrounds\nBut I I think come from backgrounds were they've spent time in government and they're of the system and all the establishment and they have this guy I really do think that they hate him because one she isn't supposed to be able to do this and I can tell you that there's a lot of people in the government\nWho really like to think that they have some magic powers of of thoughts and an organization and management\nOf that other people don't have a right to that once you become a government employee long enough because you become culturally acclimated from being within this bureaucracy to think that there's something that\nYou know you have to be in government to understand government that's that's essentially the the distillation of this point you have to be in government to understand it you know you have to have been a beltway inside or or you've had to had to run for elected office time and time again essentially you've got to be part of the professional\nPolitical class not necessarily a politician but part of the professional political class in order to be competed in these roles and it's just not true\nAnd I think that makes a lot of people who have power in this country a lot of people who are part of the elites and the establishment to feel uncomfortable because they've built their careers and their reputations on the notion that well you know I've you know the the the Gergen effect\nOr worked for for June presidents are Roger every president since advisory more words and you know ... or ... horse and buggy whip through it offers and\nYou know you get these guys who the whole\nTheir whole resume is this long stretch of government work and and different government jobs the idea of being well they must understand they must make better decisions they must know this stuff better than somebody like a Trump who just has existed in the private sector and the real world\nAnd hasn't made this cross over into public service\nAnd I I don't think I'm over stadium when I say that there's a real resentment of this I Am when really aware of it now that I'm In the swamp in DC they really\nDon't like that this president is able to do this because he's not supposed to be able to do this he he brings out Trump brings out and also it but this the insecurity of losers in a way that is very clarifying\nSuch
