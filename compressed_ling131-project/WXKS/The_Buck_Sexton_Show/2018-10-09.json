the yeah you say\nOkay All right now now I Know this is also known as as Columbus Day\nRight okay fine I I Know that people don't like to focus in on this too much because who really cares about Columbus Day and the answer is I don't know not really me I don't even know it it's not even really a holiday like John do you feel like people to even have Columbus Day all\nDay off and my other job so yeah oh I'm Sorry ...\nI I used to their John you're the bad you're you're the rock of Gibraltar a team hot man you were always always there for us yeah you know I I think that uh it it just for me it's just not a\nNot a serious holiday you know it's not up there with the ... so I Can't get that energized about it but there was a little bit of a new story here because Columbus ohio oh where lots of fun things happened I'm sure they are not celebrating\nColumbus Day so they will not so the city is named for Christopher Columbus but they will not celebrate Columbus Day there instead celebrating indigenous people's day so I think to be consistent or John what do you think I think they should have to call it indigenous peoples town\nRight\nThey got to rename this is like when people in Austin, Texas want to change the street names and then I go wait a second we might have to change the name of our whole sued Washington DC also has to change its name Washington D. C. would have to ... although I Will say it's a little confusing when I say I'm I live in Washington people were always like\nThe state or you know DC you know we should just call it D.C the district of Columbia that shouldn't be Washington DC 'cause it gets confusing\nI Know that sacrilegious because our founding father blah blah but we got a state named after him and a lot of stuff named after him he's our dollar bill so yeah Columbus doesn't call indigenous peoples anymore and I like to point out\nMostly because it upsets the left which is fun because we're we're owning lips were only lives hard these days folks freedom we embrace this because lives need to be known for their own good at this point\nThey they need people to show them that in in in politics their ideology is that new level and they need\nYou could get wrecked notice I'm dropping all the lingo John I used to noticed up when I when I used to be playing video games I could use all the cool kids laugh when I was about to say you sound like a game or no yeah exactly\nI used to I got so good at people I got to do like this special level tournaments and fever I was playing kids in all the from Shanghai to Korea to Rio de Janeiro and uh I was I was pretty nasty and the fee for anyway I was like ten years ago\nSo Columbus Day people get all upset about because if it Columbus owned slaves and was a pill a jerk\nAnd to that I just point out or why is it that we only judge and I know others are making this point you but I really I really do look at this 'cause that period of in the history of the fifteenth sixteenth century is a particular interest to me you had a massive Muslim slave trade going on\nIn the America so put that aside for a moment you had a huge slave trade in the Islamic world of white Christians I Would know they were being treated as slaves all over the place a lot of them are ... labor to to get work your debt or the women were putting ... you can figure out what that was all about\nA that was going on millions of people over the course of a few centuries and so it's not like it was just the slave trade in\nIn Western Europe although we're always led to believe that\nBut then you get into the Americas and you read a little bit about particularly the a Caribbean tribes or in your native tribes and the as tech and ink up people's as well as all that tributary\nGroups below them and the Aztec Empire for example was a massive empire built on slavery human sacrifice and yes there was a lot of cannibalism\nThey were eating people\nAnd when they weren't eating them they were ripping they're beating heart out of their chest because they thought that that's what their God wanted so I Do think that there was a little bit of a need to you know a move up the the ethical civilization scale quite a bit\nSo why don't we look on that at the same time period with any horror no we'll look on on Columbus and\nAnd apply the moral standards up today to back then well if we're going to apply their standards of today here's a point that you won't hear the left me\nColumbus was morally much more advanced than these civilizations he came into contact

service and\nThey don't want to look at his record though as a judge where he was ... really universally praise and understood to be top of his field\nThat's something that's different here that's what brings together the different factions within the right\nKavanaugh was some ... gold standard choice he wasn't the go all in and try and own the lips choice at the Supreme Court no no no Kavanaugh was the establishment pick\nKevin ... was the guy who\nWas doing what he could in order to at least be impartial as a judge should me wherever he hears cases and they tried to ruin him they tried to destroy his life destroys family destroys reputation\nThere is no more room for anyone who calls himself a conservative sit around and say yeah you know what you know what the answer is to all this be nicer to the lives\nTake their arguments more seriously play more fair with them feel a little softer and your tone with them that's just not serious anymore it's not a serious argument\nInstill the lives finally recognize that\nWhat they have been doing is no longer the way business will be done\nThat they can no longer shame and destroy with impunity we must continue to win and we must continue to push for what we noted be good and right for the country no matter how much they scream no matter how much they banged on the doors that Supreme Court or mob people in restaurants or act\nLike a bunch of savages we have to push forward\nAnd we have to stay United and we have to win Trump understands that that said\nKavanaugh's like well I'm I'm Still going to be nonpartisan is not about ideology for me so he's trying to do his part to say the right thing and to try and heal the country and so forth and so much as possible foreign play quick to\nArticle three of the constitution provides judicial power Shelby vested in one Supreme Court\nThe Supreme Court as an institution of law it is not a partisan or political institution [noise] the justices do not sit on opposite sides of an idle\nWould you not caucuses separate rooms the Supreme Court as a team of nine\nAnd I will always be a team player on the team of non [noise] I was not appointed to serve one party or one answer is but to serve one nation\nAmerica's constitution and laws protect every person of every belief in every backgrounds every lead again the Supreme Court can be assured that I listen to their arguments with respect and an open minds\nThat is Brett Kavanaugh speaking there I mean that is what he does that is what he feels that is what he believes as evidenced by everything he's done on the court\nHe was with the majority opinion or almost all the time other judges looking at the law agree with Kevin all almost all the time liberal judges conservative judges Kavanaugh interprets the law\nProperly now of course that will mean that he breaks with some progressive wish list items which is why they hate him so much\nBut there is an underlying truth here and that is that the country is a better place\nWith more respect for the rules were there will be more respect for the rule of law where every American will have his rights more respected under the constitution because the judge Kavanaugh is on the Supreme Court now because he's justice capital\nLiberals will in fact benefit from Kavanaugh's presence on the Supreme Court they just don't realize it\nBecause they don't really want somebody calling balls and strikes when it comes to the constitution they want to ring or\nThey want somebody who will tell them yes the constitution says that thing you wanted to say even though it doesn't\nAt least Kevin all will say I may not like this policy I may think this leads to bad outcomes in public life for a whole bunch of reasons but this is what the constitution says this is what the case law tells us and with respect to precedent and all the other\nInterpretation issues that come to mind ed I'm not going to give you the decision that I think I should based upon what I Want to give you a decision based on what is the law this is where liberal separate from conservatives this is how we differ on the Supreme Court on the constitution and what all this means\nScalia school is a perfect example he he would say look I I don't I don't agree with flag burning you know\nBut that doesn't mean that I think that there shouldn't be flag burning under the law is I got I don't like flag burning but you you should not be made illegal you know what I mean you\nLook at some of these decisions from very concerned conservatives will protect the rights of liberals even on issues that they feel very passionately about and that they do not because it's about principle right they they do not agree with the end policy\nFor progressive is all about the final outcome it's all about you know did Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Kagan and sort of ... and it said or did you did they\nGive us the semi divine rich from these judges over the Supreme Court these unelected super legislators did they give us what we want\nAnd that's how they judge Supreme Court which is why they have such a problem with Kavanaugh um\nBut we have entered a a very interesting period right now\nPost Kavanaugh getting through heading into the midterms I don't know if the Democrats psyche can really handle that the collective psyche of the ... the Democrat Party

believes the constitution says what it says and that we all have the same rights and we don't change the law based on whether we like or don't like somebody and\nThat makes you in today's day and age that makes you a radical conservatives according to the left\nBut college was certainly a process radicalization for me and that way but the grieving studies departments are churning out millions of

are\nPublic enemy number one in America and there's a lot of us so obviously a lot of enemies we are the bad guys based on this underlying media narrative and once you start to put it in those terms once you were willing to speak about it in an open way we're not saying oh gosh that can really know that is true\nThen much of what we've seen here with the whole\nKavanaugh debacle and I say that about the process it's as any if you listen to show knows I was as fired up about Kavanaugh's I've been about any anything\nUm in defense of Kavanaugh and then in absolute opposition to this obvious smear effort by the left I did everything I could I mean I was reaching out it wasn't just normal day at the office for the buck man with Kavanaugh I was reaching out to colleagues across media how do we get the word out we need to make\nThis we need to make this point we need to refute this nonsense and you know we were doing everything there were a whole bunch of us doing everything we could

she's this was a parody song she's making a political point so I'm dealing with it as a function of politics and she's responding to what the president said about how scary time to be a man\nShe says things like it is or rather ... you can't have the windows open when you're a woman home alone no if you live in an unsafe neighborhood I maybe maybe you feel that way but that seems a bit extreme\nI'm considering also that America is at the now the bottom end of a fifty year declined and violent crime I I think that that's a little that's a a little bit extreme but\nAnd then you say that you can't go to the bar without a chaperone well I Know a lot of women and having a lot of women in my day and let them go to the bar with a chaperone\nAnd I know plenty of women who wear miniskirts all the time and or would feel free to wherever these gr whenever they chose to not feel weird about it and plenty of women who if somebody slid into a GM's when someone DM somebody else on Twitter or you know write them on Facebook or\nWho would say whatever they felt like saying so\nWhy are we being told that these are all things that women can't do why make these claims that are

... culture on campus rape is a is a horrible crime it's illegal in all fifty states and is prosecuted vigorously\nAh so what where is this coming from and I mean the truth is that the same identity politics very divisive view of day to day life the Democrat Party takes about all groups of different ethnic groups and religious groups also applies to the sexes\nA it also applies to the way that the left views the role of women or the the the ... if you will the the position of women\nIn American society and it's just not in keeping with reality and that is\nVery troubling because once again we have this problem of how do you engage with the other side\nWhen you can't agree on the underlying foundation of what is real and what is not how old are you in gauge the other side on issues like women walk around dressing hello I'm here in D.C I've lived in New York ... this is this is not the Taliban\nVersion of America would walk around dressing however they want as they well should\nAnd women are very safe in this country by the numbers compared to what what would be the case in a ... a lot of other places all over the world\nAnd and there's something inherently that feels a little ah unjust about claiming publicly it this way and it's not just the singers are this is this is common among the ...\nThat that that men especially men who will say things like well rape cultures that we don't care about these issues that as a slur that is a slender just not true\nWhy did they go there um because quite honestly they've been fed lives and they believe these lies they really do think that one in five women and sexually assaulted or because of some campus surveys that were done when that is not true unless you include unwanted looks as sexual assault\nWhich is what was included in some of those surveys or so the facts don't line up with this but facts in this and with many other things make liberals uncomfortable and so they prefer to exist it as much as possible and emotion

Oregon and in two years never my six\nAnswers now you got no idea I Am I\nAbsolutely certain Trump is going to win reelection down but I'm pretty certain\nUm but Nikki Haley as a woman certainly fits into what all these political journalist like to do just come up with a narrative that interests people with speculation which I've told you before is the favorite tool now of the TV pundits and the different\nTwenty four seven cable news networks Phil lots of speculation built filled the airwaves with speculation and\nYou know you'll you'll uh never have to worry about\nContent you'll have plenty of speculation as easy and cheap and so that's why we do it and look it happens a lot on this but those are all I think so and so it was going to run on ... part of it is that it's fun right speculations also fun and it can be interesting and just not worth all that much but they're saying that Nikki Haley may run\nAnd be honest with you I don't know I don't know you know\nNo one knows well that's for sure but I\nI don't see that she is necessarily I'm quite as a compelling and Kennedy because here's here's what the what did you always gotta remember in these situations\nAre side doesn't get credit for breaking the glass ceiling our side doesn't get credit for oh this person is incredibly accomplish and a minority you know in fact what is said about those who are either minority or female and the conservative side who achieves high office in government is that they're sellouts that their traders\nTraded of their race straighter to their gender or whatever it may be a lot of that was said for example about college because of her vote on Kavanaugh\nThat she was a a a gender traitor which I suppose is is now he's saying [noise] um but I think that uh\nYou know Nikki Haley step aside today and it was a slow news day answer everybody got all frenzied about this and I'll just let the former or soon to be former U.S ambassador United Nations is speak for herself on this one of them we've got a lot of other things that will be getting into play quits wealth\nHow coming into the air my goal is that we make sure that everything is any way on an effort to come back in ... than the United states and I'm proud to be part of the team now I don't have anything that I'm where I'm going to go on I think that um the main thing when\nI got an hour or six years and we got like a hurricane found in your ... sitting for hitting of online and look how many\nYears have ... an hour on North Korea it's been eight years and then ... ...

out\nDoesn't really matter who cares [laughter] that's my analysis of it I Know but I Know what you're doing\nA but I I Do want to spend a little time with you on the midterms because there is a a scrambling for narrative on the left and it it does tie in so much with Nikki Haley said there and her little statement which is it's a great Dane America\nThe concern I have for the Republicans go into these midterms is that things are so good right now kind of me so strong we are fighting massive wars taking daily casualties abroad and countries we have no hope of ever reconstructing

troops\nServing in these countries are serving in in a war zone and overall things are really good right now\nOr the media the mainstream in his in his backyard but that can be a problem for us because people don't vote when they're happy they vote when they're upset that is a concern for me I Want to I Want to address that and also just the overall narrative from the left to go into these

Politico\nWho I I don't I'm not even really familiar with I Know what political ... which is a political side left wing people a dozen bill itself as that but that is in fact what it is a but he wrote a piece about how maybe more or less it's time to to take the gloves off\nA about how ... maybe now is the time\nFor Democrats to stop playing night's stop playing night they were accused a cabin on being a gang rape rich during Senate hearings these people are completely\nInsane they're completely nuts\nDo you even look I got asked this question recently by a college kid at a conference where I gave a speech what do you do\nPeople call you a Nazi because you're pro Second Amendment I said there's nothing you can do don't engage 'cause you're talking you might as well be talking to a person who's pushing around the shopping cart with you know John three sixteen written on a piece of cardboard hanging out of it I mean that's that's what we're up against now\nAnd this is unfortunately the end result of a massive\nMedia echo chamber that has given this kind of thinking some form of of intellectual cover for a very long time that's what's really going on here\nPeople think that this is a normal way to approach their problems they think this is a normal way to deal with the other side should just go completely scorched earth insane\nAnd then they to borrow from the left the Democrats have normal lives they're crazy and it is they're crazy tactics and so what is crazy to a normal person is no longer crazy to Democrats\nI you know I\nI'm not I'm not even going to get to the the the clip I think today but somebody that I'm friends with over at a a nother\nNetwork or somebody in front of the other network you were saying today that what happens when people are being chased out of restaurants that's not a mom I I'm Sorry that's them up if we can't agree and this was a CNN\nAnd I'm not we're not going to play that clip today I'm gonna let it\nJust uh 'cause 'cause I I like the I like the person on a on a person to person level who who said this stuff but she's been subjected obviously to this kind of thinking too much and has unfortunately bought into it at some level if we can't agree\nThat the people that are changing Ted Cruz at a restaurant or the people that are\nPublic officials were laughing about Rand Paul almost being beaten to death on his front lawn because someone didn't like what Rand Paul stood for a ... if if they're going to laugh about that if they're going to go on TV is senator Hirono did and said well you know this is just what happens\n... meaning that people should yell at others and get up in their faces anything else if they're going to say that that's OK and that's normal we have no choice\nBut to own the lips are only choice becomes victory the only response we can have two this insanity\nIs to defeat them and do it and I don't know how else to say to enforce our political will through the system legally and legitimately upon them that's it that is the ... that is the only option there is no other option you know people who think that a gathering of angry loud\nIn in a gathering of angry loud activists in a restaurant yelling at somebody and you know in front of his or you know his wife or her husband or whatever is not a mob if we don't use the term up for that we have no basis for discussion and this is we're in the left is really hurting right now\nUh but there's not a huge emphasis in some of these European countries of the left points to a there's not a huge emphasis on\nThe state enforcing the same outcome was for all people right there were some people will be better than others maybe not necessarily economically but some people just have happier life outcomes some people there's only so much the state is able to do\nIt unless you empower it to a point where it's so powerful that you no longer have any individual you have whatever the state Danes to leave you um but I suppose I'm getting\nToo deep into this rabbit hole a here's what I Would say about oh wait we've got more so so Trump will actually say what needs to be said here which is that Hillary's a loser to time loser for president never really done anything impressive in her entire career has just been writing her husband's coattails\n'em and crumble said other people right the Romney wing of the GOP Romney wing of the GOP is much more\nWilling to sit back and take these nasty comments from people like Hillary Clinton much more willing to sort of take the the underhanded and unseemly an unfair critiques without punching back in any meaningful way\nShow a Trump is a new era for conservatives and many of you listen to the show ...\nMany of you solve that very very early on I've not just come around to it now I I consider myself to be a a warrior ideologically for the Trump way\nOf doing politics um he said things like you get tired of winning we're certainly not tired of winning but that's not just a slogan you win or bad things happen I mean you know if you believe for example\nThat the Democrats pursue immoral policies which certainly in the case of a rover your weight and there are other things you could pop right on top of that then there is something of a moral imperative to do at least everything you can within the political system to prevent them from having the power to enact there will\nUh but Hillary has gotten in the past as we know from the media for very long time that CNN sit down to some degree of your own on one pool that Christie on whatever name as it down with her I just said her name so obviously I Know her name\nI just don't like to say that because it's ... it's ... the uh not Christine it's ... and she told the front of my sons are but they'll call it he'll call Hillary out\nYou don't sit there and and just allow or to get away with the lives and the nonsense but on the issue of Bill Clinton's sexual harassment 'cause we're in this meat to moment and everyone's\nAll focused in on how you know Kavanaugh in the Arab meat you is going to affect women's perceptions going into the midterm elections and all that stuff\nOn a porous Hillary about her husband Bill Clinton what went on here and I I Want to play the answer for you and then I Want to bring us down to a brass tacks place that\nHe said either talk about the difficulties that your husband went through the un to obviously you're going to be prepared to have questions about that moment in Nineteen Ninety eight the impeachment um the allegations of sexual harassment against your husband have a pet to answer those questions you have a pet to on to them and how do you see that\nSo many different from what President Trump is being accused of and cabin on others today\nWell there's a very significant difference I\nAnd that is the intense\nLong lasting part of an investigation that was conducted\nIn the nineties [noise] if um\nYou know the Republicans starting with President Trump on down I Want to a comparison nation welcome", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Buck Sexton Show", "city": "Newton", "day": "09"}
