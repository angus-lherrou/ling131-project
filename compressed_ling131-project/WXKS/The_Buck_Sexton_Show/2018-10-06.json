people capable of independence thought\nAnd you know what you're thinking oh that was an isolated case now just a few minutes later in the basement where the uh protesters had finally figured out the senators on coming through the main lobby they're going in the basement they were gathering there too\n\nBut why vote [laughter] [noise]\n\nIt just becomes like a strange church of protesters are really strange church of protesters\nAnd I think these lost boys and mostly last girls don't understand the full issue they're not looking at facts they're only looking at emotions\nAnd it really is frustrating and then moments after that was captured Susan Collins was going in for the vote on cloture\nAnd she walked into the the same hallway where the robots where where these folks were and she was accosted by both protesters and reporters\nAre you how do you have a novel make I mean how do you find out how to do on\nRight now I Will be\nI Will be voting yes [noise]\nAnd see the final

and again I I\nGo back to the discussion we had an hour ago in this very radio show if you would have told me earlier this year four months ago that Lindsey Graham Mitch McConnell and Susan Collins would be the three heroes the salvation of Donald Trump's presidency and the Supreme Court justice I would've said you're on your mind\nYou need to put down the pipe but no that's exactly how this worked out\nSusan Collins gave such a brilliant and measured address today I have to give you a little bit of a snippet of what she said talking about the process because she really gave a history lesson she give a lesson in law and logic and decency\nOur Supreme Court confirmation process\nHas been steady decline for more than Thirty years\nWhy can only hope that the cabin on\nMondays and it's where the process has finally hit\nAgainst this backdrop that sat each intervention well senator to decide what the constitution said fights\nAnd consent Judy ...\nI thought that was brilliant and you know we're talking to match slap earlier and Matt said that he thinks next year\nTwenty Nineteen there may be another retirement on the Supreme Court and with that retirement it's more than likely going to be a liberal justice which means then the court with a pick from Donald Trump would swing from five for conservative\nTo liberal advantage to a six three\nAnd that is going to be too much for liberals to handle that that change in the ratio would absolutely make everybody on the left to go nuts and they would be a it'd\nBe Armageddon for them be legal Armageddon for them so uh uh the the biggest thing I think Susan Collins did today in your argument\nThat she made her case was to talk about something that the left would not let us get through and that was the presumption of innocence that if you were charged with something you're used to doing something\nIn this country if we don't hang onto the presumption of innocence than it is\nAll over for America as a as a civil society\nPrincess venison since relevant to the fight consent punch him when and if you ... ... nominees otherwise exemplary record\nI worry that part in it it's ... cents and could lead to a lack of public faith and the judiciary and with these huge damage to the confirmation process\nMoving forward some of the allegations levied against jak cabinet illustrate why that percentage of innocence is selling for it\nI Am thinking in particular not of the allegations raised by professor for but if the allegations that plenty what teenager jets cabinet ... whole girls\nAnd use their week at a state

absolute insane charges brought by Michael Avon not he\nThe guy that brought us Stormy Daniels or maybe she brought him to us\nBut Michael ... who tried to make this all about himself and his

heritage public statements about it\nYeah she's talking about the media should go after the ... too much you go to Susan Collins could have taken the media part but what she did was make a well
