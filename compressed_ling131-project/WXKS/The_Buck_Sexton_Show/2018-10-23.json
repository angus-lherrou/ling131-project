Porter in chief\nAnd then build up the currency politically and with the media has helped to make it seem like you're serious about immigration reform when really all you're serious about as amnesty because with energy comes to death of the Republican Party full stop\nSo whenever they have to do to get to that point there of course willing to do whatever you can do whatever you must do to get to amnesty you should do as a Democrat because it means that you effectively eliminate your competition eliminate gone forever right victory game over\nWe cannot allow people to pour in the U.S undetected an undocumented unchecked and we can allow people to get around those who waited patiently in line that was Obama a few years back where are those Democrats now\nWhereas Obama now other than telling fantasies\nOr that he has about his his economic record to Democrats in his last ditch effort to try and\nLeast flip the house at least\nWith the house Democrats are so they know the set of on no chance sentence out of there out of their grass now\nUh put Obama's doing this whole this whole storyline about the economy and he's going to take credit for which is just that's just nonsense I've been saying and it doesn't it doesn't comport with the facts\nBut also an immigration there's such a fundamental dishonesty about this about how Democrats would approach should approach this caravan what they expect Republicans to do and all of all\nThe arguments I hear from them or just emotional appeals there's really not a policy argument for them to make because they can't\nThey won't tell you who can't stay who has\nTo go back other than criminals they certainly won't address the issue of what an secure borders doing to this country and and how it's part of ruining communities with\nPut aside the ruthlessness the brutality and this is a mafia style hit this is straight out of the Sopranos right this is you know beat someone to death count up into pieces disposed the body\nAnd ... what do you expect from an organized crime family that is ruthless and violent and what we shouldn't be surprised that at recognizing that was that the Saudis are effectively in organized crime family\nThey just have royal titles and a lot of money but they operate like an organized crime family and I just would know that is very likely that the Saudis have been doing this kind of thing\nFor a long time meaning there are a whole lot of body parts very down desert that we never get to hear about from people\nWho were maybe critical of the regime or just pose a problem for the regime and Saudi and we have no idea we never will and even the people knowing Saudi won't say anything because they don't want to be buried in the desert somewhere\nWhy would the Saudis do this in such a clumsy way other services really that incompetent their intelligence services the people that were involved in this hate\nAnd I don't have a great answer I mentioned you that sometimes in closed societies like Saudi Arabia where the services can operate\nWithout any fear of you know the Saudi ACLU getting involved or something or they can do whatever they want effectively if it's sanctioned by the regime they can tend to be a bit sloppy\nBut the Turks also have their own intelligence and police services that can do more or less what they want as long as they have the backing of the regime in this case the the air go on a government\nAnd the Saudis should've known that meaning that the chances of them getting away with this we are so slim unless they were just dumb\nAnd really believes somehow this wouldn't be a problem there must have been a miscalculation here that either we're not taking into account or that we're not yet aware of the latest reporting says that the body of the show\nAnd I was told is very early on but I didn't think it was ... well enough I might have mentioned this on radio I Can't remember now that the body of the show the main factor been buried in the garden of the head of the consulate consul general I think in in ... ... ...\nThat's what they decided to do with this guy\nWhich just goes to show you how how just brutal and Rob this whole thing was and the the reports that the\nThe forensics expert the Saudi forensic expert who had a bone saw who said to put on according to Turkish leaks put on music because it makes the process easier but this is grim\nThis is just brutal\nWhat the heck were the Saudis thinking\nOr the relationship between the U.S in Saudi Arabia certainly not going to feel the same for very long time\nAnd I'm not sure where the administration is going to stop this I think there may be some sanctions against individuals or there will be some replication of visas maybe they'll expel the Saudi ambassador but it's going to be hard for people to hang out with Mohammed bin Salman anytime soon and act like everything's just fine\nUm that's that's where this ... showed me thing for for the media of the left is is really just an ad like upset it's an opportunity to bash Trump and that's what they are ... fundamentally most concerned where this is an opportunity to bash Trump because whatever he does will not be enough\nStructures they'd also spoke about the er the caravan which I wanted to spend a moment we'll talk more about that than the next ... hours this caravan which I Do Democrats that are in tight house races and Senate races really don't want this getting all the judgments getting 'cause it's a\nIt's a problem for the Democrats yeah the base is all about oh we just want to legal and bring people and and the more the merrier but\nThe majority of the American people do on our rules ought to be respected they do believe in sovereignty\nAnd Pompeo spoke about the caravan today here's what he does say play twenty four some migrants your\nCaravan is violating Mexico's sovereignty flaws and immigration procedures\nPresident Trump will not stand for this to happen to the United states [noise]\nTo those who say say this is a hard hearted stamps without forget the United states is a historical generous station when it comes to immigration [noise]\nOne million people per year rented permanent legal status here in the United states\nFor thirty three million people to total are currently here who've immigrated to this country illegally\nTo those who want to come here\nCome here legally\nPretty straightforward isn't it and yet it almost sounds revolutionary coming from our own secretary of state come here legally stop trying to find\nWays to get around our system actually use and respect our system and these people keep saying that it's native fish than it's racist and all this to oppose masses\nOf masses of people just walking literally just walking into our country because they want to don't seem to take into account that we have had an enormous change in debt in the region decades the demographics of this country in favor of more and more and more immigrants all the time\nFrom everywhere from all over the world\nWe taking we we we had a million people a year told that they can stay in America forever legally in this country looting a large number of of citizens and as I've always said welcome to those who are citizens who come here legally\nAh but that's just crazy for people to there and say you know what\nWe just uh we just really think that America has this native his policy and the caravan is is yet another time where we're seeing the truth of it all at Portland cursed\nWe're bringing in more people than anybody else but we're doing nobody else is doing nobody else is taking this approach and every other country is allowed to have borders why can't we have borders\nWhy doesn't sovereignty matters here why is it that that anyone should be able to come here and and then access our benefits remember the tax dollars that you pay my friends or what gives these benefits and yet the protection of our military the protection of our court system\nThat's all paid for by us that it's time out of your life because that is what time is money right they you pay them money based on the time that you have accumulated either you're you're giving them hours of your life so that we have a judicial system so we have rule of law so we have a military that\nProtects us as well as the infrastructure and and society and culture at all that that have produced so much wealth in so much prosperity [noise] have you come here and just be a part of that 'cause whatever [noise] then we are just a fat cow to be milked by anybody wants to come by [noise]\nWorse than just a fantasy outage watered eventually this country is going to go down the tubes [noise]\nNot the way it should be [noise]\nWe've got more on the status of this caravan

Fox News secretary of state Mike Pompeo with the pointed message by the thousands of people ... to the southern us border\nNot be successful at getting into the United states illegally no matter what I repeat the caravan will not cross our southern border illegally under any circumstances\nAh now there's all this focus on the caravan right now and and the uh the demographics of it who's in it you know they're the left will focus on the women and children that are in it but it was we know there are a lot of military age males there's a lot of young men that are part of this caravan\nUh the less will say that they're seeking a better life and jobs but people in the right will say well hold on a second there is also going to be people with with gang ties in this tide realized that getting into America is going to be a much more lucrative for their elusive practices and\nThere's also go to the people that you would assume once they get to the border are going to try to use this map that will strain any police resources used that moment you try to to try to bring drugs and other things over the border I mean that that's just we don't know but that's a reasonable expectation\nOf but ultimately for the left this is I think a losing issue I'm a losing issue because the point is not how many ah\nEasterners or non Hondurans there are the point is that we don't know\nThat we have no verification mechanism in place that we have no means are proving who is and who is not a part of this whole thing\nOh and by the time they get to the border and there are so many thousands of them it's going to be too late for us to have any realistic process in place that's assuming they make more to maybe this will dissipate although I doubt it\nI doubt it but here is what a\nCNN was putting on for analysis on this last night get ready for it\nHit the decade CNN play succeed\nJust because someone is Middle Eastern of course there are no Middle Eastern people there\nBut that doesn't mean that they're bad doesn't mean that there are terrorists you know we were in this world now where Trump can say Middle Eastern and everybody then immediately somehow began to think of terrorists of most of the terrorists we we've had the United states are not being committed by Middle Eastern people or by Muslims\nThere being committed by right wing extremist at our own country but I just didn't lie on top of lie on top of wire wrapped up in lives and then was last night on top of it\nAnd I appreciate you trying to fact check it but I just don't I mean there are clearly you know people from other parts of the world who would try to come to the southern border there is no evidence of terrorists people with ... and ... according to the people who know\nOkay a couple things first of all many of you know I lose my mind I get very very agitated which is continued lie on the left that most terrorism in America as right wing okay I worked in the ... instead\nOf the CIA working then why PDAs intelligence division most terrorism comes when you're talking about terrorism of lethal concern and a strategic threat to the United states it is overwhelmingly Islamic radicals overwhelmingly Ninety five percent plus when\nYou look at mass casualty attack the United states\nIn the gate political motive of any kind it is overwhelmingly jihad is\nRadical Muslims trying to kill as many people in this country as possible\nAnd when you look at where we devote our counterterrorism resources and that means including how many disrupted mass casualty plots there have been how many people we are how many people we have to put out there with the FBI and CIA and everything I law enforcement all across the board\nAnd the amount of time and energy resources they spend trying to and then in fact stopping terrorist plots it's all jihadism basically\nAnything that's not jihadism is ... it's a shock it's a surprise\nSo how they come up with this is just by changing the definition of one what constitutes terrorism All right and then and then to opening that we move past things like oh you know nine eleven well let's not count that and the statistics\nAnd don't count disrupted plots and the resources that we spend a year in and year out on specifically Islamic radicalism but back to the point about other no middle Easterners\n... the reality here is that\nWe don't know and that in itself is the problem meaning that you can't just have people show up at the board none of these people have any documentation not that I'm aware of at least maybe someone brought up with them you know they're not showing up being able to prove it they're just going to show up and tell stories\nAnd they know what stories there's islands I have you know there's gang stuff going on and in my city is that is now in an asylum claim any person from a whole slew of Latin American countries that are just be ... with violence\nAnd corruption and terrible stuff happening all the time they will all be in a position to claim asylum in this country and say\nAnd you know one of the things I just got to know that people say oh very few of those molasses caravan which I Would note was organized by international NGO\nSo don't don't get don't allow them to just play a game of old but you know people saying it's organized it's such a why was the last caravan which had a few hundred people was organized by international NGO so there was a an organizer that was not just a grassroots hey let's go do this\nThat's that's one point it was on the other is they'll say very few of those people were granted asylum what the leave out of that is very few of those people have actually gone in front of asylum judge\nAn immigration judge to find out if they can say we're not and very few of them will for a long time because of the backlog and everyone knows this this is a backdoor way to get it in the country and everyone assumes that they will stay because we will not enforce the law\nThat's where this comes down to do we have sovereignty do we have rule of law the left says no because it benefits the power structure and because ideologically people just want to feel like they're helping the poor and the downtrodden\nAnd they don't mind doing it at the expense of all other Americans and our rule of law\nIn the midst of all this whining coming from the last ... to wonder why would

obvious hostility to the free market and I think has a very a very uh let's just say superficial understanding of what the conservative argument is for the free market\nOr let's just start with that we have nothing even close to a free market in health care we up massive government regulation government intrusion redistribution of\nWealth the government is already spending a large\nPercentage of overall health care dollars urine and you're on this country\nBecause of Medicare and Medicaid we we do not have a free market nothing even close to a free market so so let's start from that let's understand where we are\nAnd then look at what the problem with health care is the problem with health care as a as the left sees it is that not everybody just has it the problem with health care as the Wright sees it is that in less you increase the incentives\nFor there to be more caregivers and better care and more efficient care\nYou can't actually promise unlimited stuff to everyone and not either one in ... invoke massive rationing or to bankrupt the country or three both\nSo we deal and the reality based world of you can say everybody has health care and you can even mandate that everybody has health care but that doesn't mean that they're going to get taken care of when they are sick\nDemocrats keep pushing this notion they say well look at how it is and these other countries look at how it is and I and we pushed back and say well hold on we don't want the system that they have in the u._k. we have a better healthcare system in this country and we also by the way I have a much better and more prosperous economy\nThan they do with the gay\nAnd we also have a much better and larger and more dynamic economy than the Canadians do you look at these other countries where they also have private health insurance that people with the money will get for what they really need then what's really important to them\nYou know you want to have heart surgery based on a national health service in the u._k. or you want to have a hearts or heart surgery at one of the best hospitals the United states you know the answer to\nThat so there there's no simple straightforward approach to this but let's just all be very clear that beating up on the free market and sing the free market never wrote a prescription that's just rhetoric\nThat's that's a whole lot of nothing that doesn't tell us how things are going to get any better and this is the part of the health care discussion the left does not want to talk to you about it at all\nWhich is that a huge portion of our health care spending right now is pushed by lifestyle diseases it's pushed in large part by a choices people are making\nAnd if you don't have any cost sharing at all and that if you went to a single payer system then there'll be no incentive financially to try and make better health choices oh I Know people do but what about people in this terrible disease or that terrible because I Know that happens\nYou know what most healthcare costs comes down to\nHeart disease diabetes old age\nThat's where things in our old age obviously is not a choice but that's where the spending is that's where the money is going\nBut we're not we're not having trouble in our healthcare system because of people with you know can general birth defects or because they are born with some some lifelong chronic condition that that that's actually not where the health care dollars are going\nWe had been told so many times that America First because of the history of that term is not something that anybody could say even though it really does convey mentality in the current political landscape that many of us subscribe to\nWhich is that we want the government that puts the interests of America and the American people\nBefore the interests of not American people that doesn't mean we're going to be involved in rapacious colonialism and emerge capitalism and doing all the natural resources of the developing world and all this other stuff you always hear from the radical left no no it just means\nThat if we are citizens and we are of this country\nOr not all you're listening you know most of our citizens but if if we're going to talk about what should be doing the government that represents oh should represent us ahead of the interests of other people\nThere you go\nVery straightforward proposition bird powerful one very important\nFor them but also as you no doubt realize nationalism\nHas become something of the same way that America First has been marred with a negative connotation\nUm but the Trump doesn't shy away from this and here's here's the usual separation or you have people think of patriotism roughly speaking as love of one's country and people will say that nationalism\nIs hatred of those not from one country that that tends to be a way that people set this up or it's or if you're a nationalist\nDares dish you don't like those outside your nation and if you're a patriot you just focus on the love of the nation but of course if you think about this realistically\nThere's going to be\nGray areas and crossover between these concepts I mean if

think it's funny that Lehman is is a threat of opinion guy but they put them on they don't they won't designated by such though at least not to my knowledge he's an anchor during a news show about uh he was very upset oh my gosh so upset about this ... this moment where Trump said national appear CNN doing its thing play Eighteen\nAnd really we're not supposed to use that word you know what I Am
