said yeah yeah this is good saying that white students in this class should\nAs a form of experiential reparation sit on the ground during class and have to wear chains\nFor the whole course and this was this was published this was published here's another paper I\nDid this gets gets crazier the cycle of quote the psychological harms it\nAnd then to the sexual object to vacation of women are well documented throughout the theoretical an empirical literature but today there's very little discussion on whether and when these harms a number of gene behaviors that create them\nConstitute a form of

I really feel for professor Ford as a you know and and and but Kavanaugh because they were both mistreated by the Democrats if you look at her testimony especially you know about the the question about what she was asked\nThat you know we could have come come to you in California to be interviewed she basically was like I didn't know this nobody told me this lawyers\nThat the Democrats paid for\nIt not informed of this option they want it because they wanted her to come to DC\nAnd they even tried to tell her to say oh tell her that's attorney client privilege and she was like\nNo I I I would've I would've entertain them coming to me and and answer their questions in California I think that she really did not want things to go public that she just had some recollection that she wanted to keep quiet\nAnd then the Democrats said this is something we can use to a store\nAnd she she will be I feel very badly for her obviously if you listen to her testimony something happened to Christine for\nSomething happened to her at a party but she can't she can't put Brett Kavanaugh there none of the people she said were there could put him there the story changed the dates changed the story about having to doorways at her house\nReally doesn't hold up because one of those entrances was made for an office at the house so it wasn't about being panicked the story about being afraid to fly doesn't hold up because she flew all around the world and big planes in small planes\nI Know that that if you're afraid of flying because my wife is terrified of flying\nAnd if it's for work or pleasure it doesn't matter she thinks if you're in that plane something bad is going to happen so a ... if she truly had a fear of flying it wouldn't just affected in business relations with the fact that in every aspect of her life\nSo there's just too much there\nTo hang the San Kavanaugh now did something happened to her yeah probably she was in a school where there's a lot of drinking and by

appreciate this audience it's a a brilliant audience without question you guys are engaged you understand we'll talk history a little bit later\nWe'll we'll talk about uh all that stuff but before the break we were talking with Robert who was a bringing up some important points in Alabama\nAbout Kavanaugh and about the Supreme Court Robert thanks for hanging on you wanted to make a point about what's more important\nYes if you look at the civil rights act in the voting rights act in sixty four sixty five you'll see a presidential what they've been doing to Democrats have been doing for over ... years we had the courage down here\nThey were all Democrats they weren't ever go damn bogus through because the senators had to go back to their states get reelected although I Will get reelected they fix last\nOh not a guest I'm I'm Glad that got passed but they laid the foundation for legislation through ... back then and they're using it ever since I was a reasonable hour they cannot care because it's just a second point if you're creating court judges through three more\nAt the very top they're Seventy five here which can work and how much the youngest several a story that could conceivably go within the next six years that would give Trump or you know because you don't win reelection totally totally\nWell if you base it on the economy and if we think James Carville for it's the economy stupid then yeah the the president stands a real good chance against one of the seven thousand possible democratic candidates who are being talked about to face him\nAnd this would be if Donald Trump get one more\nThis would be a landmark this would be total game changing in terms of moving the court to a more conservative or at the position than anyone could ever see so uh I'm with you on a think cabinet gets through what what did you think the vote was the vote counts going to be Robert\nIs going to start throw it was the deciding vote as just leadership is the best advice

think he gets a he gets confirmed\n... your previous caller here right on the nail on the answer is going to be to decide or because of the stiff neck a Democrats just don't know what they're doing\nWell I I just\nThat's what that's what I wanted to call about because Trump\nThey usually are stupid he is he forced the media I mean he absolutely forced them\nTo put out what this is a

that's coming up the bottom and next our with our friend Gordon Chang but I Want to get\nBack to your books it was just a body a week ago the judge Kavanaugh had to face some ridiculous questions\nFrom Senator Whitehouse a Democrat who was going through judge Kavanaugh's yearbook dream members some of the ridiculous moments one of them surrounded\nA couple I'm surrounded alcohol but vomiting so first we went with bar fame you're worried about\nMy yearbook out or um website look at the beach week Ralph club ... biggest contributor what does the word Ralph mean and that\nThat probably ... to a throwing up on known to have a weak stomach and I always have in fact the last time I see are you ask me about having catch up on spaghetti I always had a weak stomach I don't know that I asked what kept your spaghetti let you didn't someone did and and this is well known anyone who's now that we're\nAsking about catch up on spaghetti this is what's going on in the United States Senate Judiciary Committee hearing about the confirmation but it got weirder than that talking about your books and comments off\nAnd\nThen the word Ralph's you use our yard is already answered all if you're really taco [noise] I like that I like beer I don't know if you don't like beer center or not um what do you watch the ... one is\nSo cabinet I got heat for that for that answer for confronting White House or his obsession with a teenager who may have consumed enough beer to vomit and then it got we went from ... to boot thing\nOr what do you have a view I don't know if it's books are being ... how do you pronounce a cover for ... sixteen [noise] okay [noise]\nSo that went on for a while\nAnd and they were obsessed with the F word and I'm sure the senator has never heard the F word in his life sitting this this whole obsession with your books in high school yearbooks got me thinking\nSo what did I Do I die then to the high school yearbooks as some of the people on this committee the Democrats on this committee\nI went and looked at Richard Blumenthal the named Jack\nThe guy who has a committed stolen valor in my opinion by claiming he was fighting in Vietnam when he wasn't\nHe uh he did serve this country in the marine corps reserves achieving the rank of sergeant no that's not really achieving there are a lot of sergeants I Know who did work hard but if you're going to college and then you're getting in the military they tend to make you an officer right out of the blocks\nSo Da Nang Dick is saying that he was serving in Vietnam then had to come back and make a cheerful apology or this guy was a child of privilege was in a private school and are played on the tennis team and was on the swim team\nAnd then I started looking at Cory Booker Spartacus Spartacus Booker who was a football player in his school and if you look at a Cory bookers\nSenior page on on the uh high school yearbook you can see Cory bookers nickname was sugar that's what he was known to the students in his high school sugar\nThat sugar low sugar can we find out what sugar means what does that mean because some people in the eighties referred to cocaine is sugar\nShould we assume that Cory Booker may have been doing drugs because his name was sugar and in his senior year your book quote Cory Booker has the phrase let's go all the way\nSo what's going on with Cory Booker what does that mean Cory Booker this is the guy who remember wrote the essay about groping a woman at the age of Fifteen the essay about stealing second amusing air quotes they're\nSo why are we putting the year books of all of the Judiciary Committee people up somewhere why aren't we taking Cory bookers stealing second Cory Booker Spartacus and ask him what does he mean by ...\nAll the way he was grabbing Fifteen year olds and emitted to it there's your guy who's admit it there's a guy who corroborate his own damning testimony\nAlright I'm shifting gears sentiment in here you know I

book and the focus on things like the devils trying all\nWe played Senator Whitehouse mocking cabinet are talking about a bar fearing booth thing and the devil's triangle which cabinet insisted was drinking game\nWhite House told them he thought he was lying to him that he didn't believe it was a drinking game that he thought that was something nefarious here\nAnd if you go to the Urban Dictionary which I advise you do not do it at work and you look up the devil's triangle you will see that it is a an some definitions a a ... with two men and one woman\nBut in the era of judge Kavanaugh the devil's triangle was according to some of his classmates who wrote a letter I Am in possession of the letter right here that was sent to chairman Grassley right here right here [noise]\nGot it right here\nDeer chairman Grassley and ranking member Feinstein so went to both of them\nWe're classmates have Brent Kavanaugh says from Georgetown Prep a Jesuit high school in Washington DC area we write to clear up any misunderstanding about the phrase devil's triangle that appeared on our Nineteen eighty three high school yearbook\nIncluding on our individual your book pages that phrase was the subject of questioning a judge Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing last week and has since been discussed in the media oh has it\nThe devil's triangle was drinking game we came up with in high school\nIt was a variation on the game quarters and if you remember judge Kavanaugh said it's a drinking games senator you know quarters and White House like no I don't know anything about that\nThe letter continues when we played devil's triangle for people sat at the table\nOn the table three small glasses of beer were arranged next to one another to form a triangle\nEach of the four participants took turns being the shooter attempting to bounce a quarter into one of the glasses if the quarter landed in one of the glasses the person at the table using sitting at nearest that glass had to drink the beer\nWe do not remember the exact origins of the name but none of us use the phrase devil's triangle in your book to refer to any kind of sexual activity to us it was just a game\nWith glasses in the shape of a triangle if the phrase devil's triangle had any sexual meaning in the early Nineteen eighties we did not know it sincerely\nThe Lansing Davis Bernard McCarthy

when you say stuff like this that's absolutely insane\nThat this is getting this much attention and Senator Whitehouse is out there saying well\nWhile I don't believe you so that means White House is firmly locked in and believing that there has been a ... between Brett Kavanaugh and another guy in his high school despite what everybody else says\nIt's maddening I Know\nAnd now the mainstream media is going to jump on a soundbite that came out of justice Paul Stevens' his mouth that ah earlier today surface the Ninety eight year old former Supreme Court justice\nWho had many liberal votes behind him claim to be a lifelong Republican is now saying that he doesn't think Kavanaugh should be on the court\nI don't care what you think sure you had your term you can sit down now go sell your

world's population are resides in a real small region and they have incredible economic impact not just in their area but on us\nAnd I'm I'm a little tense a not so much about North Korea anymore although I think where we should be keeping an eye on them\nBut I think China is starting to get to be a a little bolder why why suddenly now or are they coming within forty five yards of our naval ships and trying to affect our elections\nWell that's a great question Mike and I think the Chinese have been doing this for quite some time we don't know about a lot of these incidents or we don't know the seriousness seriousness of the incidence\nBecause the navy for quite some time has actually been trying to downplay these um encounters the Chinese had been acting recklessly and I think that they have sense that we're a little bit afraid of that\nSo they become bolder and bolder the one good thing about the incident that occurred over the weekend is that the navy released a photographs of this immediately and that's important because it says to Beijing back off\nYou know under the current administration we're now see both sides of the aisles think that the United states needs to be more resolute needs to be tougher nice to have a different view of China\nAnd that's a good thing and so the administration's working pretty hard to change and we heard a lot of that and vice president Pence's speech today\nWell if you haven't listened to people you can find it it's on line\nAnd you can do something ... going to C SPAN and watch it which I recommend 'cause I think\nVice president Pence has the potential\nTo be a secret weapon for Donald Trump while the media is watching President Trump kind of freelance and some of these situations\nUh Mike Pence appears to be very methodical and pragmatic in not only his language but his actions and I I think he is a a real secret weapon for this administration\nAnd that speech to me was welcomed now Gordon Chang if we're looking at China\nAnd like you said the bold steps that they made the bold moves they made this weekend and the things we seen lately with them a kind of trying to sway public opinion in areas affected by the tariffs\nIs this a reaction or possibly reaction because their economies taken a hit based on the tariffs that Donald Trump has imposed\nWell certainly the Chinese economy right now as fragile um Beijing is pouring a lot of money into the or the money supply in order to keep things going and and I think that the Chinese understand that long term they can't win a struggle with the United states\nAnd so what they're doing right now is trying to huffing and puffing and bluffs um the American public and to caving\nWhen it comes to financial stability don't get left behind get to some tips for saving and feed the big ...\nThis message brought to you by the American Institute of CPAs on the council\n[noise] we're more than a dog can I get more you can ... tigers did you\nTalk twelve hundred Boston dot com\nMichael ... for ... bucks sex than show crazy day and uh I Will tell you to day felt crazy with the delivery of the FBI report to the senator's ... went to the White House last night centers got access to it this morning\nAnd then the one side saying it's Thoreau and the other side saying it's not enough but we all know they're never going to be happy with it\nUh and then the protests and now the yelling on TV as people I I don't know why these panels on CNN and MSNBC and said\nWell we're going to have one person from the left the one person from the right and we're going to try and keep it simple it's never going to be simple the people on the left are on hinged there it's on the age that they accused judge Kavanaugh of\nBeing it's it's real people\nThey're craziness is real\nAlright thank God we have some of the smartest listeners in the world\nGym in Pennsylvania is checking in Jim welcome to the buck Sexton she'll just due to my friend hey good to talk to you\nWhat's up sure what's your thoughts on the Korea and Russia situation\nWhile I think myself I think the reason why North Korea is trying to stall are now and some of the other issues that we've had going on\nIs because they're all waiting to see after these midterms if Trump's gonna get impeached or add more problems because if that happens when they're in the clear\nThey're there they will find we won't find anyone else to put up there that can deal with like Donald Trump does and that's what they are open for\nThat or you're you're getting her feet and waiting to see what happens in in our media plays into that too because they keep promoting all that\nInteresting thought gym but I Do think a diplomacy on this level takes time\nI also believe as I told some of my more liberal friends who are crossing at the mouth going we're going to get the house and they were going to we might get the Senate and we're going to impeach Donald Trump and then we're going to get them out and I say you realize that meets president pen will be a reality and if you think President Trump\nHas been tough on liberals and on on people who are sticking it to America way to use the word President Pence would do and they were going to get him to ... we got a plan for him to show I'm not sure about that I just\nI think diplomacy on this level takes time we saw progress in the Russia situation today with seven more Russian soldiers being indicted now they're never going to extradite him here\nBut Donald Trump's been tougher on Russia than Brock Obama ever dreamed he could be tough on Russia\nSo I I think it's about time and it's about\nTrump being blustery in his speaking and then the the uh the pragmatic approach has to go through all the steps of diplomacy to keep an eye on that gym but thank you ...\nLet's ah stay in Pennsylvania and ah see what's on Felix his mind Felix welcome to the buck sex than shows her\nHey Michael hey I was a big fan of Howard Stern back in the bank and I want to I wanted to vindicate him when I went to college in Seventy eight Seventy nine and ... it was very comic to say that girls and women went to college to get the rest of the great\nWell I I understand that we're talking about ... let's go a decade forward and I don't know if the Emirates degree was as much of a cultural thing in the late eighties and the early nineties as it was in the in the seventies and I think saying it in twenty Eighteen\nIs a rather insensitive to the women today it's kind of insulting to women you know I'll tell you
