{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WXKS", "content": "I think that sounds good to me but they're they're running these these attack ads um and and people were pointing out that that this is a different thing than what you you would usually expect remember running attack at the ... in the state that is getting just battered while I was getting battered by this hurricane and they're running ads\nSpecifically on the opponents inability to respond to the hurricane\nSo usually you wait for a politicization of these things and then with hurricane response is fair game to criticize politicians for I'm not saying that but usually you wait for the politics to fly into into literally the storm has passed\nAnd in this case the uh the candidates running these ads even while the while the storm was was overhead and people were\nTrying to other bad down the hatches or or or wait until they can return to their homes by word of the footage of it is just the devastation they I I Know that\nYou know the the news channels because it's such a visceral human reaction to seeing you know we all think what would it be like if I lost my home over to feel like if I had to flee a natural disaster like this and so when you see those images you're immediately drawn to it\nAnd I and I know that there's something of a of a news cliche here with all the coverage going on of of a of a hurricane like this but there there was this political backs Georgia which which I think also\nA illuminates how tight these\nFlorida races are people are going to look to the Florida governor's race a and between Gillum and ... and Scott and they're going to look to the Senate race\n'em and they're going to try to extrapolate from that for the implications for the presidential race and twenty twenty\nYou know the idea here being the Gillum who is a a young African American guy mayor of Tallahassee very progressive very left wing I think would be really damaging the state of Florida was the policies that he's opposing and he's one of these guys who's\nYou know if he's not outward I think he is for single payer outwardly so I I should probably but if he's not outwardly for single payer you might as well be\nA but you know they they certainly are drawing some comparisons between him and Brock Obama he's young he's telegenic he's African American\nUm and and that's what the progressive base wants to see in their new candidates they want to see you know minority representation they want females they want a ... and specifically for those reasons you know conservatives ... we like having people from all backgrounds but we just like having the best people\nOr identity politics is a is such a big factor on the left these days that they really get very excited about this stuff but the Florida races are going to be very very tight and and so tight that they're not wasting even a single day while they're getting slammed by category for hurricane\nTo take the ads are taking negative ads off the air so\nI think that gives you a sense of of where that all is and uh I I Do believe Scott's going to pull it out but you guys gonna make or it's going to make a close very close\nOh I've I've got something by the way that I've been meaning to get to all week with you um and I just I've been waiting to have a night where you know I I'd had the time to read it and we can

there I I think it's because they realize Trump is winning\nHe still winning they haven't been able to take him out of office with this Russia collusion investigation nonsense they haven't been able to sing came with Republicans or you know anybody who's persuadable\nAnybody who's open minded about this with all the different allegations of the twenty Fifth Amendment and uh the investigations of his finances I'm In the New York times do I think it was a twelve thousand\nWord essay on Trump's taxes\nStretching back to his father's taxpaying practices in the states\nSeventies I think there's some stuff about him in the sixties in there I mean that they they went way way deep\nAnd it was and I read this piece I thought to myself this is this just kind of like the scene and John Nash showed the John Nash hasn't a Beautiful Mind when he's got all the crazy writing on all this stuff all the formulas and the wall and you and then you realize oh this person has a problem\nThe media has a problem Trump maybe has caused it but they're the ones with the problem\nThey are no longer objective in all of this and now it looks very likely that the Republicans are going to keep the Senate and they have a fighting chance and people are saying it's a twenty five percent chance I'm telling you I think it's more like fifty fifty right now that the GOP can hold the house\nAnd what will liberal save them and they really going to all of a sudden you know just discovered that oh Russia manipulated this election true is that going to be the play\nIt might be but I don't think they have any real belief that that will that will stick to that will work what do they tell themselves now\nI Know that they comfort themselves with the constant refrain of Trump is a racist Trump is a is a sexist sexual assault or a a traitor a crazy person all these they say all these things\nBut what do they tell themselves about the politics of this country when the president did they say is the worst president of all time which is a pretty common thing you know you'll hear on the left the worst president all time unfit for office should be removed from\nOffice because of his his temperament and his judgment in the way that he is doing his job they say he should be removed for that reason and it turns out he's doing a really good job\nThe economy is chicken but and I'm here in for a lot of people who know\nAnd this is their life's work has studied is that even though there's this sense right now oh maybe we have what Greenspan what are called irrational exuberance of oh my gosh things are so great they're just gonna keep getting better and better some people have that a lot of people have the oh it must get worse it must get work will get worse but they've been saying\nThat it should get worse for the last eight months and it has it so what do they tell themselves what did they come away with and this then brings me to the outrage mobs\nAnti ... and the ah you know the the the women's march ... creatures and the anti Kavanaugh hordes than the these stalkers because that's really what we're talking about these stalkers who are activists that try to find Republicans to harass them to frighten them to scare them away in a Republican who put up\nBlocks slap on some ... that I Will get to him later they've high five\nBugs issues increasingly looking like the last\nIs going to have to live and Trump's America for many many years to come and I don't know how they're going to to handle that I don't know how they're going to deal with this is why I've been so worried recently about the possibility of real violence\nBecause they've already gone to the mat they've already taken the dial to eleven they are doing everything everything conceivable\nIn terms of propaganda and organizing and media effort and they're doing everything they can to stop this political movement that Trump is a part of from\nFrom reaching its its intended goals from doing what it has set out to do from the beginning and they can't stop it and I think that what set in with many of them is is not just a a panic but also a sense of helplessness\nI mean the last must be telling them so we thought we were going to get this guy gone with the ... we thought we were going to get this guy gone with any number of different ploys and if we couldn't at least get them going at least we could we could stop him and have you know Americans turn on him and his base turn on him\nAnd the opposite is happening I Am more confident in this president and what he's doing and his yes his message as well as his policies with each passing month\nWhat does that mean for the left how do they try to rebound from this how do they try to come up with some counter narrative\nI don't hear it yet all I hear as rage and noise and anger and if this continues on if they don't have any real counterpoint to counter punch for what Trump is doing\nI worry about what their next move will be because I Know this it will not be rational and it will not be in the best interest of this country that we know for sure\nI I tend to think that we could be facing some kind of October surprise along the lines of what they did with cabin on the very end of the nomination process\nIt's not enough that they don't have anything they'll manufacture something they will create whole claw some means of trying to take take the the Trump Administration down a few notches at least enough\nThat they have a successful mid term election I Can't tell you I Know what it is I don't\nBut I get the feeling that they must be cooking something up\nBecause they they never give you any sense despite the economy as strong as it is despite all the different things you could point you that that has happened last Eighteen months just good for America period\nThey never or reflective on the situation in an honest way\nIt's always Trump lied Trump cheated Trump is a liar and a cheat why haven't we seen his taxes he groped women without their consent why does he have you know such tan skin and and it's crazy orange hair and all this other you know blonde hair all the ... they just hate him so much they don't look at this for what it really is\nAnd I do think that the the rage moms or anger than ever because they are reaction to Trump's success they would like you to believe that they are\nAn opposition force their hash tag resistant they stand up for Trump but that's only part of the story the other part of it is that they are now inflicted\nWith self doubt they won't talk about it they won't share with you but how could they not be this was the man they said was incapable of leading incapable of running the federal government and capable of being a successful president\nAnd he is blowing away the critics right now\nThat's got to be a strange place for them to be there obviously not adjusting well to it there have been sore losers from the start but now I I think the Trump is living rent\nFree in their heads in a way that it it's just going to get worse for them and I don't know where it goes but if they if they don't take it leaves the house\nAnd I'm ... I'm telling you that because of what I have a cabinet I'm starting to feel like maybe we could pull out a surprise you eat in the you know the pollsters over at a you know five twenty eight or five thirty eight or whatever it's called now they're saying to think about twenty five or thirty percent chance of Republicans hold a house\nThat's not enough and I think it's a little higher than that too but we shall see aid for for a nine hundred to eight\nTo five eight four four nine hundred ... we have a ruckus show here in the freedom operate out my my buddy ... joined to talk about\nJust what the top of mind with him and this week in politics we both got Dr Sebastian Gorka I wanted to get a whole bunch of my uh my favorite guests and on the line here's we've got ... joining a we also have soccer and Jedi really really a great up and coming\nA political reporter he's the White House reporter the Daily Caller who's going to be shedding some light on the whole Kanye phenomenon this week and we allow things also want to hear from you ate for for nine hundred bucks we'll be right back [laughter] [noise]\n\nHave you ever find yourself when sing at the week's sauce taste of some comic coffee from one of those left leaning corporate brands you probably\nAries we'll let a home with a unique out of the box speech or like a karaoke dead tar it will like homes with wine cellar cancers when a fully loaded kitchen and live a lot of good bedroom\nIssues I'm rich Dennison American pastor Andrew Brunson held in Turkey for two years has been free to President Trump speaking about the pastor before device campaign rally in Ohio\n... in the air\nHeading to Germany and then coming to the U.

when everybody was no collusion but I'll do what is necessary to get it on their spending\nTens of millions of dollars doing this and it's a disgrace that on top of that committee is in and out and the Senate and house you take a look at what they've done is they've interviewed everybody that you could imagine you could interview and then Richard Merce said a few days ago and it says\nWe've had absolutely no collusion different there is no collusion\nBut it should add into because it's bad for the country that when you talk about the vision and the country it's bad for the country\nWhen is

paying attention and realize what a scam this whole thing is what a deep state shocked to disgraceful pile of garbage this whole effort to stop and undermined and remove all of these things\nPresident Trump has been you know\nThere was a a story there was something that I didn't get a chance to tell you about her in the week the Mueller probe here's the kind of stuff we actually get\nFrom this

the merits of his presidency and therefore the party you leave the Republican Party by how things are going and basing their votes upon that\nBy any objective ... criteria\nThat we can point to the

appeals about how they would better run the economy all they do is try to tear down they just play the politics of the attack dog all the time\nThey don't offer a creative solutions I don't what they offer you as more constant nonsense about the Mueller probe what they offer is a continued national conversation on whether or not you know there's something in Trump's tax returns from Fifteen Years ago that would\nObviously a tremendous amount of of news coverage I have never seen so many people doing psychiatric a analysis with with no degree in psychiatry never meeting Tanya but just watching this on the news you got a lot of analysts talking about this one to the White House feel like this was a pretty big success all things considered\nSo the White House staffers I mean the ones who are most concerned with policy ... obviously had been in a way to buy it they they're saying you know why the president and detracting away from his great we with Brett Kavanaugh but the ones who are a bit more culturally a chair and\nKnow that you know more Americans saw that clip ... than anything else at the end of the day you know if you were to go around\nAnd ask somebody you know universal studios like they used to duty on on on late night show and be like who's Brett Kavanaugh most people are not going to be able to tell you but I can guarantee you people saw that clip with Kanye West up in the president's perspective\nHe's using the star POWER UP Kanye in order to talk about you know talk about criminal justice reform it really was kind of a of a hilarious moment in the oval office although it was funny to be behind the scenes I was in the at the White House\nWhile all that was occurring and I saw that the pool they select group of reporters that day\nCome out from the oval office and they were just I mean they were blown away he could feed on her face and they were just\nSaying this was wild and one of the camera guy told me than the thirty years' that he's covering the White House Thirty Years' day to day it never seen anything like it\nI can believe that [laughter] that's probably I think that's probably as a safe bet or what are we expecting tonight that Trump's out in Ohio I mean he's he's kind of the secret weapon on the campaign trail for the GOP hadn't into the midterms isn't it\nYeah I mean the the amount of coverage scrutiny that his rallies get it's just an automatic boon to any candidate who is running because the people that I've actually told me before other campaign that one of the things they love about when the president comes as you get national TV coverage you know when is the last time\nThat age you know some house candidate in uh Ohio State\nIs going to be getting into ... major Fox News viewership and and the president directly plugging him that helps with their donations it helps with their brand awareness it's free media it's one of those things that the president or the president loves doing relatively using the bully pulpit\nTo push candidate in terms of what he's going to say I have a pretty good idea you know he he's been having a saint campaign rally now for basically the last two weeks almost every single night he's got one tonight he's got one\nTomorrow night you've had one I think five nights prior and it it just it's a it's an hour long its rockets he talks about the flag he talks about his record North Korea he loves to bring people inside the room and it just it's a very high energy environment\nYeah I've certainly picked up that there is no low energy Jeb vibe at the Trump rallies or that is that is absolutely the case of what what are we what are we expecting by the way I'm On the policy side for for next week is there anything that that that you think is going to get up on the radar either from the White House side or do we do we know they're really going to\n... or ... rather some of those documents Trump talked about that if anything we should be prepared for this coming week\nYou know I I I don't think that there's much that we should look for just because lawmakers are all out on the campaign trail they were desperate\nThat last ... last night to push through those judicial nomination so the Senate could go home everybody's focused on reelection that being said uh you know in terms of on reduction that's something I you know I've been asking a lot of questions about at the White House\nKnew African president about that right I mean you ask them about the reactions the oval\nYeah absolutely I I asked him a week before you did that and and I you know that's something that we've both been interested in but the issue is that he had he had to take the issue over to the inspector general and I asked their standards about that in the last press breathing that we had and she refused to commit\nTo a timeline of before the mid term\nSo for now I don't think we're going to be seeing anything in terms of those on redacted documents that I really don't expect you know knowing the inspector general Horwitz\nHe he is very uh very cognizant of up dropping things and politically sensitive times and he does take quite a long\nTime in order to do these reviews so it's probably not coming anytime soon what's the best part of being\nThe White House correspond to be in the White House all day soccer\nA vast part is just ... it can be there for a ticket to get yelled at by it rock\nLike we were yesterday or stuff like that one of our what our alley where we were just standing there I mean you're you're standing there waiting for the people to come in your ...\nAnd uh somebody ... Iraq which I thought it was funny to all of this Iraq Iraq are you going to fire or do you think Trump's you're fired yet that's what he said he should fire all of you before well\nThat's amazing so by the way it usually as a as a as a New Yorker and as a journalist I feel like you've always got to take the um you know act\nLike you've been there before attitudes all things so I I Would very rarely be like oh here's a here's a person of a prominent let me take a selfie with him I Would judge no one for going up the kid rock and beyond that 'cause I have a selfie 'cause this kid rock\nYeah exactly it's like that it day to day of it oh if Jim Brown and here it rocket here uh you know Tom Brady rotten ground out ski or you get to meet people and talk to people that you you'd never your wildest dream\nWould be able to do and then on the other hand you also get to talk of the president the United states and you get to ask him questions on the most consequential issues of the day that\nWe got to be the most on President in all history to get to have a conversation with I mean I Know you were in the oval recently out the over ... recently it's a it's like the Trump show you really don't interview him so much as you try to guide this this one man phenomenon as he is speaking\nYeah it really is a force of nature and and it's like you said you you you you you'll throw out there and he'll latch on to it and then he'll he'll flip it around three hundred and sixty degrees and then go another one eighty in another direction and you you try and flipping Ninety two a little bit of where you want to go and you just see what it is\nAnd that that really is exactly like I said\nWe we love the ... it's just one of those things where you can always get an honest answer out of ... it's it's hilarious\nI think yesterday or two days ago somebody asked him and said have you talked to the Saudi about you know the current situation with this is missing journalist probably murdered journalist and he just said I don't want to say that yet and\nWell\nYou know who did you talk to you that I don't want to say but at a very very high level and he just started going into all of the discussion there is the vote you know what you see on TV is absolutely what you get in person\nThe other ones that give me one favor soccer can you spread the word over at the Daily Caller where you're the White House correspondent that box accent as an open challenge to anyone on your ping pong table there can only be one and I think I Will come out of the ... the Victor\nOkay I'll read that where it's definitely not going to be be arable but I oh okay I have a few chat that we can put up against\nYou you you sell your Daily Caller ping pong champion that that the ping pong champion up the hill dot com wants to piece alright you spread the word alright alright I meant saga good work as always have a great weekend we'll talk to you soon thanks for having me bought checkout soccer's latest Daily Caller dot com team quick break we'll be right back\nPay seen one of the things that make the show so special is the exchange of information that we have day in and day out I get to talk to you use email you call in you write to me\nAnd that means that we're constantly learning from each other and we're also able to share our conservative values and spread all kinds of ideas but you don't want to be locked out\nFrom social media sites for doing just that if you want to social media sites that doesn't have any of the left wing bias none of those quote conversational health moderators none of that stuff\nSnoopy dot com is for you maybe dot com is a totally new totally free social media platform it allows you to connect with other people post whatever you want\nAnd it's a place where you can enjoy the freedom of expression without suppression from administrators gets a place for discussion is valued at a place where your opinion matters sniffy dot com free joined for all set up your account today as an I.

policy discussion in this country but has to say that you know he's he's crazy what strikes me as a a really under handed a nasty way of of undermining his argument\nBut then when you when you listen to some of these kinds of you said it's not that he's crazy it that you could maybe say he's crazy like a Fox and we did it that he actually hit home with some of the things that he was saying the
