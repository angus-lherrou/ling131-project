I can tell you having watched the interview shoes and she's a liar because she changed her statement from what the official statement was you don't get to go from oh I I was one declaration saying that Brett Kavanaugh spiked punch at a party and then say well he was standing next to the punch it might have spiked it\nI don't know if any do saw or how many of you saw the Jewish wedding interviews aired on NBC NBC which also we may get to later has\nVarious versions of an untrue story trying to say that Kavanaugh was causing problems about the Ramirez testimony just a second woman didn't testify just give us warns name but the rumors allegation but hold that\nThought for a moment sweat Nick\nIs the one who says the Kavanaugh was present for gang rapes and that there were gang rape parties in the DC area sweated also well I'll break down all of the reasons why she's\nI don't think she's mistaken Dr Ford made the mistake and I think she's a very troubled woman\nI think that she has a lot of issues and I think that she may which she makes clear by telling us that she's got as you should just happens to blame her she was on Brett Kavanaugh but I think Jews issues completely apart from Kevin ... but she may very well believe what she said and as I've told you hear\nI Witness testimony leads to a lot of innocent people going to prison I with his testimony can be very problematic on its own\nUm but sweat Nick is not confused sweat Nick is not somebody who just is\nTo be ... and ... might be making a mistake that's destroying someone's life\nHere's just a part of the kinds of things that she was saying this interview and then and then I'll tell you why I Know that she's lying and then we have to evaluate what was the third person that the media treated as serious and said oh gosh this needs to be investigated if she's a liar\nDo we get to look at the second person who also has a shady story and say you know maybe there's a pattern here maybe all of these leftist females who are coming forward\nAt a moment of peril for roe v Wade maybe they're doing it for political reasons or we're we're not supposed to have that conversation bowl I Want to have that conversation\n'cause a man's life his reputation his honor his dignity hand in the balance hang in the balance and day a Supreme Court seat hangs in the balance as well\nHere's some of the sweat Nick interview that aired yesterday play to\nWhat he said well I'll tell what happened when it happened to me I didn't put ten and say to gather\nThat Ali said boy outsider room congregated together sort of like an outlet\nAnd I didn't know what was it ... ... ... a lot of laughing I'm falling in line outside or wind definitely huddled by Doris or I didn't understand what it could possibly do that\nAnd the ... anyone to get their way they're watching out numbered\nIn our whole and farm outside that door\nOne thing that hindsight insulated bottles to have [noise] I Would say [noise]\nI it's just too coincidental\nSo I think we had something ... we we got we have crossed wires there for a second but you heard sweat next talking\nLet's not look at what she says I don't have time to play the ... minute interview it's not worth it because he's just a liar I I can tell you what you lying about she's saying that she thinks that there were gang rapes are she's making the allegation that there were a gang rapes going all these parties because there were boys huddled outside of rooms\nAs she ever been to a party with teenagers were drinking beer they all huddled together has she ever been to a party were teenagers are you do have a drink seven fondue whatever they're doing they clump in little groups all over the place I remember this I used to be cool I used to go to parties\nThere was nothing about what she says it makes it as a game of she claims that she was raised in the ... I'll I'll put that whole that whole conversation aside I Would note she hasn't named anybody that she's been raped her\nOther than Kavanaugh who she says she thinks raped her how could you how could you sleep at night saying that somebody might have rape you when you don't know\nHow could you do that\nShe doesn't know I assume that means that she either blacked out or she's claimed that she was drugs but then why is he bringing his name what makes her think that he was involved if she doesn't know he was involved you see what I'm saying it doesn't make any sense\nWhy is his name even coming up then because he happened to be at this party by the way I don't believe she ever even saw him at these parties I think this whole thing is a complete an author I Know this is a fabrication now\nDoes she pepper and some details here or there about if she's from the area did she go to a party at some point I mean she can claim that some of this stuff might be but it's true in the Vegas and certainly not true in a criminal sense she went from saying in this interview that Kavanaugh\nSpike the punch which how would that work\nHe spikes the punch everyone's drinking from that okay so he wants to get the girls drunk she sang right so you can take advantage of that means but but I mean everybody's getting drunk these are high school kids it's not like the guys can be drinking is a ... you know he's adding a little adding a little boost to it to make a little stiffer\nOkay they're drinking ... so they can do that he can't roof the the big bowl of punch because that means you'd be roofing himself and all the other guys and girls that everybody right it'd be like poisoning the only water source you have well if you have to drink from that too it's a bad idea so her story is idiotic\nDoesn't make any sense\nFabrication that that's why that's why when you get into the details at least doctor former smart to say I don't remember I don't remember all I Know is that he did this she doesn't really remember anything other than Brett Kavanaugh did this that's all she remembers\nThis woman tried to do all this other stuff but the story was too complicated it's you can't keep it straight she claims that they would show up wearing their high school uniform they're Catholic school uniform to these parties no no they don't\nI went to a a Catholic school or private school in Manhattan we used to parties and parents were gone we drink beer and\nReally kegs but you know we'd get into all kinds of booze people weren't showing up wearing their uniforms that's just weird and\nAdded that detailed to make it seem authentic but that's that's wrong that doesn't ring true\nAnother detail that came up in the course of this never mind the fact that as I as I've already said she's changed things from are sworn statement\nShe is telling details are telling us details that don't make sense she's saying that Brett Kavanaugh maybe kinda she's not sure raped her which is not something that a person who really believe they were raped by this person would ever say\nShe also graduated a few years ahead of cabinet she's in her twenties and she's going to parties uh Fifteen or sixteen year old high school parties no no I'm not saying it never happens with people in college don't go to the the high school parties with sophomores in high school that doesn't happen\nI was in college not long ago that would be considered strange\nAnd she's the adult these are high school can I can tell you this when I was in college I Know that every female that I was friends with at my college if they were at a party of high school kids and they thought the girls were being roof eat and raped gang raped\nThey call the police right away right away you got to remember there's a power dynamic here at a a twenty two year old has a lot more maturity and\nWould be in a much stronger position to take action or would feel much stronger position socially when their party of no Fifteen and sixteen year olds\nI coached high school soccer I was twenty two and my kids were Fifteen or sixteen and they thought I was the adult and they were a bunch of kids I wasn't going out doing keg stands with him this is the point is it doesn't make sense she's lying\nIn that interview she gave was obvious it was a disaster anyone is still believes this really turned into an intelligence test\n'cause you you can't say oh no emotionally I'm really connected to her no she's a liar so if you're not smart enough to figure that out I don't know what to say\nTwo thoughts on this and then

doesn't like look you could find people in college didn't like me to they were losers they were jerks but there were some of them you know they probably say oh yeah a buck was you know he was bad they say whatever to trash me if I were running for office of any one of you went to college is they could find somebody especially in a really politically contentious time if you're conservative everybody\nLoves to bash among conservatives oh gosh makes you the hero of a lot of cocktail parties really does\n\nBut I think that you might see flake vote no regardless of how that shakes out and so that it comes down to Collins and Murkowski\nCollins and Murkowski Murkowski no votes I think Collins realizes that she's done in the Senate if she votes now she's done that's my impression that's my now as I could be wrong\nMurkowski though strikes me is more transactional rent or Murkowski is a little more whatever's good for forget about the Republican Party forget about whatever principle she's a spouse in the past\nSo\nThat's that's part of my concerns and then you also have this is continuing narrative and this ties into what I think is they're trying to build an escape hatch for flake you see they can't get Kevin on the rate they can't convince any normal reasonable person the cabinet was above gang rapes or that or that there's any evidence running this because there is no evidence\n\nBut you've got to remember then there's the Mazie Hirono senator Geraldo from Hawaii there is the approach that she has which is just\nWhatever we can do to criticize this guy to take him down a peg to make him look small after we should do whatever we can investigate about him we should investigate IRS Mazie Hirono on the ice throwing allegations play twenty\nAnd I can't I Want to ask you about these developments we found out overnight you live the Donald with the ... and ... cabin on through ice in someone's face during a bar fight when he was in college you feel that that is in any way just qualifying for someone who's in a Supreme Court [noise]\nThis is why we need in the eye of the nation because there are a lot of allegations and for its really are about how he behaves is drunk\nSo that is very relevant and the trail of himself as actively choir boy\nOr is there much contradicted by is his ... for example in college and some people who knew him and I still why we need and FBI and the reason why I'm calling from one for like ... ...\nMonths what\nI Do think that there's a strong case to be made that center Verona was the dumbest woman or man in the Senate I think the dumbest human being in the Senate that's a very that seems to me to be a strong case right now the evidence for that is clear\n\nWe need an FBI investigation of capital because you might have thrown ice into someone's face during a bar fight Thirty years ago\nThirty five years ago who can say that and not feel like a moron really\nDon't don't allow yourself to assume even for a second well she's on TV she's a senator she can't be that she can't be that silly right maybe maybe I'm being harsher no you're not being arch honor\nTotally missile total and complete a missile but\nThis story about temperament analyze the reason that that\nTalking point is something that I Am analyze it for you there on the show\nIs because that's not going to convince anybody you got people that have Kavanaugh or because you know he's a white male white male privilege and you know it was a front row and he's a he's a conservative and overturn roe all that stuff and you can people that say no I'm actually a constitution list and also I Believe in the rule of law\nYeah that's our team\nNo one's going to change their mind about this guy based upon the alleged ice throwing into incident of Nineteen eighty four\nWhenever it was no that's not serious New York times during a peace right now on how he was part of a like party planning or something back in the day in New York Times doing that base whoa oh gosh you know he was a\nCollege kid I mean they're they're adjudicating his beer drinking and his social life and social habits from college when he's a fifty something year old man this is what the New York times has been reduced to a joke a disgrace times also\nHad Emily Babylon reporting on Kavanaugh as a quote reporter when in July before any of this happened she came out and said she opposes him because of the threat that he poses to civil rights\nAnd women's rights I'm short too of course that's\nThat's that's a given you can assume that book by creating this storyline of temperament and oh he's a he's\nA belligerent drunk he was mean he's a bad guy that's not for any normal person to change their mind one way or the other than that it's\nAll about getting an escape hatch for flake and maybe Murkowski\nOh we don't want to look let's put forward we agree both flakes word is good for nothing I mean he could come out today I guarantee you I Would vote for capping off this has done and we don't have any more derogatory information I still wouldn't believe\nUntil the votes happened we do know guys a coward an absolute wet noodle spine coward\nBut if they can open the storyline you see how it goes oh we need somebody who's a more bipartisan pick this whole process has been tainted the country's two divided right now\nSo in response to the left waging an unprecedented part as an assault on cabin on all of his supporters and and all those around them in the entire system and all the women dressed in The Handmaid's tale is costumes and putting

spirit of bipartisanship that's what I think's gone up happening I think flakes going to be a no vote at the end of this whole thing knowing that yeah I still receive a lot of\nViciousness from

that\nBut the truth is nobody really knows what's gonna happen right now with the election the truth is that it\nCould go either way and we're over a month out from election right our way of my as my date yeah oh no yeah month and a couple of days over a month out from election day Senate this wherever and start saying the same thing it's an eternity in politics\nBob well chill it all comes down to turn out you know blah blah blah all the same stuff a lot of political pundit is not telling the same things people keep asking me I I don't I mean I certainly hope they're probably gonna win but and you know what\nThey're probably gonna do it it's not like I think the world is going to be a perfect place we don't have any problems anymore because politics is interesting it's about human interaction and a way of resolving conflict between people in a way of joining together to do some things that makes sense for all of us right but at the end of the day\nIt doesn't determine who you are what your value is you know this is the problem with the Democrats love the show personally wrapped up in your party and all that stuff I mean I I'm wrapped\nUp in principles of their ideas that really matter to me or you know justice and truth and these things that it sounds like I'm given a speech to be high school president or something but that you know those things matter to me I think the geo peas doing a good job of the country they should stay in power because they have been doing a good job it's not perfect not not\nBeyond reproach but yeah there's some very very positive things that are happening and that that's one point I wanted to make here and in terms of what we've seen with Kavanaugh I I Can't say what the reaction is going to be because until you see the reaction then then you\nSee the reaction you're not in a position to really assess whether it's going to have an impact if Canada doesn't get through Republicans better send a message for the good of the country better send a message that\nThis will not stand this aggression dude will not stand that's what has to be said\nAnd that means preventing Democrats from taking the house Democrats take the house it's going to turn into one long endless investigation and impeachment fight\nThat's the only thing that's going to be out that that's the only thing that the Democrats are really going to focus on there's no ... no policy agenda they are going to be all agree on\nWe'll talk later about who they think they're going to run for the presidency but we're a month out from election day and I have to say this week which\nIs hopefully going to come to a close with Kavanaugh's confirmation but if it doesn't have that could be the difference maker in the midterms\nI don't believe this other side of it I think that this is wishful thinking and the Democrats that women will turn out in huge numbers if Kavanaugh gets on the Supreme Court I think the only women who really believe the capital's a bad guy and a Kavanaugh's a you know a predator and that and that you know women should be believed all that stuff all that clock trap rhetoric that you hear\nThe women who really take that to heart and are mobilized to vote as a result of it hated Kavanaugh anyway this is like all the senators are saying oh it does we need to have you back beyond us occasion and that'll decide well you decided before\nAny there's even if you decided before the hearings happened to you know coups and find Sunday we're never going to vote for this guy\nIs all this is all the charade it's all ... Democrats as it forget about the due process where the allegations of sexual impropriety they made a complete mess of the normal fish Senate hearings right they they made it\nIn August or Seventy Boston released their software out is don't look back and goes to number one\nThe I ...\nIn the\nMay not be found [noise]\nIf you are hearing that you live in an area of by the Asian longhorn beetle and invasive species that's destroying our trees but you can look for signs and stop the na\nNa\nNa I found\nSome signs of E. A. O. B. R. die inside pulls I'm tree trunks a sort of like material called ... and the bill itself with a long black body of whites\nThe farm I learn all the signs and how to report them at Asian longhorn beetle dot com that Asian longhorn beetle dot com\nObjection plump founding board member Americans project and my new podcast as wrongful conviction available on our heart radio and wrongful conviction I interviewed different exonerate every weekend and help them to tell their incredible stories of tragedy and triumph\nAgainst the possible uh you've got to hear to believe it wrongful conviction from my heart studios available now our radio [noise]\nGot something to say back to the Donald you roll years of\nIn politics has certainly about all the Democrats are boxers home\nFor conservative talk talk twelve hundred [noise]\nEspecially if you're a what the person is doing is the more difficult thing to do usually whenever anybody asks me what's going to happen in Washington I'll say my general prediction about politicians is what's the easiest thing for them to do 'cause that's what they're going to do a this was not the easiest thing for Jeff liked to do with the easiest thing for him to do would be just to vote\nFor a cabinet to get them out of committee and that's the end of that but he held his vote ransom as it were basically saying you can have my vote but we need a week to do this FBI investigation and that took whether or not you agree with that that was a gutsy thing to do when it 'cause it made every Republican in the Senate mad at him\nIs the most overrated thinker in the news business I Would wager he's entirely wrong here with his analysis on\nThe Stephen Colbert show that's absolutely wrong it is the opposite what Jeff Flake did the flake out as it were is the opposite of courage because flake had already said earlier that day that he was going to vote for Kavanaugh the reason he did not was that he could not take the heat", "show_name": "The Buck Sexton Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Newton", "day": "02"}
