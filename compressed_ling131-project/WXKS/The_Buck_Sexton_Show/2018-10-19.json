expressed concern over election interference citing Russia and China in a Chinese and Iranian countries trying to interfere\nAdded no evidence that voting or broke downs were affected state and local

little bit of mentally and you get this greatly magnified effect because the media wants to excuse Democrat Party wants an excuse for why Hillary last thank God it with a whole Russian meddling nonsense but\nNow that they've convinced a lot of Americans that already won election was changed because of this ... this is highly repeatable you can do this over and over it's not that

state or or in any meaningful way or was this just\nThrowing out there some means and some fake Facebook stuff and that shifted perception you can never really gauge how much impact that shift had but

looking to undermine democracy the great irony here\nIs that because the last thing the Democrats hyper ventilated so much about the last Russian interference campaign everyone that comes after this is likely to be greatly exaggerated in the minds of a lot of people\nAnd now whenever ... whenever one side of the political aisle loses there'll be at least some faction within it that can say she change election you know that's what this election was\nMarred by outside efforts to try to change things\nSo and I would also note that the Russians and the Chinese maybe even the Iranians they're going to get more sophisticated doing this to\nTheir they're not going to just stop that these are relatively it minor and knock us space but campaigns\nAh some of the other things that I've been

that so it's all about Trump's stoking fear and fear people in the south Europe ... round people do say you know anyone who's non why did they say all the same things all the time\nWhat is the Democrats solution to this I mean that's somehow we never get to that question we never get\nTo post that we never get to hear the answer is what we hear a lot of flowery rhetoric a lot of about you know what we need is what we need a comprehensive immigration reform right what we need is an immigration system that works the immigration system is broken\nThey say all that stuff what does that mean what does it mean how do you fix it other than amnesty\nDo they want the border to continue being as it is okay let's not even get into it as\nSomething vis uh open ended in and widespread let let's take it at the very straightforward level of what you Democrats want when it comes to this caravan of people what is their plan\nShould the United states government say oh okay four thousand people who are just going to show up in a mass at the border should be allowed to stay in the country we should just bring them in\n... I I think that is what they're they're just an old at the process for something they're all from Honduras well we know they're going to say your way of Honduras is very violent we don't want to go back we just want to be in America okay and you say All right well\nYou know we've got one for four thousand more people yes of course right we've got run for when you say room but what does that really mean\nYeah we've got the space hobbies\nLate we've got a lot of open spaces country but people need resources and they have you know they want they want political represent\nAsia they it's it's

remember what it was ... when you had to deal with Hillary all the\nTime [noise] Ah yes Hillary you probably think to yourself like most normal people would oh Hillary is run for president unsuccessfully twice there is no way that she would be show\nDiluted and so self involved in so self important\n... that she would run again\nBut all I Do listen to that buck Sexton fellow sometimes on the radio it can be quite an impish little little dude and uh she has been saying for the last year regularly that Hillary Clinton may run again and I keep saying I Know everyone can say I'm Crazy\nI Know everyone's going to tell me I'm nuts but guess what a you know it's got my first time that I can think of at least twenty Eighteen you have a top\nA Clinton aide Philippe Reines who's a veteran spokesmen and console yes\nThey are saying that yes it's a it's\nPossible here's resent his political quote it's curious why Hillary Clinton's name isn't in the mix either conversational orange former former polling as they twenty twenty candidate\nShe's younger the Donald Trump by year she's younger than Joe Biden by four years is it that she's run before this would be Bernie Sanders second time and by the third time is it lack of support jihad sixty five million people vote for her\nIt was a mistake for Democrats to punish Clinton from mistakes you made and twenty sixteen shocking to last up to her being a failed candidate isn't over simplification she is smarter than most sharper than most she could raise money easier than most it was an absolute fight to the debt\nWhen asked about the likelihood of a running rains responded is somewhere between highly unlikely and zero but it is not your\nNow let me tell you something right now are there is a very very higher than zero much\nA realistic possibility than they're willing to talk about uh [noise] that she will run and that's why they're starting it's as you are right now in terms of what the public really we're expecting one what they're trying to do\nIs just start start rehabilitating that perception they have to take it upon themselves to\nMake the case which is what I hear the Hillary wonder if I've been telling all along\nThere's an entire apparatus of people around her who believe that the height of their careers would come when she won that election they have not gone away they have not achieve what they set out to achieve which was to get those different jobs they all have the drapes picked out for their offices they were ready to go\nAnd that was all taken from they believe taken from them by\nThe Russians I they believe taken from them by this uh this unholy alliance between ... and Trump and all these terrible shenanigans that went on behind the scenes or so the narrative is I've been telling you is that the only way to set right what happened in the past the only way to make it all better\nWas if they were able to now bring Hillary back and make her the president yes she will be the third time around but give Felipe rain some credit here he's telling the truth about her age about number of times running it makes more sense for her Hillary to run that Biden or Bernie\nMakes more sense first woman candidate won all those she beat burning in the last primary\nBut this is also how desperate they are for a candidate that\nThe case for Hillary from a Democrat perspective the case for Hillary is more rational and the case for most of the other candidates that the Democrats are thinking about right now and they just you know what it is they just can't stomach it\nThey just feel like they had to just show down a lot of nasty stuff\nIn order to push her once again after Obama came out of nowhere in that primary defeat or they they have to do this or they had to do it and there was a recognition I think deep down with a lot of them that they may have to do it again\nAnd they will they will I'm telling you I think the chance that Hillary Clinton runs right now you're really to give Vegas odds on this is more along the lines of\nTwenty five percent I'm not saying it's likely but I'm saying it's a serious serious shot that she decides to run\nAnd mad wouldn't that just while\nWe can replay twenty six you know election in twenty twenty\nAnd all the same cast of characters all over again [noise] I mean I'm I'm a I'm not sure if people would know it would be a ... it would be a ratings bonanza\nAnd the good news is folks that\nAre very confident that if that were to happen and guess what\nTrump would would again [noise]\nI

there\nWhat why why why would someone who lives about his drinking and\nHe didn't this was one of the more pathetic lives about Kavanaugh he didn't lie about his drinking\nHe said he drank sometimes sometimes too much when you start to try to play around with well look it's not too much it's like when ... such a law that is completely subjective and that in in no\nRational universe does that would that qualify as perjury or but you heard people saying oh there's a lot about his drinking he did on live about a strict he said he didn't blackout and he said that you would drink too much sometimes ... the Democrats went so far is to try to put\nHigh school and college beer drinking on trial in an effort to try to stop cap and it was pathetic which goes to show that they have no scruples nothing stops them nothing prevents them from you know just going all in on this stuff\nBut that was Ted Cruz in an airport being heckled I'm being you know yelled at by people who are truly angry at him and I wish I could be there well for a lot of reasons one is you just said them Ted Cruz didn't do anything to you\nKnow it would never occur to me\nAnd I know never heard any of you listening to this to go up to a stranger and just start getting up in that person's face and yelling at them\nBecause of what they can for public we went to ... it just would never occur to me now I'm not saying to talk to somebody to gauge somebody interview was elected represented ... but this is yelling this is heckling citizen trying to have a conversation\n\nAnd this is not\nMeant to in any way be constructive they're they're not engaging Ted\nCruz they're mob and Ted Cruz this is what they do they like to foreign mobs and\nAlso reminded me when she started to say all these women came forward and tell their stories\nThis was a sensitive area of the whole Cavanaugh a situation that I don't think I spoke to much about it and it's not because I didn't I was unwilling to her didn't want to you I just had so much else going on there\nBut you had all these women who were coming forward and we're telling their stories of being sexually assaulted and that's if if any woman who wants to do that that's obviously her right and she deserves support and sympathy but\nThat created this very dangerous to due process phenomenon of well it it because\nSomething bad happened to me and the person lied and got away with it or because I didn't bring charges a because someone attacked me speaking again for other people who are in a third person it means that this this case should be influenced by that\nThat's that's crazy this is just\nA it's not just a foul it's not just a logical fallacy it's a dangerous thing for people to believe you know imagine if I had a uh I I was on trial for a stealing right I was in ... for fraud\nAnd people started showing up at my trial and they were saying well someone stole from me so he must be guilty\nYou'd say well that's irrelevant it's completely irrelevant but for the last it was\nA widespread talking point a whole cabinet thing you'd hear people I I I saw other people that I Know from the media world too are there are other talking heads you said you know I I Want to come forward and talk about my sexual assault now and again that's fine for context and background and all that\nBut just because somebody was sexually assaulted by some guy who's not Brett Kavanaugh does not mean that that has anything to do with whether Brett Kavanaugh was guilty of any kind of sexual assault or not this is really elementary stuff\nAnd that this was a something that people are losing sight of and a lot of people are losing sight of juice I think went to show how completely over the top and an over politicize\nThis entire thing had had become\nA there there is a a mass hysteria in this country that Democrats have reached this point where I don't think that the king\nA logical about many of these issues they just want to show emotion they want to show rage and they want to signal there bridge you to the world and they don't want to engage in debates or or discussions on any of this they just expect\nThat other people will listen to them other people will hear ah their thoughts and because especially on the left are so much claiming a victim status now whenever and saying oh I'm a victim so you have to listen to me ah their expectation is that they won't have to justify\nThese ideas that that the justification just comes from the emotion behind it and from\nThe identity of the particular speaker of the justification then becomes well because I feel this way um everyone else has to value my thoughts on it because I suffered some terrible tragedy it was very\nTroubling to see this happening and it's a mob mentality and to bring this back with Trump is saying here you know do you want\nPeople who easily get swept up into mob thinking to be the ones who are\nElecting representatives who also whip up the mob in this way and if there's been not nearly enough condemnation of the kinds of tactics that the left has been embracing recently and I think there's been a lot well we know there's a

coverage they had on new day somebody's idea I Know I Would argue with that she had an exec on Twitter and they got turned into a few new stories that a few places because\nBook them play it's you know wants to try to try to bring the rockets they better they'd better come correct as they say because I Am not I'm not going to surround with you you sure you're going to ... syndrome journals employees I Know what goes on over there been over there um but but you know you look at look at what happened with the war on this\nAnd you know when they started their coverage of it was just ...\nYou had Alison camera like during the results have been dropped that sure\nOh yeah the results show that lives with word can't do math or isn't very smart or both or or is just I think I think delusional if that's probably the most likely outcome there but Nikki Haley of did a good job with the Al Smith dinner\nAnd it was she had some great opportunities there and she took them with with some good jokes and I do think that her\nMove all long hair has been she's good with cheese and good with the Trump people she's going to help Donald Trump won a second term she is a perfect candidate to run a once Trump has had a second term I I don't people are saying pants I don't know about that I don't see parents at the at that level but\nI've I've been wrong before us as everybody who tries to make these kinds of productions\nA meter British as I did say at least on rising earlier this week that a minute you would not go Steven Mnuchin the treasury secretary would not go to Saudi Arabia after what happened with the show gave we don't have really much the way new developments on that I Would note\nThere are still people who are spending a lot of time covering the story but there's not\nA lot out there in terms of new verifiable\nA facts and I've got to say um you know that's it's just going to be\nAt the end exactly what I thought which is that they the Saudis are going to say that this was a rogue operation um but beating up on Trump was clearly what a lot of this has been about all along\nAnd I you know and and Bernie Sanders sometimes I get a little caught up it was like the only person who's ... who's like burn the it's burned these now and the mood is right for socialism um but then I remember that he's actually a far left progressive in and we'll say a lot of things that are\nVery annoying and very very untrue a and he went after Trump on this whole issue of of ... is that in the last twenty four hours and and I I was disappointed in the burn play sixteen\nHe's not such a tough guy has to deal with is billionaire friends in Saudi Arabia [noise]\nShorts tortured and murdered courageous journalists not such a tough guy or what\nYou when you say this to people who don't care what a person's raises don't judge them by their skin color and love a lot of women in their lives and treat women with dignity all the time and are completely respectful of the women they just started to tune out all the rest of it because\nIt's cheap it's dishonest at this as a line of attack against Trump and against everybody around him is just going for the lowest common denominator and H mud slinging in place of ideas mudslinging and in place of policy I I had to I had to laugh without one I don't even know was was combination like\nThey're like kicking monks full of let's say liberal ... but I'll just like like my church right now are real like it's like why are they doing this to me\nI Wish that they would also get a little bit more of a sense of humor a sense of humor that didn't revolve around mocking and ridiculing are Christians and a white males all the time I mean white males we can take it up and the stuff about Christians that they do is particularly a nasty you know that's really it's not meant to be laughing with its laughing at all the time\nBut liberal don't have a sense of humor anymore and this is why you see these polls about political correctness and how anybody who's paying attention to it was a political correctness is a cancer in our society\nIt is destructive it doesn't add anything to society doesn't make us better as as people it just creates a incentives to make politics all about personal destruction and also allows some of the most\nAnnoying stone faced on happy miserable petty\nPeople in our society to get to write and then rewrite rules that all the rest of us have live all the time I've done it before\nIt's really important Trump got a lot of support in the early days because he just said political correctness is garbage you just said it's garbage you didn't say oh you know we shouldn't be so politically correct but I understand why people are coming from it no no no it's garbage energies\nShow destructive to society so destructive to uh our ability to talk to each other as normal people stop normal conversation I get frustrated I city or I Do the show there's so many times where I think that's a joke that I could make it'll it'll run through my mind as I can make that joke and Ninety nine percent of\nThe people listening I'll view the wonderful people listen to this show who do really mean so much to me every day Ninety nine percent of you will be like oh that's really funny or maybe maybe even you know Ninety percent of you would think it was funny nine percent of you would think man wasn't that great\nAnd then one percent though of the lips listening or one percent of the people that includes media matters and some of the other maniacs that listen to the show out they would have a problem with it and they would\nTake it and try to twist it and use it as a weapon against me and it's just not worth the risk\nAnd it's really hard to do any kind of comedy is really hard to ... because comedy entails risks right you're you're you're trying to push founded you're trying to I'm I'm not a comedian but I Do some funny stuff here and there\nAnd I certainly wish I could do even more amusing uh takes on commentary on politics and I do but it's I just know that\nYou know you you run up against this uh this third rail that's a mobile third rail either they it's not like it stays in one place you don't know how close you are getting to it because they'll change the rules and they'll change what's going on around you based upon their ability to get you when they want when they want to get you\nIt's just a show on inspiring going back to the\nThe way that they're using these calls of racism and massaging these allegations as really a primary a primary means to get people to go out and vote for Democrats that's the best they can do you know I I they're\nThey're talking about health care a little bit and basically Trump is a racist in Trump's massage and this and all these other things you know they they also seem to forget that we haven't forgotten\nThat\nBill Clinton hey ladies would see a little while is once you come over who wants to take a selfie with me just watch where that goes you know I just don't know it's got a mind of its own you know Bill Clinton's out there as somebody who is still very respecting Democrats articles in fact
