gonna get fooled and immigration again they're talking about doing this deal and the deal is going to be amnesty and then we'll see what happens for your security well see what happens with this

feud with Senator Elizabeth Warren is continuing today Massachusetts democratic called the president creepy on Twitter after he said he personally wants to administer a DNA test approved for Native American ancestry\nWarren said the president is scared trumped meantime said in a series of tweets this morning that the DNA test Warren joke was bogus and that the Cherokee Nation said in a statement the DNA test was useless tomorrow's the last day to register to vote in Massachusetts for November's midterm elections\nAnd more information is available on the secretary of state's website Sears disclosing more than a hundred and forty stores including several in New England help they filed for bankruptcy yesterday and Massachusetts the Sears at the data mall will close and other Sears locations in the region closing or in New Hampshire and in Connecticut\nTonight we can expect a clear sky and lows to the mid forties and moral mostly sunny skies and high is getting into the low sixties\nWith Boston's first News I'm ... junk twelve hundred [noise]\nGiving them the benefit of the doubt I'm Lisa like Sarah Fox news the president saying he spoke with the Saudi king and crown prince and they continue to deny any involvement and the disappearance of journalists amongst the show ...\n... critic of the monarchy when did the Saudi consulate in Istanbul earlier this month to five routine paperwork related to was upcoming marriage and hasn't been seen since\nLaughable argument I mean the notion that Elizabeth Warren is a Cherokee or could consider herself a Native American is is ... laughable to any serious you can be laughable I mean you should laugh about it\nAt the wall Street Journal said if she is a person of color than words have no meaning she is as far from a person of color as anyone could possibly be\nAnd yet she still kind of ... she she still clings to it but then there was just wondering well did she receive any benefit my friends there is so much circumstantial evidence that she received a benefit that it is also laughable to suggest that that she did not\nUm that she did not have the ... and I'm not somebody who's a school snob but she did not have the academic pedigree for law school do then going to be a professor at the University of Pennsylvania an Ivy League school and Harvard\nConsidered to be the number one school and and really the number one law school in the United states no way that happens\nIn last the hiring committees think that they can\nThey can but it's very important them when they put out these reports very important that they have a Native American on the faculty\nThat's a big big deal for them they have their pick they can have anyone they want\nAnd that's why I also why would Elizabeth Warren list herself as such\nEnlisted gave her some benefit it's a bizarre thing to do unless you are gaming the system the only reason you would do that if you were Elizabeth Warren and clearly not a person of color would be to game the system so it just defies belief it's completely\nRidiculous I can tell you that I spoke to because I have access to a lot of Democrats at the hill or and I spoke to Democrats that I work colleagues and I got to say there are all they were all say it's too though this is just\nThere's no excuse there's nothing you can say about it\nThat she thought that this prove their case was completely insane a Donald Trump also\nWe had one more to it on the sea rewrote thank you to the Cherokee Nation for revealing that Elizabeth Warren sometimes referred to as Pocahontas is a complete and total from [laughter] [laughter] sometimes referred to as ... as\nHe has defeated really progressive front runner for twenty twenty before she was even able to get into the race officially\nAnd he defeated or by getting inside her head and forcing her to make one of the great on force political errors of all time I have never seen anything quite like this uh this ... this is truly truly astonishing\nUh but then the president had this thing today later on that I got to say I don't know what's going on here I Want the president focused on what matters and I want the president on policy among fighting back absolutely\nBut what is this thing about\nWhat is this thing about a ... horse Oh yes here's what he wrote federal judge throws out Stormy Daniels lawsuit versus Trump Trump is entitled to a legal fees\nGreat now I can go after a horse race and the third rate lawyer in the great state of Texas she will confirmed the letter she signed she knows nothing about me a total calm you know it's interesting Trump really hold out here that that this is\nA lie start to finish and I have thought that ah that that there's no way that she's lying about Trump just because of the detail and they look they do know each other they have had contact it's not like the\nKavanaugh allegation and want it's nothing there's nothing criminal about anything that's even alleged about Trump with Stormy Daniels ah or I should say about his contact with her and people are saying was all the campaign finance that's pathetic the no no shot no chance um\nBut I got to say now I'm thinking you know is it is it ... why why do people jumped to the conclusion that Trump actually has had this affair with her um what what I said I shouldn't say jumping conclusion I think that's obvious but why are we so sure\nLot of people in those seem very very short about it I I'm I'm just ... I'm keeping an open mind there's ... there's never been any proof offered that I'm aware of\nMeaning she's never been able to show text messages or emails running at you know that that that relates to the affair she just gave this description of him and you know there's another part of this and I'm just thinking through this\nHer whole description of Trump in her book it's like she wrote description based on what she knew the media would want her to say which was just be really a ... and degrading and nasty toward toward the president so\nI'm you know I I had thought that the president has has before he was the president I had thought that maybe he\nAnd I hadn't strayed from his marital vowed here and I was willing to say look\nI care about what he's doing as president and the political movement he represents I'm not I'm not sitting around trying to judge all politicians by every every action in their lives um bad\nEspecially because as you know the only do that the only enforce that against Republicans they won't enforce it against Democrats but there's also part of the things well you know\nMaybe there's something else here it it just I I'm thinking about right I'm thinking about it I'm not totally sold one way or the other but now they they they are all focused on the present referring to a woman as horse face\nYou know I this is why I say Trump was winning and winning and winning this week and this feels a little bit like a field a little bit like an unnecessary distraction and and not something that I Would really want the president to say but that said\nMaybe when you're when you're this when you're this ... when you're in his position and you're fighting against everybody and and it's all an uphill battle or maybe they're just going to be these you know is it's not they're not all going to be a hits right they're not all gonna be great\nSo that that's a part of it too I'm maybe he's human which we all know he is maybe he's imperfect which we all know he is a and I think that we should be able to have that chalk\nAre among those of us who really support the president and his agenda which I clearly do and still we want to say okay I kinda wish you hadn't called some woman horse race on Twitter I just I think that that's yeah that's a little\nThat's a little bit beneath where where a president to be that said he's been crushing everything else all week and been amazing so you know so he's not perfect he's pretty darned good though so you know I'll give it to him on that and that's I I think that's an okay standard to have for politicians and it was not perfect me pretty darn good\nIt really is um and I I've seen recently some some conservatives that things start to come around to this notion of why do we have to why don't we have to pretend like any politicians perfect\nWhy do we have to pretend like anyone is is beyond or not just pretend but hold them up to this standard of of moral pro bitty that isn't there for anybody else really in public life\nAnd looked at me Trump is made more mistakes than a lot of other folks in that area but he's also clearly got a gift for politics for entertainment and he is he is the man for this era\nOr Elizabeth Warren let ... let me tell you why I say let me tell you why I say that instead of just saving and I let me break that down a little bit wider here's a perfect example of why give Trump a lot of leeway why I cut this president a lot of slack\nOn some of the tweets are some of the stuff he says about you know people here or there that I feel like maybe or it's going a little far here's why\nIf it weren't for someone like Donald Trump if we had a Mitt Romney instead of Donald Trump and Elizabeth Warren was going to be twenty twenty candidate it would just be him getting attacked\nAll the time our guy getting attacked not fighting back and Elizabeth Warren getting away with being a huge fraud\nWho advocates for all kinds of class warfare while she's making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year as a she was as a tenured professor at Harvard law school I think a quarter of a million dollars a year you may have plenty of money she's got plenty of money\nUm and and all of that false miss all that fall so that she's out they're peddling that people would really go unchallenged in a meaningful way and the worst of all if she were to win the presidency against a Romney like figure\nYou and I would have a harder time\nPutting food on the table paying our mortgages or in my case rent you know paying bills taking care of family taking care of medical bills would all be harder because of Elizabeth Warren because she has wrong ideas because she's self involves because she doesn't\nUnderstand the way the world really works and because she's benefited from this system\nThe system in place that the left holds up at all costs of some people you know get a get special privileges some people will get pushed through now and and others are told well you have some form of privilege so you have to just suffer in silence I'm Sorry\nAt Trump has saved us from yet another progressive destruction machine this case would've been Elizabeth Warren's while I'm laughing about the whole thing he's also don't the nation a great service by making sure that Elizabeth Warren focus Hondas does not become president\nNew functionality will also

since the incident\nLocal police confirmed that I suspect had had been identified in connection with these with both the salt and said charges will be likely filed in the coming days\nThe attacks took place actually Democrat former Labour Party suspended a communication staffer for one week for writing in a Facebook post that Democrats would quote bring Republicans to the guillotine in the coming

getting them confused\nRand Paul was talking about this and and I think that you know ... if if you were a Democrat we'd have to hear about how Rand Paul's a victim which he is a more than one assault both of them life threatening because of his politics in the last twelve months\n\nDemocrats don't want to hear about it but there's no stores there's no pattern you see there's nothing going on nothing to see here they would tell you that this is all just all just the the right wing manufacturing dishes stereo about mobs right they don't like the term mobs as we know from CNN they don't want to hear about mobs\nHuh what we call angry large groups of people that are threatening and sometimes attacking individuals on the street which we call large groups of people that show up in a concerted effort to intimidate harassed threatened scare and upset people when they're trying to have a meal\nThat's not a mob is no such thing as a mob but then again Democrats ... warns that charity so there's that\nWe are entering a very dangerous period here\nSome of these threads that you are seeing now some of these trends toward a radicalized and deeply angry left it's not that all of them are anti fought that enough of them support anti follow that we have a real problem on our hands\nOr they won't be able to handle they will not be able to process like normal well behaved adults if they don't at least when one branch of\nCongress back if they don't at least get one part of a a a they don't get the house majority that they've been banking on\nThey're going to freak out\nAnd there's enough of them now who really believe that Trump is because the media likes to play this game Trump is a fascist he's basically Hitler my former boss the CIA Mike Hayden thought it'd be funny

either the amateurs with their bully thing [noise]\nBut yeah you're\nRight and the great that's how the left thinks these days folks\nThat's a nice little window into the people that think that they should mob politicians at restaurants that they should spit on conservatives at rallies that they should start fights and then act like oh it's it's the far right coming for me\nThat's what's going on here you heard that man make fun of domestic abuse your your ... your boyfriend will punch you not like that said that it's good to her husband who died in nine eleven according to the woman the clip it's good that he died this guy said it's good that he died then referred the NYPD as a bunch of ...\nI used to work for the NYPD I Would oh man I I I Would love to hear this guy say that stuff's so my old colleagues in the in television\nHopefully when they were off duty see how that goes forum says the MIT NYPD the largest police part of the country one of the most affected by the way one of

the Russia investigation what a shock\nSo here's somebody who is a government employee who thought you know what I'll do to try to jam up\nSomebody in Trump's orbit I've read today that they think it was about Michael Cohen's finances they had the wrong Michael Cohen though there's more than one\nA and released this information to is believed buzzfeed news and bus be of course then there's this whole story now that's not confirmed yet but that is what I've read they think happens here\nA show quote the criminal complaint against ms Edwards allege that she leaked materials that led to about a dozen articles\nIn twenty Seventeen and twenty a gene pertaining to among other people in matters Paul Manafort Richard Gates Maria Butina the Russian ambassador to Washington a unit of rivers on holding a Russian company entangled any money laundering case\nBuzzfeed reporter who isn't I okay to the budget is an identified the charges is Jason Leopold who is listed as an author on all twelve articles cited in the complaint\nSo here's a woman who is taking\nFinancial remember these are folks this is not reports about crimes did you say is he's a suspicious activity reports and this is the equivalent of releasing raw FBI background investigation and then using it for a report oh you mean what kind of like the stuff you might get for the ...\nBut this is highly confidential\nLegally protected for good reason because you can destroy someone's business with this oh yeah yeah so and so it's got a few a few suspicious financial transactions you know what that means nothing\nIt means the government flags it and then they might look into it a little bit it does not mean that anyone has broken the law in fact the vast majority of them do not involve law breaking but here's somebody who\nForty year old woman thought that she would leak this information to the press to hurt Trump and his associates that she would break her oath\nThat you would violate the law and ruined her career and now I now probably her life along with it because it was justice at important to try to get Trump\nDo remember anybody during the Obama years from the federal government who was ... it explicitly to go after Obama and hurt Obama do you remember anyone\nWho was leaking classified information or sensitive information about individuals and businesses right this is stuff since then reports for our own on anybody it doesn't even intelligence world stuff is there are there can be suspicious financial transaction just because you put a thousand dollars in cash in the bank you know maybe a lot of banks sale\nThat's why they keep this stuff so close hold that's also why the IRS actually tries to protect people's information because they understand that if ... if it gets out there it can do a lot of damage that people's reputations will be harmed\nBy this so you have to wonder how many other\nFederal government employees were willing to break the law and share information with the left wing press to embarrass the administration river that there was ... from what I understand\nThere was nothing in any of this that\nTied to Trump was just people around him understand this though it sends a message sends a very clear message if you worked for Trump if you work with Trump\nYou could be the subject of this kind of government activism somebody within the bowels of the bureaucracy with high level sensitive access could decide to release information about you too I'm not saying that will happen to you but now it's something you have to think about isn't it\nAnd it's not just people that worked for Trump how vocal you're going to be in your support for Trump how willing argue to stand up publicly and say this and then what is the cost that you would encourage you be willing to incur in order to continue speaking out\nTheir waging a form of psychological warfare with these kinds of activities oh just this one oh how about the guy who ... a bunch of ... a Republican members of Congress who worked in the Congress but all their private information out there that's the kind of stuff that makes center Rand Paul's wife sleep with a loaded gun under her bed now\nThis isn't a one off these people are doing this stuff who leaked the conversation between General Flynn and the ambassador to or from Russia circuit gives all yet\nWho did haven't found that person yet I think it was very senior Obama administration holdover I've got some guesses horrific abuse of national security power and the destruction of individuals privacy\nThat's how they play the game they will break the law they will weaponize the government against us and then we'll turn around and say why are you\nSo mean when we win because we have superior arguments [noise]\n'cause we're

and thousands of people more than we can hold his enthusiasm like we had at you know the last election twenty sixteen which was quite a spectacular day in the evening\nI think we have a lot of enthusiasm you know I keep hearing about\nThe enthusiasm the blue wave but I think we have tremendous enthusiast\nI Do think we have a lot of enthusiasm and I spoke to Donald Trump junior yesterday and sure enough\nHe uh he is I could tell very optimistic about how it's looking for the Republicans going into the germs you know I think that he's I'm really feeling it when he's going out there and meeting with all these different people in the campaign trail\nBut you know the this is going to be very close is going to be very very tight indeed and there was one thing that Trump\nBrought up in that same interview uh think of that same interview that that is really got me a concern and it has to do with what happens if the economy takes a nose job and if it if it's\nCyclical I don't think that's going to necessarily be on Trump play a clip six\nOr ... or anything in this country or say oh there's but there's no inflation is very low on tape Powell I think I don't want to read is that goes to bed is arranging rages too fast and it's independent so I don't speak to them\nI'm not happy with what he's doing because it's going too fast because he looked at the last ... numbers are very low\nThis is going to result in some painful stuff going forward ah this is going to be an issue and I would say this there were people that were writing books right after the crash in two thousand nine saying things like you know this time is\nA this time is different or how this is a unique and uniquely dangerous moment in our economic history and and there was a there was a real clarity around we're in uncharted territory here starting in two thousand or ... or so\nAnd I think we've been a little complacent for a while now even with the debt Twenty one trillion dollars we've reached this point where there's all this prosperity Trump is cutting regulations cut taxes so much good stuff is happening\nAround the country and sure enough I'm what I think we're starting to see now is an understanding that there is going to be some rough water that's a very gentle way I think of saying it as a result of unraveling all this\nAll this money we put out in the system all this chewy and these things that have been done last ten years to keep the economy going to try and and do you know Keynesian stimulus and you know you have people like Krugman who are saying oh this stimulus isn't enough right that was the problem them but we spent all this money\nAnd you have an enormous or a series of enormous debt bubbles a student loan debt trillion dollars credit card debt trillion dollars auto loans especially subprime auto loans very very high uh we're more indebted now that when we were at the time of the crisis in many ways\nAnd you know cheaper or deeper in debt we are deeper in debt when it comes to national debt and we haven't really fixed any of this stuff structurally now be impossible for Trump to fix it right away but here's my concern that I'm not\nI cannot do economic prognostications I really can't right that's not something that is in my daily way political stuff maybe national security stuff shore\nBut here's where I see there being an issue right now and ... and that's your chew John and uh all these other groups out there these far left wackos\nAre considered very fringe will you'll notice that the the media apparatus in general is very slow to condemn them and generally uh does not seek to um\nYou know talk about them any more than they have to and I think it's because they do have a certain ideological solidarity with the right they maybe they don't agree with all of what ... does that all the rhetoric but they liked that they view themselves as resistance to Trump bright they like it they view themselves as\nI'm opposite oppositional and willing to take action about all this and with that\nUh I I think we have to remember that they could very quickly become a much bigger part of the political conversation if this is the ... this is what worries me if we have a major economic\nA reset right if the debt turns into a crisis gave all of a sudden we we get to the point where the rising interest rates means that we're paying more and more money just because of the money we've already spent my interest payments on the debt struck a crowd out the private sector and the and the rest of our economy", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The
