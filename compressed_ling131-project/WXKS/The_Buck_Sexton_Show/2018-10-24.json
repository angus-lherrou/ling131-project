about you know oh this guy not as handsome as they say is and everything because you know I\nI hated it just so annoying when people in media if you're there to talk about policy or substance knows the good old days you\nKnow I get that all the time I'm like you know I'm just I'm I'm not trying to be underwear model I'm just trying to talk about politics and policy but that's the first thing that people go for that said I really don't like having to hear all the time about how Bayh Joe was so handsome and the guy is okay\nYou know can can we can we live in can we live in reality you know people say these mean things are always talking about ugly Ted Cruz which is why I think Trump called them\nA call ... beautiful last night do we do we have a oh no we don't answer he called the beautiful Ted Cruz she people always make fun of Ted Cruz's appearance which is really really nasty and petty checkers is fine looking guy you know he's trying to be an underwear model either\nA debate or work is supposed to be some like piano model it's just put this is what I mean Democrats they can even be trusted with the most basic reality they ... they will come toward and distort

[noise]\nI can tell you I think a lot of the night that they were\nSuch an important narratives there because it's true\nThat the enthusiasm and the way I started out this segment talked knew about Trump is based on the result is based on the reality the enthusiasm is still there for Trump because here we are two years in\nAnd he has delivered on promises he has\nFollowed through years if you're a concert or a constitutional conservative he has given you choose fantastic Supreme Court picks confirmed to the bench and was not easy he had to fight Trump could uphold support from travel as we know he stayed in the fight he stayed in that bunker with cabinet till the end\nAs I Know you did with me as well but Trump has has the liberal in the economy he's delivered on judges deliberate regulation he\nWill deliver I Believe on immigration and the wall it's just going to take some time he will deliver on healthcare if in fact Congress will go along with them but you know there are there are limits she can only push these policies Congress has to act\nNo and unlike Obama Trump doesn't plan on just saying well Congress isn't giving me\nWhat I Want so I'm going to give it to my political party even though it's shutting the constitution the process\nBut I think that's all very very important are now as ... or ... or ... you also pulled them over rated O'Rourke is\nDonald Trump knew better friends know worst enemy no shortage of nicknames are overrated or was what he was what he dumped him a beautiful in Austin, Texas ten which I think is a better political may protect cruise but then he talked a little bit about Elizabeth Warren who's gotten so much attention recently for one of\nThe most astounding\nPolitical own goals I've ever seen 'em on and Trump is not

Warren big fraud he says I won't call her Pocahontas anymore because she's she's not in fact a Native American\nAnd he's not going to play along with her fraud maybe focused on to this would be a a more and more accurate description\nBut this is what you get from so many of these Democrats you know they they complain about Trump they say oh he lives in his personal behavior so Boris ...\nBut so many of us recognize that Trump\nIs who he says she is that Trump presents himself as we all see him to be you know\nHe is is I'm going to call him I Know there's a book on that right the blue collar as the blue collar president a blue collar billionaire you hear these things but he has a a\nCommon common touch and understanding common sense would say and all these big Democrat phoney baloney politicians are they they keep pretending to care so much about the average everyday folks but then we find out that it's really just all a game to them it's a ruse it's just yet another hustle\nAnd then another ... so I I think that last night was a great a great showing\nBy the president and it was a reminder first of all the ... heard here folks going to lose by ten points or more ... going down by double digits\nIn Texas\nAfter all the oh they do these amazing they do play guitar for me in writing me a song\nNonsense nonsense\nA but also it was a chance for us all to remember why do we

I you know I'm consistent on this you do not hurt people hit people attacked people or worse because you don't like their ideas\nYou don't do it nobody should do it knowing justified and doing it it's disgusting it's illegal it's immoral and it's if\nYou really are a true believer in some ideology at least in America right now it's truly counterproductive because right now\nIf you\nTake those kinds of actions your entire side might have to bear the consequences so to speak so it's it's wrong and and and evil and stupid on every level\nBut it's the Democrats who have been trying to blur the lines for the last six months or so and it's the Democrats who have been saying all those things about President Trump since he became president\n\nAnd as I've been telling you if you really believe that we are descending into fascism as a mainstream left wing writers will have been saying if you really believe depressed the United states is a threat of starting an unnecessary nuclear war\nIf you believe those things then taking extreme\nMeasures does not seem like such a leap does it they have not been pushing back on Trump for tax\nReasons they have not been pushing back on Trump's for you know health care with any of the same vigor and seriousness and ferocity as they have on all these fantasies that they have conjured around Russia collusion and twenty Fifth Amendment a Trump is crazy and he's going to start a war\nAnd now and now they want to pretend that oh it's it's Trump's fault that this happened\nAnd this is right from the very top this is right from the top of the Democrat left wing power structure in the media Jeff Zucker himself\n\nGeoff my assistant is going to be overheard by a friend of mine declaring that CNN has declared war on Trump that's right that happened you have ... now I can sit here and say without any feelings of\nOf ah she position is\nThat my criticisms of CNN all stent\nCNN is a dishonest news organization that is pushing an agenda that age furthering division in this country that lives about the president addresses it up as news coverage and that has a lot of coddled babies like Acosta and others\nWho refused to accept that you know if you want to be taken all kinds of shots at the Republicans and the president maybe they're actually going to criticize you back with words with words they're allowed to do that\n\nBut that doesn't mean that I can also sit here and say I\nAm happy to hear that no one at CNN was hurt\nThat I have friends including some very dear friends who still work at CNN and they even if I hated everybody CNN which I don't I Would still pray for every single one of them to be fine and come out of work on skates and go home to their families and I do feel that way and I know you feel that way too\nBut there's something deeply wrong there's something unseemly and unethical about immediately trying to make it all will you can still criticize us and hope that we're okay you can't condemn\nThese bombs

I don't really respect the Clintons but that's a different thing I'm allowed to not respect that doesn't mean that I Would ever advocated violence against any political figure anyone for their

that\nShow up for sale in the morning I hear so much bladder and so much nonsense and as long as it's anti Trump you know the audiences you it's good to like the the works really it really is an embarrassment but you know people people believe what they want to believe unfortunately this world my friends\nAnd you know I'm here in the swamp and what you find out more and\nMore is that so many of these folks that that think that they're standing proud for the truth in the media they're really just it's all about their own their own brand their own paycheck in their own access all the time they don't know what they do if they were doing this job and they just want to get his cause you to power responsible\nAnd if they're not in the Trump orbit they want to be as far away from it as they can so they can be in the anti Trump orbit and there's very few people that you can try to strike any kind of neutral balance anymore I mean this is just that this is a media war\nWe're in the midst of a media war the notion that those who started this war in the mainstream media are the ones who are not calling for civility is just preposterous\nReally is um I went to argue about the mobs and
