Michael\nBoth the deadly threat [noise]\nAnd going into his second term after he beat Romney just thinking to myself what is it that so many of my fellow Americans do not understand and I had to wrestle with Adam grapple with it\nSo much of it was objects and so much of it was Romney's unwillingness to rise to the kind of fight he was in he didn't really understand Trump understands and he rose to this occasion so to Capitol I was proud of both of them and proud to have defended both of them in this whole process\nBut the biggest takeaway for me from all of this is just how insane the left has become\nLess ... has turned into a kind of mass panic\nA widespread delusion a collective nervous breakdown it's no longer enough for people to disagree with others based on politics they have to shriek into this into the air\nThey after bang on doors they have to attack old men holding signs they after harass people in the streets chase them out of restaurants and threatening letters docks members of the Senate threatened the docks their shoulder\nThere was word over the weekend of senators who had been a ... with threats against themselves against families against grandchildren of senators\nA Fox anchor was ducked into the subway we'll talk later on about that a writer for Stephen Colbert bears crappy late night program\nTweeted out that she was quote just glad we ruined his life about Brett Kavanaugh you had protesters clawing like crazed animals at the Supreme Court doors\nAnd yes you even had Taylor Swift come out in favor of the Democratic party in Tennessee T swift how could you know she's very serious ah this is something quite different or the left\nHas lost it uh they they no longer seek to meet us on a battlefield of ideas we're reason even plays a role nowadays emotion it'd slogans is the mob not just\nCheering on one side but Jim ... the other demanding the arrest of political opponents demanded the harassment of people trying to serve their country people who have served honorably in some cases\nFor decades they don't want to just beat us on the battlefield of ideas they want to be just literally with sticks and fish than rocks\nThey threaten violence because to them ideas that shattered their own sense of their worth and their wellbeing they are triggered by our our thoughts\nAnd that triggering they think justifies violent response we saw this in some of the antics of anti fall over the weekend attacking people on streets acting like the maniacs they are\nAnd we see this from the way that the less reacts to political defeat we want conservatives won the good guys one with capital and notice there's really not any gloating\nThere's not an endless victory parade going on television\nThere is in the sense of now that we've beat the other side in the war let's go round and they and that all the survivors were not rubbing their faces in it although a little bit of spike no football perhaps as an order\nBecause to us this was just what shouldn't have been done this was just this was right life goes on there are other battles to fight there are other arguments to be had but also\nIn the conservative mind today in America you can have a separation between who you vote for what policies you support what you what you believe in your politics\nAnd who you are and your day to day life I don't mean that you don't live your ideals and beliefs but I mean you don't feel the need to only exist in that fear of what his political\nTo be a good conservative you have to\nFocus on things like shooting people with respect acting\nWith honor and decency and kindness things that the leftist media tends to sneer at things that pop culture dominated by the left residuals\nBut you realize that you can't be a true conservative without doing those things and it's just so much easier in so much more self gratifying so much more satisfying to the self\nDo show up and scream about how ... will be the death of millions of women just scream about how the patriarchy is alive and well dressed in stupid costumes and carry idiotic placards and act like the country is falling apart and democracies in peril\nBecause process is still respected in the Senate\nBecause the presumption of innocence as a principle that we have maintained understand this is they have gotten away with this plant if the left and managed to sink Kavanaugh it was the beginning of the end of any kind of\nHonest forthright and decent discourse in this country\nBecause anyone who was an effective spokesperson for the other side anybody who was able to wield power and authority on the right and stand up to the progressive project would have been a target for the most vicious smears and character assassination\n\nAnd there would have been this sense that once the allegation is out there that's all that's required the allegation he's the verdict and because they were deprived of that secret weapon\nBecause the less isn't going to be able to do that they had a complete meltdown click with all of it\n[laughter]\n[laughter]\n\nWe\nWere on the phone [laughter]\n\n\n[noise]\n\nShe I

something different now\nWe're not arguing over what the top marginal tax rate should be with the left today\nWe're not arguing over how we should pay for various health care entitlement programs although that's a part of the discussion that's not where the focus of the fight is now the main effort the central argument has to do with whether the last ... defeat\nWhether it can handle the fact that it's not always going to get its way and in fact the aid if you will of the progressive left right the ... the part of the mind that is where instinctive\nImpulses lie the end of the progressive left has become violent and dangerous an unreasonable and perpetually outraged it's just not going to lead\nTo good things for any one this is not going to lead to happy places for this country and I do fear it's only going to get worse because instead of learning from their losses the excuse them with delusions\nInstead of recognizing that the American people are not in fact on their side\nThey take the position that they were treated you see it was Russia or it was that big mean\nMeaning Mitch McConnell or it was some other thing that they conjure up to explain it was the electoral college now they say the very same people who for about a year and a half\nOf Trump's presidency have been saying he's undermined institutions he's destroying our institutions he's undermining our democracy

that Dr ... what she told us and that she was sent that um we have a presumption of innocence and that's kind of trade and when I looked at the lack of any corroborating evidence including\nNo evidence from her very best friend who was present at the party I could not concluded that Brett Kavanaugh was her essay and one\nIs trying to have it always and you can't say somebody as credible and then completely question their story she struck a nerve to me and what she said and how she voted because that's political power to 'em that if somebody who is pretending to be a feminist but that is fake feminine\nFake feminism a former Hillary Clinton hack their Psaki said waited that is she who consider no no I'm Sorry she's a former Obama administration spokesperson for the state department but she was I'm sure she's run that wasn't too\nBut notice how quickly they will just attack attack women who do not go along with the left wing feminist agenda\nRight away they'll attack viciously too because when a woman does not go along and really undermined the power structure\nIt's like within the Islamic faith with the radicals if you were in a ... if you had been within the faith and left the hatred that much more because you are more of a danger because the faithful will see or departure and think why did that person do\nSame is true with radical leftist feminine they see a woman who breaks ranks with them and their response is oh\nMaybe maybe we need well they say we need to destroy his person right away because other women will say hold on a second\nMaybe I can think for myself to maybe there's something else here on and there were there were some people who came through noxious Lindsey Graham who I've given lots of props to already on the show there were others um I I gave Jeff Flake a very hard time I think that he gambled with\nThe Kavanaugh nomination or by delaying it a week some would say though had he not delayed it they would not have had the votes I don't know if that's true or not but it's certainly seemed\nLike a a cowardly move at the time to me that said\nWhen push came to shove flake did the right thing here at the moment he had to do it so I'm not saying you know he he's not Spartacus either\nBut he deserves credit mansion in West Virginia also deserves some credit but let's also keep it real West Virginia is a state where the sentiment was overwhelmingly\nIn favor of Kavanaugh and against this obvious political hit\nCollins from Maine yes I think she did the right thing here I also think that all the radical leftist feminist types calling her terrible names and sending her hateful messages for weeks and weeks trying to intimidate her\nTo threaten her into going along with the leftist feminist agenda I think that didn't help their case and then that brings me to\nMurkowski now I don't know about wait wait before getting Murkowski Hi can I Hope I Hope that people in her home state deal a deal her quite a review for what she's already down five points\nUh but I really do hope that they manage to find a way to hold her accountable for what was an unbelievably lame decision um you know North Dakota in ... should out hike camp as soon as possible moment\nAnd then that leaves us with Murkowski All right now\nMurkowski is not somebody who's ever been impressive to me at all and I'm not surprised that she she pulled this stunt and she's not up until twenty twenty or twenty twenty ... twenty twenty two\nUm she's not up for quite a while so her calculation is clearly she can massage this issue later on you know take some heat now and then and then she'll figure it out or take let's see now really Mitchell figure it out later I Hope the American people are accountable\nUm I Hope that the people of Alaska K. E. N. I. up in the house you're listening to the show alive I Know you guys up there in Anchorage give you a high five\nI Hope that you do everything you can to mobilize and make sure that she is at the soon as possible moment no longer in the United States Senate for what she did here it's not just about the ... for for me to the notion of having a conservative on on the Supreme Court that's important sure I'm not going to pretend like\nAnd they won't even have these so called the dose of the Senate or in the media which you know media is a bunch of ... but they wouldn't have them say that they shouldn't do that at least she just dodge the question the answer to this is like you know the answer to if somebody ask you if you're a God you say yes\nYou know maybe that's from the answer to each somebody or should somebody follow the person into a restaurant and harassment because of their politics\nIs related you know in his owner quickly without question\nNo but\nShe won't say it because she knows where she to say that\nIt would offend the less it would offend the activists the Emily run a cow skis and to Amy Schumer and others you love to just pray and you know it was the model of the parade around and get arrested by the big mean police ... this is part of their political culture now\nThe shrill ... the nastiness the shrieking the anger the rage the the public demonstrations of psychological distress that's a defining characteristic on the left now\nRight to have really a a nervous breakdown in public that is what left ism has become and\nYou notice it here and this is we've had all these different examples you know your real Rand Paul ... wife wrote a letter about\nHow not only was he attacked and ... almost beaten to death by a lunatic left wing or\nA who just hated Rand Paul or was it was not some you know neighbor just we just have a ... attack and from the island was killed\nHe had pneumonia he was terrible pain and that's after some lunatic left wing Bernie Sanders supporter credit shoot Rand Paul on a baseball diamond in Alexandria a Hodgkinson James Hodgkinson the shooter so maybe you should know the left likes to forget it very conveniently\nUm but you know his wife wrote about how she gets threats her church child or children get a get threats\nAnd prominent\nDemocrats make jokes now they're in the media or in the Democratic party make jokes about the attack on Rand Paul as oh so how funny this is something cute that they should laugh about similar disgusting\nI keep saying they should be ashamed but they they have no honor and so they don't feel anything when they're on or is lost it can't be debate because there's nothing there to begin with that's one of the problems when you're fighting against the law is that they don't they don't feel the loss of honor because they have not to begin with\nBut you know Brian kill me\nIs a guy that I I don't I don't know Brian at work in the before I I Know everybody in conservative media at least by reputation is not knowing them through work Muslim or personally I Know everybody dish\nAnd Brian is universally considered\nA by everyone I've ever smoked a really nice decent guy you know whether you like his uh his owner persona or his analysis that that's a road he's a nice guys just supposed to be a really good I don't know well I'm only work them or the other people I can tell your good guy Brian I can only say you know I've heard is really nice guy and I've always been\nEnjoyment or actually even if he was let's just say he was in Olbermann level jackass which is not the let's just say he was\nHe would not deserve what happened to him over the weekend where he was shocked and harassed by a couple a left wing 'cause you know there are any other kind these days activists comedians here's some of the audio from it play eight\n[noise] where's your accuser sexually harassing\nEveryone on the line [noise]\nNot on the news on that\n... from the front right if you know what I mean if you want Donald Trump did say or do felt this guy 'cause he's the only person in America that Donald Trump within [noise]\nBrian who we are criminal fritter\nGo down okay nobody got\nHurt and you think about what you're doing because you\nKnow I don't know those idiots are and when I can tell you when I say this and I say this knowing full well some point I might have to come on air and explain to you that you know I got into a a a scuffle and a lot of these media types you know they\nThey think that there are you know impervious to this kind of thing to think that that's not something to worry about but I Would not deal well with some\nA left wing hack following me into the subway look is one thing to wait outside somebody's home and do the ambush interview thing I think that's pretty tasteless I don't like it when conservatives do it either\nI think it's pretty tasteless unless there's a real news reason to do it right unless somebody's refusing to answer questions about something that's really newsworthy each different in the halls of the center it's different in a public space a public building with somebody who's a public official\nThat does you know there's a difference you waiting for waiting for whether it's Mitch McConnell or you know Dianne Feinstein in the whole the Senate building to ask a question versus waiting outside their\nHome that's weird there are boundaries year but this goes even beyond that because not only was there the the ambush interview component of this then there was the following him into the subway so that's\nReally you know you're not just going up with somebody and they walk past you you leave them alone I think that's aggressive but that's done this just following them down in the subway getting in the same subway car publicly drawn to humiliate him and then trying to kind of whip up an angry mob against him in the subway car\nWhat if somebody in the subway car you know who heard that Brian kilometers racist what if that person down and Brian space and wonder Brian you know felt threatened what if you shut that person what if a Fighting Sioux what if somebody got really hurt that's not a hard thing\nTo create as a possibility here in your mind because they have these these these more on one of the comedians\nOr creating a combustible situation they are creating a scenario in which you would not be difficult for there'll be an escalation of physical violence\nAnd you have to think that when they do this time and again when they create these kinds of situations that so clearly could turn into a violent confrontation\nThey don't mind that they're running that risk you start to think that maybe that's really what they're pushing for\nThis is who the left has become they won't deny it they won't shut this down they won't call it out there are increasingly embracing not just the politics of public nervous breakdowns and acting like psychosis who were\nSlamming on the on the thirteenth on doors of the Supreme Court [noise] but also they are the less in the Democratic party are bracing the\nPolitics of offers passers [noise] said private space

treated like a a criminal even though it's a non criminal proceeding he wasn't being a judge you would be treated like a criminal\nThe reason they were so upset though and that they would switch that

experienced what I was a student at Brooklyn College in the fifties where professors were fired because it was suspected that they went Seventeen or Twenty years old they might have been a members or fellow travelers are the Communist Party we just have to put an end to that\nThat's right this has to stop\nGoes ditches corrosive to politics this degrades and your roads political discourse and it's
