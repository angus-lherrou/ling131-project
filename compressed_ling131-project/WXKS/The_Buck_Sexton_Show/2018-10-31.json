unresponsive this morning and pronounced dead at a federal prison in West Virginia where he had recently been transferred according to the globe sources say an inmate with mafia connections is now being investigated for the murder\nSomehow gets or other pushed aside because the politics or maybe there's just some some on his confusion on the part of those who are trying to get a handle on this epidemic but we always hear that it's the priest gets prescription drugs that are pushing this epidemic for what you're telling me\n... it's it's really that these are\nSimilar to prescription drugs but there are being obtained\nIllegally and being made illegally\nSo ... is is that an accurate read of what's going on here I mean is it is being made and bats in Mexico it's obviously then not being filtered through Pfizer and then sold via legitimate pharmacies to people in the streets this is just cutting out Pfizer as ... from the picture and or any drug company entirely from his\nParents who are we so we know that there was a problem then we\nKnow that there was a problem with the pharmaceutical companies and that's been very public and that you know the dangers of you know over prescribing a opioids to patients even when you're going in\nFor a debt tool for dental work there was over prescription of opioids um we saw a rise in that not only with veterans but with ... with people across the board in the United states when when the escalation of addiction\nRates started sky rocketing but what what happened was as soon as those issues began to be regulated and of course the federal government stepped in doctors stopped over prescribing for the most part one of the things that happened was the drug cartels said wow look at this\nWe can potentially be making billions off of this and that's exactly what they're doing and not just the drug cartels but China China is also a culprit of this with that and all and I think we've been hearing a lot about that at least a little bit more in the news media\nAnd what they've done is they have created their own till they're owned pharmacies and and they made him look like the actual pills so some of the markings I was actually in Ohio talking to some of the undercover da\n... that are working there and some of the local law enforcement who work with the DEA\n... look these pills are almost identical you look at it as an ex it looks like his antics that would be made by a a a pharmaceutical company but it's not it's not a real Xanax it's not a real Percocet it's not a real actually caught\nEither way taking those for recreational use is dangerous it's addictive it and two lives lost\nBut when you see it come talented with enormous amount of narcotics that are being spilled into our streets this poison\nAnd I'd sure buck you you hear about this all the time but that in all it's so dangerous that in its pure form\nWhich has moved across the United states many times in its pure form could literally cause someone to overdose and die by just touching it and in the documentary it's explained very well that only for grant for little grains like four little grains of table salt\nOf that no could literally kill a grown man and\nWe've seen loads of this stuff come into the United states for example in April this year in Nebraska state troopers they seized over a hundred and Eighteen pounds of that and all\nAnd authority said this is enough to kill twenty six million people when we showcased\nAre ... and premier the movie here in Washington DC and then showcase did in Ohio which was which is really the epicenter we use Ohio as kind of a microcosm of the rest of the country when we showcased it they're one of the head of the DEA Mario Jimenez\nCame and talked to the audience you know the full house because Ohio is really struggling with addiction rate and he said look if I close up this theater right now\nAnd they released a small package affecting all through the air system\nWe would all be dead\nHe said so this is no longer just about addiction this is about saving our children's lives\nRealizing that this is a potential national security threat really understanding where this is coming from and not being ashamed not being ashamed about addiction we have to come out you have to talk to our kids we have to let them know without on the street\nWe have to be open and honest with one another if we're ever going to find a solution and I'm not saying we're going to find a solution to stopping addiction we have to stop this before something potentially so dangerous happen before we lose a generation of our kids\nAnd we have to face it and we have to be honest about it [noise]\n[noise] sure this this argument or tacos what is the biggest health crisis in the United states are more people are dying from this than died from the height of the AIDS epidemic or the crack epidemic in this country when when you speak to these families obviously\nGoing to be very and people would have been affected by this in any respect it's ... it's very emotional and and it's it's haunting for people there's clearly now a greater awareness of it than ever before what what is the answer what can we do about this\nI think first of all people have to find their lane everybody in ... in an all parts of the ... our communities need to find out what they can do what's their role as a parent it's educating your child\nAs a health care provider it's\nUnderstanding what's going on and be able to be aware of of the potential dangers out there and assessing those right away so we can save lives and that people we have to realize we have a problem with addiction we also have to have the right resources appropriate at the right way so that when the federal government put money\nAside for this epidemic\nThat there's accountability for it that this money isn't being funneled through the federal system through state and local agencies and and just disappearing into the bass array of our\nOf our money pit but that it's actually working\nAnd that we support our law enforcement and our federal law enforcement I Believe that as this\nAs we start looking at this on a broader scale especially with the threat of setting all especially with the threat of the drug cartels and now they're pouring this poison into our system and into our children's lives we call it not in vain V. E. I. N. not in pain\nThe drug cartels are using the veins of our highways to infiltrate and move their contraband into the United states and that and you are people's gains and into our children's games when we have to find a way to stop this we have to work with our southern partners with Mexico\nWith Colombia with Guatemala with Nicaragua with El Salvador we have to insist that they do their part and honestly there were a few people in the documentary that brought up some great ideas you know look this is not just a criminal organization this has now become a transnational terrorist\nOrganization they are pumping and chemicals that could potentially endanger the lives of millions of people and we have to start treating it that way\nWhether that's putting up the wall building the wall\nOr enforcing laws um international laws and going after some of these drug dealers that's what we have to do more importantly educating ourselves and educating our children I Can't tell you about how many parents I Know\nThat have no idea that this is actually going on on the streets they have no idea that these pills are manufactured in trailers that that our kids are purchasing stuff\nThat the drug cartels are making look like pharmaceutical a prescriptions a that what our children are doing really understand that it starts at home\nThat it starts at home and now we've got to tackle the bigger broader problem of holding people accountable\nLike the drug cartels in Mexico likes you know lower elementary do all these different cartel the Beltran Leyva and really making sure that the Mexican government understands that we're no longer playing games\nWere going to stop the flow into this nation and of course uh you know we have a lot of issues coming up at the election\nWhether or not to build the wall whether or not to deal with how we're going to deal with Mexico and our southern partners are these are issues that Americans should be actively involved in and put in their own thoughts and their own two cents and calling their congressional leaders and saying hey what are you doing about this what can we do about this to help save our country from\nThis ... this potential disaster which is already taking more than a hundred and Fifteen lived a day for working people watch the documentary\nOr would work for people to go to not in vain V.

doing\nAnd that we would all essentially they will be able to laugh at us as we all suffered the horrible consequences of having Donald Trump as president\nBut you see we have suffered the consequences of Donald Trump as president and suffering with things such as the lowest unemployment rate in sixty years the lowest black and Hispanic unemployment rates of all time a booming economy a ton of investment\nNo massive foreign wars getting started no crazy foreign military interventions\nThat are going to stand our bravest and best Americans into harm's way for missions that\nThe powers that be already been clear on what how they're supposed to end and what's supposed to happen\nThat's that's\nThose are the consequences of Trump ism and now that we've\nFelt that for two years now that we've seen it for ourselves there's a desperation on the left what does it say about the judgment of\nSome of the most celebrated names in the Democrat Party whether it's politicians or pundits or anybody with real power ... what does it say that they have been wrong wrong wrong\nAll they can do is criticized Trump's words his persona his attitude is tone\nA but they're not able to say oh look at this issue of look at this major policy issue where we're from either lied to his lied to his supporters lied to his base\nOr failed miserably no quite the opposite\nThey they hate Trump more because he is successful they hate Trump more because he is by his ability to withstand them and succeed despite all of their efforts\nHe's in a front to the left very sense of self\nHe makes them feel insecure about their beliefs and on the left the leaf and politics are tied together\nIn such a way that the true believers the left wing zealots don't know who they are if they do not have their\nProgressive virtue signaling they don't know who they are if they can't believe that CNN is objective and the New York times is a liberal and you know all the smart people all the good people vote Democrat\nIt rattles them in a way that people that view politics really just as a as a system for managing conflict in a in a civil society which is what I think conservatives that have a good perspective on this understand it to be a don't feel as\nShaken up\nAnd we see this is okay what are we getting how's it going what are the results we try to take a rational approach to it and and even if someone just passionate although I Can't say that's always the case\nI Do like it when Trump owns lives I find it very amusing I think it's very necessary to I think the media in this country will never be the same and that's a good thing I think the days of believing\nThat there is an objective neutral press that has the the center of our our media apparatus that's never coming back that's gone\nNow we now we expect honesty and trends parents do or else there will be at least\nPush back there will be a fight over it\nBut the calls for civility from Democrats the last couple of weeks as I've been saying all along\nHave been in bad faith what they want\nIs for conservatives it for Trump and for the right to engage in self\nDoubt and just stop fighting\nThere'll be no reward there'll be no meeting in the middle when the right decides to stop pushing forward beliefs and what it thinks is correct and what is best for the country all you will have\nIs the left exploit the situation for their own ends and then go back to what we saw for the eight years of the Obama administration which was rub your enemies faces in it at every opportunity\nRight the villa left under Obama took the attitude of no prisoners politically speaking they didn't just you know overrun conservatism for at least the first few years of Obama's time in office they overran the conservative outposts the number bay and that in all the survivors\nIt was rough\nThere was no good said there was no meeting in the middle there was no bipartisanship no triangulation nothing\nNow where do you believe that we should win it looks like there's so much more on the horizon that would be good for the country and the Trump could accomplish now we're supposed to listen to the opposition somewhat say our political enemies and take their advice for how we fight when we're winning I don't think so\nI don't think so\nAid for for nine hundred to eight to five you want to chat open up some lines

call\nLike I Know you're going to get on the subject of is a burst right deal and if people are informed of that for the conch\nConstitutional amendment it has nothing to do with illegal\nBirthright yep\nOh I'm In it that in death coming up later on the show but just I guess that's kind of a U.S kind of a preview of the courts have never held that that is that that is the case that illegal aliens no\nCourt has held that illegal aliens or should be given citizenship it's never been addressed by the courts before and when you really think about it that was clearly not the intent of those who wrote the amendment at Eighteen sixty six and why would that be the decision of the government now it makes no sense\nTo consider people who are foreign citizens meaning citizen of a foreign country who are not legally in this country who are supposed to be removed from this country as soon as they come into contact with law enforcement and our government apparatus\nThat their children should be automatic ah their children born here should be automatic citizens and it doesn't make sense why would we do that\nIt doesn't make any sense it was formed to give the birthright to this ... children of slaves\nOr the ... yeah the fourteenth amendment was what was for it was for yet that the descendants of slaves after the civil war was one and it was very explicitly for that purpose and it also at all no this later on it when you look at the way it didn't deal with Native American populations at the time and you know there's a lot of\nLegal ease here about the different jurisdictions and overlapping jurisdictions but it should be clear it's pretty amazing really that we'd gone this far without anyone challenging it and I I think Trump is absolutely right if nothing else we should have clarity on the issue I mean we should at least have the court's\nWing in and explaining and and I think that the problem here Charlie is with the Democrats don't really understand\nIs that no matter what once again they are showing their chipping their their hand here and we're seeing the Democrats are in favor of\nIllegal immigration illegal aliens being in this country ah yeah they always take a side of illegals in every issue on every issue and Americans take notice of this\nI think I think our president is slamming it in their face and yeah he has every right to do that yeah\nI think he's I think he's making the I think he's making them the right move on that so thank you very much Charlie for ... calling from Maryland Stephen in Springfield, Massachusetts what's up Stephen\n... a ...

they've lost a lot of union ... this is their animals towards like working class voters but but but that's not really my main point on the ... thing I Wonder and wondering is on the ... this whole birther thing got me thinking about anchor babies when it comes to welfare\nAll day because there's a crisis of a caravan coming and then two more caravans after that caravan\nUm what what do you think any idea of Trump freezing brand new welfare applications in light of this crisis until this gets sorted out because one of my pet peeve destroy a long long time is that people don't understand that a white in this country means your\nYour ability and freedom to do something it is left or right to calm down a government desk and expect money\nWell in terms of welfare and and immigrants I can say that technically\nNew immigrant including legal immigrants are supposed to be on welfare in fact in immigration law there's a there's a there are clauses about how you cannot be a a ward of\nThe state uh so you cannot be a dependent on the state and that they know and that's that's supposed to be the way that we're in our immigration system is set up as we know that's not the case\nWhat ends up happening is for example with the anchor ah the anchor baby issue once you have and as a child who is a is is given citizenship either to a to\nA legal parents then benefits accrue to that child so then you start and and it goes to the household so essentially the benefits start coming in for that child and they have to go through the adults right you don't give a a a two year old you don't give

our radio talk show\nTalk about it I just wanted to talk to you about the president or by shock is all\nThis talk talk talk\nThis is the perfect example what I'm Talking\nAbout here you have a a guy who writes for the Washington Post Eugene Scott he he tweeted out to politifact today\nAre are white males responsible for more mass shootings in any other group you hear this and and white males they also associate with the right even though there have been a whole bunch of mass shooters who are white males that were if anything political leftist but you know that this is\nThis is what do you often hear I mean this is the story line this is the way that they will\nThey'll talk about all this um and\nYet when you start to break this down and say OK okay well let's take this guy the Washington Post ... ... let's let's think about this let's say white males are the majority of shooters in this kind of ... in this country um\nTurns out that's not true turns out actually mass shootings are essentially line up with what you would expect in terms of demographic representation a for all the different ethnic groups in this country\nBut ah your ears would you find out they member mass shooting summertime an overall violence overall violence now you get into a whole other conversation about\nSome communities have a much higher rate of violence in other communities but for mass shootings it's it's pretty evenly\nDistributed um but\nNinety five percent of shooters plus I mean probably more like Ninety seven Ninety eight percent of shooters might be Ninety nine are male so as a river we're being told white males or the bad guys that we have to be worried about their the terrorists they're the real threat\nI'm Don Lemon says that's what that other guy was a radio show I've never heard of jazz Ninety nine percent of shooters our our mail in this country the country's also Seventy percent white\nSo if if let's say Ninety nine percent of shooters are male and the country is Seventy percent white but\nOnly fifty four percent of mass shooters are white then that means that there's a disproportionate representation\nOf other groups that are non why their shoes so so what point do people at the Washington Post and other places they're really making about this and we want to remember I said it's pretty evenly distributed but there's actually some\nThe outlier here is not that there are so many are white mass shooters in the country so why are they pointing to that I mean I don't think they really want to go down this road I also think that looking at ethnicity and when it comes to mass shootings is is a an irrelevant and really\nPointless exercise um but they'll laugh like to do this because they think of us all based upon our or ethnicity as as a as an essential part of identity or whether we agree with that or or not um then you get to the terrorism side as an officer and make this brief ah that\nThat the GED torch mafia a moron from

neither am I but\nI seem to know more about this and Paul Ryan among many other things in a more about the Paul Ryan a but here's what he says that the fourteenth amendment just one this is\nA very clear political and yes partisan issue right before the election we can count on on on Paul Ryan speaker of the house to come forward and this is what he does play\nYou cannot and birth to ship with an executive order we didn't\nLike it when Obama tried changing immigration laws ... and following the plain text of the constitution I think in this case the fourteenth amendment pretty clear [laughter]\nUm and that would involve a very very lengthy constitutional process where we obviously totally agree with President is getting at the root issue here which is among check illegal immigration\nA [noise]\nThe fourteenth amendment is not clear in that the language when you look at the language leaves open room right\nSubject to the jurisdiction thereof as we've been discussing if your subject to a four and ... if a foreign country can say hand that then that guy back over to us and we go okay he's yours\nWhich which jurisdiction as you really subject to ...\nI mean you know this is where he started to get it okay hold on a second and and also you know as an American when you're traveling in a foreign country if you're an American or you're traveling in France and and you're like a I don't want to pay any more American taxes would you have to do when you live abroad by the way we do that in this country they don't do it in many other countries\nAre ... and you say well I'm only subject of French jurisdiction now because I'm an French ... a French French joy all French soil or I'm always subject to do their jurisdiction we'll say none of your subject or jurisdiction so you're an American citizen\nOr jurisdiction is not just about geography\nAnd that's where this sketch where that's where this gets more complicated and there are instances already where you could be born on us soil and you could even be are legally but you would not be a citizen\nRight in the case of the sons of er and taught us diplomats who were born here and they maintain their own nationality their own citizenship so that's\nA place where there's no clarity often the courts and just for Paul Ryan to pretend that he's opposed illegal immigration when he's pro DACA he's ... this huge huge increases in guest worker programs and has just been so wimpy an immigration for so long\nAnd for him when he's not running again to come out now and say this and just get a kick in the ... to the G O P side I got to say I was I was pleased that at least at least from was was willing to call him out on this one I mean it was good to see\nThat are here we go Paul Ryan is from Donald Trump quote Paul Ryan should be focusing on all the majority rather than giving his opinions about birthright citizenship something he knows nothing about our new Republican majority will work on this closing the immigration loopholes and securing our border\nPresident Trump is completely right I'm Paul Ryan look it's one thing that ... to come out and say look there's there's a lack of clarity on this and you know we had the courts need to take this up and it it is an important issue\nBut that's not what he said he said you know it's pretty obvious that the left is right here that yeah that's right we want people to show up and go and stay in maternity hotel or whatever it's called birth hotels wherever that is when you show up and have a baby when you're a foreigner and the whole point is to get them citizenship here\nAnd you know birth tourism\n... that's clearly not with a long time but you know Ryan just can't help himself I he's the guy who clearly has all oh gee shocks I I think he is much more about Paul Ryan than he is about the party there I say and and that brings you back to how I don't accept this separation\nOf party and country 'cause I think that the Republican Party is better for their country therefore I support the Republican Party\nIt's a you know they're bringing back to that formulation for a moment and then I just have one other thing here for you I Want you to hear this is Joe Donnelly who's a who's running in the Indiana representative a or in the U.S senator other Joe Donnelly here's what he just said during the during the debate yesterday this is incredible liquid one\nWe want everybody to have a chance in Indiana and in America and my officers reflect that both on the campaign side and on the Senate side\nOr state director

want to enforce the law when it comes to people illegally crossing the border\nThey say they want an orderly immigration system bought that I Want to do interior enforcement is that there should be consequences roiling the law but they don't want to know when they get prosecuted ... at home or anything else right so yeah this is classic and then with the constitutional aspect to it have to
