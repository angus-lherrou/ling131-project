will be processed but if they claim asylum\nIf they turn themselves in a and they claim asylum they are going to get a hearing the hearing will be delayed so you'll have a ... another wave in another

right now\nIt is shown very easy for Democrats particularly well off connected coastal elite Democrats who don't compete with illegal immigrants for jobs you don't have to worry about illegal

for always and and forever for the foreseeable future least vote Democrat\nBecause they know that\nImmigrants particularly the ... people well [laughter] illegal immigrants they're not supposed to vote for members who really knows what's happening there uh but but immigrants in general\nUh tend to vote Democrat and people who come to the country and have a greater need for all kinds of government services are obviously going to vote for the party of big government the party of the state and state isn't that the Democrats\nNow why is it a bad thing for the president to say enough stopped we can't keep doing this the answers to it it's not\nBut they won't ever tell you the Democrats the media when they set up this problem they won't act like there are two sides to it they're not going to present this as hey\nWe understand is very difficult problem uh this is how we come down on this and we would like to presidents to take the following actions no they want to point

Enforcement or being told by border patrol in this case you know you're you're now going to be taken into custody and they hope to make this an emotional issue\nIf it's really that emotional for them why don't they just make the case that the imagery\nMakes for them which is well I guess we should just taken everyone\nAnd everybody everybody who has been waiting in line for years has been going through the legal process and it was respected our laws are many people who are still waiting to get into this country and who have respected our laws along I I guess they're just Trump's they don't have\nMS NBC CNN New York times Washington Post in their corner so they don't count\nAnd it's just very very destructive and it's also ultimately an issue of sovereignty\nIf the United states cannot determine who comes here under what circumstances then it's just a matter of time before the United states ceases to exist as a policy we will be a different country different political union if we don't control who comes in who goes\nYou cannot have open borders and the welfare state I think the answers are really the truth is you can't have open borders and state\nYou have something else I don't know what it is no other country in the world allows is no other country in the world takes in a million people and makes them legal and God Bless and welcome to America legal citizens year in and you're at a million a year I'm Sorry legal permanent residents and citizens a million a year\nSo a lot every year were ... million for a legal process\nAnd when when Trump says well for security purposes we're gonna take refugees Middle East down from think something like fifty thousand to thirty thousand all my gosh he's like a tell all the ... he's a monster well hold on a second\nWe're already taking in a million a year are we allowed to discuss that number changing the kind of number only go in one direction can only get larger\nIs also why yes we do need a wall because it's not realistic to expect the president's gonna keep having first of all we have a Democrat president going to do anything and if we have Trump even an office for\nIf we're lucky the next six years to try and stem the tide for current migrant marches to the border is just not realistic by sending additional forces by dealing with this on a one off basis you need a permanent barrier you need a wall\nDemocrats don't want it though because Wal first off would prove its utility very quickly and then they all look foolish or wells don't work no pretty sure walls work\nYou know if you're if you're going to walk on your neighbors' property and there's nothing there that's pretty easy for going to walk her neighbors' property in has a ten foot cement wall\nThings just got a little harder you may think twice about walking onto their property in trespassing right this couldn't be any more straightforward but they say oh walls don't work and works in San Diego San Diego sector of the border\nFence they're absolutely works\nSo why wouldn't work outs were all they don't have any good answers for you\nThey just don't want it to get built because once it's built we can see that it works and once we see that it works and it's there they can't do very much about it I don't think they're going to be successful with you know break the wall down\nThis is one area where Trump has an ... look he has an on fulfill the promise now as to who's behind this march and who's\nPulling the strings here I Know there's a lot of theories out there I I I don't know but I Do know that there's just not a coincidence that you have the largest of these migrants caravans that I that I Know of just a couple of weeks before the midterm elections\nOn the way the border this allows the media to

the president I'd states they wasted a year of our time on this year and a half of our time when\nIt's insane is absolutely insane but\nThey can get enough people at the border looking sad looking hopeless take lots of photos of lots of videos and talk about how heartless Trump is for enforcing the law that was the law in the books during the Obama administration about how the safety of all involved and also yes as a deterrent you separate people from their children at the border\nYou should reunite them but this is the process that they have had\nAnd if they do this again I Know the Trump administration's changed the way that they were going to do it because he outcry originally but if there's any separation whatsoever even a temporary separation I mean even a matter of hours\nWe're going to be told that it's heartless it's cruel it's you know it's evil it's a it's a Nazi concentration camps all over again I'm not making that up people were saying that about this\nPeople that we're still supposed to take seriously in public discourse witches\nAnd itself just astonishing\nWe are in a fight my friends and we need to understand the such the other side plays

my favorite question to ask people what is what what are you really saying what does that mean Howard in power were about to have a big election and a lot of people are going to vote one way and a lot of people are going up on another way what what is the peril the democracies in right now this is like when people say oh the first amendment is under threat by Trump how\nBecause he uses the first amendment do we ever get to hear an explanation of this is just rhetoric it's just empty it offers nothing it tells you nothing\nJust democracy is not a spectator sport gee that's brilliant maybe you could put that on a mug and give it to somebody\nWhere do we find these Democrats poor show sanctimonious so full of demagoguery and don't add anything to conversation there are interesting liberals out there they're fascinating left\nThere are people you can talk to I I I Know people were anarchists that I Love talking to you I Know people that have all kinds of really interesting belief systems in at least it's worth engages you learned something but the the marquee Democrats\nThese days it's just all pitiful it's all nonsense Booker\nAnd Warren and Sanders and bite in none of them have anti any intellectual heft whatsoever it's remarkable when you think about it what ideas do they stand for redistribution of wealth defending our democracy\nThat's not that that's not a policy solution is an interesting people have been talking about that for a very long time and get them very far I'm going to do is very bad things happen\nBut there's there's just nothing that's even more listening to most of these people about Bernie Sanders has a kind of charm it a A N authenticity that comes across 'cause you don't go up in Brooklyn so I looked him 'cause he runs that people don't know if a book and\nYou know you hear him talk about these things you say okay well that sounds he sounds like he's well intentioned but then when you start to get the things like math you go well this isn't gonna work this is crazy some really bad idea\nSame thing with all of what is what is Kamala Harris stand for whatever the Democratic party tells you to stand for what is Cory Booker stand for same what does was with Warren stand for basically the same Bernie Sanders' same Joe Biden a number warm CNN poll recently about who they think's going to run for president\nThey've got nothing\nAnd I think that's part of why there's such a desperation and why they're being violent weather attacking people why they're hurting people\n'cause they've got nothing\nI mean they have the usual slogans and the class warfare and all that but I mean in terms of candidates in terms of a bench\nKamala Harris I see here is is thinking about uh giving American families you know five hundred dollars a month you're going to hear more about I think universal basic income I think they're actually trying it now in a a trying it in a city in California right they're pushing for it out there\nThey have no new ideas they have nothing to tell people about that can get them excited all they can do is get people angry by telling them how terrible and awful or the Republicans are\nI think there are also in a bit of shock and this is where I'll talk to you or some what about the the Kavanaugh effect which is very very real these senators who are leading the charge against Brett Kavanaugh in the Senate\nMay have in fact caused the Republicans to gain seats I think you'll see fifty four fifty five GOP seats by the end of the election in the Senate and they were going to go to fifty four fifty five\nJak search

leader\nIn right now\nI Know somebody sees political analysis such crash\nSee Schmidt is among the very worst we'll talk more about he's going to get another beer and later the show he does the dumbest stuff on TV so that means that you know fun to use them for commentary purposes they put 'em on TV a lot of MSNBC though what he's saying is true by the way\nWhat he's saying is is not accurate I maybe thinks he's being kind of women's Ikle or something but it's not just droplets on the ballot and in fact what we're seeing is that it is not\nA the Republicans are not treating it as though there's only Trump on the ballot first of all\nEvery single congressional election has its own idiosyncrasies and realities and a media markets that you'd you'd think a guy that ran a very unsuccessful McCain presidential campaign should should know that uh but beyond that there's a there's a clear dynamic that has unfolded in the\nLast couple of weeks last few weeks that could change as election much how you got it right now and in fact I spoke to\nI'll tell you I had a I had a child with the Lindsey Graham flashlight spoken for about twenty minutes we sat down we're over Fox I was I was up ... we weren't off the record but I was giving him a little bit of what I think's going to he was give me a little bit of what do you think's going on and here's the bottom line\nThe Kavanaugh effect is very real Lindsey certainly knows that because he had his proudest moment I think ever in the Senate defending Kavanaugh\nBut here's what's happening and the reason that this is trending toward the Republicans at this stage of the game because you have ... Democrats are are they're running a a campaign at\nAll the local level of a or a local\nElections rather [noise] uh you have the state and and congressional level of healthcare you don't hear about it much but that's what they're messaging and healthcare help to your health care at the national level they're making this whole Trump issue but really they're pushing the health care issue very hard because they know the polling showed that that actually for the people were going to vote that matter\nRepublicans do have had a gift recently and what you see is that the cabin all effect in any state that's read where there's a Democrat who's trying to pull the usual you know Democrat oh I'm kind of centrist on these things I'm sort of a conservative Democrat had fake\nIs that's not going to fly that's not going to work [noise] um the dynamic of this playing out right now is the uh the dynamics\nPlaying out is that in states where it's clearly a red state and the conservatives Republicans have the advantage Trump showing up for\nBased turnout trumpet showing up to make sure the base remembers that they need to be a part of what's going on here in this midterm election but the dynamic that I think is really interesting and you're not hearing you talk about the media because they're all they're they're actively wishing in a way they hope it goes away\nAnd it is that in a elections that are in states where it's kind of a you know a a Democrat in a in a red state you know is\nIt's a little bit of a of a close circle all across the board they want people to come and speak about the cabinet issue\nWant Lindsey Graham to go and speak because that's a reminder to anyone who's toward the center of just how you cannot trust the Democrats with power\nShowing very red in very red states to get the base out you're going to have a lot of talk about you're going to have Trump visiting Trump's getting the base fired up he's going to get them to show up at the polls are great but in states where it's a closer call or it's a little more purple were very are going to have\nThe Lindsey Graham's of the G O P showing up and saying remember what they did the Kavanaugh you can't put these people you can't trust these people with power you are not\nBeing a responsible citizen if you think that these Democrats should be given any if any more authority now already have all the wives the American people and Kevin all could be the game changer think about what a political miscalculation the Democrats made their\nThink about what that what really happened they thought\nThat they would stop the Supreme Court sheet from going to a conservative constitution list and even if they couldn't stop it they would be rewarded by their base\nFor just going thermonuclear to try to stop it just due to a scorched earth do everything they could but what we're seeing is they didn't anticipate that in a lot of\nClose fought elections in suburban parts of America are a lot of Republican women are furious\nAbout what happened to Capitol furious\nAnd they want to make a statement and they're coming out to vote you know if your a pink hat wearing you know meet your T shirt emblazoned left wing feminist\nYou already we're going to vote and you hate Trump doesn't matter but if somebody was like well you know sometimes I I'm a little bit you know not not ... with some of what Trump is dawn ... but you're you're a Republican woman\nAnd you see what they did the Kavanaugh what the Democrats did and what that would mean for the future of this country going forward a lot of them are absolutely\nFired up about this and that could be the game changer it could be the enthusiasm among center right women in suburban districts that makes this house contract it's going to be down to the wire\nThis is going to be really close I think could she'll go to the Republicans oh that would feel like a miracle but it could still happen and it's\nGoing to be because of Kavanaugh so folks that

... that's the kind of decision that is going to be the very top level of any government US government any government whether they're going to let that information get out if they have a short memory could be a human source right we don't know\nBut if you're going to have proof if you're going to show evidence of this you would have to also most likely be willing to say where can I say what it is which means you're going to expose very likely how how you got it [noise]\nAh so I I don't know I don't know what they've got quite yet\nUm but I Do think that there is a very real possibility here that the Saudis are I'm sure they're going to suffer some consequences but they're gonna\nProbably live to fight another day diplomatically on this one because they're going to say that it's just\nSomething that happened they were in control of it and you know things things go bad and or there'll be better in the future or something like that and got to remember the Saudis are in the region are pretty important player for us play quip sex as secretary of state Pompeo again\nI told President Trump this morning that we ought to give them a few more days\nTo complete that we do have some understanding of the facts surrounding that which point we can make decisions about how\nIf the United states should respond\nSurrounding this show I think it's first of all the number to where I Belong to a site to thirty two long strategic relationship with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia [noise] that continue to be important to terrorism for his [noise]\nTested it with the two holy sites\nForeign changing\nHawaiian the United states [noise] we need to be mindful of that as well\nIt's an important ally not something that\nWe want to just discount just fly off the handle decide that we're going to try and make some big statement here\nThere are plenty of places all over the world were very very bad things happen to people on a daily basis we can make all of our problem I Know that there's symbolism ear to journalist he was he was a green card holder he was a permanent was in this country not the same as being a citizen but\nHe definitely had very real ties to America this was this happened on foreign soil however and so the people that are calling for an investigation I think just don't realize what all the hurdles are in place of that investigation we have no basis you certainly don't have any jurisdiction but no basis for sending\nAny kind of investigative team and last one the Turks allow it 'cause it's Turkish\nDitch Turkish sovereignty or I mean is on Turkish soil and to the Saudis would have to allow because of the council it so you are multiple levels of complexity added into what would already be a an investigation as highly sensitive\nAnd I don't know who we think we can really trust and that whole process either I mean if we don't send Americans to do this I Would be very suspicious of what information we get and how we get it\nBut if we do send Americans um well I just I doubt that's going to happen unless they were brought along kinda riding shotgun so to speak\nVice president Pence however is saying that there will be consequences political ten oh I can assure you though\nWhat has been away\nThere will be consequences the vice president says notice that people are pretty pretty thin on details\nOf what those consequences would be and it's because not only do we have to be concerned with the immediate Saudi response which would be both over and covert I'm sure against our interest in a whole bunch of different ways we also think about the unintended consequences here\nWhat would happen from a major fracture in the U.S relationship with Saudi Arabia truth is we don't want a major break with the Saudis um the Saudis are in some ways useful right now and here's what nobody really wants to say\nThe scariest scenario for America when it comes to Saudi Arabia in a lot of ways is actually a revolution and then democracy um the Saudi people in charge of what goes on in that country and representation in Saudi Arabia for look just\nRemember what happened with the Arab Spring with at all it's going to be great in Egypt they're going to elect people western style democracy is going to be great there's going to be human rights and women are going to school and all these things which I mean that was happening in Egypt beforehand but you know what I mean it was going to be a really big step forward\nAnd then the Muslim Brotherhood came to power\nLet me tell you something if they had elections in Saudi Arabia the Islamists would be in power there too and I would offer to you\nProbably much more hard line Islamist than anybody wants to admit or or would a would realize right now because the\nClerics that are allowed to preach and Saudi Arabia right now only do so with the acceptance and the and the ... of the government if you actually had the top pulled off this thing and the people of Saudi Arabia were calling the shots and the preachers were whoever they were listening to [noise]\nUh I Will be bad very quickly and that's that's kind of a nightmare scenario it's one of the reasons why the Saudis and the Pakistanis for example get away with as much as they do in terms of our relationship with them is because\nThe worst case scenario is not that they're mad at us the worst case scenario for the government is overthrown and either of those places and Pakistan because you have nuclear missiles in the equation it's particularly scary ah in Saudi Arabia\nWe have very few powerful military allies left the middle east is dwindling we've Israel and then\nIt starts to get pretty thin Jordan has a good ally but it's a small country not but not for the wealthier powerful one of the Turks are increasingly Islam ... they can't be counted on to be our friends in the Mid East Saudis obviously we've got this problem playing out right now got our concerns there\nEgypt is just not what it once was not as reliable a partner and it's got its own problems and you look around the region like who can we turn to who will be helpful I mean Iraq we're just hoping the place doesn't\nCollapse into some kind of ethnic civil war and you got it wrong clearly is not perfectly fine to the United states so when we talk about consequences for the Saudi Government could never be against the whole state of Saudi Arabia I mean I don't think that there's going to say\nWe want a Magnitsky sanctions against just a few individuals I don't think that would be\nA sufficient response people are talking about a hundred billion dollar arms deal uh getting shifted around a one way or another getting stopped ... whatever they they end up doing\nA this these are major consequences these are major consequences and then you have to look at the other side of this which is the people who are the loudest voices on this issue many of them plenty of people would loudest voices on this do not\nHave America's interest necessarily at heart\nThey view this as an opportunity\nTo both criticized and antagonize the Trump Administration that's right as I've been

of people but for the deputy attorney general to say it and I've gone back and forth on this I don't I don't think he was kidding\nI think that became the excuse but the more I thought about it I'm not sure what the latest if you're like ... two weeks ago he said he was kidding yeah but I thought about it more I don't know like I wasn't there that's all I can do is base it on the things that I've heard\nBut you know Rosenstein or\nHas he look he's an Obama administration hold over and he's clearly very\nTight with the DEA OJ bureaucracy and the bureaucracy protects itself\nBut that's why Mark Meadows is finally had enough\nHere's with Fox News reports about meadows of the Freedom Caucus she says that he made the comments about Rosenstein stepping down\nAs James Baker the FBI's former top lawyer was questioned behind closed doors on Capitol Hill earlier today about Rosenstein is reported comments as well as other decisions made by the bureau meadows criticize Rosenstein for not accepting a reason imitation to testify before the house Judiciary Committee about the record a reported comments\n[noise] you know roses ... there should be accountability there should be accountability for those people should not uh people should not be able to do and say whatever they want in a senior government role like that just because\nGetting rid of them might feel kind of messy and I thought the only deep states kind of a deep state updates the deep state store I wanted to tell you about uh you have\nA\nThis treasury employee\nWho is charged with leaking financial fence and reports on Trump team people\nShe was apparently arrested where they flash drive in hand here's a quote from Fox the top Treasury Department employee was charged with leaking confidential financial documents pertaining to former Trump officials was apprehended the previous even with a flash drive in Tennessee allegedly ... information in her hand\nOh my gosh caught\nRed handed or flash handed went nuts week this week but the dramatic arrest late late Tuesday came on the heels of other high profile leak related prosecutions on the administration which has pledged to go on the offensive against leakers the president has have called traders and cowards\nAre so this is now the Mayflower Edwards who is a senior official at the financial crimes enforcement network she gave a reporter bank reports allegedly documenting several suspicious financial transactions\nThis is so dirty as as I've been telling you I really want to understand this isn't leaking information that is necessarily accurate or even meaningful this is leaking rumors in a sense that the federal government has on hand that they can look into\nYou'll Richard Simmons likes to exercise\nBut did you know he was going to be a priest did you know he was in a ...\nMost importantly did you know that three years ago\nHe vanished and all of a sudden\nI Me straight up that out and just\nSearch for missing Richard Simmons now on I heart radio\nWe're more than talk radio and just so little time you can lie to share and follow issue [noise]\nTalk twelve hundred Boston dot com [laughter]\nWe our service cause [noise] our economy is driven by ... eighty plus percent of our GDP eighty plus percent of our job creation is services\nSo when you're a service economy the way to stimulate your economy the way to grow your economy is to allow consumers to buy goods as cheaply as they possibly can and use the rest of their money to buy services or if they're lucky enough to say anything that raises the price of a good\nDoesn't make sense for our economy even if they're paying it to the government as a tariff it's just another tack\nBefore we are close out here it's when I was a real quick here to get from a grade on the economy a threat what would it be so far\nWell you know I'd have to qualify that I Would say on a general parents are pretty good regulations are dying and taxes are down\nBut I I gave him more credit which is pseudo credit and that is he's a great cheerleader and there is such a thing as subjectivity in in cheerleading and you know an economy that people do respond in a positive way uh this way but the economy has been better but it's all it's sort of like you're doing well if you could borrow millions of dollars every\nEvery month you know so uh but the economy on the surface is good but it's not sound is not lasting it's based on that and the payment will come due soon\nI'm sure many recognize that second voice that was Ron Paul and NFL who's saying it's all

Paul\n[noise] ah [noise] he's right Ron Paul was right mathematically historically he is correct\nOr there is a very clear history of currency in a in the history of the world and it is that fewer currency always ends in disaster and financial calamity\nIs very clear that there's there's no exception it always ends very very badly now\nThat said Ron Paul saying that the economy right now is not found a way too much debt and all that she can be right put on what timeline\nAnd if Ron Paul is right that the economy is going to crash fifty years from now you have to ask yourself today how much do you care I Know we don't like to say oh for my kids and my grandkids and but how much do you really care and beyond that\nIf it's fifty years from now how do you leave the Next Fifty years right how do you\nTry to make money in the markets or how do you try to move on to your career and pay off your house deal with the basic financial challenges that we all have right telling telling you that the stock market might go to zero and our our dollar maybe worth nothing which I don't I don't think that's ever going to happen but even if it were true that happened to fifty years that's not very
