comes from\nNot being able to tell them this is true the Democrats in general they are not able to tell the American people what they really think and what they really believe and maintain\nTheir electoral prospects you know they're they're the ones you always have to play this game on things like immigration which is why that Obama soundbite where\nHe said you know you can't you can't sneak into this country\nIt's not allowed or we're not going to let people just surge into into this place some people as a I think it was ... to the New York times wrote oh I thought Obama was you know we're so are you know so pro illegals it's like yeah he's lying when he says that he wants to secure the border she can't she can't figure that out apparently\nA but but you see this time and again

they also\nNeed to call out the fair Margaret Traub is normal one other thing I Would add to the Democrats should it ought\nTo say is that people playing some of these countries are playing some of these countries because of conditions created by Republican foreign policy particularly in the Reagan Administration is I mean we have a problem with the images we go back over time and see why these countries on the condition that they are right\nThat's right folks it's American foreign policies fault that Honduras is a a hell of a whole of crime and corruption and and violence it's America's fault you see every country anywhere in the world that's in bad shape is somehow are full that's the view of the west\nAnd it also informs their immigration policy don't think that that's just a throw away\nBecause the progression in this country believe that America has only becomes so rich and powerful on the backs of the third world and essentially the non white regions of the globe that is a widespread left wing beliefs\nYou see it in in uh in academia you see it and media\nUh this is not unusual at all and in fact some of the Obama administration approach to foreign policy was also informed by this idea that America is why there was all the bowing and the apology toward America has a lot to apologize for\nAnd the dysfunctions in Central America or somehow according to left is the fault of America and therefore we shouldn't be saying hold on a second ... you know we we can't force the American taxpayers to subsidize\nAll the dysfunction all the problems in Central America that's not fair they say oh no no no you owe that to them see\nThis is a fascinating and very destructive role do the left has but it informs the Democratic party's foreign policy\nAnd the basics of it or that anything that we have to do when it comes to immigration when the weather's taking in refugees are taking in illegals that is going to be exact cost up on the American taxpayer is completely justified\nBecause we owed them you see it's our fault that these countries\nAre more prosperous are so corrupt um it it's always our fault that left view and really what it is a globalized victim allergy\nRight that that other countries there people are victims of the United states and therefore the Democrats need to be in charge in this country to make amends for all that victimization

point for the right way you that messaging against Hillary Clinton to drive out their vote so I think you could end up seeing a huge boost their numbers because you've got to Hillary Clinton now and the other side being associated yeah Gillum so close to\nHillary\nClinton not exactly getting a love there from a a panel of people who are Democrats that's yeah that was a CNN panel interviewing for the Democrats\nAnd and this is one of the the issue is one of the problems the Democratic party's gonna have to find a way to deal with and that is they have all of the establishment politicians who are\nReally ... you know they they just they don't go away they\nOwe cling to power forever and they have no sense of of self awareness of what they're doing\nTo the Democratic party's chances going forty below sea and Clinton are really two of the most powerful people in the Democratic party still below sea is likely to be it's crazy to sit and it's a sea as she's likely to be\nThe next speaker of the house if the Democrats I Know I Know bite my tongue I'm just saying that the Democrats without very likely that Nancy Pelosi is going to be the next speaker and and Hillary\nHillary is running again folks I Know she is she's running again what happened was what he told me she\nThe eggs that she's going to be in the mix wants war and I told you why\nThe the Democrats the ... the whole mentality is that they have not really excepted\nWhere or what happened they they haven't really accepted the Trump one that's why there's such a fixation on your coming up with some explanation for how Trump cheated essentially that's why there's some version of\nAll that stuff and twenty sixteen that wasn't really the American people speaking out that wasn't the American people choosing something different for their leadership it was that the Russian collusion whatever whatever so something doesn't matter what it is at this point you know something\nBy the way I I I'm going to be talking to on rising tomorrow George Papadopoulos\nAnd and I I got just becomes a ... where we're going to be airing it tomorrow morning Papadopoulos was the guy that they have built this whole narrative around that oh because\nOf Papadopoulos a that's why they needed to set up the FBI investigation I spoke to this guy ... the FBI and the department of justice should be show embarrassed\nThat this is a person that they thought they should bring all these resources to bear against\nThat he said that he had ... western intelligence agents\nSet upon him and try to and drop him I mean ... that's ... he makes it very clear you'll you'll see it in the interview and\nThis is why the guy the guy got fourteen days in jail for you know Mr remembering the date of a conversation with Joseph Mitch sued you know the reason I was fourteen days and not for you know and not for years because everybody knows that it was a relevant it wasn't even material factors matter\nIt's not like oh because he lied about the date it change the narrative of his guilt or something else no it\nThey just wanted a hammer him and this is what we're dealing with a mass irrationality in this country about Trump's election in in many ways and I know today is a particularly\nA sensitive day to talk about that but it's very much there it it it's part of the America that we're we're living in right now uh so I I just I just worry about that please do check it out the interview you will I posted tomorrow's you'll see it but the interview that I Would Papadopoulos and\nYou know we'll see what I mean in a way Hillary that she's running again blows he thinks he's going to be next speaker of the house some Democrats are fed up with it but I don't think they're really gonna learn their lesson until Trump gives them a wall up and twenty twenty maybe than the learn roll calls up next box [noise]\nAnd this election that we have coming up well it's the most important we have seen in

in our conversations with the left I I Will give you examples others we will spend a bit of our time this hour working through just how dishonest the left is being with all this just how delusional they really are\nBut I didn't\nWe spend a moment with you first on what we what we now know about uh about these bombs in fact I could have an assist here from the attorney general my buddy Jeff Sessions click with a place\nTo ... apartment is responding to the suspicious packages that have been sent several political leaders and a media outlet and then ask\nLast few days yesterday I spoke

them the actions that led onto a these acts these activities and the strongest\nPossible terms on terms into determined to make sure that we get to the bottom of it injustices done\nThey will find who is responsible for this I'm very confident of that I don't know how quickly though and I don't know if it will be in time for us to make a fully informed decision us being the American people you and I already\nKnow this doesn't if it doesn't affect my vote doesn't affect my feeling about\nTrump or the Republican Party or anything else that has nothing to do all the safety threat\nThis is one very very stupid and uh and agree\nJust an evil jerk\nI wanted to use another word but we're on radio or who is going to spend the rest of his life in prison it's just a question of how soon we put him through that process\nBut the judge bombs that have been found so far no could they have gone off could they have detonated under any circumstances there was a press conference today with the NYPD in fact one of my uh some of my former colleagues were named in the press conference I had a bit of nostalgia but they talk\nAbout how the bombs that haven't gone off they kept getting asked the question by the press are they real bombs or the ... the M y pd is going to have to say you have to treat these as real threats because just imagine for a moment that the largest police department the country's as no these are these are\nThe odds and then the next suspicious packages that goes out whether it's by the same person or not but look similar person opens it up and goes well I Know it's a dog and then we have a tragedy someone loses limbs site maybe dogs from one of these pipe bombs um\nThe NYPD can't take that risk not yet can't say that these bombs wouldn't have gone off under any circumstances but I'm here to tell you that I think that is increasingly likely to be the case\nAnd if that is in fact what's going on here let's just take a step back I Know I'm not supposed to say I know I'm not supposed to\nGo there but then again I actually professionally did this on like Ninety percent of the clowns going on MSNBC and CNN to talk about it and in the past when they've tried to tell me if those places what is and it's not real when it comes to terrorism or they have\nTended to get bucks slapped rather hard here's what I see\nIf you were trying to come up with a means to change the entire national conversation away from Kavanaugh which was toxic for Democrats in red states and Democrats in states where Democrats were struggling the Kavanaugh debacle self inflicted wound was toxic\nAnd the caravan making its way up through Mexico the far left active is when the Democratic party loves this story ah but the people and places like Indiana and Tennessee and Nevada who are figuring out who to vote for gas what they don't much like the idea that the Democrat Party\nIs effectively an open borders party\nPrivileges certain people from certain places of the world getting around the rest of the immigration system because it benefits the Democrats electro prospects they don't like that and so if you wanted to switch that narrative if that was the purpose it has been master fully achieved here\nNow is in fact possible\nSome would even say probable I'm I'm not quite there yet I Need I Need more evidence is it possible a problem this is one incredibly stupid reckless and\nA ... and really her doing whatever side he thinks he's on doing tremendous damage to it is it possible that this is somebody who wears a mock a hat and and loves Trump's so much thought that the way to\nThe way to show support was to violate hundreds of federal statutes threaten people terrified people and in the process put himself in a sure fire\nA position to be spending the rest of his life in federal prison is that possible absolutely that's possible I'm not discounting that at all we may find out that that is the case\nHowever am I willing to discount am I willing to push aside that if this was in fact somebody whose purpose was to change the conversation right before the midterm I don't think anybody believes this is a coincidence in terms of the timing\nIf the purpose was to was to push aside conversations that were damaging to the Democrats and in the process make the anti Trump media seem sympathetic\nAnd give them something to talk about that might sway some moderate to their side just in time the election\nThis be a successful strategy yes I Am talking about a false flag strategy I'm not saying it happened I'm saying would these things all be true if this were a false flag answers obviously yes\nSo that's why I'm unwilling to just discount this out of hand and that's why I I refuse to take the position that well because the left has already started not just to blame the right for this but to blame the president of the United states for this\nThat's where I think we have to draw a very hard and fast line\nThe Democrats have created not alone but primarily predominantly they have created this vicious toxic political environment they have\nNever thought for one moment there was anything decent are acceptable about Trump they wanted to remove him from office I even had an author on impeachment on my on my TV show or the week you said yes this is the first time ever that there's been impeachment talk for a president who had not even been sworn in\nThey have a mass delusion problem they're having a collective nervous breakdown in slow motion over Trump and his movement and that's why things have\nBecome so tense and so nasty and so vicious so would one individual\nChange that dynamic you know\nWe will hold our final conclusions until we have more evidence but in the meantime I'm leaving open all reasonable options\nAnd some

yesterday\nAnd we don't even know if it's over\nA obvious question is does the president bears some responsibility obviously not for the the bomb making or or the or the recipients of but does he barely responsibility for the tone that allowed it sure\nSure he does and that's part of the reason why I never endorse them and I've never been personally critical of him but yeah it does bear responsibility for the divisions are the biggest megaphone\nTrump they say is\nNot responsible for the bombs but he is responsible for the ... that's ...\nFormulation that you get here from the anti Trump bluff that's really what they're saying I I mean I'm not going to tell you that the reason this happened is Trump I'm just saying that Trump is one of the reasons this happened\nThis is why people despise the press the press deserves to be despised Russia's full of a bunch of self important cry babies and liars obviously not all people I'm In the press technically but a whole vast majority fall into that category\nAnd they have completely jumped the shark here or there not waiting to find out who's responsible for this not even putting this on conservative ideology or on the right in general they're going right to the president this is yet again another attack on the president folks this is trumped arrangements syndrome that we are seeing\nThe president that states is responsible for this guy sending bombs to all these people were so so I just need to understand\nThe president's not allowed to criticize rock Obama's presidency not allowed to make fun of Hillary

would you 'cause he likes this game he'd say no one blames Trump for the bombs okay that's right no one thinks that Trump was in the west wing putting together these bombs with his bare hands or whatever okay we're in the east wing\nNo one thinks that what's happening but they're all saying including the president of the CNN network that the environment\nAround all of this is from ... creation Trump's fault and the environment led to the bombing so in essence from does have responsibility for that is what they're saying\nAnd that's exactly what Mika Brzezinski did because I think

hold on a second ... how do we how do we do this how do we deal with this right you are not responsible for what someone else does because of your politics\nYou may be responsible for violence if

do is that one person yes that's right and false like fashion\nAct like a complete idiot\nAll they have to do and that everyone says oh see see that and it's just common by the way you see this with this is a a continuation of the debate you have with radical Islam\nThe left will always rush to say the radical Islam is not in any way representative of Islam and then any jihad or jihad is aren't representative of the broader Islamic faith that they will say that\nAnd then when you responsible hull on a second I mean who are you to who are you to to declare what isn't is not Islamic member

somewhere did something bad but he's white and male and on the right so that means that the right has to own this whole thing\nBecause because one guy said something racist because one racist incident when is it the exception when is it the norm this is a very important perception game that the media engages in all the time and this is where we can't we can't give any ground\nWe do not have a

tough\nTo ignore the department of justice is going to have to look into this\nAnd that means folks that there could be unlike the proceeding that the left was so excited to use to try and smear Kavanaugh which was not a standard criminal proceedings right there they could not subpoena people they could not uh\nTake their phone records that they're no phone records to take the allegations were from thirty five years ago or whatever it was just the whole thing was insane and I'm so I'm going to say that I Am so proud\nOf what we did hear on the show me and bike and John the whole team and all of you supporting me when that was a really difficult a couple of weeks especially in the early days we knew it was garbage and we ... we kept our shield sigh yes we did\nWe held the line on this one and people notice by the way\nThere was a front line on defending have it all and we here in the freedom that we were on that front lawn publicly in every possible way I was in contact with the White House team I was trying to get in through the confirmation on a near daily basis\nSo um\nThat Grassley is not passing this\nThing up and saying okay you know we'll let bygones be bygones is the right move and this could this this will mean that they deal Jay now has the ability to pull records you know they they might be able to see some communications perhaps between sweat naked other people but you know this ... you want to\nPlay in this game you want to try to lie and get somebody ruined and smear them you're going to sign ridiculous sworn statements with no ... nobody would be able to tell you yes or no I mean the whole thing\nIf they can prove she lied if they can prove ... he was part of a conspiracy for her July they must both be criminally prosecuted the law either matters or it doesn't there's really not a lot of room for interpretation here if they can prove it now\nThere is the possibility that they won't be able to prove that sweating collide because her charges were so vague or the statement that she swore was so vague I was at a party in the eighties and there were gang rapes and I think maybe Kavanaugh was near the punch maybe he wasn't\nBut then again she changed her testimony publicly from what the sworn statement was which is when we all knew that this was not just a fix but an obvious fix my dad was when it was clear to anyone paying attention\nOkay this really is too much this person has a problem this person is ill is sick so um and that's where I think we are now\nBut if they they're they're going to try to do two things on the left now because by the way they really don't want can you imagine if Julie sweating it faces criminal prosecution for what happened there what then we're supposed to think what the other two women just they were the ones that were really attack but Julie sweating it just came out of nowhere to lie\nAbout what that does to the narrative and I am\nVery clear on this one for if you can prove somebody makes a false criminal allegation against anyone they must suffer the consequences because they are doing violence to the truth and they were trying to ruin someone's life is an attempted ruin nation of the human beings life that must\nBe punished crystal Gail magnum I told you this this was the uh the stripper who\nClaimed with Mike knife on that despicable district attorney down in Durham North Carolina that Duke lacrosse team raped her it was a complete fabrication a total lie which she claimed the guy was raping or who was miles away at an ATM machine and they had him on video and using his card\nThere so kind of hard for him to raping her when he's a few miles away a complete fabrication they didn't press charges against her they did ... along and he should have gone to prison for a long time but they just to support him\nShe went on to kill her boyfriend starving to death later on maybe she should have actually had to deal with justice of course you should have had to deal with justice perhaps somebody would be alive today\nNot only did Kavanaugh survive and therefore due process survive with him through this process but if we really do care about truth and decency and justice in our system if we care about due process and\nThe right to protect your reputation the right to face the acute the to face your accuser the right not to be destroyed at the political whims of the left for their convenience\nThan people who lie in order to destroy you under oath must be punished\nThe left is going to kick and scream over this one because it's a very bad look for them I Know now will they be able to prove this I Can't say quite yet is it clear to me that's what ... absolutely absolutely\nI as I Know she's a liar and not just based on statements he made a base in the contradictions overstatement if you don't say I think someone's spiked punch at a party which what what would that even mean\nThat was such a crazy thing to say in the first place he spiking what he's drinking the punch\nHow would you spiking the punch he's gonna he's going to poison we're very or get super drunk all of his male friends too so that they pass out and can't move\nThink about that she didn't she didn't say spiking of drinks spiking an entire principle that everyone drinks maybe he was putting alcohol in it so that everybody could have some alcohol but he was the whole thing it's just it none of it rang true it was a fabrication out of this woman's mind she's deranged she neurons I mean\nAnd that's what they're going to say if if they really nail her on the lie\nThe story will be she's not sound mind let's let this go she suffered a novel that kind of stuff I'm Sorry I Know if she was a sound mind enough to bring these charges and try to put the final nail in Kavanaugh's\nConfirmation coffin she's of sound mind enough to have to face the consequences of our actions to have to actually stand up and defend what it was that she was saying and how she was saying it and she ... she sworn affidavit\nThat either has meaning or a dozen so I Hope Grassley pushes this and the DEA OJ needs to investigate this\nAnd we'll see how far they're able to

right to come to this country and get kind of part of this caravan any kind of in our country you will be returned home\n\nOkay that's true but but but\nThey're being coached along the way they are being told exactly what to say all they have to do was establish a record and that just means saying they don't even have to\n\nIt's it's sort of switched around it used to be that Central American\nImmigrants at the border would would uh would lie and say they were Mexican because if they were going to be detained and sent back they didn't want to get flown back to Central America because they spend a lot of time and money often do you get\nTo the border and so they would rather just be released back into Mexico you their Central America but now that's changed because of this\nAsylum claims situation\nAnd as long as as long as they can\nI'm\nConvinced the border patrol agent or a few border patrol agents and the ah immigrations and Customs Enforcement process that they are from Honduras um they're going to be part of this asylum deal right they're going to get brought in and letting the injured the United states and uh\nBeen telling you that's not going to that's just there's never going to be real enforcement alright\nWhat can be done about this I'm not going to hear all bucket oh what do you go to the issue the ultimately the thirty thousand foot level Congress needs to change the law so that it is very clear that asylum they then need to change the asylum process so that you apply in your\nIn your country or in the nearest country you can get two at a U.S embassy and there's a process it it should not be that you just present yourself\nIn this way out of port of entry I'm a because you're in walking within walking distance of United States that's not\nThat's not the way that this law should be but ah as importantly there's something called a safe third part said third country agreement\nIs well I like to tell you things on the show that you won't hear from other people because I actually read lots of things and do lots of research because if you were kind enough to spend your time with me I have a mandate to make sure that his time well spent team\nSo the say third a third country agreement would mean and we have one with Canada by the way so this is not some crazy concoction and we've we've discussed\nThe possibility of this uh at the government to government level of Mexico but what it would mean is that we would set up\nAt the border but on the Mexican side of the border and we yes we would probably have to pay for this and I was a book they should they should pay for it will go a lot faster and much more effective if we pay for it we would set up\nA centrally trailers you know a a holding facility sounds like it's not attention facility but it's a\nWhat would be somewhat similar to a a refugee camp situation it would be a place where people you know they have uh they're they're able to stay safe there's water there's food um but it's on the Mexican side of the border and we would move infrastructure down to the border so that you have\nAt port of entry courts\nSo you would start you would move the judicial infrastructure to deal with these immigration cases right down to the border and people that were waiting for their adjudication ... so that would speed it up obviously and people that are waiting for their education process would be on the Mexican side of the U.S border which means that\nThey don't uh they're they're not able to just go further and further and ensure United States and get some you know immigrant rights lawyer to represent them pro bono to keep suing the federal government all the rest of it if their claim is denied guess what\nThey they get to stay in Mexico or or the Mexican government then can can hand them off to their country of origin\nThat way you prevent what's happening right now which is using the legal system and it's very important to understand that they are not illegal immigrants\nThey may cross illegally so then they are in the U.S illegal but at the moment that they say I have a credible fear of my safety these Honduran immigrants go into the asylum process and then they're due process\nAllows them to stay in the United states that is the law I've talked to senior immigration officials about this is talk of wars about this\nThat's how this works so we need to take action here beyond just we're going to enforce the law the border that's great that's a good start but if you have this caravan of seven thousand\nThat gets all the way even if it's only a thousand that gets to the border vicious going to be they're going to keep doing this they're going to keep doing this it's the best\nSpecial ... to get to the border I'm at you know on the day
