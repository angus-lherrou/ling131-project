both networks other than that\nAnd they're both full lives but CBS had this uh this segment about hate speech and taking down hate speech and\nThis has been one of the issues that has you know I've been talking about for a long time here where we do you have this chorus particularly on the left of oh you've got to get rid of certain kinds of speech on line\nUm and and you're not doing a good job of it and then we find oh wow you mean it's going to be abused and that they're just going to use those to shut down conservatives that should shock\nNo one oh but that's what ends up that's what ends

would they can do is is all of a sudden have second a pro Second Amendment groups that find their Twitter accounts or their Facebook accounts the activated but here's part of this a discussion and I

after nine eleven when people had access to\nISIS supporters and those who are trying to radicalize yet isolated individual as we know now that Facebook Twitter and YouTube all had agreed with that have worked with the government can take a lot of these videos down why not when it comes to right or left wing extremists on line\nWell for one it's very hard it's hard to identify what is extremist and it's hard to identify what exactly is hate speech words are very complicated and different context and in particular case of powers\nYeah it's very easy to identify what he was doing he should have been found that should have been taken down but as a general principle it's very difficult to identify what if a speech what is not hate speech and to set farm policies on that\nIt's difficult and we know that if we give them any leeway on this issue it will invariably be used to the detriment of conservatives it it will be a situation where conservatives are the\nOnes who find themselves the rules will certainly be much more strictly enforced against the right if they're in force against the left at all and ... and here's you know a very good example of exactly what I'm Talking about is the fact that Louis Farrakhan\nStill has lots of social media are still is able to view his hatred intolerance and this is also why I just find\nSo much of the media's effort over the weekend to

Simpsons and this comes after\nThe reports late last week now a ... one of the more recognizable characters on that show who is not that are really we're way that guns gay but um but up who is\nYou know about to get written out of the show according to reports from last week because\nUh you can have well a couple of things right he's a an Indian a quickie Mart owner and so he's in any convenience store owner and you you can't have you know Indians and seven eleven you're you're not allowed to\nTo have that stereotype anymore and pop culture and media where we've talked about you know the the war on a pool before but now they finally decided that it's not just that there there were some concerns or some ideas out there that they were going to have somebody else voice ... cars Hank owes area who is the\nUh the guy who wrote voice and that was a white guy\nYou know the whole lot of voices voice actor but he he's a white guy voicing a brown guy which is obviously on this for the social justice love it's a big no no but they're actually just going to or at least the latest warning I saw yeah that's right there are writing him out of the show\nSaying that uh you know that that they're running on the show now some people are pushing back on that saying that it's not true that he's not being written out of the show and I I think they are responding to back last year because people were saying really ... this is where it is now\nNow now you you can't have this cartoon characters but Robert Twenty years and and I would note a pool is yes he's a stereotype\nOr on the show for sure there's no question right to stereotype\nBut he's also not ... you know he's a family man he's a successful business owner I really mean that I mean it's not he's not being put down in fact he's often used on the show to highlight the silliness stupidity and ... of other people\nWhereas you know he's actually kind of living the American dream got a nice wife you heard or on the than the ...\nWe came into second there's got a whole bunch of kids he's a business owner I mean you know what a lot of people aspires you in this country for themselves and and he's not you know there's this big difference between laughing added laughing with a pool is I've seen enough of the symptoms of the many episodes certainly not all of them it's been on for Twenty years\nBut of who they laughed with character you know you're laughing with it and you find him funny he does insightful political commentary yes he has an accent and yes there is some stereotypes behind it but it's all being used for the purpose of\nNot just entertainment but also a inside and I and I just think that they're being really unfair to the character but I I Would say this\nYou know over the weekend 'cause the political correctness thing everyone hates it except for the twenty percent of the country are so that are just social justice left\nManiacs everyone I hate this cold the political correctness this idea that we can't laugh at anything any more nothing is allowed to be funny anymore everything has to be treated with this you know this deadly seriousness and there's no way for us to just\nBe normal people ah who can laugh at things that a normal person would find funny\nWill reject this but we find ourselves still stuck in the totalitarian psychological prison all the time of the political correct speech and and thought police\nBut I I'm kind of happy though that they're not I'd I'd rather than get rid of a food than just you know do what they usually do which is either take the character and remove any hinge of humor from him\nRights and all of a sudden the Pooh is going to have like an English accent and be a Harvard professor and just make fun of like the stupid fat white people like The Simpsons character Homer all the time\nYou know that that's one way that they would go or the social justice warriors would want this to go a ... and in another way that they would go would be to use them to make social justice you know to make more social justice related point\nYou know now all of a sudden the food so I just I I don't want any of that you know I just part of me is happy they'd rather get rid of this character then destroy the character I I think that's a\nThat's one maybe silver linings whole thing but it's just indicative of how I don't even know what what's allowed to be what's allowed to be funny anymore because you know it's going to change in a year and not based on humor but based on what is acceptable based on where the left wing draws these

of the victims memorials outside the synagogue\nOf course include person born in the United states who are foreigners aliens who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers accredited to the government of the United states but will include every other class of persons\nThat's right notch foreigners okay this is different than do people who are permanent residents were green card holders there are no longer foreigners they may not old citizenship but they're not consider foreigners for the purposes of this discussion\nBut it is very clear should be very clear that it was never the intention\nOf um the ... of the\nPeople who are drafting this of the senator back in Eighteen sixty six Jacob how for example who was who was talking about this amendment and there were dropping some and it was never there intention that this would extend to people who are in the United states illegally\nAnd now this is where we get into some complexity and some difficulty because for quite a while now it has been treated as such and this is where we get the anchor baby phenomenon right if you come into America and you have a child\nThe law has been the way that the federal government has interpreted the laws that we have on the books is that you have a citizen now or you have citizenship\nSo if you come into America you have a child that child as a citizen this has led to some open it outright scams out the system most notably with the citizenship a or a birth tourism or citizenship are scams that are run\nAnd there have been all stories on that so where in California particularly you have people from East Asia who will fly to California and stay in\nA specific hotel and and the whole purpose of this is the they're\nWhen they're you know nine months pregnant so that they give birth here that with a child as citizen ship in this country and they can then go back to the mainland China or whatever and then when they want to go to college or they want to you know moved to the states when they're older they already have citizenship\nWell gee that's that's a pretty that's pretty sweet deal isn't it but citizenship is not supposed to be a commodity that people can just sort of snatched for themselves whenever they want they're supposed to be more to it than that and\nWe obviously can tell that it's a scam when people are showing up here and just having a child and then leaving but all but it's a citizen right all but this person a citizen and people say ... what about military what about um bachelor's abroad yeah they're on official government business\nAnd they're abroad on behalf of the United states so it's obvious that there should be and has been an exception for people under those circumstances\nI'm but illegal aliens\nThis by the way it goes right to the heart of of what the what the Democrats have been not just allowing but encouraging now for decades which is people violate our laws and then they benefit from that violation of law and they are a combination of emotional appeal and political pressure\nOverrides an actual plane interpretation of what the statutes are and it's unfair to the American people\nOur government is supposed to be putting our interests ahead of the interests of those and the rest of the world who just want to be here and that means enforcing what yes I understand on a philosophical level who's a citizen of what country who's born in ... in one country another that's all it's unfair\nBut life is unfair and nation states are inherently somewhat arbitrary system just like the lines on a map at separate them are generally arbitrary yeah some of them have geographic boundaries but a lot of the time it's just okay well that's where the line that's where the line is\nAnd if there is no government enforcement of that than the line ceases to exist if there is no government enforcement of laws around immigration\nThan those laws in effect ceased to exist and then you keep working back from this and you find yourself saying whoa whoa whoa hold on a second here\nWhat your Democrats really what Democrats really want and what do they believe the fourteenth amendment says and and they clearly believed that and and ... it's not just believe that it's also desire\nOr that anyone who comes to this country and has an anchor baby a we'll have that person to be a citizen because then that makes it a that makes it much much more likely\nThat later on that person will be able to sponsor all that's right you get to sponsor family family reunification right\nSo if you if you come let's say from Honduras 'cause that's in the news a lot right now if you come from ... to the United states you were waiting to find out if you get asylum\nYou have a ... maybe a five year lag you have a baby in America but you're you're not in the country in any permanent status you around the country even really legally you're going through a process to determine your legality\nIf you have that child in America and then you go back to Honduras let's just say theoretically you could have family\nReunification migration ... chain migration to bring interest the family in so oh yeah they do is have one kid in America and you're\nAlready at the front of the line when it comes to the immigration system we have to think about the it's not just the incentive for that one child it's the incentive for the entire family now\nYou know the the uh what was it the uh I'm trying to remember the name of the group but I Do I can tell you the center for Immigration Studies there you go\nAbout a fifth\nOne in five and twenty fourteen seven hundred and Ninety One thousand\nA birth in the United states were to in immigrants whether legal or illegal and illegal immigrants counted for seven point five percent which is almost three hundred thousand so in twenty fourteen is believe that three hundred thousand illegal aliens had children in the United\nStates but it's not just that three hundred thousand or so remember that's a few years ago could even higher now it's a three hundred thousand plus then they'll likely sponsoring of their entire family reunification oh but maybe it's even more complicated than that\nBecause once you've had that child in this country let's say that you are here legally and you've had a child now you have a citizen child you know the Democrats are going to say oh we can't separate families\nSo forget about whether they can even sponsor the rest of the family for a for a legal immigration system\nAh forget about that right because now it's you have is just the politics and the emotional appeal\nOf oh\nOh hold on a second you already have a citizen citizen Charlotte American citizen Trump of course we can't send you back of course you can't be deported hence the phenomenon of an anchor\nBaby right it it just centrally gaming the system not just for that individual who's obviously getting a benefit by his\nParents doing something that is a illegal right the crossing into the country is clearly it'd be being illegal aliens illegal Democrats may not want to believe that but it is true it is illegal you are in violation of law so they're getting a benefit but then they also get the additional benefit of oh wow if immigration and Customs Enforcement later tries to deport the\nParents they're breaking up families Trump says he's gonna handles with an executive order is that the right way I mean probably not\nFrom a perspective of separation of powers the constitution there are some\nDecisions although not particularly robust ones that look at the issue of who's a who's a ... a who's a citizen subject the jurisdiction there of and there were some complexities the nineteenth century around this because of Native Americans and whether Native Americans were subject to Native American jurisdiction not not us federal jurisdiction um\nBut the courts have never really weighed in on this and a clear fashion\nSo yes Trump's executive order on this show to get science should he do it will clearly be challenged right away by the never Trump judiciary\nAnd quite honestly it would probably be challenged regardless of whether it was even Trump who did this it's not just this is not a trumped arrangements syndrome limited issue\nBut it will get fast tracked I think to the Supreme Court and then they will have to weigh in on this and then we will find out if in fact the Supreme Court\nWants to reward people for breaking US law and make sure that there is a clear plan to change the political and demographic realities of the United states through continued loopholes in the immigration system\nBecause it benefits Democrats that's we're going to find out and by the way at the Supreme Court rules against this and says that birthright citizenship is no longer or rather if you're born in this country or no longer going to be an automatic citizen what does that say about the scam the Democrats have been running with a lot of Republican complicity I might add all this time\nWhat does that say about what's been going on if that if that really isn't a valid interpretation of the fourteenth amendment and of of what's currently on the books in terms of the constitution so we really so the American people really would have been scammed all this time oh it when you look at this we're the outlier there are roughly\nThirty countries in the world where if you're born in them you get citizenship automatically the only ones that are that are developed world or the U.S and Canada no European country does
