identifies or they transgender woman won a woman's world championships likely event on Sunday\nYou know Rachel McKinnon a professor the College of Charleston won the women's sprint thirty five to thirty nine age bracket at the twenty Eighteen UCI master's tracks cycling world championship in Los Angeles\nSo we have somebody who is the first transgender woman world champion ever and we're supposed to celebrate this do they really expect us to celebrate\nThis is supposed to be treated like it is in some way a victory a victory for whom advocate for transgender rights certainly not a victory for women the reason that we have sex segregated sports is not because of sexism and maybe this is where progressive\nJust can't follow the logic training or maybe they just are unable to understand that but the reason we have sex segregated sports\nIs because men are overwhelmingly and invariably biologically larger heavier stronger and faster than women as a function of hormones and genetics that's just\nThat's the truth I mean I I used to occasionally with some friends of mine a scrimmage with some of the women's varsity teams when I was in in college and then I could tell you that I a reasonably athletic\nCollege male would probably be a three sport superstar for most female programs if he had had some of the of the same skills by playing let's say on a high school team I mean that that's just the truth\nBut that's why we have sex segregated sports but the leftist show devoted to this idea of transgender rights and transgender raised them\nAs something that must be celebrated remember I told you the the way that the progressive approach these issues is it starts with just just tolerant be tolerant and then it's you know be inclusive and then it's\nCelebrated and then it's you know\n... or accept this or else which is basically a version of celebrate it but they they always have this sliding scale and it will start just with oh just tolerate it that's the first thing and and then you have to you know later you off from it and then he'll be told the celebrated that's I skipped affirmed to celebrate their\nBefore but here we have it I mean if I told you five years ago that we would see pieces about how men could compete in females sporting events because they say they're transgender and that would be considered fair somehow on the left you'd say buck that's just crazy and I would say well yes it's crazy but now it's true\nNow it's happening a this that's why these here you have\nThis is the ... this was the women's world championships women's world championships and uh you have your men\nCompeting in these events now than the whole notion that we have to say biological mail I Would note is a misnomer because male is a function of biology as his female we can pretend to these things are separate we can pretend that they're distinct but we're just\nOnly fooling ourselves and and it can't be a shock to anybody that are on a day or it

... the the\nFrenzy the frenzy to the media is engaged in right now to make this the biggest story in the country\nAnd just skip over what's\nGoing on with us troops for example in Afghanistan and place we're still at which we are still in the war\nUm we don't hear about it do we we don't hear about the fact that we're in the process of slowly losing that or they don't want it they they don't talk about that anymore or they want to focus on this issue and I would\nSay it's not just because they do feel journalist do feel a special affinity for other journalists right that this hits home for them it's not so much during the Obama years when Obama was pulling the phone records of journalists and listing on the OJ charging sheets on indicted co conspirators as you know journalists\nBut you and that was Obama oh that's right you know tough guy tapper which you know a damn ideas\nSaying that that you're really the best this administration is the best messenger on that issue yeah that's\nOoh tough talk tough talk to the Obama administration which used the Espionage Act more than every other business ration combined\nNot a lot of talk about how they're destroying the first

disgusting or disgrace none other than chief\nNational security propaganda is for the Obama administration Ben Rhodes change this to the next level and you know it's once again it's always about Trump

people are talking about Hillary she's like my daughter and a Katy Perry world\nBoston conservative daughter\n[noise]\nShe's holding the line for America bugs the accent is that\nSaid we're going to

claims alive is\nThat those responsible are held to account\nNow that's the vice president who's saying\nPretty much all the things you would expect him to say I think he's saying the right things you hear on this issue\nUm but the left is credit so the regime\nOf the administration sorry that happened sometimes they're not placate or by this at all they're not okay they don't say oh All right you know because ... says we just need the facts and will hold them accountable they're not they're not slowing down all they want to jump all over\nThat their plan they want to jump all over the president and the vice president on this issue as much as they can\nAnd they're not waiting for anything they don't wanna wait for the fact that when a wait to see what action he takes day just prefer this notion that yeah\nTrump is a bad guy that helps them sleep in one of the things I I Would disagree with vice president Pence on on one matter or the notion that this is an attack on an independent press okay well he would write for the Washington Post but Saudi Arabia doesn't have an independent press at all not not even a little bit\nOkay there there is not an independent presence all your people say oh buck it's been getting a little better than read\nWhatever turkey doesn't have an independent press in fact\nInjury workers Shelby was from what we see from what we believe murdered is one of the worst in the world when it comes to press freedom not Saudi Arabia turkey bad when it comes to press freedom so when we say it's an attack on a free press yeah we live in a world where the free press is\nThe exception not the rule lotta countries have all kinds of constraints on what can be printed what can be said what can be shared\nLots of countries\nAnd even countries that you think of as having a free press maybe ... some of the western European states for example they have\nRestrictions based on you know hate crime legislation and all all kinds of stuff in Britain there's no oh you can ... you can print national security secrets because you're the press they had the official secrets act lock your butt up they don't care if it's a matter of public importance they'll just lock you up\nSo I just think everyone needs to take a deep breath and understand that yes this is bad\nYes the u._s. should send a strong message but it's not the worst thing that's ever happened to the history of mankind we need just take a step back here and understand that people die all over the world under terrible circumstances everyday\nDoesn't mean you ignore at all but it just means that unique perspective here and what we're going to do even if we find out that the Saudis are as culpable as is as has been alleged from the very beginning meeting all the way up at the top\nMaybe will not sell them some munitions we said we're going to sell them maybe we'll send them a a strong reprimand under ... we have no legal authority to do anything about this we are not signatories the United states is not a signatory to the international criminal court so we can't go there\nAnd we're not certain for for good reason which is that the notion of an international criminal law doesn't really exist I mean yeah there's war crimes I guess but\nTry and forcing knows unless you've already beaten the country\nAnd brought them just admission that you want to punish people and because of their war crimes that it's just it's really easy to the bank the tough guy drum on this issue it's it's a lot harder to sit back and actually come up with constructive ways to deal with all this\nYou know it's really easy to say oh you know I'm I'm all about a free press and Trump isn't doing enough or what should we do I'm not just saying oh we can't bring 'cause she'll be back 'cause we can't\nBut he's not he's not an American why does it fall\nOn us why does it fall on us just wonder you know wondering why that is\nSo there's this caravan is making its way up into the country and the lives are going to do what they always do\nThey're going to respond to this issue emotionally they're going to say oh my gosh what about the home of the base of the statue of liberty what about Alice island what about give me your tired your weak and Bob alright so does any mass of people that shows up at the border and I'll get to come in the United states why do we even have immigration laws why do we have a border patrol\nWhat is the purpose of all this\nIf lives are just going to grandstand every time and act like anyone who has any questions about just bringing a ... whoever wants to come in this country can say she ultimately here's the problem\nThat the leftist project the really the socialist or the Democrats socialist project in Western Europe and in America because there are Democrats socialist year as we know ... and others Elizabeth Warren but\nShe's got other problems right now the problem that the Democrats socialist project has to face is that they believe in open borders but they also believe in a welfare state a massive welfare state that doesn't work\nThe Math Doesn't add up and also people\nAre willing to help the less fortunate from within their own community from within their polity right their political union there is still a sense of nationhood of nationalism should I say where\nYou want to you know I I Want to help Americans first if we're gonna have a welfare state in this country it should be to help those who were Americans\nAll races grades and colors help them if they're down on their luck and we're going to have welfare state that should be but if if we have a policy of essentially anybody who shows up\nAnd has a ... a sob story about how their country has not I'm not talking about people that just generally that are facing any imminent violence they just say oh the jobs here are better\nWell guess what if I show up in Switzerland and say hey that I like this place better it's cleaner it's more civilized I demand citizenship they're going to put my button on a plane\nAnd kick me out of the country never let me back and no one's gonna feel sorry for me\nThere is an order that country's try to maintain\nOther countries are allowed to have borders not only that other countries are not expected to take in millions and millions and tens of millions\nOf people from a different culture who speak a different language and once they come to this country increasingly claimed that this country is not fair to them because we don't do enough for them\n\nI was under the impression that if you came to America you're supposed to feel grateful and legal immigrants by the way all of you listening Hi five thank you welcome to being part of the American family legal immigrants overwhelmingly do but I Do see a trend among illegal immigrants were they think that we owe them something\nWe owe them not just citizenship\nNot just permanent residency but also all the goodies that the state can offer free health care free school free housing free everything\nEven America with are incredible economy and our economic dynamism and thank you Trump for showing us that growth\nGrowth under Obama for all the people who go well I'm a ... show right growth under Obama and his last year in office was like one point something\nPercent growth under Trump second year in office GDP over four percent\n\nSingle best measure we have of economic activity in what's going on in this country\nSo he wasn't going to be Obama corn and we're slowly please yes there was a natural economic reset that occurred Obama made it slower and more painful and less powerful than it would have been had he not gotten in the way but he was\nIgnorant of economics I mean Obama is just not somebody who understands business not somebody who ever had to look at a balance sheet for any length of time not somebody who had to run a business of anything you know using the business of Obama different\n[noise] but the facts facts cannot be allowed to get in the way up the leftist narrative with all this stuff this group is going to come to the border\nAnd they are going to do\nBe in a position\nWhere we can either let them in or not and you know what the liberals are going to say let them\nIn\nAnd we're going to turn around and say hold on a second but if if their claims of asylum allow them entry in this country what we're really saying is that anyone can come and stay as long as they want anyone is allowed to show up in this country and we are effectively have an open border\nBecause all that all of us required for someone who's to say the right things now the word is out now we know what the loopholes All right now the people in these communities that\nAre coming into this country no that all have to say is I fear violence in my home country\nI fear violence I mean violence can happen at any one country there's a song it was mostly for people that are fleeing either a horrific natural disaster and by the way they're supposed to go back usually we give them temporary status for natural disasters\nBecause we're we're ... we're carrying country but we're not supposed to be Trump's rock supposed to just be you know the the the fat cow to be milked by the rest of the world and that's what's happening the Democrats have no way of turning his back by the way\nThey understand ah they understand that quite honestly\nThere is\nNo way that they can explain to the American people what it is that they really want if they told the truth to Americans would ever\nWould have a lot of folks would say oh what a second I don't think that's gonna work I don't think you can just bring in endless amounts are foreigners\nNot through the legal process not go through the normal channels of assimilation that had been in this country for centuries now or join this community that now liberals speak to specifically be illegal immigrants in this country the quote on documented joined the ranks of the aggrieved undocumented\nAnd try to get them access to the public treasury as fast as possible\nWe are Twenty one trillion dollars in debt I'll talk to you more about that later on the show bringing people without a high school level education and without English language skills by the millions is not actually making our economy stronger that is why\nIt's an obvious lie if if Americans are not\nBalancing the budget at the end of the year for the American people are actually paying as they go when it comes to government spending we really think that bringing a lot of foreigners who don't have skills who aren't going to remember I'm Talking about illegal foreigners\nThey're going to be the ones that set the economy right I don't think so I Know you know there's two but\nMan is frustrating\nIt is frustrating that you're going to hear so much is going to turn into one big media sob story to all who would drawing these people who would turn these people away how could you show
