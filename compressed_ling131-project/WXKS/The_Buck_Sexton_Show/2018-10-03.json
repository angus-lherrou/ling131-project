told that is of course told that is why people like me in a a bunch of others but not the mainstream media not the overwhelming number of media outlets out there they're so invested in telling you

say fine if people want to quibble over how good the results have been that's one thing\nBut you can't just regard them you can't say oh the economy is amazing but it's not Trump that did this or

what's really happening here\nOr there and there's some other stuff and I always been said about Trump in the last day or so you had to a union leader or union leader no less thanking Trump for tax

need a higher tax for why should we have the highest corporate tax rate in the world why does that make sense someone explain that to me because we get the best government services for our business is

notion that she needs to turn the country around I I keep returning to this notion to this point because I I have to tell you I'm I'm sitting here and I keep saying to myself\nWhat exactly is the Democrats hate so much about what's happening around us well what is really their objection again we're not starting wars in countries we don't need to be at war and we don't have some you know we

failing or the Senate not having the votes one or the other\nAnd that is this notion now that the only way that we can come back from this brink of partisan a base is if Kavanaugh becomes the sacrificial lamb if Kavanaugh is the one who has to get swept aside\nHere so that we can bring the country back together you see so that we can heal the nation\nI Want to slap myself as I say that but\nTrust me that resonates with people like flake Collins and Murkowski and you could see today some of them at least jockeying around this issue a little bit trying to position themselves for maximum political benefit around\nTrump oh how how could he so terrible making fun of the victim\nWasn't making fun of or he was really making fun of her testimony which is a different thing are there are people who could make fun to a great extent of Dr Ford you know people will say oh she's so credible she came across as very came across to me is very strange in a little disturbed\nAnd you know the day off I'm hearing all these people that are going to the media and saying well well I was you know I had a sexual assault in my password I Know somebody who's actually saw the show I Believe Dr Ford dishes\nEthically him a ... completely on cannabis unacceptable position that will lead to monstrous outcomes something bad happened to me so I think that any time there's an allegation of that bad thing involving someone else I Believe that person or I Believe the allegations\nThat's not the way the system's supposed to work that's not the way moral judgment can be passed but this was a hysteria there was a frenzy here and it was ... so much by politics but also\nBy the personalization of so much of this Kavanaugh versus Ford situation you'll notice the second the second allegation firmer mirrors and the third from sweat neck they barely even discussing that any more\nJust ... you really can't make a case that somebody should be believe when that person isn't even sure that she knows what she's saying as we found out what their emir as and in the third case with sweat Nick it's an intelligence test watched that interview with Julie sweating it where she's talking about gang rape and being\nIn in community college and hanging out with high school kids and all this stuff and and if you think\nThat she's being truthful don't buy any books with big words in them anytime soon I it's just the truth if you think she's\nBeing truthful your your skills of discernment in analysis are ah are lacking\nTo say the least but don't be fooled by what's happening with the damage here don't be fooled\nFor a second just because the narratives are collapsing just because now we can really come out now it's really safe out there to say hold on a second there is some big gap there is some whole there's women who were lying or we believe the second and third are lying and that's just a coincidence but the first is also honest\nI have a hard time believing that now we can speak honestly and truthfully about what has been said to us last week in week and a half and\nWe need to understand that Democrats aren't just relying on that in order to take down Kavanaugh now it's going to be all we need bipartisanship oh\nThere's a temperament issue here as we discussed yesterday it's about it's about Kavanaugh's character you see\nTheir stuff in his background this is the latest just breaking before I came on the air the ... the Senate with Feinstein in Coons just you're basing themselves for the amusement of the pain cat wearing lunatic left\nThey're saying now that will be

fights\nI drank\nDid a\nConcert and or substances are what are we were all\nMy records six pack and an hour before uh before going back to class or things like that\nWhen Obama talked to the media about his\nPredilection for illegal drugs fighting in his own words there right being a dog when he was younger it was evidence of a kind of authenticity and I guess the charm oh he oh yeah that's right Obama he was living living life on the wild side back in the day\nAnd he we also know that he needed to doing cocaine which\nI Would say is in a different category for most people than alcohol or even marijuana right cocaine is\nThat's a whole step above and no one had any issue with it in the media at least nobody somebody you might have been an issue with it but the media to have an issue with it\nAnd now we're supposed to be of jak his cabinet was drinking beer that's what this really about\nThe behavior that involved a all kinds of legal stuff that Obama did was held up as being cool by the way I I Know I'm just gonna say this\nIs just my my sense of it I got I got no evidence for back back this up you know you could say maybe bucks credible when he said it's maybe not I don't believe they're bomb and got into fights I don't believe it I think you said at three things that makes it sound cool I don't believe that Obama got into fights you can tell me I'm Crazy\nBut nope it strikes me as a just I don't I don't see it\nI don't know and I never prove it one way or the other\nBut just when he said it is not really I don't think I don't\nThink Obama's been at a fist fight in his whole life that would be my guest\nUm but then again I'm just drawing based on what's credible folks I don't I don't have any evidence Rome or the other ... going based on what I think is credible here\nBut the double standard problem is a very big one whether we're talking about the Clintons and the sexual stuff that went on a with Bill Clinton whether we're talking about the way the media treated Bill Clinton's accusers versus the way the media treats lousy forty bloody borders sacrosanct why\nWhy can't we look into her past what she she made herself a center of national attention she did not have to do this I I also have never her civic duty that was the justification for all this was your civic duty\nReally who believes that she's an ideologue she's ... she's a left wing partisan\nAnd she thought she had a chance to take out a a game changing Supreme Court fifth vote that would have gone not even that conservative by the way I think Kavanaugh I mean don't get me started on this I think Kavanaugh is going to be much closer to Roberts and a lot of people realize Roberts is the one who saved Obamacare\nI don't think the cabinet 'cause I think cabinet have a kind of beat them judicial minimal ism approach\nUnlike what the left goes for which is well I like this and so now my opportunity to make it the law the land I don't think that that's what you can expect from Kavanaugh at all but you know Obama's past\nShortcomings foibles illegal activity whatever that was all charming and grade and you know evidence that Obama was cool\nA Bill Clinton's sexual improprieties which ... in a whole different category of anything that Obama did I'm not trying to see I I can make these distinctions the left will say yeah capitals like Bill Cosby cars are idiots\nOr you know what Obama did is probably pretty normal teenager and young adult stuff am I trying to say that he was I think honesty is overstating it if anything to sound cool\nAh what Bill Clinton did when he was a full grown adult and governor of Arkansas and then later president was disgusting and illegal and and horrific and the media covered forum for eight years\nReally you you look back to the way that the media dealt with Bill Clinton and the sex abuse and sex scandals surrounding him and it's what gave us the conservative media that we have\nYou could even argue that people like me even the careers that we have now and the outlets that we have a new alternative means of getting information out there exists the Drudge Report and talk radio and\nThey exist the way they do because the media sold that so for Bill Clinton I [noise] so you know that this stuff is not distant memory and this is not an remember what people say oh the Clintons that was a long time ago well we're talking about\nKavanaugh allegation that stretch back from thirty five years ago so I don't really want to hear the oh that was a long time ago thing now oh we have more on this that we're

papers story you know at a paper like this the New York times or big national paper\nAnd find myself barely able to get through it\nUh this is I think it was twelve thousand words as long as what I saw I mean this is like a novella\nAbout Trump and and here's the short version but I'll I'll get into what they're really trying to say or what what the purpose of all this is they're saying that Trump is in self made and that Trump and his whole family were engaged in\nQuote suspect tax schemes now is Trump's self made not if not if you're going to say that he pulled himself up by his bootstraps and didn't get any money from his family of course not he got money for his family inherited a very large real estate portfolio and you know he was born rich no question about it\nNow has he built in ... in international brand an irrational recognizable brand that did not exist\nAre based on what he had been given inherited of course and did he inherited a\nPolitical future than anyone ever think you'd be compressed the United states no so I I don't think this is nearly as potent a criticism as the New York times thinks it is right but they're saying oh his books and the art a deal\nAnd all this stuff is is a poke 'em I'd solved bunk nonsense\nThen there's the other part of it and and there's I when I say excruciating detail I really mean and they're like on any you know bought a whole bunch of white out to use for some paperwork back in Nineteen eighty seven and any I mean they're just\nMan this is an exhaustive they say it's based on a hundred thousand pages plus of documents in interviews and all this stuff and it felt like I was reading a hundred thousand pages of it myself\nReading that is a front page New York times story a or their audience you could only be reading this and could really care about this because they have trumped arrangement syndrome and this was in a sense a trumped arrangements syndrome manifesto\nThere's nobody could care that much about what Fred Trump Donald Trump's father did in terms of his business dealings really Thirty years ago\nTwenty years ago where does Trump's wealth come from and I couldn't help but read through this and and come to this this this kept popping up in my head that I as I was\nYes that's right I was lying by pool in Las Vegas for a while is nice you know get a little bit of sun although after about five minutes ago it's easier to my son for me to get the shade my Irish skin doesn't\nDo well with it but I couldn't help but think imagine if they had\nDone this kind of a deep dive into the finances of the Clinton crime family imagine if they had really spent effort looking into what the Clinton Foundation did and did not do what ways the Clintons were able to ah leverage\nThe funding that they were getting ostensibly for charitable purposes in order to support different aspects of their lifestyle but I've never seen a comprehensive media deep dive\nBy any newspaper or any TV organization into what was really going on with the Clintons with the how is it that the Clintons were worth a hundred million dollars within a decade of leaving the White House a hundred million dollars plus\nRemember to have that you know you've got to make about a hundred and sixty a hundred and Seventy million\nTo have to be worth of a network of a hundred but how can make all this money\nWhat is it they didn't they didn't own a company they didn't create a product how they make all this money it's it's astonishing when you think about it oh oh by giving speeches wow that's really amazing speech\nAt five I have the ...\nThat was kind of I'm sounding a little more like George our banks instead of Hillary and my my Hillary is getting a little rusty folks got into more Hillary impersonation um I didn't carry on impersonation out here at the confidence that link plans you're doing yoga and stretching and everybody loved it so see already on a kind of pure anytime you needed to\nBut they're talking about all these different from tax schemes and here's here's what is so dirty about isn't it reminds me to censor what they've done the cabin ought to\nAll this has passed a statute of limitations so so they can say oh you know we we think that he's a tax cheat\nIn a criminal which we know Harry Reid said about Mitt Romney not long ago as well and it was a total lie but he said it on the floor of the Senate so he couldn't be sued forties you legally free to say whatever he wants there\nAnd it was intended to just be a political black guy for Romney that Harry Reid gave him and that was all that was what was\nThe New York times says that Trump was engaged in these tax schemes that Trump was doing all this uh you know\nShady behind the scenes\nUm evading of what was due the government and I mean Fred drop here and from\nA Donald Trump is well they're saying this\nAnd we turn around and say well hold on a second this will never be adjudicated this will never see the inside of a court so how do we do if they're telling the truth about this or not is anyone really going to dive into this hundred thousand pages and also\nWhat is it a shady tax dealing really mean do they have them dead to writes on tax evasion no of course now they're saying that he you know did this and that and try to find all these different ways to avoid paying taxes really an avoidance of taxes is not criminal\nAvoidance of taxes is\nTaking advantage of the fact that the tax code is Seventy thousand plus pages it's a mess it's a disaster but liberals don't want to change it 'cause they like it and the government like that and Republicans unfortunately in the Congress like it too because that's the single biggest ways they can influence policy and engaging doling out favors to people which is the tax code\nI mean you you make changes attacks they changed the whole country\nGot to pass legislation you need the other side so that people pay attention that can be harder changes in the tax code giving people carve outs and giveaways wide Seventy thousand pages because\nIt's a way for the Congress to pick winners and losers and do favors for donors\nSo Trump dry celebrities is the way that a lot of other folks do two or he has in the past\nYou I think it's good though I think we should have a flat tax and people should know about the fair tax whatever something like that it should be on a postcard that was one of the things that really did like about the cruise candidates the I Will say that he was very opposed the IRS and the way that it's currently constituted but it's based on Trump is just\nIt's boring long winded and there's not nearly as much there there they'd like to think even though they've said they've gone through a hundred thousand pages\n... must be must be must get tiresome to be such a a relentless Trump paid or after a while but at the New York times I guess this is just this is what pushes them on you know this is
