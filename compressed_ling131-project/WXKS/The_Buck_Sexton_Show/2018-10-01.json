movie called the man with\nThe X ray eyes which was another cheesy horror film so uh I think you would enjoy it\nAs I was only ... because I saw it as a child but I guess my real one is a\nFantastic good one Seventy nine yeah it's one where they started to have a little more special facts involved in movies but I I still go for the the kind of raw naked fear that we saw in a night of the living dead but that's what makes\nA\nGood good well I appreciate you joining the conversation thanks for listening to a buck and and let's hold forth we've got to just what was it six weeks left before the

into the robots area it starts turning a little bit below again\nYeah it through a robot is a little too close for people that don't know welcome to Delaware beach talk a bit at Delaware a little too close to Maryland and it gets it suffers from some of that Maryland a liberalism\nYou got that right man well I wanted to say that that that my top scary movie of all time personally I Would have to go with the shining with Jack Nicholson\nYeah there's a lot at the shining it's currently leading in all voting and it's a it's a great movie behind\nYou guys I I just now started the show believe it or not I'm On the AM radio and and the ... that show just started about ten minutes to go round that\nOh cool well in our\nOwn you guys so I'm just now catching I thought the show just started ... you\nKnow the first hour the shining was the leading vote getter despite my constant lobbying to have neither the living dead get the props that it deserves from fifty years of scaring the heck out of people but the shining Islam ethic\nIt is well the shining it's such a ... very well directed movie and uh my only complaint with the shiny\nWe thought that the nickel since character was weird from the very beginning and I think in order to have a real tragic characters shift you have to like the guy first he was weird from\nDid actually hit came off a little bit scary or maybe a little bit psychologically stable and the stats and my correct\nYeah yeah so ... here we are ... on a great political talk show we're analyzing scary movies but\nUh I'd ask John John what'd you want to say about Chuck Schumer because I'm no fan of humor he was my senator for twenty plus years\nI just wanted to say that I have an absolute hatred for the guy and he's got a huge big out and he always said the Robin Hood saw into wearing what he said today about uh the judge dairy said that he was a you know deeply deeply part is saying and is there any as a candidate notice judge from a carrot a\nChuck Schumer is got big mouth and if we don't get our little boat and we'd all you know get out there for the mid term that make things right\nAnd keep things the way they are if not better Schumer is going to be the big boss hog up there and we're gonna have to hear his mouth for the next God only knows our long I Can't stand it\nWell the only thing worse than Schumer would be Schumer and Pelosi so these are ...\nThat's another one like you hit the nail on the head\nYeah these are two very scary realities people and we have to make sure that you take someone to the polls because the Democrats are mobilizing in ways that you have no idea\nAnd despite the fact that the Kavanaugh hearings\nAnd the obvious uh the way this was organized to destroy this man and several this nomination it is
