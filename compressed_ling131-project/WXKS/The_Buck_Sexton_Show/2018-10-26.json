[noise] excuse me in mockery\nUh that that would be offensive to some people I I get that I'm I'm not but I'm just saying that\nShe is not even really taking a definitive declared his position on all the she's just trying to have the conversation\nBut because she veered away from black face under any circumstances is racist is wrong is terrible really any darkening of the skin as part of a costume is racist and wrong and terrible NBC\nJust I mean they had different anchors coming after NBC just fed\nHer to the wolves on this one and then that led to this which I always find so depressing and and the whole thing is always so sad the Soviet style show trial forced apology\nI'm here is what she said in an effort obviously to keep her job one that was doomed to fail before she went on the air please play her apology\nShall I Megan Kelly and I want to begin with ... I'm Sorry [noise] when they heard they answered a we had a discussion here about political correctness and Halloween costumes and that conversation turned that whether it is ever okay for a person of one race to dress up as another a\nBlack person making their face later or a white person making errors darker can make a costume complete I defended the idea saying as long as it and that was respectful and part of the Halloween costume it pulled okay well I was wrong and I am sorry\nOne of the great types of sitting in his chair each day is getting to discuss different points of view and as I talk and sometimes I listen and yesterday I learned\nI learned that given the history of blackface playing an awful way by race it in this country and it's not okay for that to be part of any costume Halloween or otherwise\n\nNow I could add older mega called me up and I have a soft spot for her because she used to be nice if you know started my career and having on her show and used to tell me that I was very talented and had a huge future\nAnd that I was amazing when I filled in for Rush Limbaugh and I was you know her favorite of all the Rush Limbaugh feelings and and you know so\nSo I have a secret soft spot maybe not so secret anymore for Megan Kelly I'm just going to be honest about that okay I Do even though I think that she turned over people and made a horrible decision by going to NBC and was ungrateful for the position jihad at Fox and all that okay fine\nI would've advised her because I understand how this game is played now because I have to deal with it from both sides and no one's paying me tens of millions of dollars\nNot even anything in the universe of that to do this kind of work that once you're in this kind of a gym you can't you can't take the oh my gosh I throw myself on the mercy of the politically correct to court\nOh my gosh please please just just let me keep my job I'm so sorry I'm so sorry because there has been a\nA very clear shift\nWhere now when you upset the PC police now when the social justice warriors come for you you have two choices fights and go down fighting or in your ritualized apology humiliation and then let\nThem take your head those are the choices that's it and maybe you win\nThe fight by the way maybe you're able to defend yourself and and see it through and but I promise you if you do the\nOh my gosh mayor cobalt I'm so sorry I'm so terrible I should never have thought such as the number to then it just goes gee\nIt's like a it that's why I said at the Soviet charge for all this is you know you've you've signed your confession now you're definitely guilty now they definitely have to destroy you now they absolutely have to ruin and they will\nHow Megan did not know that is I don't know beyond me she should have known that she absolutely should have been aware that they wanted to get rid of her anyway her show's ratings were not strong the NBC audience was not warming sure she's not a morning show\nHost this was not ...

House is not helpful it all\nOn the collateral damage\nIts own and coming from the top and now the NFL has become a target\nHere now in my heart that President Trump there's a lot of responsibility for rhetoric that made it almost inevitable that top Democrats and the media what they targeted\nThe say there is no connection between what Trump has said about Hillary Clinton Brock Obama Eric Holder John Brennan and CNN and the thinking of the person who sent those pipe bombs is pool party this is someone\nWho has a weaponized Trump's\nTwitter feed and made it into a hit list\nNotice are we switch there and that little montage replayed it starts off with very\nProminent famous anti Trump Democrats saying all manner of you know\nNasty violin gag rich Henri is that a word I think it's a word degrading I think I think I might have just made up degrow Tori is that I did I just make up a word or derogatory degree tore oh yeah\nYeah I did I just made up a word um yeah I just made up a word\nOn live radio that's interesting you know we'll go with it derogatory was what I was looking for [laughter] but but ... rich already sounds doesn't that also you know I kinda sounded like a word I kind of made up my word there for a second a folk spin a long way [laughter]\nYou go but I you know that's when you know you're a\nReal baller like Bush when when Bush said Mr underestimated I knew exactly what he meant you know and that's not word when he called himself the decider that wasn't technically a word either but it might as well up in a word and now it is or what I think it's great you know who's the decider who say oh who's the person who makes the decisions I don't know the decider\nUh anyway so I made up or they're let's get back to the substance or so they they are all saying these things about Trump very nasty things very um two rockets or things and then they all immediately jumped to its Trump's fault is Trump's fault that this clearly disturbed very\nYes dangerous and and an evil but she added pathetic human being a decided to send these these\nHomemade they were pipe bombs and they were they were alive bombs I mean they could have gone off at this guy knew what he was doing thank God they did not um but there's really no principle that the left is using here to determine you know what is acceptable what is acceptable political speech and what does incitement it's just what is your side\nDo that's bad but it's my side do that's okay and that's really the primary separation\nThere's really not a lot to separate things beyond that there's not much that you can point you were you'd say you know oh I see that there is some establishment of an actual baseline of of how we can adjudicate these things no no no it's just my side good your side bad\nI and we know that this was going to happen\nOr it's just it's just very it's frustrating to see this um because it is so it is so obvious it is so clear oh\nGovernor Cuomo also wants to weigh in on the bombs\nLet me first assert that a bomb is a combustible the vice with explosive material that can be dangerous place Thirteen\nPolitical mania this fervor rancor hatred or just say this again and again and again thank God nobody got hurt [noise]\nMost importantly did you know that three years ago\n... and all of a sudden\nHe came up that out and\nSearch for missing Richard Simmons now\nStuff people are talking about every established by the government Boston it's all for conservative\nI think the president of the United states\nShould take responsibility for the kind of violence that we're paying\nFor the first time in different ways I think the president of the United states for than dog with through to his constituency making them believe that their problems are caused by those people over their head and I think that there are that they believe the president wants them to do\nIt as oh way really does do a lot to promote violence now they're trying to turn it on our costs would they would like to intimidate us and of course we must be a lively must be bullies and how can a polish ways but\nWe never stop this end up by the justice ... in this country Maxine Waters very foolish\nAnd you know we we just gave you there on the one hand she's calling for essentially rabble rousing she wants people to get up and faces she wants to you know yell and scream and be nasty and mean and you know don't don't give them a moment's peace and then she's you know saying that\nTrump is the one who is is inciting violence Trump is the one who is causing a causing problems and this\nIs why I I knew this was going to be the case all week uh assuming that we got to where we are now where we know that this guy\nIs a wacko and\nIs going to be the right is going to be saddled with this with his complete you know look he's he's a dangerous he's a dangerous maniac so he's got to spend the rest of his life in prison and he needs to know the need to be serious consequences for this well you're in the end of the guys also I mean is it there's something sad about someone who is show\nShow deranged empathetic and an evil and and just the whole thing I mean he's a really pathetic human being um but ... now we're supposed to act like this guy has supporters are this guy is representative\nOf a broader sense but on the right meanwhile do we have a country of three hundred and twenty million people and now I can think of er there's one there's one\nPerson that we can associate with being a Trump supporter or who\nSince Trump has been president people would say oh well\nYou know he's a he's a lethal threat because of his uh what you've uses his politics um but now\nThat they're going to make this you're going to hear about this for ever is never going to go where they're going to be talking about this one I mean they still talk about oh an abortion clinic bombers from like the Nineteen nineties I think it's like Ninety\nNinety three you'll still hear about bombing abortion clinics haven't happened and you know a very long time but that's\nAnytime you talk about terrorism and and then you also get into this whole discussion and\nI wanted to discuss this with the young Turks guy who was on my show and rising morning with junk we're never going to hear again you watch next week there'll be this oh right wing terrorism is really scary terrorism right wing terrorism kills more people that tends to be the\nThe headline that they lead with and I always have to point out well\nThe big issue there is one do you exclude nine eleven from it\nAh that's first and foremost but then also there's a whole bunch of other things like how do you really count this\nWhat is the determining factor whether something is counter to terrorism because\nWith some of the federal statistics that they look out for this they'll say well you know a neo Nazi got into a bar fight and stab someone to death Nicole ... well if the guy was a minority they'll say ... now is that a hate crime is murder yes\nIs it terrorism though in the way that we think of terrorism the the definition can be a little bit ah a little bit less obvious less clear right it's a hate crime it's murder but is it terrorism or and then you you look at the way that they constantly exclude from a from the discussion\nOr an from the statistics forwarded attacked him in the moment that you start looking at worded attacks and you realize that radical Islam is far and away the biggest threat that we\nYou know you look at the times square bomber you look at the underwear bomber frugal most of them a column I mean these are attacks would it kill hundreds of people most of the right wing terrorism at the site with a with a couple of exceptions over the last Fifteen Years most of the right when jurors may site is single acts of violence against individuals'\nBy a neo Nazis or or or white nationalist again pain is evil or\nCrimes that should be punished the full extent of the law but it's not strategic level national threat terrorism the way the radical Islamic terrorism is but I'm just telling you you're going to now that we've got this guy who's been captured today\nThis this uh says our\nFellow says are ah say rock was where I keep forgetting is how to save his last name I mean everyone remembers his first name but not not studied everyone's saying uh everyone saying that you know he's obviously so pro from Betty such a bad guy or say ... say opposites Iraq say are\nOr what is a we know what it is is not I mean these American but what what's his his parents nationality or his parents parents nationalities wondering if there's any news his first name says are the kind of unusual anyway [noise] ah\nYeah they're ... they're going to run with this though and this is where we have to deal with now this was not going away anytime soon it's a unfortunately going to be used against us and\nI don't know if it's going to sway the midterms I really hope that it does in so I Hope that people can see that this is just one deranged maniac but ... you're going to see floods ... zone coverage of this issue for the next\nSolid week and change\nBecause they want this to be first and foremost on the\nMinds of as many voters as possible and they're going to be they're going to be really pushing this and they really want people to think that this is\nThis is what will need to be on the lookout for the real concern is right wing terrorism when [noise] so there's going to be crazy people have all kinds from all places but\nHere's a tweet from President Trump quote Twitter has removed many people from my count\nAnd more importantly they've done something that makes it much harder to join they've stifle growth to a point where

Fox News the hunt began and the New York area and ended a thousand miles away in South Florida the suspect in a series of mail bombs fifty six year old says are say in custody authorities say he has a history of financial problems and a record of past rats including one for making a bomb threat\nAnd don't want to give it to other people and use the government and the power that they have either in or outside of government in order to make sure to de keep the stuff that they have stuff and the other people don't\nAh that sounds very that has a Marxist twang right that sounds like it's very much about the redistribution of wealth and I think it's show noteworthy that President Obama who himself\nHe's incredibly wealthy incredibly powerful that's where he knows that's a sweet spot for Democrats and the envy push that pushed that notion it's pitch powerful politics and\nThe other side of being cynical ... what is it that Republicans Republicans want to give a little less of their own money\nTo the government there being greedy\n... this is a a at a central talking point on the left you'll you'll hear this all the time you know tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires okay well they're still paying a vastly disproportionate share of taxes overall I mean are the top one percent pays I think thirty percent of all federal income taxes\nSo there we already have a very progressive income tax system but that doesn't really factor in does it for for Obama it's all just about\nYou know ... you are oh you being the people that he's talking to wherever it is wherever it is every speech he gave same basic theme there are the other guys\nDon't want the government to have more control over lives and take more of their stuff because they don't want you to have more stuff he creates this perception that prosperity and security\nAnd all these things that people strive for and society that the zero some one side has it the other side doesn't mean what what what are the Democrats have to say how do they explain all these Democrat billionaires who are out there you know what do they have to say about that and the answer is\nYou know they never really addressed is you know why why is it that if you're an incredibly wealthy Silicon Valley entrepreneur hedge fund manager a Hollywood celebrity good on the list and these are people that have amassed incredible fortunes\nAll Democrats why are they all Democrats\nYou know what what I find to be the case that people people that have had to work incredibly hard and overcome tremendous struggle\nTo make their money uh tend to be at least more fiscally conservative people that when the genetics lottery by being incredibly beautiful Hollywood people or people who\nGet really really lucky with you know signing onto a start up early on in Silicon valley you know being like the tenth guy in the door and now there are options are worth a billion dollars and\nThey tend to be liberal I you know this is just that anecdotal but that's my sense of it if you had to sweat it out rich\nMany night's sleep or you know do your own taxes take out your own trash a cut back on on you know eating out because you're trying to make a a business work that you started yourself I just find that those people in my experience\nOr concerns I just\nThat's the only way I can explain the difference in the economic philosophy here are but Obama was preaching about even more than than just the notion of the powerful in the privilege and how they want to hold onto their stuff he also kept talking about the economy play that play Seventeen [laughter]\nFor big banks [noise]\nCrisis in our life [noise] and Democrats [noise]\n\n\nOh why did it start with Obama\nHow how about we've had even we had an even bigger financial pull back with the great depression and we recovered from that and ...\nAnd entered period of huge economic growth and boom I mean Obama really at what point does he does does it become laughable that he thinks he takes credit for the economy and we're we're almost two years into the Trump presidency we're still hearing about\nHow about ... reminder by the way Obama never achieved or three percent growth GDP Growth for an entire year never\nOnly president in history for whom that's the case\nSo when do we get to say that this is just ridiculous that what he's saying is\nIs transparently false and and I would also note you know the uh the government was the problem with\nWhat happened in the great recession and liberals don't ever talk about this you know when he says agree banks and all this stuff that's what happened no it would really happen was that liberals said that banks to lend to people who can't pay it back\nBut if you can't pay it back and you happen to be non privileged and particularly the fall into certain minority categories\nThen banks to lend you even though you're bad you're a bad bet for a loan and you do that enough and the federal government backed off those loans and says well we'll we'll pay if these people to fall we we've got you got you covered Wall Street\nAnd Wall Street does what it does\nThat's what really happened [noise] you know one question Obama should be forced to ask or be forced to answer rather by someone in the media would be what exactly did you do that was so great for the economy\nWhat exactly does does he think\nGot and it was just got to grow up they caught him to go go go gotta going how what what exactly did he do and I think the truth is it's\nVery clear he he has absolutely no answer that I mean the stimulus was was atrocious as soon as was a huge waste of money and that was money that was put on the tab for future generations to pay so what\n... what did Obama bring to the table when it came to get an economy of running answers he doesn't even have an answer he's just out there it's just all demagoguery it's all so shallow but really that's a good summary of what we have for eight

always try to tell folks ...\n... you know what my my main thing with with the liberals that I Know my liberal friends is when I when they asked me they say oh I don't understand how you don't know the countries in so much trouble or institutions they got all all bummed out about all this stuff really just you know Trump is destroying America and they they cry about it and they get really upset\nOr whether we'll hope they don't actually cry but they they want about it I Try to tell them you know it really doesn't matter to\nYou as much as you think it does these things that you keep talking about you know are fraying institutions it's not going to affect your job is not gonna affect your home it doesn't affect\nAnything that you think it especially when you're talking about stuff like Russia collusion and but I I really do believe that there is a a big part of the general population that likes the anxiety\nOf catastrophe that they like to\nCling to this notion that oh my gosh like this terrible things going to happen and I'm not saying there aren't real\nConcerns that we should all have you know first and foremost among them as you know we're all gonna die that's the truth that we have to deal with right there there are some real things out there to be worried about 'em you know we we are probably going to explode or currency at some point and you know the our currency has a\nHas an incredible track record historically of always always leading to financial disaster there was no it has never been avoided fuel currency leads to financial disaster there is a hundred percent\nA track record of this show you know that's a real concern a disease that is in curable because of all the antibiotics you know especially antibiotic resistant bacteria in a you know a mass infection or map mass\nViral plague things like that that's real concern and day to day concerns are very real you know how you get along with your friends and family and how you doing work but the concerns that liberals obsess over or delusions\nUh this notion that the planet is going to die and I mean that quite literally the entire planet will die unless we start making insignificant modifications George day to day lives are with regard to seal to admissions that's crazy\nThat it's not based in any reality that's not a normal thing to be worried about but it's not a normal thing to think that's just bunkers\nAnd when you start to look at the other things that get liberals really upset and Russia collusion and election security and all that uh they they are worried about things for the sake of worrying in many cases but the problem is they believe that they don't\nKnow that they're doing that always speaking of a of of uh you know very real pie DSD ah I saw you know in the in one of the opening sequences of picky blinders which is an excellent show 'em and they really make use of the backdrop of the first World War\nThese you know the now they're really just trying to take the fun out of Halloween if you can't wear sexy costumes and you can appropriate cultures what the heck is Halloween for an adult at least and for kids I Would note you know it maybe it's a good lesson in a sense because you end up realizing that you don't really want to eat\nCandy all the time you know you you don't really want to be in a position where you're just constantly ... on recent pieces you will reach a saturation a saturation point for reaches pieces\nYou will find yourself at some point do have eaten all the ... you know ... the most uh most popular standing in the world\nThat's right I mean that's number one it was a random aside I almost a started working when I was waiting to go to the CIA I got a I've got a job\nOffer at a forget which widen remember what it's called out but some big advertising company and they wanted me to work on candy and I'm pretty sure was the Mars account which is a ... so I Would have been peddling M. and m's all over the world and most of the CIA take me thank thank God that did\nAh but yeah you eat all that Kenny realized you don't want to eat that much candy as a kid you know nobody really wants to eat that much candy I mean you just reaches level you're like I've I've had enough I don't really need to do this anymore\nAnd that so you learn that as a kid in it but then as an adult as a guy you know you you get to be routed than women tend to dress some women some without a lawyer like buck I dress like a\nUm I dress like a witch and not an Audi which but it's scary one or whatever that's that's cool\nBut some college age and and ... and older you are young women tend to dress in more provocative fashions opens August worried about this it also is a reminder for me that cultural appropriation which has gotten all this attention right now or the or the holiday season\nCultural appropriation is not a thing\nOr it's not even that I disagree with cultural appropriation is that there is no such thing as cultural appropriate it's not even possible it's not something you couldn't do because culture doesn't belong to anyone or any group\nCulture is just a way that things are John ... a ... way of um either eating or dressing or speaking or any number of things\nAnd any human being can adopt any culture that they want that's just the nature of and in fact all cultures in a constant state of appropriation and evolution\nAnd the only way the culture of all just by having other influences that affected so there's no such thing as a static culture therefore you can't be stealing someone's culture you can only be part of the general cultural odds most is like that for about a fun fun word there that everybody else is engaged it as well\nBut now I also remember some of my my best and worst costumes over the years John do you have a ... a costume and you're either very embarrassed about her very proud of\nThere'll be show I don't I don't think I've ever dressed up\nAn adult would dress up for Halloween as an adult now but I don't see how it is I feel your call me out and see what's out there\nIs producer Mike is he going to be talking to a naughty nurse right now are sea
