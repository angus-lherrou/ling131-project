I'm\nJoni Ernst shoes off to the side but she was up there too but you had Susan Collins front and center in a very professional look I think she got a new hair cut too I'm sure she did you know oh it's all about image it's all about optics\nSusan Susan Collins up there on one side Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia Republican senator\nTo the other side Cindy Hyde Smith a senator from Mississippi right behind her so now you have this moment where we as conservatives have had the ... beat none of us for the last three weeks\nBeing accused of being just the worst people in the world the party that does not understand women\nAnd you have a woman delivering the knockout punch a woman who is known to be pro choice so now you have someone\nAnd that other women especially boy that was ... that argument that judge Kavanaugh is going to a destroy roe v Wade you have a pro choice women standing in front of the world talking about how Kavanaugh can't do it\nThat in fact that the the people that\nThe um the Democrats who are worried about tearing apart ruby ... years ago not only did they not do it they wrote the argument against overturning roe v wait\nSo you have brilliantly staged brilliantly written delivered for an audience that would then turn it into prime time response\nSo after all of the theater this week after all the circus atmosphere for the last eight days in Washington\nDC you ended with an epic finish so bravo to you GOP bravo to you and to the what was it five hundred plus protestors arrested today I think I'm not sure\nI think Spartacus got arrested today I'm not sure I think that that would make sense for him because that would be a good campaign commercial for a twenty twenty presidents he hopes for ah for Cory Booker or should we call them sugar as I\nTaught you guys last night I found the ah yearbooks from some of the angry Democrats on the Judiciary Committee started going through their senior year books to say gee what was the new year book\nCory Booker had his nickname sugar and I don't know about you but\nI Lived in the New York New Jersey metro area where Cory Booker lived and went to school in those years in the late eighties and a\nBook or we called a cocaine was referred to as sugar so why were you sugar senator is there something you need to tell us and also the guy who said he had um groped a young woman at\nThe age of Fifteen in the article he wrote called stealing second or something like that a book or a also had his senior quote was let's go\nAll the way\nSo Cory Booker has some ... to do but he may be got arrested today it's not really an arrest as we saw with Amy Schumer yesterday it's kind of like being scurried off to get your picture taken and then somebody pays fifty bucks you get a ticket and you go home or you go back to the protests\nBut there is so much to get to today so much I'm just so happy about this and we will dig into it but I Want to remember what sparked all of this and it was Donald Trump nominating Mr Kavanaugh judge Kavanaugh\nAnd on the date when that happened\nChris Matthews the elder statesmen and MSNBC you have to wonder how much longer he's going to continue\nIn his role ah Chris Matthews was on the air talking about revenge\nAnd I tell you all of this\nAll of this anger towards anything Donald Trump does towards any nominee he brings forward all of\nThis resistance an obstruction which started the day after Trump was elected\nIt's a dangerous thing for the Democrats it to\nWhen you go out and develop all of your\nMissions in life based on revenge they tell you to dig two graves because you're going to be joining whoever you think you're going to take down remember this from June twenty eighth\nThis year Chris Matthews on MSNBC following the announcement of the Supreme Court pick from President Trump\nSays this time for vengeance for what happened two years ago and if they don't read the vengeance now with four and a half weeks four and a half months to go before the election they will not look very strong to their base and I think there'll be under attack\nYeah yeah that was a good plan wasn't it wasn't a Chris Matthews\nIf you don't if you don't go after vengeance and he's talking about Merrick\nGarland he was talking about Hillary's loss or I'll I'll tell you talk about backfiring because the way the shrill arguments came out without facts which was a hundred and eighty degrees from what Susan Collins delivered today they sounded like a bunch\nOf people especially when you hear the chanting the chanting the nonstop shrill chanting it just great and great and great\nNow I I'd like to say this is a a a good sign for the midterms but a month in political terms is an eternity it's an\nAbsolute eternity so I have sort of a plan that I think the GOP should lay out in advance of the midterms that will keep the interests of those of us who are conservatives who wants to try and save the house although it's a really tough tough event to try and pull off\nTo save the house when the president or out of the other part when you know what happens when you get the house and the Senate and the presidency and the very next election the midterms\nHistory tells us it always balances out and the voters will get power back to the other party\nSo for the GOP to retain the house would be a little bit of a miracle but I have a plan and that will share with you I also want to hear your thoughts on today if you have any thoughts on that it's friday let's have some fun\nAnd I have a really ridiculous question for you I Know the other day I asked\nA question about what's the what was the scariest movie of all time and a lot of you came up with great answers well today I reached maximum anger\nAt the worst jangle ever and I know\nYou've heard jingles it doesn't have to be a current jingle it can be an old commercial jingle one is the worst jingle ever you know it's an ear worm it sticks in your ear I'm going to give you money you want to call in with yours and you can sing it or you can ... you can say however you want\nBut when I hear one age seven seven times for kids I Won a stab my radio\nOne ... for kids and then they say donate your car today they don't say donate your car today they say donate your and what the hell is done neck\nOr that's my crazy thought for the day if you have any thoughts for this Friday a celebratory thought as we get into a great weekend hopefully hopefully twenty four hours from now we'll have a new justice\nOr give us a call a for for nine hundred Bach aid for for nine hundred to eight to five Mike oh Palca in four bucks sex then on the buck sex than show\n\nYou want to be smart when you're hiring you don't have in this time and resources and you need the best people you know what's not smart posting to job sites one by one you know it's not smart waiting around for people to apply to you when you could be going out there and

unfilled all you have to do is listen\nTo what Mike Rowe talks about if you don't follow Mike Rowe on Twitter or Facebook or visit\nMike Rowe works on the line Mike Rowe works all one\nWord you're missing out if you would like to have a career that you're probably never going to worry about being unemployed there are literally tens of thousands of jobs that are good paying jobs we're talking fifty to a hundred and fifty grand a year and\nThey are jobs you might need a little trade school for but micro works will show you\nHow you can uh get skill and then go to work and Mike puts out scholarships for stuff like that\nSo uh check that I didn't mean to get off track oh also the fifth number one in all the top issues of what voters are looking for in the midterms the fifth inning guns because Democrats are going to try and make gun rights again a big deal\nAnd Donald Trump is a I think Donald Trump is throwing a couple of bones towards the people\nWho are a kind of squishy on guns now I'm a Second Amendment guy I'm On a lifetime man or a member I'm a concealed carry weapons permit holder I'm a\nBeliever in getting trained and being sure\nYou know how to operate your firearms and keep them safe but I also understand there are people who are ... another bonus word of the day today hospital a phobia you don't want to ... ... someone who when they hear the word gun\nThey immediately lose it on the little sister who hears the word gun\nAnd instantly her blood pressure goes up I could buy a pop tart into the shape of a gun and my sister would have a problem but the president has said he is going to sign something on bump stocks\nAnd if you are a fan of bump stocks than a I'm Sorry but um if there if it's illegal to own an automatic weapon a fully automatic weapon I think bump stocks are skirting the law and I think\nWe could win points with some of those a hospital folks if we would say bump\nStocks are a good thing if you disagree with me convince me or just one of those things that this gun owner descent or a member is in lockstep with the president or so\n... that's where I'm at All right that's a couple of things are going on today 'cause we still have a lot to get two for the midterms and I will give you my a plan for how I think\nTime in February Seventy Pasadena, California hard rock band van Halen than there is some kind of

Collins a pat on the back test pseudo John\nHi how are you doing I'm good how are you know I Wonder I Wonder if that was actually one of the reasons why this is true circulate into a cheerful is ... ... the truth to power I think that's one of the reasons why Trump is so popular with people because\nWe're so used to all these politicians just here say they want they're doing something else you're never followed up all sounds good come up to a lecture but when somebody actually script sooner heart is you know Congress there's truth to power before Trump that was a pretty rare thing\nAnd I think she tapped into that dream\nBy you know forty out some of his sisters usually people look at the television and they're just like you know like why are we don't want which is why would you go back to a party\nYou know ten times where you know people will be drug to rage stuff that anybody would an ounce of comments parents just have to say you know this is\nAnd the one thing I said the media is so

John John twelve hundred\nThe high court I'm rich Dennison Fox News with three swing senators announcing their plans to vote yes it appears the Senate is likely to confirm Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh tomorrow Republican Senator Susan Collins and Jeff Flake along with Democrat Joe Manchin today announcing they will vote yes\nMike ... at night to be with you\nYou know it's a it's a little bit of history I have to tell you I Am grinning ear to ear tonight oh what a speech today from Susan Collins\nShooting reach out ... look I'm sitting here with my ... wife mercy and ah the end of a long couple of weeks and I don't think it's illegal on on the radio to tell folks that we opened up a bottle of wine and I was telling her I feel\nYour article here and I just feel like we've all been through the ringer\nI Can't imagine what it feels like the Kavanaugh's but we've all been through the raiders were very emotional and that but very important that we win this battle\nIt's it's vital that we go forward and not just for the party and not just for the president and not just for the judge and his family but for what Collins laid out is the rule of law\nOh and and America is the legal system I think would have taken one and the guy had we not going forward and I I Know we're not done yet I Know where we're not across the finish line for about another twenty hours but it's pretty much a fait accompli isn't not math\n[noise] it really is and um you know the only thing is we've had every curve ball thrown at us in this process uh I Do think that um\nAmerica has to figure out a way to deal with our divisions and I think of course I'm a part of sitting on the conservative side as or you might but the I think that the the left has become so radicalized so hate filled and they would justify almost any action to get the ends that they want but I think the stain\nA peace loving a kind of like the Democrats that you're that were grandparents for many of us who are you know I have orange is the Democratic party my family I think those folks have to find\nA way to recapture their party because it's quite ugly when I see the scenes of the Senate hallways over the last couple of days\nI think it's off the ugly and maybe that shouldn't maybe those people don't properly characterize where the Democratic party is but I'm I'm I'm fearful that actually is exactly where the Democratic party is that if that's the case every battle we face going forward is going to get worse until the American people decide that they just want none of that\nWell here's one of the things that I brought a mad and I have a question I I have a personal question I Want to get to you before you guys get to the next year or the next can of wine or whatever you're celebrating with\nBut I Am nervous that this victory happen too quickly too soon because we've got four weeks before the midterms and that's an eternity in political life\nCan we keep this engagement in the conservatives in the G O P to possibly save the house is there enough energy to drive us forward for four more weeks\nYeah I mean really if you think about it we you know the Supreme Court should be so separate from politics that shouldn't have implications on the election but because of what the Democrats did it is the number one issue\nIn the election and I understand you're concerned about keeping the enthusiasm go but we have to think about this if we\nAs a party and were unable to make this happen and now that the filibuster is dead it just it just took Republican votes if we were unable to do this as a party then I Would be worried because I talked to too many people around the country I've traveled a lot of states\nI'm In too many people around the country still the same thing that if the Republican Party kids simply keep his promise the most important have its promises\nThen they just don't want to be a Republican anymore and I kind of share that as well I kinda felt this is a moment where my heart just can't stand for something then I'm not sure I Want to be a part of it so that we have the opposite of that we have people who feel proud of their party they're proud of Mitch McConnell the proud of Lindsey Graham they're proud of Susan Collins\nI'm I sold it to grant a Fox News you know they give him a big huge hugging I've been a real critical of Lindsey Graham but like a lot of these people who hated Donald Trump were never truckers and if come around because they see Donald Trump is actually keeping his promises\nI'm going to do the same for these Republicans who kept their promises they kept their promise\nTo support a constitutional as a Supreme Court justice than we ought to applaud them for it I think actually our movement this coalition a coalition of Republicans and Trump supporters and\nMost of that coalition or conservative I think that there's great promise now more promise than I felt in a very long time\nWe're talking to match slap a I call them a friend you probably know him as the chairman of the American Conservative Union if you've been to see back you recognize him he's also\nAll over TV even brave enough to go on MSNBC\nMatt or if you would have told me three months ago that I Would be doing exactly what you're doing praising Mitch McConnell Lindsey Graham and Susan Collins I would've said you're drunk match lap go home but that's exactly what's happened this is this is a little bit of a miracle ...\nWell let's talk about Mitch McConnell just for a minute here I mean it was Mitch McConnell who deserves the credit for keeping all those centers together and we had the majority in the Senate and when a Merrick Garland was picked for the Supreme Court opening that was Mitch McConnell doing kept those senators together he kept all of them together\nAnd that's why we're where we are\nWho you are a hundred percent correct he just around the credit for that and he and now he deserves great credit for the fact that he has ... you know not done yet\nA tomorrow or will be the second Trump nominee tickets shepherd shepherded through the Senate and under increasingly difficult circumstances and I'm going to make a production I think we're going to have another one next year\nAnd a and if you thought this one was rough just wait till you get the next week is an excellent could be replacing a liberal and a and I think the stakes I think the charges will be even more outlandish and so was the tactics\nWell I I Hope we have some lesson as you called for us to look for some kind of unifying moment and Susan Collins did as well I've been telling everybody go pick a ... millers autobiography and read what Democrats used to be like\nYou know read about a guy who was a blue dog Democrat from the south who had reasonable approach is to a changing minds in different opinions and I think that's kind of the mold that the Democrats have lost complete touch with\nSo I I'm pushing that in the time remaining that just quick question you'll have like five daughters you in mercy have five young young daughters\nWe do we have five daughters that's exactly right\nHow has this last three weeks been at the dinner tables in the ... house\nThat's a really great question because I've had a lot of pretty serious conversations with my two older girls one is a\nSophomore in high school um goes to a high school that's kind of a sister school to Georgetown Prep and\nThey all fuel silver lined by the ah\nBy the treatment of these Catholic institutions I think there's a real unacceptable or talk about Catholics of their institutions which were disgusted about and I've talked to my eighth grader and I talk to them how\nThey have to be careful out there with social media and drinking and of course boys and you know all these little lessons of life which are really important to know but I also ah you know what happens at our dinner table a lot is because they see their parents on TV which they think is really a kind of like the big deal\nBut you know you got to fight and I'll tell you what Brett Kavanaugh taught me this last couple of weeks that I wouldn't have thought ... was this type of person as well as I Know he's pretty he's pretty mild mannered you know he's low key\nBut you know what he did when they went to what the character assassination he fought back he fought back hard and when we talk about the around the dinner table we talk about that because they see their parents being criticized in the end we tell them that we're proud of what we do and they don't have to agree with us politically when they grow up they have to agree with us now by the way life is just mandatory\n[laughter] that would ever believe they want [laughter] but we talk about the need in a democracy\nTo stand up for yourself and to speak your mind and I think for especially young women that's really important lesson\nWell it's important that they know they have that arrow in their quiver\nAnd also that it's not the first era you pull out every time you know and I think ... showed us that he waited until he had to go there and then he fought back I thought that was a very powerful time\nAnd I thought today how did it with Susan Collins match slap I Can't thank you for taking time out of what should be a celebratory dinner night for you and your wife\nAnd I appreciate you for being a friend not only mine but of this show and the the conservatism everywhere\nTanks Mike you're a good man and I have to say that God Bless America I think we have a great future before us\nFrom your lips God keep us going the right way thank you Matt [laughter] we'll see you soon there he goes match lap or if you've never been to sea pac which happens every year\nAnd the spring it's even in a non presidential election year\nIt is worth the trip if you're anywhere near DC and if you have a young person who's looking at politics and interested in politics especially from a conservative point of view it's really important that you get them involved because their training\nThe [noise]\nMost News I'm out of Neal undecided no longer Maine Republican Senator Susan Collins

and we're talking to you guys about today and we're also talking about horrible jingles because I'm trying to get some of the horrible jingles on my head and we've\nBeen reminded us some of the old

what an original list it does as a judge and the fact that it's exactly what the constitution designed was designed for\n... ... ... George or a hundred percent correct and part of this starts not just a with what we talk about between ourselves\nBut Dana Perino who I just think is one of the greatest people ever in media\nGain and she's fair to Dana tweeted out today that it we just don't understand our history and I contend that because we don't teach it we don't teach American history we don't teach the constitution we just finished was it three weeks ago was constitution week\nAnd I guarantee the school's took the money to hand out the pocket constitutions but nobody had a real discussion\nOf the constitution no and I I'm lax myself so that's why I carry one all the time\nAnd I think that if you get judges\nOn the Supreme Court who will follow this operating manual that's been handed to them and not rewrite the laws are reinterpret the laws are I I think we're going to be in a better place and I also think this this whole success of today\nIs only part of what Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell have been able to do with the appointment of more judges that are getting confirmed in a record rate and I think what's happened\nThere not just mad at cabinet now I think the Democrats woke up in the middle of this confirmation and what\nDo you have any idea how many judges Donald Trump is getting appointed we are screwed for decades and that's actually I think part of the anger so that\nYou just you're ... the judicial was always designed to be the weakest of the three branches it was just designed as a referee on the court\n... well on the basketball court right there but there were there were designed to be the referee here's what it says if you have a disagreement about what it says we will re read it for you and tell you what the laws say they weren't they weren't there\nRhino has a huge deal or network great pricing warranty in customer service so they'll do rhino safe dot com today ... safe dot com\nThinking about life insurance what if you could make one free phone call and learn your best price for nearly a dozen highly rated price competitive companies well that's exactly\nWhat happens when you called select quote life\nFor example Georgia's forty he was getting sky high quotes from other companies because he takes meds to control his blood pressure but when I shopped around I found him a ten year five hundred thousand dollar policy for under twenty five dollars a month I'm select what age and dance to be you know and believe me if selected isn't shopping for your life\nInsurance you're probably paying too much\nFor your ... called eight hundred five seven one sixty one Ninety eight hundred five seven one sixty one Ninety eight hundred five seven one sixty one Ninety or go to select quote dot com since Nineteen eighty five we shop you say\nGet full details on the example policy it slowed down ... commercials or ... depending on your health insurance company over factors rambling Austin\nWriter spittle or children in Springfield forms the lives of children and families every day by providing comprehensive pediatric specialty care\nI'm Denise ... director of rehabilitation services Chinatown pediatric specially trained therapist and I wonder when care in the most damage their name and said to the Arctic that men to ensure our young patients safe return to play sports and the activities of daily living in\nA rehab gym with a variety of partial body weight support equipment such as the altered gene anti gravity treadmill\nOur equipment is designed to make therapy fun for patients well building strength endurance art therapist develop a personal exercise program for children ranging in age from\n... therapy as a result\nTama athletic injury and everything in between\nMore comprehensive inpatient outpatient and rehabilitated specialty care for your child in the Gulf War what three seven three five one two three four located on exit six all the math\nBy now a year in rock spotlight Nineteen sixty nine we\nSeeing\n\nIn\nJanuary of sixty nine credence Clearwater revival has a number to hit was proud married the Beatles on line for the last time on the rooftop of apple records in London and after touring as the New York version September sixty eight Jimmy Page renamed the band Led Zeppelin and releases their debut which goes top ten and both of us and you can\n[noise]\n\nIn\nFebruary of sixty nine Detroit Rockers him sci fi released their debut album kick out the gyms on election records Tommy genes in the Sean does have a number one hit with a psychedelic influenced crimson and clover and San Francisco's lined the family soon go to number one with the single everyday people\n[noise] and you're\n\nListening to her radio for more [noise] from Nineteen sixty nine coming up [noise]\nThis is the sound of equalize splashing around and Roy hamburgers on you're cutting board\nIt looks like mom just put it to me", "show_name": "The Buck Sexton Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Newton", "day": "05"}
