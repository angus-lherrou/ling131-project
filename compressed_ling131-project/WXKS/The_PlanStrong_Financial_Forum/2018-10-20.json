[laughter] the silver I think that's a good idea okay [noise] um are you having symptoms of lime\nYes I had them to the line and then I uh well I they put gave me a test and I they called me and I've got early states ...\nWhat's what's the symptom\nUh always feeling like you're you're a you know going to throw up but you don't always a little nauseous always a little busy a feeling slowly all the time but you don't have the flu\nOr get on the west that I'm usually shop at the time\nSo I mean different people experience a wine or or attacked in different areas of the body by line so they get different symptoms that doesn't apply\nTo a head on and they said I've got it\nOkay no I'm not saying that you don't I'm just saying how some people it attacks the heart some people attacks the brains some people attacked the joints so that was that's better\nFeel I have also have joined in all over where I didn't before\nOkay um I don't know feeder and anything else you can think of besides the oregano and the solar ... yeah I mean it just kind of gets down to the individual\nI'm ... I Would probably look at taking the omega three six nine okay okay because that's anti inflammatory but it also helps the nervous system throughout the body All right and so I Would I Would\nIf you can ... if you absolutely can't do unemployment and then you should at least walk in the door and talk to us for a few minutes about it okay we can get a little more precise okay All right thank you\nWrite and uh we just tried to keep her appointments as ... as possible yeah it's only a hundred and thirty nine dollars and I know that some you know but that's for just for the first appointment and sitting down and talking to you for an hour hour and a half\nUm and then follow up appointments after that a sixty nine dollars as long as you come within a year of your last appointments so that we we try to you know keeping low most people can afford it so I understand you know some\nPeople are much more um [noise] a limited budget so ah but that's why we have the radio show and that's why people can can come down to our center and and talk to us as as much as we can make ourselves available\nWe really try we we do a lot of free advice on her ... daily way more than we should wait even more than anybody else does that has a practice I can tell you that you don't you know most doctors don't give you the amount of time free that we do a two hour\nAnd and that's you know we do it because we want people to get well\nUm we could be like everybody else and just you know got to make an appointment that's the only way we're going to give you information um ... you know this is what we tried to do to help the community be as healthy and well that's why I Do a blog and that's free or to get advice and after you know get information that the accurate\nBut you got to understand there are conditions that are complicated and you can't do that you're not doing the right thing with a complicated condition by going here try this try that\nIt's it's it because then it's hit or miss um we don't have all the information that's you know I mean this is why people go to doctors\nIs so that the doctors can get all the information from the test results that down and figure out what is the best course of action because again not for nothing but you go to a medical doctor and I understand the you'll get the co pay and all that stuff but that's you know that's a whole another story\nBut [laughter] but typically all they've you know what to do is prescribe your doctor cycling\nYeah that's what they do what they they don't have anything else why do you need an appointment\nFor that why can't you just go and get tested and then yeah somebody just prescribes you you know doctors cycling why do you need to see a doctor for that that's what they do\nYeah\nI don't know [laughter] but you don't mind going to the doctor and paying for that and every single person's going to get a T cycling yes and again if that doesn't work\nThey give them something else but it's it's not like they sit down and go okay now we got to look at is it attacking the hard as attacking the joints what can we do to support the joints or can we do to support the brain or you know not only let's kill off the line bacteria\nBut what else can we do to help repair and protect those areas that are being attacked by the line\nThey don't do that they just go here but I'll make an appointment with that doctor and get that tiny little bit of advice that they're giving the every single person that comes in with the lime disease\nAnd get you know we do we do exceptionally well treating Lyme oh yeah really well but it is a very very complicated condition I tell patients right off the bat figure on a year a rigorous treatments a year\nAnd and you know there's a lot of people who do get lime and they never have symptoms because they caught it so early yet that the doctor you cycling killed it off there you go and you're all set you're good to go but the people were you start having some symptoms and particularly the longer the symptoms have been going on\nThe tricky here it is to alleviate those symptoms and get the body back on track that's what's involved you know people who get you know they just got tested they got on ... like clean and it's gone they go you don't need to see us\nBut people who have complicated or cancer or autoimmune conditions the does not quick fixes for that you got a cold we can usually do this do that\nUm but when you get into the complicated we need more information and I I'm Sorry I Apologize to people that we can't give you out information but it it's not a good service for you to take a stab in the dark and saying oh just do that\nYeah it's not appropriate and we get ... hey we get all the time people walk into our office regularly and go so what are you got for cancer and a foreign runs like\nReally you just want to walk into a store and ask what we got for cancer and whatever we have Andrew a bottle and you're just going to go home and take that and figure okay I'm treating my cancer now I'm also I Would\nBe really concerned about anybody who did that only smoke if I walked into somewhere and said you know give me something for cancer and they said oh here they're you know\nI Would run and get a question yeah you know how much ... really know who they're going to hand me a bottle that quickly with not knowing anything about me or my cancer or my treatments I because we want to help you but we want to help you the right way yeah that's the deal and part of that is tuning in every Saturday\nEvery Saturday we can we go we're you should be to be promise not to lectures next week [noise] don't make promises [laughter] that's good to speak for yourself go vote you know I promise I Will [laughter]

direction my recommendation would be after you use the liquid would and it just horns the existing\nTeam won a Lebanese get some ... at the bottom of that open grain and even if you just smeared on with your finger if you want to paint it that's fine too that all sealed\nBut I like to use the cruelly cooking just mirrored across the bottom of that and that are really waterproof and seal up that open grain so that's and acrylic a silken ice talking for that\nUh another thing you can do\nIs you can get in there and just cut off the bottom you know six inches or that bottom foot just cut removed that T. one eleven cut another strip\nThat said same distant you're going to have a scene there just nail that back in and take some of the a clear acrylic talking put it at the bottom of the board and also in that scene and then go ahead and paint that a shutout a or staying that shut out whatever you want to\nDo but make sure those seams are I'm certainly sealed and you'll eliminate the problem it's a\nAnd and so there's three ways to go ahead and take care of that problem All right sorry Bob we did have a difficult time hearing you apologize All right let's go from a Bob we'll go to Rick Rick welcome\nHi how are you guys are fine\nThank you for taking my call ... ... I have a\nI have a question I uh my front porch entrance uh we had family over and and now a garbage bag outside\nOnto the car creating a parent lately Greece or whatever so through the bag on the concrete and now there's a big a three foot strained by eight inches [laughter] I was wondering if there's a way to get rid of that\nYeah is that Greece is that what it is great for meat or what is it yeah yeah okay um what have you tried to have you tried like dawn liquid soap or anything along those lines\nI I did not um I was afraid to use anything to push it back in very concrete march out like no\nSo um I got to ... to suggestions one I feel real certain about the other one\nWas some screw up and you might get it done so when I say the dawn I'm a lot depends on how sealed or how um deep that Greece ran into that concrete which is what you heard about two but Don brand the liquid so\nIf you put that on there just you know full strength\nA damp at a scrub brush and just really work at it and work at it and work at it and flush it and then maybe put some more dawn on their lead said\nCome back and really working with a scrub brush you might remove that uh but it's going to take some scrub and um another option\nThere is a product called ACT cleaners\nAre usually recommended on a petroleum based stains like motor oil greasy any freeze that type of thing ACT was actually invented in the oil fields in Oklahoma and this cleans machinery it's actually an enzyme it's a powder\nYou sprinkle it over the grease thing it does work on on Greece from meat so that's why I asked\n'em so somebody had like a ... or a concrete patio and the Greece can on their gas grill spilled um you can take this ACT cleaner sprinkling on there it goes on it's a white powder and you just leave it alone you don't touch it\nAnd it might take three days it might take two weeks but that enzyme will actually eat that Greece\nOut of that concrete\nAnd the white powder will just disappear also and um you know or you can get that only on the Internet and its ACT cleaners dot com\n[noise] um but that's an option not cheap but it's a it's a wonderful product for getting rid of any type of grease

make sure that your garage doors working right so a washing waxing that's a good first step\nI'm making sure that the weather seal uh that's the ceiling the bottom than the concrete isn't good working water it's one piece um that's going to keep the water out the window that sort of thing um and then\nYou know if your door isn't real dire need of help\nIt's okay to replace that we encourage that so yeah I got some good products out there and to me I won't have to clean there you go away I mean [laughter] still get a lot of life in it if it's only Nineteen years old but I'm telling you we've got some new designs that are worth you know\nBefore we get into the designs Justin let's let's seriously talk about the benefits as we head into the winter months\nI had last year I Can't I Can't remember last week besides last winter but I think less where it was kind of chilly we had some pretty cold but I think we got below zero in ... my garage never go below forty degrees below you know they're\nStarting to come in for temperature never got below forty degrees amazing\nIn in ... you think about well you know my garage what do I care about the temperature in the garage well first off when you get in your car you want it to start up right away do you want it to be struggling pipes do you want your pipes to freeze\nYour beer in the ... you know if you're in the garage so that you don't want body ... sorts of things can happen in those are important things not they have a right so now but in all seriousness the ah him a pipes freezing as a real concern and there's a lot of pine earning grudges\nAnd if you're having insulated garage door you're going to have far less likely probability of those\nThose guys ... years ago when I was dating my ... my my my my job\nWas to insulate those pipes and that garage was old wooden door\nAnd pipes run across the ceiling man those things would freeze every year we don't really get those tinker then my job was to fall so now that I was thinking when you're talking now is probably not even a problem if he had a really good insulated ... is it different qualities of ...\nThere are a yeah you can get a a poly Styron insulated or that's the same type of insulation in having those a foam cups guy might use guy and then there's polyurethane orange ... that's the big one yes our intel core garage doors used that polyurethane a phone\nAnd what that does is that gets in all the nooks and crannies and it's\nIt's a higher our values so it's a it's going to keep\nThe cold out the warm in better than anything so yeah that's our and until the court product line and it's gonna be the top of the line when it comes to insulation\nSo we always talk about the beauty adores would ears are but the real bones how effective it is and how warm it keeps your garage which in effect with and keep your house that worm that really plays that's that's a that's a key if somebody is an old steel ... or ... would door\nRight yeah it's not I mean having the ... the base of a quality insulated product is important and then the aesthetics for sure is something that we uh we definitely focusing\nI had a one or you're a big dealers a bill every door on last Saturday and we're talking about yeah we're talking about getting that door ready for winter doors breaking January Man\nYeah you know one thing people don't realize is um springs need to be replaced it's you know cars when they you know the certain things that you need to do every so many miles in a spring replacements one of those things too so in the winter\nAs the mental gets more brittle because it's cold um that's when things like that can wear out and that's that's something I Know a bill Weber and his team to get a job or placing those uh those springs when there's issues there and that's something that you want to watch out\nFor you find a good good door contractor and let them do one silver going into winter\nNo doubt the key is to find a a reputable dealer or a ... there is as good as they come for sure [noise] um but if you're in a different part of the country what you want to do is you want to find someone\nThat is on the you know I'm Better
