so it is up for us and so I'm sure there is salts in masonry products of bricks the mortar between the bricks\nAnd when that becomes compromised and um get sweat a lot that's all becomes compromise those salts begin to bloom and they started out as white shadows and they can actually get to a point where literally looks like table salt on the surface of the brick\nAnd um you know I'm sure what the folks whose sole Jew or isn't a fluorescence remover I I Can't tell you why would not work I can tell you however when you use an F ... remover um it will removed\nYeah fluorescence but that doesn't mean it's not going to come back the other ... there's some deterioration\nTaken place in there's moisture outside and it will continue to be a challenge to keep that off but once you use a cleaner it should be clean for a while so that part I don't understand um you know one of the products I've mentioned for this as\nQuick creek makes a product called ... in rushed remover\nA knee and it requires an application and require some scrubbing rinsing et cetera and then I Would get a brick sealer on there to minimize the amount of water penetration that can get into the breaking get into the border so it\nWill slow the process of that ... blooming\nSo you know that's that's my story ... but I don't know why the other stuff lemon juice isn't strong enough\nOr what but uh if he got rotted she went to a brick company I'm sure they saw ... remover in I I don't know they did why that didn't work unless it right are heated applications did you\nCheck back with them and express why that didn't work or yeah followed all the directions and everything\nGoing to go back to them about labor on the road listening to you know what I call it maybe yeah oh yeah I\nI'm just guessing they sold you a product that that that would work I you know I don't know why wouldn't work but again it's a long term um ... it's a long term problem Mary and that's just kind of really what I wanted to emphasize you clean it off and I would get at a brick sealed\nIts brick healer yes mhm starting to get it off first but you got to get it off hours\nBut okay we can't get by on Oregon um we power washed but then we're told we our wash\nRight power wash it actually exacerbate the problem because you're putting water that you're kind of force in into that brick okay\nSo uh so you know again you can check out that quick create a fluorescence remover ... you know instructions follow him to the letter of the law and then get a good missionary brick sealer on that house and that'll slow down the process\nOkay what what's your name again quote quick Crete have fluorescent scene and rust remover came over and learning and get that\nI'm Home Depot Lowe's some you can get it on line to\nOkay that might be what my God it might be it might be I mean it's good to me it's a good go to product\nOkay I'll Try that\nYep just make it or we read those directions thoroughly\nMake sure we follow the entire process of how it should be done because it it'll work it may require a second application and again I don't really know what the what the uh\nUm you know soldiers but I'm assuming it would be a product of mild acid that would potentially moved that eh fluorescence of followed a correctly or one other thing too is I I talked about a brick and masonry sealer I talk a lot about\nUm a website called masonry defender dot com and they make a again a breather bowl and that's what you need breed the ... case moisture is behind that brick that it can breed that moisture through\nUh the surface
