basically it's a ten or Fifteen minute a project and you turn off the break or by the way\nSo could probably tell you very good very good turnout to break her literally I made sure we put one up and it was it was no more than ten minutes\nAnd I'm the has a nice little diagrams you know how far the screws need to come out and you just slide in\nBlack wearing a black why or why are why our ground to ground screwed\nYour business him absolutely any download the Q and a half which is a very powerful user friendly half you download that and you connect your light using the app to your local route or in the house and that and then after that basically your light than is connected to the cloud and you're ready to go it's a very easy process okay so\nSeriously it is that easy and say I mean it really really is that easy and you got a flood\nLight Sylvia of a ... flood light you can just simply ... yes\nIf you got a flight over your patio or your your garage or your driveway or corner of your house you basically just remove the flight and then you installed a new and we have what's called a quick connect plate\nWhich is a a plate that you mount a first allows you to wire the plate up you're not actually holding the light and you're right it's just a just a disk that you actually wire up\nAnd um I went that's once that's mounted you take up the light and you just snap it into place and you're good to go\n... light the maximus flood light is easier to mail then a flood like you buy the big box slowly it really is because of the quick ... am absolutely have really really is All right now the fun part okay you said you download the app so this\nCamera and light functions on the app on your phone\nRight so you know there's a very user friendly app that you can see all of your cameras on your lights are on your your smartphone with your apple user Android doesn't matter um you know the first thing that happens is even when you're not looking at your phone if someone comes to your door you get a notification that someone's that your door\nSo I'm at work you get older I'm In the ... in fact last night we were having dinner the one fellow that was with us 'cause well somebody's at my door and it was very cool and so it notify makes a sound or listen\nTo the ad sewage whatever the notification you have it vibrates or the noise what however you set it up in your phone and then you can actually click on it and if you click on it then it actually takes you right to that camera alive and you're seeing the person real time and you can actually talk to them real time that you can talk to them have a conversation if you like or you can\nYou can press you can dial nine one one you can actually pressing alarm if there are a burglar I mean you can do is learn that can be press so if you don't know who this\nPerson is and they're not dropping off a package or maybe they're taking a package um you can take action\nAbsolutely yeah on the spot and and no matter what if you if you answer the door or not or if you go to the live feed the the video will be recorded as into the cloud for for downloading viewing later\nSo so if mom and dad say no kids in

of years to sell this coach light with camera or are these prevalent or do you are the only ones that have the ... are usually cameras free standing or\nYeah so there's a there'd be an issue again and as a consumer I think you know you have to decide you know search the mark and see what works for you the best but in terms of the porch light\nA application you know we're really the only ones that carry a porch lights solution\nAnd we offer that the foresight does come and different um different styles and different finishes 'cause we trying to accommodate you know the the likes the design of your house I'm so we don't really have any competitors in that space there there's some knock offs that are trying to mimic what we're doing but really there you know as it relates to porch lights we've you know really know competitors\nThe flight there is another option or two out there um but again I I think we've got the best solution if you compare the the products are in the market with ours I I I Believe\nAnd our customers tell us as all the time they replaced their existing product with ours and how much happier they are with the product\n[noise] what would be the difference is that the quality of the camera\nYeah the quality of the camera detection range him in our detection range is Seventy feet um detection on the camera [noise] it's a hundred and two hundred and Seventy degrees around the camera to detection range definitely I'm I'm you know one of the differences the quality of the camera\nYou know we use you know not to get to technical but because of our application and our software and the from wearing the products we actually use less resources so um we're not as resource hum heavy so our products will work a lot of times when social services week\nOr the wife eye signals not as strong as as you know others products requires so um you know just generally speaking we have a very good customer satisfaction the app is definitely a difference if you compare our app with other\n... yeah I mean we do some nails are so that means is when you're looking at your videos you know you don't have to actually play a bit\nSo to see what's on the video we show you the thumb nails for all the videos and you can sort by camera and sorted by by day and time I'm it's just it's again there's so many uh features and our app that customers really like and we we hear that all you know quite often [noise]\nNow on the coach light with the camera that camera is I mean you talk about the angle when you talk about the distance but its position of ... too yeah so it's\nA it's in a ball basically um both the the flow of light and the coach later the other a poor choice\nWe put the camera in a in a in a ball that can be when you first installed a

talking about the smart security lake by max was how it operates flood lights with cameras coach lights with the cameras to play back mark when we went to a break you said something about adding ten seconds before\nBefore what before you see the right so what happens is the the cameras are always recording in memory or in buffer so when we're when we do have motion a sense and weak in the video

you have a question about this feel free to jump on board again it's eight hundred eight two three eight to five five in Diane welcome\nMhm how can we help me yes\nWell I heard a click cattle and ... with a camera now what happens if somebody perfect like ... or ... is that possible for them to cover it for the Clinton thing\nOh sure I mean if they if they cover the camera that I mean obviously it's going to block so sure of the um the viewing of the camera the you know the good news about the cameras very and conspicuous I mean you don't even really realize there was a camera on the light\nI guess that's also another good thing for that ten second buffer though right yeah you because you gotta walk up you got to get to the cameras they've already got John camera and on video so\nYeah there is also one other small feature we actually have a status light it's a little um indicator light\nThat used to tell you you know different colors blue it means it's on line but if you really want to be you know in talking to you know you can actually turn that light off in the app so that little blue light is not on the person does not see that when they woke up to your door so\nBut very good question though Diane you're thinking\nThere's not a lot that goes off on your phone at how we're actually not a light off the wall fake fake\nKnow you would just get your normal notification greeting at someone's at your door and of course once that happens I mean there is a panic button on your app that does sound an alarm so some some someone does damage to the delight or covers it up you can push the panic button the light flashes and the alarm goes off on the light itself\nI think you're right not All right Diane thank you care so it is smart\nIn order to than what you said a hundred and eighty two three to five five we're talking about smart security lights by maximus lighting fascinating Randy welcome\nI ah I have a question we shoot the runaround what they're saying trigger heart\n... yes I mean the ... you know if if you have the porch lights is the on your front door um I mean it's designed to pick up motion within say ten Fifteen feet your porch area\nBut you can set in the ... you can set the zones that you actually want to be active or hot that would actually trigger the the motion sensor\nI'm so yes it will pick it up the other hand you can do to there's another feature that I didn't mention earlier I mentioned it now is that um if you see the dogs that are in your yard you know look out your window you can see them\nUm England or the app anytime even whether the the motions been triggered or not and you can do just uh you can hit the record button live she couldn't do record on demand\nSo if you're something going on in your yard it's in the field of view of the camera no matter what it is um if you want to start recording you just hit the record button and it started recording that activity\nOr any\nKind of curious because we are very true right now have turned off\nEvery ten minutes though they're turning around the house and go wandering if there's a way to the jets offense to it\nThey're absolutely there's two things one is you can you can control this zones are literally would just show you a grid of the field of view of the camera and you can actually you can highlight the areas in that grid that you want to be a sensitive for to to the actual activate the motion and the camera\nAnd beyond that you can actually turned into a bar you can slide the sensitivity up or down so you I call it tuning so when she saw the product you can kinda tune you know which alert you want to get the ones that matter and that again we've we've built all that features into the product in the up very cool and\nThen see that's man you gotta think everything don't you I'm fascinated by by\nThe questions again it's eight hundred eight to three to five five Sheila welcome\nHello yes\nI was wondering like how do you have an a generator that are run by law or any solar panels or any how roof tiles or anything like that\nWell they're selling the security lighting but that's something you could add to your home but these things are are they go ahead I'll be quiet [laughter] okay so let me well I don't\nI mean I don't think the chair\nOkay well ... actually today marks\nReady to go with your ... question he he may I think he's got an answer\nYes so one one feature we do have um that's important is that we ... we do send the alert to your smartphone when your cameras on line or off line\nSo if the power goes out on your home no matter where you are there'll be a mess he just sent to your phone and says that the the cameras off line\nSo at least you know that it's off line for some reason which is usually it's a huge or either the wife dies out okay or the power's out we don't offer um any type of supplemental power this time we get that question it's something that we're learning that\nUm interests so we don't we just pointed does need power to to operate interests that\nHe had all kinds of issues there [laughter] that's wonderful though All right um I just had a thought and just that just ran out of my brain so we'll go to Tom", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The PlanStrong Financial Forum", "city": "Newton", "day": "13"}
