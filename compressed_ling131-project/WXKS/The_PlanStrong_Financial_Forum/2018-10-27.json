let's get to ah Jerry Jerry welcome\nThank you for your program thank you sir I'm\nGary I'm redecorating our home we're moving from all paper too painted walls I've had excellent success and prepping and painting paper wallpaper ... have a large master bad ... bathroom with vinyl wallpaper and experiments or suggestions\nFor voting taken that down in painting over vinyl wall I\nWell you can paint over everything I say it all the time ... you really can a buddy has um you know it has drawbacks um is so\nYou always want to take paper off and you know if you can't ... and there isn't much other choices yeah you you can certainly pain over but if you were if you are definitely going to do it preparation becomes the king\nLike everything else they're your answer really scribbled down make sure you get all the residue of surface\nHopefully the seams are intact ... mood the net thing is so tight you can't get it off and then you would use just a good you know latex or curly bonding primer\nOr to the paper a and then you would come back in uh in pain on top of the primary ... use of paint with a primer so you kind of double priming yeah um but what happens sometimes and just you know just so you know um sometimes additional weight was actually in the in the moisture actually help remove paper\nI'm less so with vinyl of vinyl is more of a slick material so the challenge here is to making sure that it doesn't feel from the vinyl\nAnd doing the bonding primer and then the pain with a primer\nWill usually take care of that [noise] so\nDid you did either how'd you how'd you do on the ah how'd you do on painting the paper paper\nOh absolute a mid ... trip [noise] uh I I run or two after there's a lot of work because the walls Ron prep for probably thought to stay there and it was well done uh probably we pay but I I used a dry wall mud on the same\nHand it to make sure it was it was ... and ... and everything was tied put a kill Cote ...\nAnd then primer and then put a to coat so a primer paint eggshell\nFinish it and get a single Bob now and it was absolutely thrilled with that and they had been remodeling divine on a big kitchen ... took a lot of prepping almost says they prepping a new wall and thank God track and I bought in that big master bad that'd be great\nCampaigner is by paper always paid a lot better than the vinyl um I mean there's paper on drywall right so so it always paints a better than the vinyl the vinyl sometimes has a little bit of a texture to it yes uh the drywall compound is less likely to stick to it\nSo there's a little bit more challenges with that but if you get really good tight seems and you wash it real good and it doesn't have a texture to it and you put a primer on you probably do All right I just hate to ever guarantee it because you never know you know it's that one a variable\nThat's right well thanks for taking my call and we enjoy your show\nThank you Jerry good luck to you that care about my married

be used over no debt situation of paper I'm In it it's a it's a very very good primer\nMy theory and see if you agree with the deer my theory is if you can stay in the category of the paint your used

we'd go thirty three minutes after the top but they are kind of want to update you with the conversation\nI had with Gail just to let you know what we're doing with the airport we spoke off the air one of the things that I'm a originally when she was talking that maybe there was something wrong with the pain and I said well jeez you know there's usually\nI'm I don't know how more than anything could be attributed to the pain itself\nAnd she contacted the representative and who was determined to that point when it wasn't drawing as they may have used the wrong color and\nIn the solid color stain which was which makes sense that it wouldn't dry color and for the most part and I'm Talking about generic color and the Jews them ... or done never drank features which would extend the drank time which could allow for other sports to get\nIn tangled in the sticky pain which could cause the growth now\nShe's talking about using all kinds of clear she talked about a thirty second cleaner which is a good cleaner I'm so that didn't work at all um use the wedding forget and that was about five weeks ago so sometimes a wedding forget to include the temperatures extends the\nActive time so I don't think that was really given enough time to really work\nOr wherever we kinda left at is pursuing it through the bank company but in the meantime getting just a good grade of oxygen they bleach work on a smaller and scrub it see we can remove it from there because at this point when we have issues with\nThings around our house we don't know what that is when she was first talking one of the things and I didn't even address this with her um and it didn't sound like it would be this but uh it it could be in some other cases\nUm when you have mulch and maybe this happened to you a hardwood mulch\nSpecially inexpensive hardwood mulch spread around your home there is um [noise] a byproduct to that I guess I guess that's where you would say it is a cold artillery fungus or shotgun from

razor blade all of the glass or something to leave a little yellow stain\n[noise] no I don't think that's what her as she was I'm not really sure exactly what that issue was because we don't know what's on it we don't know what that stain or you know what's on it at all so\nWe've had a couple of mysteries today and sometimes you just got to dig deeper deeper deeper I left with her like she needs to work it through the pain company in the store for the wrong ... was used that could have implications on many things on the outside of the house outside of just not drawing proper way [noise] alright\nEight hundred and eighty two three eight to five five that's our phone number you can grab aligned happened to take your calls as we march through another weekend Sheila welcome\nHey Sheila hello yes I live really meeting we play my neighbor just at his\nHouse was what what are they had metal valleys on the new law that his thing took them first layer\nOr shallow and put on and one down reward and then some kind of I don't know I think of something and then he'll put that new I ... everything that black tiles and\nHe told them they don't use the metal valleys anymore and cause problems\nNot as good I I never heard that before so I came here well it's called a California\nWe have and uh your roofers wrong they do use metal valleys they still use metal valleys of galvanized in pain them they use copper valleys in in my opinion I think those valleys are actually better\nUm versus the California we've uh California we've is used by a lot of roofers\nBut um you know my opinion is I kind of like the metal valleys that doesn't mean you have to have him that's just my opinion\nI'm not I'm not in that room full but before I went to look for I guess I Want to know hey we only have one layer of tire out here for ... take shingles I made her take off all the shingles it don't cut the shingle on top of an old one because they make them do\n[noise] um you can put a second layer of shingles on top of an existing layer of shingles and it'll save you a little bit of money\nUm I kind of go back to the thing is I probably wouldn't do that um\nFirst of all a lot of roof worn teaser avoided if you go over in existing layer of shingles okay I'm also I'm\nA yeah it's always good to check what's going on underneath those shingles in case she had some water damage or something maybe some would needs to be replaced that doesn't give you a smooth the look and you're saving a little money but it's ... it's a little money it's not ...\nHow have hit by telling them about taking the original shingle off and putting stuff on the mall was correct yes an alley I'm going to talk to the people I hear\n'em before I stopped anybody I wanted to talk to you and make sure that I got um\nYeah and you and you bring up a really good point to Sheila because I'm I'm you know some refers to the California weave in and swear by it okay but you know I'm saying I like the middle valleys in the reason having these conversations is\nIt's all about the quality of the roof or you know that other roof or he was good to he was saying Gees I wouldn't put it over the old layer I really recommend stripping absolutely\nBut I always say there's people ask me all the time what's the best shingle I said don't don't worry about single worry about the roof or get the best route for you Ken\nOkay now the next question what is the ... inch of the ... valley ... over the California\nI'm not really sure I can tell you what the advantages it's more long lasting it's more it's less I'm more susceptible to being intact if there was a lot of wind\nOkay that that I was ... for a lot also depends on the slope of the roof to got it from yeah then I Would like the mental valley", "year":
