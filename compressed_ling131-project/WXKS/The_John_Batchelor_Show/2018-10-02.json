Raj who was really sort of cut from the same clauses father\nDoes every indication that he is still kind of man to this day now why is that important to John well Sir Roger ... is the number two in the ... he is the warlord show gone um it's all about and its military operations in Afghanistan and that and he is an al ... which should tell you something about\nThe Taliban relationship with a guy to and the economy as a sort of key role in connecting all these characters together\nCharlie Wilson Charlie Wilson has a movie played by Tom Hanks so that certainly makes him a significant member of Congress however Charlie Wilson's part with the ... network is is right in front of us were looking at it all the time and you note so\nHow does Charlie Wilson how does the CIA how does the way we fought the Soviets uh continue today right in front of us\nWell you know of course if you go back to Charlie Wilson's war the movie or the book the book is is very good at laying out the relationship between Charlie Wilson and do all of the county\nI'm Charlie Wilson this congressman from Texas who pull all these lovers to make this sort of a job in Afghanistan work he was very much I'm Fonda jaw in an economy to the point where he actually called the county goodness personified is the way you referred to him\nNow of course the title of my piece is bad and it's personified because\nIt turns out that economy was the exact opposite of what Charlie Wilson thought he was um in the county so cutting out a very close relationship with Wilson Wilson even visited um Afghanistan and Pakistan\nUnder the protection of the counties and at one point is a very um in his book by Milt Bearden Bearden and James rising called the main enemy which recounts sort of a CIA war against the Soviets\n... one of the anecdotes in that book um is about how ... and his men took old tires and chains and they were raking in across the dirt road trying to kick up dust clouds they were trying to attract the attention of a Soviet fighter or helicopter why they because they Charlie Wilson wanted a shoe one down himself with a stinger missile\nAnd so the shows you how closely um economy was working with walls in and how close relationship between those two they basically this US Congressman was in bed with this legendary and now notorious\nMujahedeen commander who incubate it all ... and it shows you sort of the unintended consequences of what came out of a war against the Soviets in Afghanistan\nIt occurs to me a bill listening to your story I've just done a new history one volume history of Vietnam\nHow the U.S created the same monster in Vietnam that we've created in Pakistan\nOr the intentions that first year to fight the Soviets or to fight the Cold War but what what becomes of our of our clients is the enemy itself and we failed to solve this and so we go through the same cycle again and again what we did with\nAh the see I'm brothers in the Nineteen fifties and Nineteen sixties until John Kennedy approved the assassin hum the removal of the GM brothers\nYou can see with the hub county network we we ... we ... we ... we we we advertised it so that the Pakistani ISI was not wrong headed in thinking that it was it had our blessing\nYeah you know I basically I look at the story of John economy they stay in the piece\nAs a warning I think it should be with one of those lessons that still people have not really learned from all this in fact we've sort of went through a replay of this where you've had especially post Arab Spring the procedure uprisings you've had a number of calls in Washington elsewhere it to get behind Sunni extremist or ...\nSome of which are either linked to al ... are kind of groups um because they want to work with them in Syria or they want to work with them in different countries you know some of some people have actually meet outright claims\nWe should work with these types of groups around the world and I think that is sort of sorely mistaken for a lot of reasons I don't think it makes sense for the United states ever to get in bed with extremists of any sort to be honest with you people try and make these ... billion calculations and say well we'll work with this one extremist group now and then we'll sort of\nSold them down the river later but that's not ... you know Nicola Machiavelli wasn't a moron you know he wouldn't work with you know people who basically wanted to kill him\nAnd think that that was going to be right at the end of the day and essentially that's what a lot of the foreign policy establishment in Washington has has called for in Syria and elsewhere is the get behind sort of the modern age loan and economies\nAnd it doesn't really make any sense when you look at the story of what how this unfolded in Afghanistan pacts and the fact that we're still\nLiving with the consequences of the two day we're still living with the consequences of what a county and his men have done here to this day it really is I think a cautionary tale\nBill a very good evening to we'd go immediately to Somalia which is another twentieth century story where the U.S invested treasure and blood and these many decades later in Somalia is a sale date\nYou've reported on the U.S taking action against the al Shabaab in Somalia so vast landscape and most of the action seems to be in the south or why are we launching airstrikes what is our mission in Somalia given that it it it's a completely failed state\nGood evening John yes so the U.S is trying to counter Shabaab which is al ... branch in each East Africa it's official branch\nAnd you know you are correct in most of\nThe airstrikes and and operations are in southern and central Somalia but we've seen in the strikes span almost the entire length\nOf the country there's also been a couple of attacks last year against the Islamic State's Nason branch in Somalia as well so last year there was a total of uh thirty four strikes thirty one of them against Shabaab\nAnd another free against the Islamic state this year there's been twenty three strikes that keep hitting Shabaab window when Somali forces or or the when U.S forces are partnering with Somali forces are African Union forces and operations particularly in the south of most of these operations are inside out or Mogadishu area where it's south of it\nUm show in the state department issued a country it's got to report on terrorism and it said that Somalia remains quote as terrorists safe haven and quote\nThe year before they similar language was used about ... about the strikes against Shabaab have increased but obviously it's not enough because\nYou know a total of sixty plus strikes over the last two years or just about sixty strikes in the last two years has not done enough to roll back the Shabaab partnering with yeah with the Somali forces without the African Union forces which are slowly withdrawing and that the size of the African Union contingent there continues to decrease\nEnsure Bob ... a terrorist haven and\nThat is you know the the problem here trying to go with you know partnering with the smiling national army partnering with African Union forces\nThey just don't have the the staying power they don't have the esprit de corps that Shabaab possesses and that's why I ... I maintain a persistent insurgency in the country now people will say well it's just a local insurgency it's not something the U.S should care about\nExcept they're having lots of ... there's been fighters that have gone to Somalia and then go on to other theaters and back\nAs far flung as Afghanistan I'm fighting in Nigeria and other places so it\nIs part of this is a it's a it's a theater and the war against archery\nWill speak more on Somalia when we come back bill because the Shabaab is targeting not just American allies are not just Americans but also our allies in Mogadishu the capital this is Black Hawk down for everybody who wants to relate to this from Hollywood\nThis is the episode that introduced us and its military into the cuts throats of al ... it happened a long time ago but his right in front of his bill road show\nTom Johnston foundation for the defense of democracy you want to know who we're fighting today need to look to the past I'm John bachelor\nThis corporate ... runs you buy energy fuels incorporated\nAmerica's largest producer of uranium and been ATM\nUranium for nuclear energy is a crucial component of us national security the crooked ministry ... launched an investigation into America's increasing dependence on uranium imports energy fuels could benefit if the president to support this strategic domestic industry\nAs energy fuels has the ability to increase its production to meet potential brewing demand energy fuses also will position to benefit from the growth potential ...\nA strategic mineral used in steel aerospace and batteries\nGet to know the energy fuels story this corporate ... minute has been brought you buy energy fuels incorporated breeding symbol you you you you Web address energy fuels\nScott calm energy fuels dot\nTo proceed to make a tape for looking savings when you may not be realized\nThe Russians have hacked our elections are infrastructure our government secrets but the United states has master hackers to the best one is the CIA cyber race to defies all notions of what a deadly spy looks like in by former intelligence agent Eric Anderson page turning new thriller\nMore to\nSixty seven buffalo Springfield releases your debut album she's single for what it's worth in April sixty seven give me some living by the Spencer Davis ... the number seven us by Seventy year old he would end in may Elvis Presley marriages Twenty one year old girlfriend Priscilla in Las Vegas\nMay Mitch Ryder hits number four would double with a blue dress good golly miss Molly\nAnd the Jimi Hendrix experience will lead their debut in the u._k. in July they tore the U.S at the opening act with the monkeys is with us [noise]\nListening to my heart radio from from Nineteen sixty seven coming up\nWhen dad needed help getting around\nI begins giants any daughter would do the same\n... ... ... if he needed help dealing with things and they listen to me to be his personal shopper and financial manager to swing newly dad moved in with me so I became his his personal assistant physical therapist and even\nWhen we got to be taken care of the ...\nI didn't realize all the rooms and I'd have to play\n...

S. M. C. A. U.S Mexico Canada announced today in the rose garden the new NAFTA\nA involves agribusiness pharmaceuticals automobiles that does not involve steel and aluminum those terrorists are to be negotiated separately certainly daring in other words and there's an updating two of the old NAFTA including a financial services and cyber\nAllen this deal wasn't happening friday night and there was rationalization and then it's an out are you surprised and what more do you want\nThis is really pretty typical for for trade deals John having them come to a to some conclusion that the eleventh hour and\nEven after work does it say it's it's it's really like a high stakes poker game and at some point one side or the other decides that it can't afford to do with no deal at all and in this case Canada clearly blinked\nAnd diplomatically speaking that's clearly a triumph for President Trump but I worry that when it comes to the manufacturing heart\nOf this new NAFTA it's going to be just as ineffective as the oath after at providing incentives for bringing manufacturing production in jobs back to the United states and that was supposed to be job one for President Trump when it comes to when it when it comes to overhaul in trade policy garden\nOh Alan always see the darkness in the situation I'm an old him the high standards yeah okay let me show you the light regardless of what one thinks about a two point oh or one point five or whatever you call it\nWhat's important here is that disagreement really I'm under cuts the momentum for a candidate China free trade agreement\nAnd that I think would have been really bad for the United states in the long term because this is not of course just the trade deal this is also an issue of American security because by the way we do have a fairly long border with the Canadians um so it seems to me\nThat really there were bigger stakes here and also as the United states gets these deals with Mexico Canada the EU we're now starting to present what looks like a United front to Beijing and of all of these countries and I know a lot of them are not good traders\nBut of all these countries that Chinese or the worst and they're the ones that pose the biggest challenge the U.S so I think that what the Trump Administration did here was perfect because what if it was it put the U.S in front of a big coalition facing China ... what do you think\nI think we're a long way from that big coalition because I really don't see anything in this new version of NAFTA that would prevent if not a formal new Canadian Chinese trade agreement to further deepening\nOf Chinese of Chinese Canadian trade ties and I couldn't help but notice in a lot of the press coverage that we got this morning and it could very well been just sour grapes ... but maybe not\nThat many Canadians observers were saying that they felt that they got such rough treatment at the hands of President Trump that they learned their lesson and they would never again or they would do their very best to make sure that the country never again\nRely so heavily on a foreign trade partner to absorb so much of their exports\nOh I think the British taking over a French Quebec made that necessary come out Allen well no it's ... location\nWe after a member candidate exports a lot of agricultural products with a lot of raw materials\nAlright alright likely with it with us\nKind of I just never again that is never again never again\nYes the longest peaceful border in the world ... fatty you see Canada right now from yeah you can literally again right and it literally can and I I'm not seeing him holding pitchforks and torches yet over this agreement\nBut Allen can you can you tell us what some of the some of the changes with Mexico we're ... we know about Canada and you've explained a lot of and what about with Mexico sure\nThe the most important changes have to do with the automotive trade and of course automotive trade has been at the heart of North American traded diplomacy a certainly since the previous NAFTA began to be negotiated seriously by George H W. Bush\nAnd the big problem I see is that it's going to be just as easy\nUnder this new version of NAFTA for non North American automobile producers to supply North America by exporting to it rather than rather than by investing in it\nAs it as it was under the old NAFTA and the result of that old NAFTA was exactly what President Trump complained about the United states lost\nMillions of highways manufacturing jobs many of them automotive and clearly last global competitive and clearly last global competitiveness in that critical industry\nTo a garden and how to Beijing see this deal\nI I think that Beijing she's still as a real issue because they hope to use Canada is wage um and and actually to pry Canada away from the United states\nIt's a little bit more difficult now than it was a twenty four hours ago and that's a very good thing for us because it really means that we are going to keep a strong trade junior or a customs area you know Mexico Canada the United states\nYou know I can understand Allen's hum points but nonetheless when you start to look at the bigger geo political issues um China must be frightened right\nNow thirty second is Allen I spoke with Scotland earlier today and the u._k. ...

districts\nSo I think David's right we need to see where the dust has gone to settle in terms of the house races or it's not going to be a great years we've always disgusted some mid term for first term president but if it's just a question of whether or not it's going to be horrible or whether or not they can cut their losses and actually do a respectable job\nThat last month to remind everybody Foley was represented to Florida I Believe and he had concealed his bad acting towards house pages that was revealed and he resigned did name right before the election something like that\nHe was gone but it it it would be at the end it was covering up the bad behavior by the speaker's office and others are saying and so when that became a scandal and rightly so many of us were outraged but we also knew this so would the voters\nAnd we knew that it was going to be you know here's it's indefensible what's the leadership did in that instance and so you just went in there knowing that it was going to be far worse than you had originally probably thought even more so than men would then when that came out\nThough do you have a question for David size\nDavid in terms of the Senate we you talked about how this can kind of in ... building enthusiasm in a lot of those red states with a democratic incumbents are we seeing any type of enthusiasm gap change in the house races\nWell look the initial read on the past few days is that the Republican enthusiasm is up across the board but the issue is that the hardest and shift and the atmospherics and\nHouse races versus Senate races in most in the house races are already in trouble because the voters there\nAre the gun it especially female voters\nHave gone to make a decision that they want to put a check on Trump and you're not dealing with the same kind of\nA heart is in conservative reporters and Republican as you may be dealing with an Indiana or a West Virginia\nOr or North Dakota and so it's just a different in\nIn what kind of voter you're dealing with an and one thing that if I wanted to add on to that one of the things that reminds me of oh six is that in a lot of these districts I think you're not necessarily finding unhappiness with the Republican incumbent but just the desire that you have no other choice\nIf you want to put a check on Trump to\nVote for the Democrat and that some of the things that I've seen and it's what we saw no sex where people would would say in the verbatim to the polling and would say out loud\nI Know you know Congress and so and so he does a great job he's doing a great job for years but I just had enough of Bush and then there's nothing else I can do that's too bad he's gotta suffer for it but that's just the way it goes\nWe are joined by John Fund at the national Review Online and it's fun we have been commenting ... lived through oh sex when the Republicans lost the majority in the house of representatives and ... he became speaker and two thousand and seven comparing it to the conditions today with a month to go how do you measure which are\nThe problem is many many areas where the district or actually competitive\nThe problem is Republican low voter turnout and that's why the Kavanaugh situation is so critical it could end up boosting democratic turnout dramatically but also end up losing Republican turnout dramatically\nWhat we do see though is of course Democrats are revved up about this election or they were abducted the places where it counts because if you if you're in a democratic district and you have Donald Trump and your vote democratic it doesn't change anything\nSo that's why the cabinet or race is I Love become part of a campaign we're going to be we're going to be voting in large part of the emotions and the issues stirred up by Kavanaugh which is completely unexpected develop\nA fat each have a question for John\nLooks the same time he kind of touched on the steam it earlier John about are we seeing the Republican enthusiasm applied both in the Senate which they even talked about are we seeing it as well in the house districts at the house has to win because as David pointed out their different constellations ...\nSuburban or urban and the districts were for Mrs Clinton and yet have a Republican nominee I Believe they're fifty or fifty five of them John and those are well educated and well money of voters\nWould I Do know is a lot of stabs Republicans view Brett Kavanaugh as one of their own kind of ... married to a crowded Republican and a lot of them view the Democratic tactics is just appalling and if that can be combined with the Trump\nVote then in some of these out just strict you might be able to drag a few of the house Republican incumbents along over the line and when\nA debt Republicans they're still going to have a bad election year but I think Kavanaugh because if the Democrats are ... seemed to have overstep the boundaries of decency and politics this they could mitigate some of those lock it released suburban sees\nGave a juicy overconfidence with the Democrats the Republicans have that as a as a constant tell when they're approaching election overconfidence how about the Democrats\nWell I think that for no liberal groups on activists that are focused on feeding Kavanaugh any way they can\nI think that there may be a bit of over confident that there's no way this can cut against them I mean they they believe in this as a matter of policy\nAnd philosophy so I don't know that they're that concerned about the politics of it but I I don't think they imagine that it could cut against them I Know that democratic strategists that are in charge\nOf healthy to win campaigns are worried about it I've talked to them about it and is there not worried yet that it's gone or off the rails but they're worried that it could go off the rails I think and I and I know from talking to them many of them\nAnd I pulled them and I've talked to a few of them can extrapolate here that many of them would have preferred a quiet Kavanaugh confirmation if they had been up to them so that they could just move on to what is it working for them which is the focus on Trump and everything Trump talked about uh every single ...\nYou've mentioned to me David just quickly here that some very smart democratic or fear is an empty seat on election day\nYeah yeah some of them here and have you seen a lecture maybe all of a sudden they can be a repeat of ... of twenty sixteen potentially and it's like you need to show up so that Republicans are in charge of of confirming this seat because the Democrats\nAt this point have been pretty open with the fact that they will walk that they will keep the seat open the same way Republicans kept open the guy turned out to be the Gorsuch seat and twenty sixteen and they they don't want that to be something that they have to fight over that they want to be about Trump\nDavid ...

S. M. C. A. [noise] it is a product that must be approved by the United States Congress so therefore it is not right now in place but it's perspective\nIs to replace NAFTA\nVery ... other Mercator center joys to comment on what we know so far of the ... of the the new deal that replaces after NAFTA\nVery ... very good evening you first my thinking here when I heard it late last night is this is brinksmanship you have been very cautious\nAbout the negotiations for some time you've been extremely unhappy with the tariff threats by the Trump Administration from what we know now about the new pack the U.S MCA\nJustice satisfy your concerns about terrorists in the U.S economy and jobs good evening to\nJohn I'm yes and no I'm so glad we have a deal I mean I'm so glad it's lifting the uncertainty\nThat investors um had weighing over them that was holding back on their investment in the U.S\n[noise] and so it's it's a really good thing we have a deal and it's a very good I think we have a Mexico us Canadian deal that was important so this this is a big relief I mean on the terrorists side I mean let's face it I mean we haven't made that much progress\nBecause it was already pretty great deal that we had a with the exception really of Canadian dairy and all us exports we're going to connect Canada and um\n[noise] and Mexico duty free which is pretty remarkable um shall we say the little progress on the Canadian under leftover a Canadian I get a imports but unfortunately the metal terrorists are still up and retaliate tore tart tear it from\nCanada and Mexico are still up let's say yes and and no and then they'll just say the auto part which is from the center of this deal is you know not great but it's nothing like it could have been a in terms of things that I'm\nAll right I Want to speak to those two aspects first medals or the I'm following the wall Street Journal reporting here us negotiators have insisted than any changed us duties on steel and aluminum that took effect in June be addressed separately from a broader trader deal among the country's commerce secretary Wilbur Ross\nSaid recently an agreement to revise the north American trade pact with allowed negotiators turn their focus to resolving the steel aluminum standoff so therefore steel and aluminum is the obstacle ahead of us does this give the momentum to resolve that or have\nHave objections raised in these last week's may mean that steel and aluminum is impossible\n[noise] I don't know I Know I mean I've seen headlines suggest that the Canadians we're going to tackle the metal ... um after the closing bell\nSo maybe there'll be more on this front to say tomorrow morning I think that an agreement between the U.S Canada and Mexico is honestly opening the door slightly bigger to um to allow\nA resolution auntie I'm On the medal terrorists it's also worth noting that the deal\nI you know as imperfect as it is um\nAnd then some improvement and let's let's be honest about this um has um I was also a providing a protection for Canada and Mexico against the upcoming threat of auto tariffs\nWhich would be quite devastating to to\nThe trade between Canada and Mexico and the U.S so\nI think I think we're making progress we're not there yet but we'll see\nLet's go to the cars are the manufactured um vehicles part of this as I understand it in and the details were not rich but that there's an agreement here\nTo manufacture large parts of the automobiles in Canada and the U.S where the wages are high and not in Mexico where the wages are not high you that well and also\nYeah that's and also by the way for like try to block or created this it's not that she used part from um countries where wages are lower than in Mexico um that's not a good thing that increases the cost\nI I understand I understand so is this something that did not exist in NAFTA there's a portion of a you know so you have your standard Toyota did we divvy it up in this fashion in the old NAFTA or did the old enough to let you make your car where it was cheapest\nWell so um they was a requirement a source requirements for your part and it was sixty percent I'd have to be sourced and the three region and now it is moving to Seventy five percent\nSo um it's not as if there was in terms of ... that was non there was nothing however there was no a labor requirement that I Know of especially that are so high and putting Mexico such a disadvantage [noise] um so but as\nFar as I Know there was none of that we really exporting are bad are bad labor laws and and it's even more shocking to be honest that\nIf the Democrats were trying to force these type of labor laws a minimum wage increases on American businesses the Republicans would be furious and rightfully so because they would understand how much distortion that create in the labor market\nThe expectation is that this has to go through Congress next year and the the reasonable assumption is that at least part of the Congress will be democratic\nAnd so the labor part of the negotiation looks to be a compromise with ... which is that that they can use in Congress so let's move to another part which is the dairy dairy farmers reports the wall Street Journal got what they asked for in a new version\nSo the ice cream and milk tariffs that we're holding everything up turned out to not be profound I guess that's not a big number but it does make a comeback copy\nYes but um it's also let's face it right well it will benefit this moving towards closer to zero I'm On a on dairy tariffs\nOn it's a it's really good for 'em for Canadian consumers I mean these are the\nI I've puzzled though that our media colleagues did not seem as excited and their questions of the president could even do more [laughter]\nYour name John ... is an understatement as the president made this announcement in the rose garden it good for him for doing it in a location because it to grow Joe Biden\nIn a different context there was a big bleeping deal just with the promises made by candidate Donald Trump\nEverybody mock Kim they said you cannot renegotiate trade deals whether it's with the e whether it's with China whether it's got that NAFTA agreement you simply can't do it\nPresident Obama mock Smith is a proposal saying it it it's it's all gone now globalism is here to stay that says the new normal you cannot bring manufacturing jobs back\nTo the u._s. what do you have a magic wand well it turns out that President Trump does not have a magic wand but he does have perturbed negotiating skills and first chief struck a deal with the Mexican government and then they put the screws to the Canadian government\nJustin Trudeau the prime minister young dashing a hip\nCool by his poll numbers are not very good and he realized that candidate was going to be left out in the cold unless they got to the table and negotiate it with the president ministry should they came to the table they hammered out this deal and the president ought to be extremely proud\nOf actually getting a replacement in place for NAFTA which put American workers and American taxpayers at a ferry I Can't disadvantage for the last what thirty or so years he was able to turn that ship around when\nEverybody else that it couldn't be done\nWe are finished the third quarter we'll get the first estimate of the third quarter growth right before the election the expectation is for it to be four point to which was the second quarter or better\nI spoke with Europe in these last hours Monica we are the envy of the world the European Union is growing it like point for while we're growing it four point pluck\nSo the NAFTA deal will only the new NAFTA which has us MCA lonely and richest the more I'm not waiting for the president get credit because this is Supreme Court week\nI have an announcement will get credit after the Supreme Court week will have an announcement from Mitch McConnell on the floor of the Senate today I read the majority leader's remarks\nThat he believes that this is a mayor on the good name and family\nA Brett Kavanaugh he says his good name and his family have been dragged through the mud with a campaign of character assassination based on an allegation that lack any corroboration McConnell goes on to say the ... an obstruction has come to a close\nWill be voting this week\nIt look like the Republicans have although slow to this Monica have got themselves organized is the party paying attention\nFinally John yes and in fact I have a column coming tomorrow morning at the hill which has also pushed on my Facebook and my Twitter account that talks about not only the Democratic cats shots nation a machine gun tactics\nThat they've used on Kavanaugh\nWhich they also used on Clarence Thomas which they also used on Robert Bork et cetera but\nThey're they're a full hypocrisy\nAnd the ... think tank to Modi which they have used out this process to try to take a Kavanaugh out at the Supreme Court nominee\nAnd I you know it comes to mind when when you hear them\nA speak from their their ivory tower purchases on the Senate Judiciary committee about school drinking on the part of cabin or college drinking on the part of having the gusting John\nAnd I actually a recount this scene from Nineteen eighty five of US Senator from Massachusetts who sixteen years\nEarlier got drunk and actually killed a woman sixteen years later he I'm One of his fellow democratic Senator Chris Dodd a waitress on their table and sexually assaulted her I'm speaking of course if Ted Kennedy\nThe late Kennedy who was lying by the left as a progressive icon and granted a state funeral when he died but folks are sitting in judgment of Brett Kavanaugh for having a couple of\nYears in high school and college you know these people really take the cake John the American people see through it that's why the polling it's starting to move against them particularly those very vulnerable red state Democrats\nYes I Want to know if the ... of the Republicans are waking up Monica because I Would wake up for the news we lead with which was the U.S MCA than new NAFTA deal\nAnd the four percent plus economy that means people are working that means families are stable that means the growth of the United states is restored that's what I wakes me up but apparently that is enough for the Republican Party\nOr so the question is is the cabinet character assassination enough for the party to get to the polls or not\n[noise] yes now from what I'm saying you know Democrats had it and as soon as he hasn't been the energy gap\nHeading into this whole process right we kept hearing about the right way to come out and said their frustration about\nEurope and the whole truck era but now we're seeing polling comfort coming from Ross my son and some other places that now the CIO pi has clues that gap that Republican voters and independents are in just by what they're seeing here and that is transparent political ... job of a very good bad\nThey're outraged by it and now that the one problem that Republicans had was a sense of complacency well now I think the Democrats themselves into it because that complacency problem seems to be gone\nDianne Feinstein this is this is a challenge Monica because she's acting extremely aggressively without explanation making claims making allegations\nAnd also can feeling or let's put it this way maintaining silence and the questions about how she handled the original allegations from Ford how the letter was handled\nDianne Feinstein I chose to my surprise Monica is now the the the person most\nIn charge of this character assassination in the Democratic party Chuck Schumer seems to fit it into the woodwork business Feinstein's work are you surprised [noise]\nNo well look her evolution has been happening over a number of years she used to be she came out of San Francisco of course but she used to be a relatively moderate Senate intelligence committee he used to be somewhat of a voice of\nFreezing at a party that was getting increasingly more radical uh\nBecause the party has gotten more radical she had\nA primary challenge the state a Democratic Party in California did not back her so thin move against Kavanaugh makes total sense if you put Dianne Feinstein at the age of what is she eighty five\nShe says she is because the eighties right she asked me if\nI if you take her and put her in the context of her party and it's the lyrical environment it actually does make sense but what a way for Dianne Feinstein to get a complete her political tenure\nHearts are assessing a special edition of Monica Crowley we'll speak with Monica later in the week right now the news is that McConnell senator call in charge of the Senate has said there will be a vote this week lots of time for the Democrats to smear the more\nI'm John ... this is the John ...

I Believe that the\nMy favorite anecdote is the armed robber who continued to work at the VA because there were no rules against it so\nYou do like to come back to that one at the at at no point in the future we'll let ever not be a great story OK Fox a fair point yeah\nFederal government has work rules and armed robbery isn't part of the conversation so now we go to how Mr Wilk is doing as managing ... an organization this large made up of a lot of veterans in cells in other words a lot of people who work there are patients of their own a constitution\nHow is Wilkie dealing with the turmoil show can and before that the long troubles of the Obama administration has he got an even hand or is he seemed to be an outsider in a rookie\nI'll get to that if you don't mind in a moment but I Want to make sure that we don't\nLeaves a thread onto a unfold on this mar a Lago group\nNobody has ever alleged ... including the people who have talked to from inside the VA that they want anyone to do anything underhanded or to benefit them personally or any of that it's just that they're not accountable to anybody on the house or Senate Veterans' Affairs committee anyone else in Congress or anyone\nPublicly that anybody can tie any particular policy to one of those people and ask him questions about it so I didn't want people thinking that there's some\nThat there are some ... bits conspiring against veterans or anything like that that doesn't appear to be the case it's just there's no transparency no accountability to your question\nI'm ah about what happens um ... what is happening with secretary Wilkie is he's leading the depart right morale morale I'm keen on morale\nTo these wonderful reporters to cover the VA our own government matters on the program tonight Nikki went link from stars and stripes and Leo Shane from the military times\nAnd we joked as we started to record the segment that this would be their last appearance on the program because there's not going to be any more news coming out to be a sin secretary Wilkie told the committee that things are calming down and morale is improving and VA is now a nonpartisan organization\nAnd we joke that there are services with no longer be needed on my program since apparently everything's fine obviously everything's not fine at the department of Veterans Affairs given the problems that you and I talked about in the past but that that the thrust the message that the secretary wanted to get across to the committee was\nThat he was cleaning up all the things that they have been worried about in the past and the day especially\nSaid to him at his confirmation hearing these are things that we expect you to clean up he wanted to very clearly deliver the message that he was getting on the case in was doing so\nA detail here Frances I 'cause I remember the bill for the Denver hospitals I took many years and was long long a controversy they just got two hundred billion dollars in the new budget or have they learned their lesson about over spending about extravagance what's your sense we have about a minute\nWelding the acquisition folks that I talked to inside the department of Veterans Affairs\nTell me that they are going to work a lot more extensively with private sector or contractors who build hospitals for a living and they're going to rely on a wisdom from other government organizations like the general services administration\nAnd the Army Corps of engineers who built big buildings on a regular basis instead of trying to think it all up on their own that's what really got them into trouble in Denver\nSo that is a partial answer for will be more careful in future we won't run over budget we won't freelance out our own will uh will follow procedures more closely and we'll keep inspired this or is any everybody learned on their own\nI think everybody's learned on their own especially given the beat down to so many people on the acquisition shop took

percent of the Tories\nIn parliament once Brexit but there is a an adamant minority that's against all resolution no you are a net and borrow than I care a great deal about Scotland you know I went to

have to raise my and the cost of of a very colorful characters [noise]\nWhat is what is the key sticking point on a lot of what's going on with breakfast for the European Union is the Irish border that is the the border between Northern Ireland and the republic of Ireland it's a it's a very touchy Massa and it dates back\nTo the circle troubles um that were you know it started in the late sixties I went on to the early nineties and it was horrible period and no one to repeat of it [noise]\nSo what government is doing now and particularly a Nicholas starch and who's the minister of Scotland she will be looking mushy mushy will be looking to see\nIf there's a special deal for Northern Ireland\nSo that it may be sort of neither in the u._k. and went out to the u._k. some sort of something special because if a happens may be scalding can say well is that getting a special deal that has the absurd off in a house maybe we can have a special off in a deal because\nScotland is very pro European a much more pro European than say London or the southeast of the u._k.\nAnd you're not especially tore in Scotland and from for many years it was labor dominating the Scottish\nUh districts and then I think the Scottish uh the Scottish national party did very well in the election before last and now you're watching from a distance that's why I'm watching breakfast at Simon I read the headlines from breakfast and they're totally confusing I'm not going to step into that it's hard enough for me to solve NAFTA\nAnd the dealing that were going on here so I'm going to move to a way of watching Brexit which is to watch the euro\nUh currencies are uh I I pour but adequate substitute for the the news headlines\nThe euro's been beat up badly and you have a piece of Barron's saying that the the that that the pummeling it's so bad it might be time or two to bet on the euro why Simon and how do you bet on the euro\n[noise] well it's an interesting story actually one of the things we know and this is ...\nOh that is that the U.S is growing really really really well it's booming growth is high unemployment is really were the low ... the European Union the euro area which doesn't include the u._k. but does include Ireland and the other big economies on the continent like Germany and France\nThat economy's going going quite slowly it's been limping limping along with low inflation and you know a lot of the Mediterranean Countries not doing very well like Italy and Spain\nSo everybody knows this and so they all sort of bats on on on the dollar and taking that money from Europe and I have a flood into the U.S where factories are being built a money invested in the stock market\nAnd here's the thing when every body is bullish on one thing\nThen it's likely to be at the very top point that it's going to be even temporarily and so right now everybody's bullish on the dollar and everybody who's got money that if it bearish on the euro so you could expect things to kind of ...\nUh and and I think it will reverse bats that's how you look at it and how you bet on it as you look at the uh the euro futures markets and or you can also look at the ATF for the euro and you can pass on maps\nAnd you can also look at again options so are you going to be um you want to be so called long the euro's advice you would buy euros so maybe the euro PF I'd actually experienced credit Fonda and you can make some money on it you know\nIt is a brutally tricky market to get right because you're up against central banks like bank of England the Federal Reserve and all the rest of it but there is some money to be right that\nUm the euro's now down I Believe it's well under one twenty which is shocking to me given that I've travelled in Europe\nWhen it's in the one fifty one forty one fifties and the pound has been in the sixties that's been a retreat to\nSo for some time now the European currencies you have in the u._k. both the euro and the pound have been in retreat is that related to Brexit for you I mean it's just a Brexit story Simon is that why the ... the euro in the pound or so we\n... the the pound his weight primarily because of Brexit um the u._k. economy has been vibrant for a long time or it has tremendously low unemployment it also has box numbers of immigrants who've come from elsewhere in the European Union because they want to be here now you know you don't come to Scotland for the weather\nYou were you really don't it's lovely how I like it but but there's a bit of rain I Know like every half hour or so when people are coming here it's because the economy's great so I'll be the plunging the pound which was like you say about one Seventy not that long ago it primarily due to breakfast\nThe the weakness of the euro is really nothing to do with breakfast it's to do with the fact that the the whole European eurozone economy is just fairly slow growing\nWhen you stop wasting it or you know things like you know France and Germany being off the entire eurozone right so those two countries are wrong fairly slowly and that's that's what's really going on\nNow NAFTA we have an announcement that NAFTA has been changed to something called the U.S MCA doesn't staying away NAFTA does but it's the United states Mexico and Canada and that that negotiation which was fraught with twelve sour uh twelfth our moments\nRod Rosenstein took his post April twenty six twenty Seventeen immediately afterwards came lots of turmoil having to do with Russia gate\nThe president had fired fires James Comey because of a memo written by Rod Rosenstein and then soon afterwards Rod Rosenstein makes a decision\nTo hire um a Bob Mueller to run this special investigation rather than an alternative so Rosenstein has been at the center of this whole drama for quite some time does he like it there league is residency and comfortable with having all this pressure\nYeah I mean I I imagine that what he tells them self when he walks into work on Pennsylvania Avenue that his job is to protect the institution that that\nHe's worked for now for twenty eight years that department of justice um so I mean look in a in a way I think that all of your listeners we can all sympathize with somebody wants to do\nWell by an important American institution like the department of justice like\nThe Federal Bureau of investigation however the various things that the OJ and the FBI did during the two thousand sixteen presidential campaign\nBoth she uh irregularities and abuses regarding the Clinton server\nInvestigation and the irregularities and likely crimes that were committed in the Trump Russia pro I think I I think we'd all be more comfortable if you were helping clean up the mess rather than to obscure the different problems that we are going on there so\nI suspect that he's a that there are a lot of anxious times over there\nIn the deputy journey attorney general's office\nThe hiring of Bob Mueller or that has thrown the whole country and this wait and see mode\nOr the president has spoken poorly of Muller he spoke and partly of Rosenstein is part of a spoken poorly of Russia gate\nAt this point you measure you mentioned those documents you measure that Rosenstein is looking to protect the institution surely he knows that the documents that would be the face of a warrant number four in June twenty Seventeen that Rod Rosenstein signed\nThat would be a sculptor tore information about Carter Page and that would be the three or two for Bruce or in addition to the president ordered\nThe revelation of all text messaging by the principles that the FBI and the de OJ and the twenty sixteen you measure that roses scene is keeping those back\nNot because he's interested in protecting some version of Russia gate but because he's an institutional as well so how does that how does that interpret y Y Z denying us information Y Z denying us information\nNo no not just because he's interested in it not just because he's an institutional is he wants to protect the institution but I Believe he's also protecting an operation here against a candidate Trump president elect Trump and then later the presidency itself\nWe would like to know we would like to know what the uh you know the the the scope memo that he wrote for Robert mother saying the outline of the investigation\nMost investors redacted we'd like to know what this says uh the fact that the fact that the J has pushed back so hard on congressional oversight committees wanting to see what that says I I think it's I think it's fairly significant\nUm this is what we do know is is that the Mueller investigation and this is very important for people to understand I Believe that the Mueller investigation is a continuation of the FBI investigation that again\n... in July two thousand sixteen which was open on the Papadopoulos story which looks more and more bogus by the day as it falls apart as figures like Alexander down or the Australian diplomat walk this back\nAnd this is also the investigation in which the FBI used the Clinton funded opposition research to secure a warrant to spy on a Trump campaign official\nSo the fact that this same investigation is continuing under the control of Robert Mueller who is being managed by Rod Rosenstein yes this is a serious concern\nAnd look there's another there's another document I'd I'd point to and there are other important fact that point\nYou in there when rose in stand up pointed the special counsel he moved to that investigation from the FBI to the D O D J right he could've just let\nThe deputy director of the FBI Andrew McCabe who as we know has problems of his own right now facing a grand jury here in Washington D. C.\nBut he moved away from him and put it under his own control this also should tell us something about the a bureaucratic gamesmanship of the deputy attorney general\nThe deputy attorney general was not involved in the original Russia gate scandal of Tony sixteen\nHe did get involved however for that for five so war it is that a uh is that a vulnerability for Rosen esteem does he believe it's a vulnerability that he ... assigned that document the document that we want to see twenty additional now redacted pages from right right\nYes I think it is a loner ability I mean among other things that was spying ban on Trump\nAssociates or as I point out of the peace and would have allowed ... it would have allowed the FBI to listen to intercept or monitor the communications a very high level officials in the administration at the time\nPerhaps or even likely the president himself that's a very bad thing or the other\nThing that I point out that when we're asking so what is the redacted information what are the things that then the new as another a congressional leaders ask to see what are they telling us that's worse or at least as bad as the fact that the Steele dossier\nWas the premise of this or that that's the premise of\nThe size of one what else is bad in there well Rod Rosenstein signed it whatever it is I Would imagine he doesn't want the president and doesn't want a lot of other people seeing it\nRod Rosenstein is the name is on that and the question I asked in the article is\nRosenstein is the best that maybe he didn't read the application for the war and\nSo that's one possibility didn't read it while that would be negligence that would be professional professional negligence the other possibility is he did read it and he doesn't want people knowing that he signed off on something very bad that the FBI was doing a regarding President Trump at that point\n[noise] Rosenstein right now uh\nThe facing the question of being fired or not is he in line to stay on for the rest of the first term or the rest of the term depending on how the election goes in twenty twenty or is he in line to step aside the way many people rotate after the first two years how do you read it like\nYeah I I I mean the way I see it as right now uh especially with the cabinet nomination I mean there's a lot when this White House and there's a lot of the ... J to uh be focused on right now and so I Believe a\nAnd sources and told me that the president does not want to stir the pot anymore than meets the third and that would likely happen\nIf the deputy attorney general either a if he was fired or if he resigns so I think right now certainly up to the election up to November I Believe that\nThe White House will try to keep the department of justice as stable as it possibly can while at a tense you other equally important business again like securing the non uh like securing Trump's nomination Brett Kavanaugh\nI Believe that after the election and there will be I don't know I guess you can describe it as people rotating out and other people were rotate again that's happened with this administration which by the way I think is that is generally a good thing\nYou get people to do certain jobs and then you bring someone else and the weather's a or we can just say that yes it it looks like a Mr Rosen's dean is likely to be on his way out after a after the elections regardless of whether or not um Democrats take back the house or the Republicans hold it\nLeave Smith writing it real clear investigations on the fate of Rod Rosenstein the deputy attorney general for the next week I'm John bachelor this is John bachelor show [noise]\n\n\nCreated I heart radio so you could put it in your pocket to take a everywhere you go to the station music podcast and more for free everywhere you go bringing radio to every part of your life wherever you live you can stream or a station on your phone laptop in over two hundred other devices like Google\nDonors Roku and hundreds more all your favorite music all your favorite dish altering\nMy heart radio I'm going to put your helmet on un hard to protect your family\nBut some residents are easy to get him my friend John that caused\nWest Nile virus when he got an iron cockroaches leave behind bacteria as well as allergens that can trigger asthma and\nBeing happy and more than half a million people to the emergency room\nCongress has can threaten our health plan how to protect your family\nHas ruled that the public service message on the national has many Asian CDC\nBoston ... home for conservative talk with my family from Boston Ninety four or five what did you manage to keep on talking twelve hundred I hard radio station\n\nEarthquakes ... up sharply ...

created by Russia in Europe so uh NO CARRIER or for that matter surface ship could enter into the Baltic Sea for instance or bring relief to Poland or any of the Baltic nations with out missiles that are based in Kaliningrad being able to reach out and block them up you know prior to them coming in\nFacing a to a D a challenges on in both Europe and in Asia the two services the air\nOr send the navy in your paper you indicate or at least point to a problem in the past and I ask if it's solved now the air force has long range strike missions the navy has the control\nAre those two surfaces working together given the scale of the challenge in the Pacific ad in the north Atlantic\nNo no they're not working together and that's part of the purpose of this paper is that even after the Goldwater Nichols act of Nineteen eighty six of the navy in the air force of not gotten together to come up with a joint concept of operations and for that matter both of them have been proceeding based upon assumption of easy access to the theater so\nOne of the areas where the air force has gotten a where they're very out of balance is they've over emphasized\nShort range fighter aircraft that can also serve and then you know air to ground attack role um despite the fact that these anti access technology is coming along so whereas in the beginning of the air force the bomber community really dominated\nToday it's the light attack fighter community that dominates and even if the air force makes investment just finding by for instance Seventeen hundred and sixty three thirty five houses\nBut they're only playing to buy one hundred new be Twenty one when be Twenty one would actually be the platform\nUh that uh that has the most emphasis of the most utility and I point out because I switched from being at at CNN yes\nOver to being at telling us right now or one of the one of the clients that I Do advise ... is a is an aircraft manufacturer Northrop Grumman are that the uh manufacturers be Twenty one but I wrote this paper prior to coming into this environment\nWe lack a sea bass long range penetrating precision strike that means that something off of the carrier is that a debate at the navy that we ... that this component is not there for the year twenty fifth day when Xi Jinping's says they will dominate\nSo it it is a debate but unfortunately it's not a strong debate the navy or specifically if we look at what it is done and deciding on the new him to twenty five ... aircraft which they recently down selected to one variant\nThey made a decision to go with a mission tanker for an unmanned aircraft on board the carrier deck rather than making an investment in an unmanned long range strike bomber which is something that they could have done had they made some decisions differently a couple of years ago\nSo the navy is not come to grips with its strategic shortsighted in us on leaving the long range mission\nAnd has not come up with it as a useful or adaptation or concept of operation that will allow its air wing to bridge that span of distance for awhile navy aircraft to be able to strike targets of shore\nUh right now as I understand that the Trump Administration is recommended a force for class carrier\nAnd a two in addition to the carriers that are now either by at sea or in in rotation a but building a carrier that doesn't have this strike seems uh a few child doesn't cherry\nDoesn't it it does it does and this is one of the things and and I have\nBeen supportive of the idea of building up or carrier force back up to twelve\nBut it's all been based upon the presumption that the navy would seriously engage on the relevance of the carrier by investing in the U.S carrier air wing to again get long range strike back on to the platform or we need a twelve carrier right now there's new stories out there that the USS Eisenhower\nA which has been one of our most used aircraft carriers um is going to have to extend her stay in the yard for an additional Eighteen months she was supposed to be in six months\nShe is a so in in such bad material condition shocked to be in for two years\nWe need to get some additional carriers out there to take the strain off of the current fleet but the carriers will not be relevant in a future war if their air wings are not properly equipped to be able to spend the distance and so\nYou need new unmanned platforms you also need a new generation of missiles that have longer range faster speeds at lower radar cross sections in order to penetrate\nThese new anti access air denial environments that the Chinese and Russians are building\nI'm speaking with captain Jerry Hendricks US Navy retired he is at the ... group he formerly was at the center for new American security and he's published a document from C.

Thomas Bogart and joined with the U.S government the user here as do has\nCreated the circumstances dramatically that\nBrought America into the first World War in Nineteen Seventeen and they hinge upon a fantastic opera called the cameraman telegram\nZimmerman Telegram intercepted by the British because they routinely read the mail of the gentleman called Americans that's what they did it in the decoded they laughed at American code they regarded them as simple as the German codes were a little better the Germans have changed their codes a few times but they were good at that too there are a couple of guys name\nNigel ... gray and others in the room forty\nThat find reading a code easy ... unimportant deep distinction Thomas you make in your book\nWhat is the difference between a code and aside for\nA a a that's a good question and it took me some some time to understand that aside for a century if you take one letter and replace it with another\nDay to be for instance if you change if you change one letter to another or one symbol to another it's a it's a site for a cold is if you if you use a word um I'm In place off another word of another symbol so that's that's the whole difference there\nUm and to the gym and telegram was coated with not a site\nFor it was in a code and there were several codes that the Germans were using Thirteen oh four oh five nine five o seven five hundred there was another way of talking about their code summer summer good summer that you have a code book you conquer words and what you conquer word and you see it's repetition\nYou when you come to it again you know that's what they're using for example Zimmerman's name itself had a code and when you recognize that you saw that Zimmerman had signed this telegram compared to what we do today was signals intelligence is a simple rubber member where before digital communication where we absolutely leaders\nAnd also were before the first and second war the taught everybody\nThat gentleman do read each other's mail all the time in fact\nThey read it so much they fix gentlemen's mail and that's why history is a mystery always when you re discover how people came to decisions All right the telegram is intercepted hall gets it and he goes through what I'd have to say Thomas is\nA the work of a great novelist he created world within world so that there's always doubt about how the Zimmerman Telegram came into the hands of\nThe foreign secretary bow forward to hand to page on February twenty third and it creates such a world of mirrors that you spend a deal of your book\nOr a a a translating those who have written about the ... over the last hundred years including all who either middle representative or miss understood at your book itself is a work of crypt analysis Thomas congratulations\nThank you thank you very much thank you very much halls\nWork is genius and he has to be one of the icons of signals intelligence is he given credit for that here in the twenty first century\nOh I think absolutely I think he absolutely is he is credited as one of the fathers of of a crypt analysis now the interesting thing is of course hall himself had a very weak grass of crypt analysis\nHe himself was not was not a natural code breaker I'm I'm a ... you can see and his ... sometimes confuse us these different codes and you know you have to read ... with care because\nSometimes it's deliberate disinformation sometimes I think he just doesn't understand you know the uh the fine points of ... but he didn't have to be he was a fantastic manager and he was a political animal and I think this is what what what made him until it ran from the British perspective\nI'm I'm such a success story it wasn't that whole\nWhole you how to hire the right people and he knew how to manage these people well they all admired him these these these these amazing cool breakers um but he himself wasn't really concern with this um with this new show um if I may I Would just like to elaborate a little bit on what happened of\nCourse and by the by what I Would say is that hall is jobs and crept analysis is a ... that's the difference between jobs in the ... created the umpire with what you'd have to say are create a creative ideas\nYes can you like that yes I like that no that's\nThat's that's a good analogy um what happened and and I think this this kind of you know it goes a long way to explain\nWhy hall was so successful at what he did when the British\nIntercepted them and telegram hum hum as it goes through London at the time you know again they were routinely intercepting American telegrams and and then also the Germans that were embedded in them um he he understands as you as you said that he has a bombshell in his hands he understands if he gives this to the Americans\nThis this will have an impact um because here we have in Germany basically offering American territory to to Mexico and and by implication also to Japan and he also understands that he needs to be really really careful in my interpretation of holes actions at the time is that his main concern was not\nThat the Germans would find out how hall had gotten hold of the telegram but that the American sport as you said you know they were routinely intercepting American um\nThere were cheating intercepting American communications I'm In London and uh uh if the Americans\nUm had at that point asked hall\nWhere was this telegram actually coming from he wouldn't have a good answer and would not have a good\nAnd he would have to give up on his access to jewels and he was very shrewd because he was thinking beyond the war and\nSlowly and also it would play play into those into the hands of those Americans that were saying hey you know the British they're just trying to pull us into the war\nTo get the chest knocked out of the fire for them when the zoom into like revenge Lee is published in the u._s. press and we'll get to that at this point there were people were asking hey how how how did this telegram how was this intercepted ... how did we get this and the first place\nAnd if it was if it had been review of the time that this was a British Intelligence propaganda operation it could have played out very differently so so all the schools to save a whole learns a fatality from the first place he is so concerned that this doesn't get out that he doesn't even tell the foreign office which you know by by law he should have\nUm a because of his concerns he he he was he was concerned that the Americans would learn 'em that he was intercepting American messages and to his dying day I'm In in the late Nineteen thirties early forties he never admitted um how he had originally intercept the telegraph\nIn fact he created several legends one of which was that it was because someone at Pearl ... documents\nRelating to the Swedish embassy on board the ship which carry bounced off the German ambassador back to Europe having been
