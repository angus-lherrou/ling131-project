forces [noise]\nUm I have to imagine and you know he was going to talk about how\nThe members of Afghan security forces are going to be treated in their presence because disarming them is a major insult so I Would have to guess when senior officials and high high level officers are meeting with Afghan or they're asking of opposite\nThat the that the security forces will be disarmed or have to leave leave the room for\nAmerican security forces have to be president kind of a standoff bill this is yeah this this reminds me of the stories I read it in in about Vietnam especially after the

couldn't be sure uh who the good guys and bad guys were in Vietnam Vietnam\nYeah what's ... what's that bond of trust is broken and in this type of infants [noise]\nIt it's really something difficult

patriots are shot by Afghan forces so\nYou know it it causes a lot of tension is trust and that is exactly what the Taliban or any you know insurance either it's worth it so it wants to try to achieve\n[noise] I tell them a very good evening to your article takes us to the wrong connection a partner nations seek to disrupt us in partner nation seek to disrupt the Iran Taliban nexus\nMissions fresh to me you've established over many many years that Iran is a very active agent with regard to al ... how does that extend to Taliban\nOr get anything done you know this is one of those stories it's really under appreciated that you know you go through some sources will tell you that in starting in two thousand one neuron was incredibly helpful with the U.S\nIn trying to set up a post on government and was basically acquiesce thing to us and international demands and with ... playing a diplomatic and otherwise healthy role in Afghanistan\nUm there is a whole fact pattern which tells the opposite story the dark side of the story which is that in starting in two thousand and one of the top the top on in Iran actually cut an agreement to work against us\nAnd we've documented this in a numerous times and his most recent action taken by us and six partner nations and the terrorism taskforce\nWas meant to disrupt the finances are that are at at this the horror of this nexus between Iranian actors and the Taliban specifically\nUm to officials who worked for Iran Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and six tall bought officials in addition to a major drug trafficker who are all sort of in the wind in this network is coming after the Afghan government and its international allies including the U.S and Afghanistan\nSo the iron juicy could force has targeted the capital or they're looking to make whether they're always looking to make money what is their chief interest in Afghanistan\nWhile they're cheap interest in Afghanistan is to get the U.S out and to expand their own interest now you know where people go awry on this story as they correctly remember that the Iran and the Taliban were at odds were at loggerheads in the late Nineteen nineties\nIn Nineteen Ninety eight there were even at the on the verge of war against one another and some people leave off of that story and think that that's the end of the relationship between the two but as we've documented that wasn't the end of the relationship between the two in fact there was the governor of the ... province which is um the western most province\nIn Afghanistan round the border with Iran was a guy named ...\nWho was an emissary from ... to fire the Taliban and he was eventually to attain to Guantanamo and was one of the five senior Taliban officials who was traded for Bowe Bergdahl well care costs case file is incredibly interesting because it it came to light and in fact he brokered a deal on behalf of the tall bond\nWith Iran to come after us in two thousand one there after now this latest action if you read it very carefully by the U.S Treasury Department and he's six partner nations actually gives you a lot of details and what happened after that initial deal was caught between a tall been neuron you see that they're actually a series of arrangements they came that were\nBroker between the two to come after us I'm including in two thousand six two

officials identified in this ... this designation are that are serving other ... either a shadow governors or ... shadow governors\nAnd as bill and I stress for years you know one of the things the Taliban is doing by setting up shadow governments is they're getting prepared to rule over Afghanistan once again this whole thing could this whole shadow government that they've set up\nCuts against the idea that they're going to want to broker a deal\nTo let the U.S out and sort of reconcile with the Afghan government they're not going to want to reconcile the Afghan government they want to take

McCotter W ... great voices the great lakes my colleague in Khost and we're joined by Gordon Chang watching China doesn't take much to interpret these remarks way first look at Xi Jinping in these last hours this is just put up the president\nSaid it is necessary to strengthen the mission and concentrate preparation for fighting a war is looking at the south China Sea and Taiwan Strait\nThe president said we need to talk the president of China president for life of China Xi Jinping when you need to talk all complex situations into consideration and make emergency plans accordingly set the precedent [noise]\nWe have to step up combat readiness exercises joined exercise and confrontational exercises to enhance servicemen its capabilities and preparation for war that would be a headline when the man who is president for life of a billion plus people and a two million plus military\nPreparations for war the defense minister whose job it is to exercise these indications said\nIf someone tries to separate Taiwan from China the Chinese armed forces will take action at any price the defense minister said the islands in the south China Sea have long been China's territory\nWrong there the legacy of our ancestors and we can't afford to lose a single injure them garden there is no ambiguity here this reads very poorly in English and I'm going to guess it reads very poorly in every language it's being translated into\nWho's the audience for this garden who is way talking do who is she talking too good evening to\nA good evening John I'm Thaddeus\nI'm I don't know what's inside of sea jumping said but there are many potential audience is sort of for instance we could actually be an audience because they want to intimidate us to not defend Taiwan\nIt could fear will be people in Taiwan to say you've got to surrender but I think the primary audience is the one at home and the reason is that he is trying to gird um the Chinese political system and to make sure that he's got support in the military\nGot to remember that ... has been purging military officers recently and I'm sure that doesn't go down to well in some parts of the military and so what he needs to do is he needs to bind the fighting for us together and I think that these types of statements play very well because you got some flag officers and you've got some colonels\nWho just really want to go out and kill people and so this is going to be popular politically you John one thing I should mention is that we've heard similar statements during a period of when Hu Jintao was the Supreme Ruler\nBut China was more stable but right now the political system I think is in flux and so when we hear statements like this was your shouldn't fluff it often say oh we heard that ten years ago I think now we've got to pay particular attention to what they're saying when they're saying\nThat is a garden you mentioned the president for life has been purging the military on what pretenses even doing that\nWell he's been doing it on the on the basis of corruption which is the same pretense that he's been using 'em to go after civilians\nBut as we know in the civilian arena um as in true with senior military officers basically they're all corrupt so this is not a question about corruption is a question of going after political enemies\nBecause we've seen this that feeds from paying in the civilian arena has not going after his friends and he's not going after his friends in the military there\nAnd he's not going after his family um and\nThe civilian arena he's going after anti corruption campaigner so the only conclusion that you can draw from this is that this is a political purge in the civilian area as well from a military\nPuzzle garden ten years ago the Chinese military was aspirational it's no longer aspirational it's actionable that that maneuver against the Decatur was a threat\nWe can do more we can open fire the time that's happened two weeks ago the Taiwan Strait exercised by the anti them and uh the the\nBy the early ... class and the missile forget that was to demonstrate that we we embrace Taiwan we do not acknowledge your claims on Taiwan the Chinese military is not capable of shooting back I don't think that was that was ten years ago they they hadn't stolen enough to do that now\nI don't know Gordon I Can't tell\nIf these words are boasting or hollow I Can't tell and if I Can't tell how does the navy town\nYou know the that's an important point John that uh the circumstances of change and so um the Chinese are actually feeling their oats\nAnd you've got to remember ... D institutionalize the Communist Party which means that the rules that were meant to keep leadership in check are no longer there which means that feature in paying 'em is subject to no holds barred retaliation\nWhich means siege and paying realizes that he's got very little um that he can't do plan B\nSo if he seemed to back down he's going to lose power he's going to lose freedom he could lose his life\nThis is going back to Maoist era political struggles\nAnd what teaching thing has done is he's increase the cost of losing a political struggle he knows that\nWhich means he can take China over the edge\nIf he thinks he's going to die anyway he might as well ... half of humanity doing it if he thinks he's got a chance to survive so that's what makes this different than Hu Jintao who was this middle of the road bureaucrat who you know it was just going to get along and play along and let everyone be happy things are very different now\nNot just to note here garden you just reminded me that there's an article in foreign affairs right now I'll get the author in a moment that argues that are US Navy because it can demonstrate authorities so close to China\nIs likely to\nEncourage the Chinese to go maximum in any in any exchange of weapons because we can strike at their nuclear forces\nAnd they can't strike at ours easily and so therefore the situation in Asia it's far more unstable than it ever was during the first Cold War when we were balance with submarines\nA land based ballistic missiles and bombers between Russia and the United states that is not the case with China it does not have the the tri ad that Russia or a created\nAnd it has a limited amount of whatever it does have to strike back at the U.S\n[noise] yeah I I've got to read that piece but the point is when you show weakness when you don't show I'm the U.S navy the Chinese feel embolden and that was the lesson of letting them takeover Scarborough Shoal so you know the point is\nThat's what living United feels like to me my name is Dale Kaczynski I help people she financial independence so I don't just where the shirt\nGift advocate\nVolunteer Libby nine and ... by United Way an ad council\nI'm Jason plump founding board member of the Innocence Project and my new podcast as wrongful conviction available on our heart radio on wrongful conviction I interviewed different exonerate every weekend and help them to tell their incredible stories of tragedy\nAnd triumph against impossible I mean you've got to hear to believe in wrongful conviction for my heart studios\nAvailable now our radio\nStuff people are talking about every establishment Whitey out our government wants to sell them for conservative\nSock twelve hundred [noise]\nI'm John bats are Thaddeus McCotter W. J. are the great the great lakes my colleague can cause Gordon Chang stays with us from the Daily Beast and we're joined by the\nFree beacons bill card bill is written extensively of Chinese capabilities over many many years decades\nAnd he's watched the Chinese develop their skill set and the confidence and their arrogance towards targets in the United states\nThree letter to remind you oh pi am\nThe Chinese compromised every security file in the U.S government at that moment all the security personnel all their Social Security information all their credit card everything was compromised so much so that the Obama administration sent out letters to the compromised\nIntelligence officers who were behind closed doors to tell them to make adjustments in their daily use of credit cards and private information O P s why do I tell that story\nBill a very good evening to the Chinese took everything when they took OPM what is their ambition why do we know now about the ambition for the twenty teen election and be on good evening to\nOh hi John always good to be on the show well first off a the the twenty two million federal records that were stolen by the Chinese and the opium hack uh are now being used with advanced or artificial intelligence software\nTo actually conduct major information operations whether that is targeting a network administrators who they want to have further or to conduct a election meddling operations as the vice president revealed a couple of weeks ago\nGarden ville I understand that China has put more money into trying to influence the American electorate than any other foreign power but it has been done what the Russians have done which is patrol farms in the box\nThey've I've heard actually put the infrastructure in place but not implemented it what do you think that they've done [noise] well\nI think uh I I got a hold of this first of all the vice president mentioned that there was a ... internal Chinese party propaganda notice which\nBasically outlined a what I Would describe as an information\nWarfare campaign targeting ah the United states and kicking off of the trade war which they are clearly engaged and they're they're making no bones about it uh this propaganda notice I found it online the White House referred me to uh to to court briefly from it it said\nWe must carefully control our propaganda tone not to escalate not to expand the scope instead we must fire precision strikes we must ...\n... or so discord among different groups in the United states and make them collapse so that kind of gives you a sense of where the Chinese are going with is\nThat is how do they mean bill collapse what is the nature of that a goal\nWell they're they're basically targeting the trade issue so that's kind of the main focus or they feel like they believe that the Trump administration's effort to pressure China is part of the anti communist drive to prevent China from rising they they view it in ideological\nCold War terms despite them saying that accusing the United states of having a Cold War mentality is part of their propaganda\nBut are clearly they want to prevent\nThe United states from succeeding in in the tariff war and are clearly they're under pressure uh there are important science that there are struggles within the Chinese leadership over how to respond to this pressure this economic pressure that the Trump Administration has imposed so I think the u._s. is winning\nAnd they're going to try every way they can to defeat Trump a bar by or perhaps in the mid term elections coming up next week to try and\nPrevent that the Republicans for maintaining control and hopefully working through the Democrats to to further undermine Trump's policy towards China\nThat's a positive bill or their America desk I'd like to ask a question here what what is where is your education to think that Nancy Pelosi as speaker is going to be pro China I don't see any evidence that that's accurate nor do I see any evidence that controlling the house of representatives is going to change Donald Trump's mind about trade conflict\nWell or they want to be able to go after Trump in every which way they can and of course there's no question in my mind that if the Democrats take over the house I don't think they will but if they do they're going to try to impeach a trumped\nBy email they want to get the Chinese are gone for the big one they're going to the old twenty fifth version three\nYes that's right a halfway measure and then a parent's revealed in his speech that ah it's not limited to this year's election they're going after Trump in twenty twenty so they're going to find and support a pro China businessmen who are going to support\nPro China politicians in the Democratic party to follow Beijing's long garden\nVille I think you know as as John indicated um that's not going to be really smart plan because there are number of pro China politicians are equally divided between the two parties and if there's a balance there is going to be more in the Republican Party but putting that aside for the moment\nWhat do you think the United states should do to counter the electioneering on the part of ... [noise] uh they\nHave to be made to pay a price and so far they're not paying a price there there was some economic measures the terrorists are are part of it I think there has to be political ah efforts made a using U.S intelligence to expose some of the leadership corruption\nA there are people in a in this country and I can think of one off the top of my head a of a dissident Chinese billionaire named ...\nWho has the details on the corruption of all if not all but many of the top Chinese leaders and their foreign holdings or their foreign corruption\nAnd it's endemic to that system and I think that U.S intelligence should be tasked to expose some of that but let's make the people pay a price let's let's show the Chinese people how corrupt the Communist Party leadership really is\nTwenty seconds that is quickly do require coordination among several branches United States government to see that happening bill [noise]\nUm I think it's possible I certainly do I think after the midterm elections we'll see what happens but I think that a Trump is clearly a made clear that he's going to\nPut continue to put pressure on the Chinese and uh I think that they should be made to pay\nA price if in fact we have the more details on the type of political influence operations that they're running in this country ... guards Gordon Chang that is\n[noise] I've never seen a

the other incidents because of the horror of it it was an attack on innocent people and at the same time it can joins with what the us has enjoyed for Seventy years which is\nSpeaking how ah how well the U.S has welcomed Jewish refugees from the Europe pars and here we have one visited upon us is beyond irony John it ... it reminds all of us that you have to be a watchful every day\n[noise] well I Know several ex patriots who are Americans but live overseas and they come back to this country perhaps once a year and talking to them as a real eye opener because they see the country of snapshot form and they noticed changes over the course of a year or two [noise]\nWhat I've been told by many of them the last two or three years is is how much more politicized America is how people are yelling at each other about politics but no longer discuss\nYou know the normal course of the events they immediately jumped into politics and they find out who starts somewhat is on and they start attacking them social media has become a mosh pit of resentment some prejudices and name calling\nSo one of the greatness of the great things about America for much\nMy life has been we don't dedicate everything to politics politics is sort of cordoned off people carve up their lives separate from it I think the age of Trump\nThe age of ... the age of the shouting at the yelling has meant more people are getting more upset with each other than they ever have before and that ultimately has consequences\nThat each have a question for you know the gentleman but there are not are they are not deep divisions among people view of the country in the direction the country's going to lead to this and how do you really are eight or the rhetoric amongst both sides when that chasm exists David\n[noise] well I think part of the problem is nobody wants to say except responsibility for anything you know the president is never fall for anything he says the a leading figures on the left or never fall for anything they say\nSo everybody says whatever they want and it's always the other guy's fall and nobody's willing to collectively take responsibility for things things that\nAren't necessarily their fault but in a sense\nAre their fault that they're an elective office because otherwise why are you there that nothing is going to get better I think it is true that we are deeply divided nation and that is that a\nA character of our politics increasingly over the past Twenty years I think what's different now\nThan at least in some previous decades although this isn't the only time in American history this has happened is that at the present time were particularly tribal about it we are with our political try because the other side of evil so my side might not always the right but the other side is evil\nThey're not just wrong they have ill intent and we have seen\nBoth the left in the right to stride president they don't like is not just being wrong but purposely wrong for the purpose of undermining America on purpose\nAs though political leaders actually said to themselves when they get up in the morning left or right today I'm going to ruin America on purpose for what purpose I had no idea that people believe that\nJohn I'm\nBoth sides believe that the America that they want is threatened and we have seen in the last Thirty years the percentage of people who believe that the other party is evil as David described has gone from about ... percent of Republicans and Democrats used to believe that about the other party\nNow it's fifty two fifty three percent for each party you cannot have a functioning democracy cannot have a Congress it compromises and\nPasses bipartisan legislation you cannot have anything like the old politics we have over half of the country believes the other side is exactly what David said men is a a domestic enemy an enemy of the people um those those are not conditions under which you can govern the way we used to\nA question Richard Haass that are raised in an article you wrote in Nineteen fifty this during the McCarthy period when there were deep divisions in America\nAnd I paraphrase it just loosely because I Want to ask the question about this David do you measure that Washington today is prepared for the opponent\nTo be the government our men and women going to work on Capitol Hill and at the White House aware of the fact that the people they're opposing tonight on television could very well be the leadership of the country in a matter of months\n\nWell I think I think that's for political professionals in Washington they know that very well but they have a part to play and they play the part and then the election happens and they go about their ... they kind of go about their business so I think that when you're in this business you say all sorts of things\nAnd then you're able to work together the next day because that's just your job I think the problem with that is that you create expectations among the electorate ... make it harder for them to be\nOkay with you doing that job so for instance if you\nIf you go on television call one party evil and they're trying to undermine America a or you beat up on the political establishment and the government in and create a sense of distrust among touche and then when it's time to actually do your job\nWell you're a professional so for you it's no big deal but for voters they're sitting there going but I don't trust the government and you said the other side of the evil so I don't want you to compromise with them and and I don't think that\nI I don't know the political leaders have digested or or talking heads and digested that they create this or that they might not necessarily believe and think it's all a part of\nYou know you're in the middle of a football game and then when it's over your friends again but for the fans they still have the other side's fans and they don't want you to make nice with them and I I don't know if people quite a internalized that\nJohn do ... are the professionals ready to acknowledge the other side is in charge and work with them\n[noise] well we're going to find out because if the Democrats take back the house or that will give them the responsibility of governing\nAnd we can see if we have a normal Congress where there's a give and take and you know people debate whether or not to have a government shutdown and what the how to stop that and pass appropriations bills and all of those things how to negotiate with the Republican Senate or\nWe can go to every democratic chairman issues lots of subpoenas halls and members of the administration for questioning and moved to impeachment remember the leading democratic donors that it will have elected a lot of these House Democrats Tom stiers specifically in California\nDid so say we want to impeach President Trump so the expectations that David spoke about are going to be there if the Democrats take back the house they will have a choice\nDo we govern normally having you know ... won the election or do we are we driven by our donors in our partisans in our base to you know full frontal war with the administration and there's no pretense of governing\nJohn Fund of the national Review Online and Fox News David ...

left of the Iranian economy chiefly to do with banking rules and the ability of around and do business with the rest of the world and also have money that has substance it's collapsed over these last week's\nInside Iran however we are not making war on the Iranian people this is to do with a regime gang and this gang hold everyone hostage in Iran and out making war on its neighbors it's a

your inspiration to be very particular about who it is that is the ... who is the problem good evening to you\nCould evening a thanks for having me I'm watching this report that I'm that we're discussing is coming about a week before the Trump Administration are renews the rest of the economic sanctions on Iran that had been lifted up under the two thousand and Fifteen a nuclear deal\nAnd uh that's what I think that these this is a vital stop I think it'll go a long way towards pressuring the regime\nAn exerting a fairly devastating impact on the economy but I think as we do this it's also a very important that we also go after the figures in the regime that are responsible for major human rights abuses\nBy the Trump Administration as well as the mission before him a had already um sanctioned a number of such people\nBut there are many more within the regime that have yet to be a designated for human rights abuses that I think it's very important that we do so now\nAlso because the Iranian people are um protesting as we speak on the ... uh on the streets of Iran as they've been doing since two thousand a Seventeen and uh they're looking I think many of them are looking to the United states for leadership first solidarity\nOr they remember the fact that President Obama was largely silent uh when they first protested mass scale in two thousand nine or ... and I think that by sanctioning these people I think we're also sending a much more\nA direct message to the Iranian people that we understand the particular place that they experience on a day to day basis um and these are figures which um you know he's earned obscure figures within Iran many of them were actually appointed by president Hassan Rouhani who is often described as a moderate\nUm but in fact when you actually look at his behavior um\nYou see he actually was appointed officials who are directly who\nPrior to the appointment we're responsible for major human rights abuses and continued um since then so these are people who report to Rowhani so we can't uh plausibly argue that\nUm he has no responsibility for this or that he's powerless to prevent it um the these are figures within the regime that a a ... that operates daily I'm apparatus of repression\nThe report is entitled profiles of Iranian repression architects of human rights abuses in the Islamic republic it's available at the foundation for the defense of democracy the website I'm going to look to breaking down there twelve names here\nBut and they're all unfamiliar to me before I come to the profiles provided in the report\nSo we'll begin with the ministers a mock mood a lobby is the minister of intelligence\nOh he is a severe abuser of the Iranian people at the same time he says his job is to stand up to the cronies of global hedge me had jumped on me meaning the United states\nHow is the ministry of intelligence used internally against the Iranian people say\nWell the mystery of intelligence is probably a arguably probably one of the most uh it's not the most major human rights abuses or a in\nA Iran um it has its fingerprints throughout the country in terms of uh targeting dissidents journalists a political activists ethnic and religious minorities or you name it on the ministry of intelligence is job is to monitor dissidents to monitor opponents\nOf the regime a and it had a pretty extensive infrastructure uh aimed at doing so um it's probably the minister of intelligence is probably one of the most important ministers I'm In the regime\nUm and I think they've also I Would notice they played a key role in suppressing um the protests are through force that have occurred um over the last year they actually operate their own um\nPrison wardens are within Iran infant is a prison ... infrastructure [noise] um so uh you know when these people are sent to prison you know they ... they play a direct role um in torturing these people and extracting a force confessions an otherwise mistreating them in many ways\nUm second this is one of the most a brutal ministries and the regime\nThe ministry of interior Abdul ... what is striking about this is that he manages the the L E s a who is ... and what is the Eli after the\nUh supposedly is the minister of interior and the ... that stands for the Islamic ... the law enforcement force of the Islamic republic of Iran or at least as basically the official state police um they're responsible in theory for\nUm insurance law and order and uh I'm sure they do that to some degree in in prosecuting legitimate in the ... actual crimes are but what they also do is a key role in suppressing protests and what we've seen over the last year was that in addition to folks like the ministry of intelligence\nUm they have been on the one they had been the ones on the streets shooting of protesters are arresting\nA thousands of them um and playing a key role in stopping them um the minister of interior also plays a role in uh approving permits or or or in this case not approving permits\nOr for protests in print according to the Iranian law you can't a protest without a permit but in practice or it's virtually impossible or for any protesters or to get a permit because the regime does not want anyone to demonstrate against them\nThree member commissions a which had the ... which were responsible for sentencing or individual uh these people to death or these panels were often um cannot be described as any serious a legal effort a these are often they would interview people for for a few minutes um and on the basis of several\nMinute interview would decide whether or not they would live or die and Abraham right you see\nA was one of the members of those\nA death panels I'm associate directly has a responsibility for a scores of deaths\nUm and today he presides over a foundation um called Austin customers Avi a which plays a key role in um generating um the money that helps a Iran a ...\nA deport a support terror abroad or as well as repression\nI'm at home um this is a foundation that set with a real estate value you know in the range of a hundred million dollars um and um\nThe fact that he occupies a such an important role in the regime I think is very uh telling 'em because it really just shows um that the regime a really doesn't particularly care about a\nHuman rights abuses on on the country um he was promoted I think not in spite of his bloody record but because of it\nUm because it showed his loyalty to the regime and to the radical Islamist ideology or the tribes so so he is I think one of the most important figures and arguably one of the most dangerous as well and the regime brigadier\nGeneral huts sane ... he is in charge of the law enforcement force L E s that includes cyber I Believe and it overlaps with the ... how does he make Warner's people\nWell the police is responsible for us suppressing dissent um the police or you know routinely um arrests those um it's it's it suspects of defying the regime whether we're talking about a journalist human rights activists religious minorities et cetera and I think the police at all so\nOver the last year played a key role in uh arresting and otherwise using force against Iranian protesters so just as I said I think that's what it says Eli asked a law enforcement forces is one of the most important bodies\nI'm of the government responsible for attacking suppressing it so people\nCome under the siege goal I'm sane guy in power for and the puzzle here is we don't know how big the message as you have estimates from a hundred thousand to five million what's a what's a good guess\nWhat we're talking about we're talking about I'm In the millions and this is actually largely a volunteer force that has branches a throughout the country and it's fairly uh embedded with in the daily fabric of Iranian life now there may be several million but we're not talking about necessarily a\nSeveral million who are active date today um those are are you know are we talking about a bit of a smaller number um but what makes the um\nThe siege distinct from the police is it not only do they um suppress dissent but they're\nParticular they pay a particular role in enforcing the religious norms of the regime but I think the most dramatic and most well known example of that over the last two years has been a the suppression of Iranian women particularly those women who refused to where the hit job or the head scarf or in public\nI'm refusing to where the headscarf is a crime that can land you in jail or in Iran and in fact that's precisely what's happened over the last year when many women um refuse to wear their head scarf in public as a as a as a form of\nProtest and uh they wind up in jail um other things that the uh a U.S each a does as they try to prevent a let's say male female ... station I'm having a party where men and women are present a together a can easily land you in jail\nAnd a siege is one of the main forces responsible for ensuring that happens so um this again is another dangerous uh organization I'm within the regime and it's a particularly important role in the religious enforcing the religious norms set up the government\nAnd two judges or one name ... to the other one name ... say you say there are hanging judges is that what they do what do they do today\nYeah these two judges are among the most infamous charges a any Ron I'm they probably had a responsible for war um unjust sentences in the judiciary and the judicial system than probably\nI'm almost anyone else I'm ... I'm I think became particularly more well known in the west back in two thousand nine when he actually presided over the public trials\nOf hundreds of Iranian protesters\nUm since then um you know he's continue this work ah as I mentioned about the judicial system earlier um this is a system where trials can often last minutes um uh lawyers are access to a lawyer started limited\nOr non existent and I'd also highlights olive are cheap because he is actually played a key role in um sentencing a number of dual nationals\nI'm In Iran including several I'm Iranian American citizens um the regime has a particular interest in capturing these people\nBecause for the obvious reason that regard that the United states has its ... adversary and when Iranian goes ahead and gets a un American citizenship that's obviously something that deeply troubles the regime so when these people come back home\nUm they often have a strong chance of getting arrested\nAnd in those cases um\nThey often get sent to a solid body um and they get sent to him because they know the regime knows that he is going to deal with them I'm very harshly so when the river the regime wants to make an example of somebody or he's or go to guy and he usually a dozen disappoint them because these are folks that end up\nI'm spending a long time in prison or where they frequently face torture I'm at and oh and by the way I'm\nMany much of the time um you often hear that these people have confessed to their crimes are so to speak but in fact as we know and as many prisoners have reported um these people these a\nConfession so called confessions are coerced under torture often um so when we hear about you know these ... that Iranians are committing a but they've done wrong to the regime we have to keep in mind that ah it's likely about a confession that wasn't delivered voluntarily\nThe document is profiles of Iranian repression we've we've talked about nine of the twelve names there's also the minister of communication there's the man who's in charge of the prison other bad\nActors it's produced by the foundation for the defense of democracy I've been speaking with ...

I think ... might as well surrender and is that the end of the Dutch up with one little episode in future that's the end of the ... in Manhattan that moment right\nAnd that's the render it's wide thing don't fight an overwhelming force\nThat is correct a ... and has a hard time coming to that conclusion because he is a real soldier he's he's a man who came up through the ranks of the Dutch west India company\nHe's he is Keith successor as governor basically director of the colony but he had fought the Spanish on behalf of the Dutch and the Caribbean prior to his arrival in Manhattan Island so he's a guy a real a real Marshall a temperament\nHe's very capable administrator a far far far more so than keep to ban\n'em but he does ultimately face reality is that he's got a little for with a few hundred uh uh settlers a couple of hundred militia men and soldiers that he can he can muster and yet he's face he's facing not only a flotilla of English\nOr warships a manned by sailors and soldiers but he's also got the problem that if he looks across the river to the shore of ah where where really the Brooklyn Bridge is now today um he's got a whole he's facing a whole\nA mob of English farmers from the far reaches of Long Island who also on hand over uh the Dutch territory to ah to the king of England so he wisely as you said a decides not to fight\nAnd a and from then forward a Dutch New Amsterdam becomes English New York there was a brief moment as you mentioned in sixty and Seventy three Seventy four the Dutch sale back in\nAnd take over again but then they handed back to the English during peace negotiations and sixteen Seventy four so you end up having New York as a as a port city of the British Empire\nBritish Empire but the umpires now tangle for the next and sixteen eighty four to Seventeen sixty three a series of wars chiefly fought between the French and English and Spanish did get involved and they were always hanging on the side and the only was it the periphery of those but this is a transforming period for New York\nMentioning a William kid captain kid the pirates who found trinity church who is one of the ... name didn't trinity church

sometimes got blurred buccaneers were pirates a plain and simple out to prey on whatever cargo ship merchant ship you know showed on the horizon\nA regardless of his nationality private tears were officially license to a a basically a pirates for war in other words their mandate was to sail forth for their given sovereign in this case it would be the king of England\nUm to basically re the

originally a licensed by um the British authorities to sail forth as a private tier\nI'm against the French enemy\nBut also to hunt down a pirates who were praying on English ships um ... what happens

Ottoman Empire as it collapses come all must stop other becomes what we call remembers auditor\nWho transformed a theocracy headed by the sultan end up paying all the vast strictures of sharia\nTranslates that transfers that into them what we now understand as a modern state of mixed up\nA secular and uh profane and what we have here secular and temporal\nLobe what we have here is also in and out of view through the Navy's eyes of what this period a man to the people who live there and this is their memory now a hundred years later and the massacre of the Christians remains controversial\nRather than just talk about the Armenians I Want to go to what is known as the punch is this is the north\nEastern part of what we now see is turkey\nAh the coastline and the interior punches this were a lot of Greek Christians lived and the navy gets involved because they make regular calls along the coast slide\nAnd Bob did the navy know that these massacres or this brutality towards the Greek was underway how why did they respond to this how did they get involved\nIn the navy or what does not know about that they weren't happening originally the or\nThe or a lady had a ... ships which then visited a couple of the two the two port city is on the major port cities on the northern coast to turkey travels on an ... soon or in ... soon was closest you could get to a ship to actually get in a two\nAnd a modern agra or you had to still take a trip a shovel days to get there but that was the way you could in fact you have any contact with um\nThe nice Los to set up shop there so after a while a breast or had a hit ships um a visit and visited for a couple of weeks at a time and then transferred to another ship so we always had somebody in that in a port and nothing was happening originally but eventually the ship captain began to report to ramble brushed all\nThe information they'd found from the other people in the city of Americans and the other um and British and Turks about the uh the up deportations to the interior that were taking place there [noise]\nUm the and the death marches and also the massacres were taking place whereby the um whereby the ... were trying to get rid of\nThe uh I'm a I'm a difficulty in their in their back regions of all these people who were ethnic Greeks and they thought they might be a kind of a a a a threat to them as they fought LSD Greeks out in the middle of a turkey\nSo they were at war with grace and they just trusted the people who were Greek who lived\nOn the punches and they evacuated them or they for some of accusation and that was what you present plenty of evidence that that was a cover up for the fact that this was a massacre ongoing and it was what we would call and the twenty first century an ethnic cleansing is that an appropriate term for this\nI suppose so it's also called the Greek genocide and what they were kept in a shovel stages this was the last stage of it a and a yes or certainly that was what it appears that general who was in charge was a very brutal man he apparently been sent by Mustafa come out to um\nTo uh take charge and two are in fact a pacify the whole area and he regarded that is to get rid of all the middlemen military age normally by massacre and then to send the others\nAre women children old man a inland on deportations to the interior a but in fact uh these deportations turn out to be massive death marches\nUh this information was reported back to admiral Bristol now the controversy here is did the admiral follow the anecdotes see he was just\nDid the opinion that the Armenian massacres was one sided I Believe he wanted to follow the idea that this was a civil war and that both sides were committing ... but when he's being told about these evacuations in the ... and that they're associated with a ... a a ... the auditors that nationalist does he believe it\n[noise] um he actually did he was eventually forced to believe it eventually says I think he said he is quoted as saying and one of his letters I saw one of his letters where he says\nI think there's no question that they have that the Turks have wiped out all the villages throughout the region and sent that people inland uh there's no question that eventually he did and part of the reason for that was to destroy our captains who put it to him and the most from way that if we don't do something will be like the Germans during\nWorld War one in which they said nothing about what was happening to say the Armenians\nRight so there's a wonderful story you tell about the conscience Carl come in from Canada\nThe Greek women and children and families are running in the middle of the night they can hear the screaming they hear the burning of these towns where they live but\nThe Americans and they're often they're missionaries are teachers at colleges stay inside their compounds they know not to get out they hear shooting and people come over the wall and they're given shelter by the Americans that Compton's help one Greek family a lot of families disappear into the\nUh into the interior and they don't know whether they've been killed or whether they've gotten away successfully but I think you're right the sixty years later the Compton's heard when one of the family members Ruth I think she died and they heard from the family and they got a letter ... were you able to contact the family who wrote the Compton Bob\nI Know I was not able to but uh certainly they had always treasured\nAh the Compton's because they had help them survive many
