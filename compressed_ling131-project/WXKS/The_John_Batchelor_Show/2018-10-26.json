to the mid term the twenty Eighteen mid term which is the focus of every cable TV show every radio show the talks politics and certainly all of members of Congress and the White House and former\nOccupants of the White House and former members of Congress Victor a very good evening to you we're going to your article\nIn the national Review Online about the camera vans because there's a report of a second caravan forming up and about what this means for the midterm but I Want to stop\nAnd know that all day long and yesterday we have information about possible explosive devices it's incomplete information ... is at this point not reliable to take any one report and put it together another one and add things up\nI Do have an incomplete ap report tonight that the white powder mentioned earlier in the news cycles\nI Believe associated with John Brennan is not dangerous or is not what is presumed to be dangerous that would reach back to the anthrax I Do have a possible incomplete report that one of the couriers if not the courier\nHas been found on a video surveillance ... these are all very very vague not nailed down not Reuters not a pie nothing I count on but they're floating in all the time and we have to deal\nOften before elections with incomplete information so a very good evening to you how do you measure the possible explosive devices in comparison to the genuine we can see it on video caravans for the optics of these last days good even if you picture\nGood evening well so far all we know are incomplete reports and the substances seem to be in ... the bombs don't seem to be\nPractical and its before mid term so there's a chance to these incidents can be leverage politically but we don't want to rush to judgment and then connect rhetoric with fact and\nI had somebody says something them if the cause and effect means that these bombs means something but in the case for the care of and we have hard concrete visual evidence that uh if those people from Honduras were able to come ... walk across Mexico and craft the U.S border and would do it with impunity\nAnd we really wouldn't have citizenship sovereignty or the idea of nation for that anymore it's terrible optics for Democrats were progressive that may support that when they know that\nThe majority of American people don't and it sort of a replay of but Elizabeth Warren DNA video and the Kavanaugh demonstration for the Kavanaugh hearing from so they're just they're in an echo chamber and they think that resonates with the base but most people don't like about instability and they don't like the lawlessness and all those\nIncidents were connected by either they're lawless or there's no truth or ... to them\nWe have a report from the Pentagon that Secretary Mattis has approved additional military forces to the border\nI can guess that they're going to move quickly the military does when given an order or is this necessary picked or are we exposed and Ken the border patrol not handle seven thousand I've heard the number of fourteen thousand because Mexico is a very large country or at the border we can handle it we need troops\nOr we may because it it sort of confirms Trump's argument that a war would be as they always are through history but they work and had we at war right now it would deter people from coming\nAnd again if people come in think of how it erodes the idea of liberal bloggers people waiting years to come legally for a green card come as refugees they're put on hold people who break the wall and they look you know when you look at the visual imagery it looks like fifty or sixty Seventy percent or\nMales and nobody seems to be starving and they're in a large country of Spanish speaking country with similar cultures if they really want to flee an extra central threat in Honduras they might want to seek refuge in Mexico but they want to come to the United states\nAnd again it's a disconnect for the American public because they're ... they hear so many complaints against the United states but it's racist that its neighbor native is that it's been a phobic those on welcoming and yet people seem to ignore all that and think it's a pretty good place to come\nAnd they can't get the story straight whether or not a very envy Glazer were very unbelievable to the extent that fourteen thousand or so people would want a march over Fifteen hundred mile and break the law to come here and then continue to break the law by a residing here unlawfully\nOptics Victor I'm cautious about this but I'm puzzling about coincidences\nAre the Democrats saw that they pulled very well during the summer\nAnd the controversy about separation of families at the border those were\nA ... and people looking to crash the boarder who were there they didn't they they did not represent something that could happen in weeks they were immediately a problem and the separation ran all summer brand for weeks in fact I think it ran right up to Capitol\nNow we have with week to go another caravan marching from Central America toward the border it looks to be a re creation of the original a conversation about what do we do with people at the border and now we have these\nAre possible explosive devices delivered to celebrities or Democrats are celebrity Democrats\nDo both look to you to be see trickle in some fashion ... and and arranged in a way that points wouldn't make sense without the mid term\nI think everybody's pretty cynical that any spectacular event whether bad or good or sensational\nThat occurs right before the midterm there's always a suspicion that someone or some thing\nIs prompting that and there's a political motive to what I think in the case of the curve and it's clear that\nAnd the real clear politics politics average a favorability Crumpet dropped about five point once children were seen on TV separated from their parents were undergoing\nTrial or detention so I think people are in the international after the domestic left or the foreign left thought that if these people cross the border there would be those scenes right around election time about what to do what it did in July and hurt the Republicans particularly in the Trump supporter brown\nUm it was like you said a very joyful time there um I find very few protesters actually John which was interesting that a lot of people the Donny nose red cat and a lot of people just really enjoying the performance the president put on\nOr did they use the I Know I I have not seen photographs did they use the long ramp walking or did he come from behind the crowd usually there's music playing and he appears applauding which what what how is his entrance\nSo he he walked down the ramp from ... hair for what they love that rap few of them yes\nIt was it was quite the performance and it did remind me of rallies I've seen on TV before um so I think I think he definitely has a bath that that he stands by 'em but it was a lot of fun and people are very excited\nAt what point does he leaves the script defeat was ever on script could you tell\nYeah yeah you could definitely tell so um so I you know John recently there had been the it's a kind of suspicious bomb packages I'm On Democrats doorstep right because of that Trump was pretty on scratch that first got the beginning\nUm other rally and he he really wanted to make clear that it's his job to keep Americans safe and even though this is a Democrat and he cares a lot about finding out who did this and wants to bring justice so he is very clear about that in the beginning\nUh but then as soon as he started going and you uh\nUh the Wisconsin rallies you know the content elections themselves an issue that stake here he certainly went off script and with having a lot of the crowd was certainly feeding off of the reactions just getting a and with you know people are doing that the typical chance and the media today has\nFocused for some reason on this lock her up chants that they're claiming people were uh\nYou know chanting for ... a lot of this rally and honestly Don I Can't I actually think of when this when this can't happen like I Can't recall it my recollection of of this whole event though with a very quick chance and maybe a small group of people that did it at at one time but um it's certainly strange to me that in a headline why\nWell let's let's think out loud Corey let's think out loud I Can't I Can't be certain but let's think out loud in terms of what we do a deal of reporting is getting clicks these days correct I mean you you want people to come to your website or your social media page or to re tweet\nYour remarks and and the people of Wisconsin are wonderful and the people of northern Wisconsin I've been to Milwaukee I've been to Green Bay I've been to Madison but I've never been north to this wonderful place most any All right but I'm going to presume that there aren't as many people to click and most any\nAs there are in Manhattan I'm just going to guess that affect us\nI think that athletes ... alright alright\nSo lock her up because the it's controversial and edgy\nAnd refers to a part of the president's campaign this is\nA during twenty six gene when he was um using aggressive rhetoric against his opponent Mr Clinton lock her up has become a way of demonstrating that the president hasn't changed at all in two years and if you're going to lead with the headline about most in the I'm guessing\nYou wouldn't leave with a headline about how the crowd was entertain 'cause that would people have most any clicking on that you ... you would leave with lock her up is that a fair gas\nI think that's a fair guys I think also I just sitting on the ground observation lock her up with kind of you ingest almost like this is like a a thing like the Internet and you're going to say it there was one guy but it doesn't really when I was talking on the crowd is that it was a smile and it was almost like I'm not a Trump rally I'm gonna make this joke but it wasn't it wasn't talking about Hillary by any chance\n... law let's let's let's remind everyone who's never who's been to a Trump rally your memory of it being happy is correct and let's be who've never been to one I attended the president's speech at the pack in February\n... okay it is it is a ... he's chiefly a performer he's absolutely\nAnd people were just so excited I mean though so John that there's this long long line right to get through security and to the end to the rally right and you walk across the biggest field and here there's a small tarmac at the airport but there's this large field right alliance winding\nThen everybody's in a good mood and the crowd and blowing up carefully and it it's sort of like a fourth of July picnic where everybody's waiting for the hotdogs\nOh absolutely and everybody's Wagner either Trump gear and they're selling Trump here and there is\nAnd again played and to the song there are a bunch of you know American American bombs being played on but then there is also like\nUh we are the champions little rocky kind of song need expect from Trump um but it was it was a lot of fun absolutely and the American flags everywhere\nWhat did he say about Wisconsin about the political race in Wisconsin Governor Walker I see is hard pressed and\nUh the reelection for Tammy Baldwin according to the media I'm reading and you know you read what you can post or a guessing game say that Baldwin is comfortable and her lead so how did the president responded Walker and ...

Elliott did you think that this this will continue and whether we'll be able to interview of the fact that we see the the partisanship so enhanced in and and\nAs well as the some of it and especially when you have to admit on the Democratic left extreme is coming in who do not share their views you just described about the U.S relationship with Israel and and the steps against Iran\n[noise] well I you know again I think we have a good case to make for everybody and I'm going to continue to make that case I mean I I I think that um that that Israel is the only democracy in the middle east um you know they get to pick their leaders we don't get to pick their leaders that they get to pick their leaders\nAnd um I think that the relationship has always been strong and we're going to work to keep it stronger than ever\nAnd do you think there'll be bipartisan support for the sanctions on Iran that are upcoming will be necessary and\nTougher LA it we can ... we have to have a plan B because Iran is a bad actor\nIran is is is a bad actor and um you know that's one of the reasons why we you have worked\nOr with with Saudi Arabia although obviously what's coming out of Saudi Arabia now is very very difficult to to fathom with a with the er the killing of the mystic us cause so Jay I'm it really\nDoes make things difficult you've got to members of Congress who have been long supporters of Saudi Arabia\nLike Lindsey Graham who now have changed their minds because we\nWere very unhappy with what we see so I mean one of the things that were in through the years is that things things shift and of course in the middle east\nThings changed pretty quickly but I think what what needs to never changes a strong bond between the U.S in Israel and I and I will say that you know a President Obama had differences with a with a run as you point out\nBut when it came to a to helping Israel with with with funding um he was right there and we've always had a uh for the past twenty or Thirty years we've always had a both presidents from both sides of\nThe aisle bipartisan he won the the\nRelationship and that's really what I Want I Want to say and that's what we did again the foreign affairs committee and it doesn't mean we never had a different differences of opinion but we did it respectfully and we were able to always compromise so we were able to come out I remember there was one sanctions bill during the December twenty Thirteen\n[noise] and we passed unanimously out of the foreign affairs committee or that people like Tea Party people from the ... from the right all the

or second or third time you hit it you come to them but they do in fact threaten the United states this is Latin America and Hezbollah that's right you've learned correctly Hezbollah is a terrorist organization that dominates\nThe middle east dominates Lebanon dominates all of the characters it touches bug where does it get its money how does it function does it Rob banks well in a way\nA professor a very good evening to you has bull law and Latin America how do they go together where is the relationship good evening to you\nAnd good evening to you and thanks for having me\nHas ... has been a a active in Latin America for nearly four decades ever since\nIts inception it has a made sure that uh she a Lebanese expatriate communities that exist in Latin America I mean deep in other places in the world like West Africa like the far east\nUm and the institutions that serve these communities are loyal to the cause\nA and by by making sure that these communities remain committed to supporting Hezbollah they'd been leverage to communities to engage\nA at the very least can fund raising and often times and that's especially the case and left America engage in that type of elicit financial activities that raise\nFunds for the organization now in Latin America would be most profitable economic activity unfortunately today is trafficking in cocaine\nThem the margins of profits are huge\nAnd the cartels which are you know like spending their reach everywhere across the globe are as society is so far and wide increasingly consumed vast quantities of cocaine cartels needs\nA allies of the global level that can help them transport the merchandise to this and markets Sally\nAnd then ... the money in a way that it looks legitimate and that's where Hezbollah comes in Hezbollah has been helping the cartels\nTransferring distribute their cocaine globally striking deals with organized crime all over the globe and he has also used the network of communities\nIn order to um\n... the money to the cartels Federal Trade based money laundering schemes that of course in the process because ... gets\nA hefty commission as payment for services all of this money goes to fund its activities in the middle east and um you know conservative assessments suggest\nThat all of the roughly one billion dollar a year budget that has ... has at the very least three hundred million that he's thirty percent of its budget does not come from Iranian contributions that comes from\nThese type of illicit activity so it's extremely significant and that means the butler is an ally and uh you know a very significant contribution\nTo the disaster a of organized crime that he's wrecking societies eating societies\nAnd within in Latin America corrupting their systems are and the and the proceeds also pushing up immigrants are and and crime uh all the way up to our border\nBut the seems to me to be a a conflict in in the way we respond to what do you sew excellently summarized we how we got to where we are today in the in especially significant I think today the president signed the ...\nInternational finance prevention act that was passed by Congress or\nI think last week the final authorization that allows the executive to go after both ... members in the\n... their financial facilitators yet at the same time and I like you to comment on that but at the same time project Cassandra which appear to be a success was launched ten years ago to to a counter as well as growth\nOutside in the middle east and yet despite the science of success that it was shuttered end to end the whole team dispersed how how do you account for this appearing instead of this apparent contradiction\n[laughter] well the thing is that uh you know the the uh the the the successful endeavor project Cassandra uh was in the shots or a um but that was under the previous administration and he was part and parcel of a political vision that suggested that\nUh the United states need to see could the tones with Iran a across the board or that included the going after his ball lined up in America and other places where it was below us involved in criminal activities\nIncidentally involved I'm standing down and not getting a you know not not standing up for values and interests of the United states in Syria and other things and and that approach to Iran which caused the end of project Cassandra\nWent away with the end of the Obama administration here you have another a new administration which has created a task force or in January twenty Eighteen to look into um the reasons why\nAre you know what happened with project Cassandra and try to revive it and that only a few weeks two weeks ago has announced the creation of a task force to calm but transnational organized crime it has listed five\nA top priority is among organized criminal cartels into world that pose a direct threat to the national interest of the United states has ... is one of them and now passes this you know signs this legislation to rule\nThere by a acquiring new very powerful tools to go after not just has below members and their activities but to go after globally\nAll those government officials and businesses that facility has bottomless illicit fine so the question now is whether the Trump Administration will turn the task force has has established\nA against Hezbollah financing the task force against transnational crime and the legislation that Congress passed into a real policy that will\nHit as ... hertz across the globe and that's what we're hoping for\nWe have thirty seconds to how long can we wait before we know whether there's a positive or negative to that question you just asked\nThe president has me or rather the attorney general has given the task force Ninety Days to come up with a policy and concrete steps so we should know soon whether this is just an exercise in rhetoric or if it is a concrete effort to put back together cause you to sound or something similar to it\nTo go effective after Hezbollah using the whole panoply of public policy tools that US government has to dispose\nProfessor Emanuel out

welcome Ted Frank the director of litigation at the Competitive Enterprise Institute\nWho was about to make a case standing before the Supreme Court about an issue that you've all heard of class action suit what you didn't know and I learned from Ted now\nIs that class action suit benefits the law firms bringing them but in the case of very large class action suit such as a recent one against Google the actually offended parties get almost nothing if nothing at all\nThis is a twenty first century version of ambulance chasing to my to my ... eyes she had a very good evening to uh this is a revelation to me that law firms are in the business\nOf chasing class action suits not to share it with the offended or harmed or litigants but to in fact cut it up for themselves or directed in some fashion or two powers of their wishes which is nice Seventeen struck nine sixty one Frank versus ... you're the Frank\nYou're arguing on Halloween to do with a federal rule of civil procedure about class action suits wear ... according to the quote that you provided to me where so doing is quote superior to other available methods for fairly unofficially adjudicating the controversy [noise]\nThe question before the court is whether or and what circumstances\nA sigh press that trust law doctrine award of class action proceeded to provide no direct relief to class members supports class certification and comports with a requirement that a settlement binding class members must be fair and reasonable an adequate my image or translation is\nThey're going to decide whether it's okay for the law firms to get everything and the litigants or offended part is to get nothing what is your presentation to the court ... good evening to\nThank you thank you for having me the presentations the court is a before a court can approve the settlement under the rules of civil procedure it how to make a finding that it's charitable inadequate\nAnd it's not fair and reasonable by definition of the attorneys are getting all the money in the class is getting nothing and trying to hide that the classes getting nothing by steering money to third parties in this case the attorney it's ... it's an alumni donation using the classes money basically\nA doesn't make an unfair settlement fair the\nParticular case if I follow correctly and jet is my guide here I'm just reading is Google\nGoogle offending a the the class action team because it took advantage of privacy restrictions and didn't adequately\nFollow or provide information to those using it now we all use Google so we're all in on this and the estimate of the New York times article right up and this is we're all due for sense that's not going to happen because\nIt's inefficient so therefore the eight point five million dollars or portions up\nEntirely to the law firm is that right cat\nIt goes to a law firm and then a basically a slush fund of a ... organization that the law firms and and Google wanted the money to go to a and you know these are suit alleging violations of federal law and if they knew\nThe violation of a class number with the title to a thousand dollars so that clearly didn't think they could actually proof is because they settle it for us you know force them to class member man we're not asking for the force but you have this eight million dollar pot of money and you can\nFind a way to distribute it to class members the reality is\nThese notices in the mail and and you could make the pot of money available to people who filed claims to get the notices and say yes I Want my share of that eight million dollars and the reality are so few people ask for the money you could distribute five or six dollars per climate\nRight I I've had these notifications over the years because of the end of certain companies that I purchased or the companies of went on a business because they sold out and they send me this document saying you're part of a class action suit and I say I don't want anything to do with it so I run away from it\nAnd and that's what most people do a lot so it's possible to get money to the class if they actually want to write a they just didn't want to do that because they'd rather see the money go to their own\nAnd the four and the court in this case this is the Ninth Circuit court that's a pretty big court at that out west they dominate the west the Ninth Circuit court isn't going to apply the law firms at issue and you you give me their names one's in San Francisco not theory and John or young and the others in Colorado camera law\nThose law firms are not required by the federal government to make good to all the injured parties couldn't they do that isn't that imaginable\nIt it is and that's what other circuits have done with one case in the seventh circuit in the ... circuit and the third circuit\nWhere the court says look the the attorneys have if I Do share a duty to their clients to get the money to the clients first if you set up the legal rules like the Ninth Circuit did that the attorneys get paid no matter what well of course the attorneys are going to prefer to give it to a charity the Senate wants because then the defendant will say okay\nWe can get two million dollars to class or for a million dollars to our favorite charity and the attorneys say will give the four million you don't give the money to the class give it to your favorite charity and then we can get a larger attorney\nNow this is Google right Google were all have Google Google had easily communicate with all of us what do you want to do with your four cents John and that could give me boxes to check off you know the red cross or the ASPCA\nOr a protecting a wild habitat they could do that and the law firm could direct Google to do that that's not that's not a painful remedy do you agree ...\nWell I mean there there's a reason they don't do that and that's because if they told the class members hey you can make a claim for a five dollar check or you can check this box and you could give it to my alma mater a ... everybody's going to demand there five dollars right there they're not or they're not going to make a claim at all\nUm they're not going to say I want the money to go to my lawyers favorite charity\nIf if I Want five dollars and go to charity or I can write a five dollar check to charity or or bigger ... ... um ... it but it it's that the lawyers are are are trying to not give consumers that choice and they don't want to because the consumers would want the money\nIs this a well known problem cat has this been going on for a long time it's sort of a deal between lawyers in courts and we're all ignorant of it\nUh I mean it's been an increase in the big problem uh and it's going to get even bigger if the Supreme Court doesn't act or this year a another nine million dollars and it was a small class it was only a billion people it would have been and they had everybody's address what you would have been really easy to just bail everybody a check without\nEven asking them to check a box\nIs it because we have too many lawyers and not enough work is just because of the lawyers in India who are doing jobs on line is there is some crisis and I didn't know about Ted we've got about a minute\nAh I it's just we have the rules in place and judges aren't enforcing those rules because [noise] the the the attorneys have the incentive to to\nMaximize their own attorney says\nIf you're in a class action suit you can do something you know ask you for your for censor your five dollars at the law firm as and say what
