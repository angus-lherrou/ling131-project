Gordon Chang the Daily Beast we're joined by Allentown pa new blogs that reality check\nA Allen is our guide on trade especially manufacturing trade especially the concerns that the Trump Administration and many have in the union with China taking American Jobs and also dominating American workplace with\nSubsidized good we know now there is an event coming up to seven seven December to non December in Shanghai, China it's ... it's called the ... Shanghai, Shanghai new international expo center in Shanghai, China is described as a three day event\nHeld at the Shanghai new international expo center event will focused on the accessories suppliers finish productions meth production manufacturers trade companies and vapor shops online retailers brand buyers famous media is a cat academics\nFamous players and individual consumers and east takes industry in other words a grab bag of material manufactured in China to be sold in the United states exported from China to the United states Gordon is this the event that is at issue about the United states attending or not if I got it right\nYes the United states is not sending a delegation to this event this event primarily intended to encourage 'em countries to export to China and ... number of people are starting to say that our refusal to go is basically hurting us business\nI say that it's part of I think a very powerful messaging on the part of the Trump Administration by saying we're trying to disengage from China even if it hurts us in the short term\nAnd by saying we're willing to take this pain in the short term um were telling the Chinese that everything they think about the weakness of the American political system is wrong they cannot manipulate the administration that the administration intends to separate us from China and if you're an export dominated economy like China that's a chilling message John\nSo this is about China incur a encouraging act it imports into ... that's what this is about propaganda\nA vent yeah and that's what they are that's the way that they're building it and they're getting the Europeans and everybody else to go there sending delegation\nPutting and are tending their an import economy as opposed to the facts which is that there are entirely and export model\n[laughter] yeah I think they're doing this to try to dampen down a trade tensions and to try to build a coalition against the United states\nAllan uh you have a watch very carefully these years and now it's the second year of the Trump Administration dealing with China what is your measure up the you know us not attending a Potemkin trade show by the pie LA\nJohn Potemkin trade show is exactly right\nBecause as Gordon put China is anything but an import friendly economy whatever propaganda they're trying to put out and what I Would add to Gordon's very trenches analysis here is that it's especially promising this move\nIf it indicates that the Trump Administration is moving away from it stated hope\nIs that the trade war that it's conducting with China um he's going to succeed primarily if it ends up persuading shining to open up markets to us and other foreign competition\nAnd play fair and treated exports are from\nEverywhere else in the world just like a treats Chinese made goods that is a noble am it's certainly been the standard boilerplate\nFor us trade policy for the entire world for about for at least Thirty years probably longer but with China it's especially misguided because the Chinese have no intention of opening or keeping\nMarkets open to foreign competition one moment longer than they absolutely have to wonder what I mean by that is\nChina recognizes that there were still good it's critical to its economic development that it needs to secure from overseas but once it's managed to steal the relevant intellectual property once it's managed\nConduct the appropriate reverse engineering um that foreign product then the company that makes it gets chewed up and spit out Gordon\nAllen so what we're really talking about is the Trump Administration are encouraging companies to move their supply chains out of China\nAnd of course uh once that occurs then um the u._s. is certainly much less dependent on the Chinese economy because we hear a lot of people say and and they're absolutely right\nThat the two economies are intertwined but if there are no longer intertwined that has all sorts of implications not only am a trade area but also of course across the spectrum of our relations with Beijing so I agree with you or if that's what the Trump Administration is trying to do and it appears that that's the direction they're going\nThen we have got a watershed moment in American history and that we're actually looking at an entirely different relationship with China going forward\n[noise] that's right and I would only hope that the Trump Administration if indeed this is it's a shame and I do think it is but I Would only hope that the administration would make the aim explicit\nBecause this is this drive to reduce American engagement with with the Chinese economy that that's ... that's in fact contrary to the conventional wisdom completely incompatible whether this Dr has of course run into tremendous resistance at home here in in the U.S\nAnd it's going to be crucial to overcoming that resistance for the president to explain the stakes the longer term stakes to the American people in a reasonably comprehensive way and we haven't had that yet and I think that's a really important missing element to the administration's China strategy\nAllen have you heard anecdotes about a slow down here because of the tension with China\n[noise] do you hear a lot of anecdotes but certainly you're not seeing it in the economic data or whatever and uh I grew up being taught that that data trumps anecdotes any time a and in particular we've I mean we've had several months\nOf steel tariffs much less time with China specific tariffs but several months with steel and aluminum tariffs and it's clear Isabel from every major data series that the American government been puts out\nThat not only are those industries that use steel and that and that usually with him not being harmed by these towers yet they're actually out performing the rest of manufacturing in most respects\nGarden [noise] Alan I'm you know we've had a number of discussions about whether manufacturing it's come back to the U.S and I'm a bit more optimistic than you are um but what does the data say\n... paid staff rich worked at the DNC was a young I Am very able and sophisticated

O. Y. A. request has turned up from the NSA that there's\nA link in some fashion with documents we do not have between ... now the allegation and twenty six team that I Believe Russia to get is still working with is that the documents and the DNC servers were hacked by Russian professionals ... chiefly cozy bad the G argue\nThat those documents were passed to Julian Assange to embarrass weekend in some fashion under caught Mrs Clinton's campaign\nDoes that that does that that information also connects to the fact that crowd strike was called in by the DNC this is a\nA cyber security firm and crowds dry took possession of all of those servers all of that hardware and software and told us that it was fancy Baron ... that ... what is what is crowd strike what are we learned about crowd strike\nSo crowds strikes founder Dimitri ... is uh basically comes out of the Ukrainian Jewish family a very much anti Russian [noise]\nUm what what's fascinating is that the ... nobody in the federal government the federal law enforcement agency has been able to get access to the survivors the coup inclusion that it was fancy Baron that it was rushing is based entirely upon the work the crowd strike did there was a big problem with the work the crowd strike yet\nThey started work on the seventh of may they if they did their work right to should've come\nIn and one twenty sixteen don't have that may twenty six teams after the report and exhausting cracked the reporter that look as\nThey were doing things properly they would have come in turned off all of the computers and installed new software and and get everybody knew passwords which would have broken the the the the the linked to a hacker if there was a hacker\nBut what happened is the emails were actually downloaded on the twenty fifth of may and now we know from an article that appeared in Esquire Magazine in two thousand six to ... that crowd strike that not shut off the computers\nUntil June tenth and did not start installing software to that weekend of June tenth\nOr this is just laughable because they claimed that they knew that there was a Russian hacking going on as early as may yet did nothing to stop it that then gets taken the last the last day of the emails that appear on the wiki leaks\nAh archive is the twenty fifth of may so you've got to raise the question of what in the world was cross strike doing but on top of that then we have the analysis that was done by Bill Binnie who is the former technical director of the national Security Agency\nThe bill is a is a true genius in this area and he he was able to take the meta data that appeared it's recorded on June fourteenth third June fifteenth that's all it by the name of goose or for two point oh surfaces\nGood for for a to point no claims to have these documents and in fact both crowds strike and Robert Mueller the special\nCounsel have all pointed to goose or as proof that it's Russia because they look at the stylistic parts of the medical data such as language usage build it and look at style he looked at simple math and science there is a transfer rate and you know how fast information can be transferred over the Internet if it's a hack buys\nHow fast it could be transferred if you put it onto a thumb drive\nWhat he discovered was the transfer rape that's in the ... of the documents with goose your for two point oh put up with Robert Mueller claims is proof that it's Russia in fact could not be transferred over the Internet it could only are corrupt or transfer a download it onto a\nPhone call right we've established a very important ... questions now about Seth Rich about Julian Assange about crowd strike about the DNC surfer\nWe've also developed information most recently that crowd strike was a was a firm that was connected to the Democratic committee and was represented by a man named ...\nWho was in a ... who is an attorney for ... Perkins quiet now subsequently identified as the firm that hired Glenn Simpson in fusion GPS\nIn order to create the dusty against Donald Trump\nWe also know that that's been represented crowd strike\nSo crowds tried being called in is entirely consistent with the DNC he's\nA law firm ... but it also raises the question as to why the FBI was not provided access to those server sometime in may and June it never has had access so we we ... we can answer that question\nWhat what you presented here Larry is that the questions that we presume these last two years were answered were not answered adequately or there are possibilities that haven't been explored is that all correct\nThat is very ... there was a part of like concern on this was motivated by the excellent our you spent with Steve Cohen last night\nBecause it highlights that we have tried to portray Russia is this great enemy perpetrating some tremendous fraud against us and yet it's not based on a shred\nOf actual credible evidence it's based on manufactured evidence and particularly if you look at the documents they point to as quote evidence that it was the Russians it has such clumsy fingerprints on it that it it's deliberately design to leave trademarks and fingerprints and\nA and elements to point to Russia well new intelligence\nOutfit worth its salt\nConducts an operation like that particularly the Russians and yet we've we've turned the Russians are intelligence outfit into a subject to a clown show and are are accusing them of something that was putting the ferries when in fact it looks like what happened is Seth Rich who had his own motivations he was a Bernie Sanders supporter I'm told\nAnd he was at odds with a couple of his bosses at the DNC had every reason in the world\nTo doubt ... alright again we open questions that I presume have been answered joined us Taj Seth Rich crowd strike Dimitri a pair of itch or the ... law firm\nAlso the question of the Russia investigation Mr Mahler we do not provide answers we do have the fact that\nThe NFL has documents that certainly were not available and twenty sixteen or twenty Seventeen to to open these questions again Larry Johnson a ex CIA acts State Department and my colleague I'm John bachelor this is the John ...\n[noise]\nShows me [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nThe unemployment rate is that a forty eight year low most people\nThey want to work are working if you're trying to fill open positions that your business you'll have to find your next candidate from the currently employed I heart media can help you spread the word to Ninety two percent of the U.S population that's right Ninety two percent use this radio station defined your next employee driving to or sitting at\nTheir current job you'll have your pick of the most qualified candidates for any position you have available we can help to go to I heart works dot com that's I hard work dot com\nI her radio now makes it even easier to listen to all your favorite podcast no need for another half of all the biggest needs and podcast and can be found in the car radio out\nThousands of NPR's\nJust added ESPN thirty thirty five cats and big names like Ben Shapiro self worth your time comedian marked man Joe Rogan\nYears now your favorite radio out can be your neighbor get them downloaded open the ... radio out into the pot cafes have\nTo start exploring fought students you home for conservative family Boston Ninety four five nobody gee I managed to keep on talking twelve hundred and I hardly radio station [noise]\nAnother package just like the others ...

I've been really a quite aggressive in ... years and there's been on certain the in East Asia in Taiwan included\nAbout whether America would do something about so I think this has been helpful and reassuring those who bought the line that the Trump Administration was very transactional on trade and might be ignoring the south China Sea and China's territorial aggression\nDave is there a concern in Taipei about a miscalculation or accident that could lead to an escalation and these episodes where warships traveling at high speeds on the open seas could misunderstand or miss direct like that incident with a Decatur\n[noise] oh I think the answer to that it yes but mostly military circles I find that concern that the greatest military circles in Taiwan but also a military circles with us on the Pacific command particular they will also have\nSomewhat of a concern about miscalculation on the Chinese part and we've lived with some of these miscalculations in the not too distant asked to in terms of the air maneuvers that led to the the three crisis severely Bush administration and some of the\nThe sea bass confrontations we have but in Taiwan generally I think the biggest concern is that the U.S becomes either distracted by or an ... with its dealings with China\nAnd Taiwan just becomes a on that is lost in that match Gordon\nSteve you know if you go back in the last year which is the first year of the Trump Administration um you get a sense that the president and the national security team around him in Washington really weren't quite sure what to do with China and it did look at some points that they were willing to to do with China over a number of things including North Korea\nThis year um there's a very different tone that I sense and you're in Washington and I'm not\nBut I I get a sense that the administration decided that it is going to disengage from China and obviously that has implications for Taiwan I mean do you read the mood in Washington the same way or do you see in somewhat different tones\nOh I think there's contending use in Washington and within the administration to a degree of president seems very clear that he is simultaneously open to a deal but very firm on trying to reset the context in which that deal with the ...\nAnd certainly in the run up to the ... the mid term election and probably his reelection at twenty twenty\nI Would put a very low the odds of some kind of a grand deal on trade or security ... have you are but as you know he has said an intention to consider another meeting with Kim Jong un and the north Korea negotiations could go and very unpredictable ways\nBut for the most part I think Washington was very much in the warm bath conventional thinking on China for so\nLong that it's been unsettled by what I was I think articulated by vice president Pence of the kind of bill of particulars of the many ways China has upset the status quo and the administration's determinations or respond but\nThey haven't really detail how they'll respond and that seems to be to talk of Washington and now\nI Do not recall the Obama administration or the or the Bush administration sending two warships instead the Taiwan Strait for sixteen hours perhaps you can recall for me but does this mean that the Trump Administration is seeking to embrace the defense of Taiwan\nWell I think\nThat Secretary Mattis has been very very clear about the deterrent message he has conveyed I think you're right in terms of the precedent in terms of as as far as the transit the talent straight go in close proximity\nI but this I think has more to do with freedom of navigation and the claims in the south China Sea than it does just the Taiwan Strait a and there are strong thing said going back to the tourists and confirmation hearing as a matter of affirmation hearing\nAbout the south China Sea and this is the first time we've seen I think a systemic and to liberate rushed back of the Chinese and it happens to

people put their money to work and that creates the conditions for the rest of us to work I welcome Jenny Trapp\nJenny is going to tell me what a family offices here in the twenty first century been

from investments to a steak bending philanthropy for instance in Dallas this week or next week\nWe have a a very well for somebody to talking about marrying into money not think how sensitive that

I'm going to let them go easily\nAfter all they've got this enormous amount of money right so you would offer the difference between a family office and a private bank or or a private equity firm let's quickly to find that what's a level for a private off for a for a family office to work what level of of wealth so that different levels in\nDifferent places I Would say roughly in many would argue about that but probably north of a hundred million dollars is a single family all single family which means is that like you hear like the ... it's a single a group of people that fourth only for you in that if my name is gates I have a family right right right\nAnd then I Would say between tend to a hundred maybe twenty two hundred is the heightened it with individuals\nUh I like the old shrine that's within two to tend to think of themselves and they would normally work with the moves\nThat from a multi family office which works the same way but it's a group of unrelated people who have a team working for them right they work with different families that don't that doesn't justify for them to hire an entire team by themselves [noise]\nThe family offices are extremely desirable I read from the point of view of IPO's or start ups Israel is a startup nation the U.S here has a few start ups every once in a while our family offices attracted to start a very\nVery much so these

invest in smaller companies they have a lot of liability than a lot of rules within that they need to uh operating somebody else's don't\nAnd the beautiful thing about some of the ...

to diversify the risks and they love the adventure they love to look at different kinds of tech related investments absolutely\nThe concern I have about family offices and where they're going now is the difference between here in New York and in Israel and in Europe I hear they're different tax structure of DNA I hear that around the world you have to know what you're doing the ... are people attracted to the U.S version of a family office as opposed to a European it's a good\nQuestion I think Europe is Mm all around the place you know just so many different cultures which is also a problem is probably number one culture wise they don't always seem to seem to don't agree\nAnd taxation that they come from different countries with different rules it makes it very hard for the call invest go invest meaning\nI Will instead of going to a fund I Will come to another family that the ... states and I don't do this that and that will join them in the roost investments and they will join meanwhile I'm good at let's say to college and then we'll take the middleman out and it's just us and we have the same objective\nBecause he owes so much of his presidency to that promise which he genuinely means that has has been trying to to accomplish in the last year and a half since he's been president he sticks so much of it on that if people are looking to him to followed through\nNow that we have this this this invasion marching through Mexico marching inexorably toward our southern border the president has now said that he is prepared to deploy the military to seal the border\nTo prevent this invasion from entering this raises a really profound\nQuestion John that has so far been unanswered when does the mob those foreigners used to storm our border become an invading army that within justify military action to retell it\nWe don't have an answer to that question get there is going to be a showdown because the president is serious about feeling the border and not allowing these people it will be authorized the use of lethal force what I what is going to happen with this\nCaravan this army of invaders get to the border we don't know that yet but we are now in an era of\nBob and this is what my column in the Washington Times about tomorrow because I call it Trump calls the bluff with the left wing mobbed [laughter] this caravan\nIs the latest Bob it's also the biggest of them all but we are now being bombarded by left wing mobs\nEvery where we look for in the Senate confirmation vote of Brett Kavanaugh\nCute social media to antifa mobs roaming our city streets to progressive gangs hounded elected officials where they live work and died vandalizing their offices and of course the biggest most most powerful Bob if the goal is the media\nIt's a virtual mob especially when it gangs up with entities like Facebook\nGoogle Twitter so we're looking at mobs and especially left wing mobs in every direction the president of the United states is doing his best John to fend off and I think when you're sitting the momentum move and a lot of these key races toward Republicans\nIt's because conservatives Republicans and independents and disaffected Democrats are all responding to the onslaught against this country\nBe mention of democratic Bob's takes me to buy you Monica always happy journey and Nineteen sixty eight August I'm Nineteen sixty eight which was a tumultuous months in world affairs the Soviets moved against\nUh Prague against Czechoslovakia surprising everyone of Vietnam was collapsing around the Johnson administration the peace talks were going nowhere in Paris\nAnd in Chicago a very large contingent of democratic activists we now call them progress has a ... word charge by the ... by the Chicago police and Mayor Daley was screaming at the podium in the Chicago convention hall during the nomination of\nA a Hubert Humphrey for ... president of the United states that wrecked the Democratic power so much so that Richard Nixon your mentor was elected ever since then Monica\nThe Democrats have not been happy about those events and have talked about how they never want that to happen again so how do we get here Monica having sworn it off in sixty eight why do we see these demonstrations in twenty Eighteen to they have no memory\nWell they haven't sworn it off and I write extensively about this in my column coming tomorrow and the Washington Times John ... thank you for giving me a chance to talk about it I write about how in the mid Nineteen sixties\nToo radical left wing professors Richard Klein word and friends in argued for accelerating the transition to socialism by overwhelming and then collapsing the social welfare system a few years after that ... the radical revolutionary\nTalked about destroying the capitalist democratic order\nBy what the ... humiliation and mockery and mirrors and yes mop\nFast forward John ... the great recession you went to hundreds of union and other thugs descending on bankers home\nThen after that you had the Occupy Wall Street Bob out there in the city streets committing violent crime and trafficking illegal drugs at desiccated on police cars\nIs what the radical far left does they manufacture may have designed to advance the progressive agenda but what they fail to understand or maybe they just don't care is that the United states is still a center right country and when these things happen as they are now\nWell you get a backlash because the great majority is ready to put his foot down yet again as it did in twenty sixteen and as it did yes in Nineteen sixty eight by electing Richard Nixon\nAnd in Nineteen Seventy two because we saw a repeat of it and stick in sixty Seventy two with George McGovern leading the progress of the Democrats so Monica we have a story here where the Republicans are responding\nAre inclined to Kavanaugh first and now the caravan is that enough conventional wisdom says the house goes for Mrs Pelosi the speaker perhaps by six plus six perhaps by plus sixteen and the\nSenate dais Republican and perhaps picks up to three or four seats are you comfortable with conventional wisdom\nI never comfortable with conventional wisdom remember John I came on this program what about twenty four hours after Donald Trump came down the escalator and\nAny fifty and schools me on though and I told you and I told you I Do not count him out right likely to be the nominee and the president right\nUm and I went against it every bit of conventional wisdom\nI have now said on this program and others that I Believe the Republicans will hold the house narrowly\nNarrowly but I think they will hold it and what first of all it was a gut instinct but now I'm really examining numbers among some key\nRaces in the house and those places collectively have narrowed they've tightened Republican intensity\nIs way up and we can attribute it to the eye for an invasion about to storm our border we can also attributed to having all the way he was treated and the left wing mobs and so on\nYou can attribute to to a number of things I Would add in the economy which is incredibly strong thanks to President Trump and the Republican agenda\nAnd we're going to get the GDP number for the third quarter first estimate on friday morning so we'll have that number all next week before the election\nAnd that could be a great political gift to the president and Republicans as well boiling them um look the Democrats the less they can help themselves are out there screaming acting insane and I think it turns off a lot of independent voters and remember\nThe group that elected Donald Trump Republicans or conservatives are even independence was disaffected Democrats blue collar folks in states like Pennsylvania and Ohio Michigan Wisconsin don't change their mind not Donald Trump they're glad they voted for him\nBecause their lives have improved renegotiated NAFTA renegotiating trade deals tax cuts deregulation it's all served\nTheir direct economic purposes you add all of these things together I Do not think there's a blue wave you seem prominent Democrats like Bernie Sanders backing away from that whole that whole concept trying to lower expectations I think that the great silent majority is not done yet\nMonnett Monica Crowley Washington Times watch for her column time John bachelor

Ninety thousand South Asians these were not\nRegional wars these what these were you know almost village a conflicts and Russia really turn them into a regional wars 'cause it's a very good a lever one thing that I Hope John Bolton will be very different than most of us us predecessors said\nUs efforts have ten and conflict resolution of tend to focus on Iran in ... you know getting the two sides together to talk to agree it's really not about you're unemployed cool it's really honestly about Moscow in ... and Washington and that\nUh you know with our understanding how Russia uses his conflict or to hold the region hostage on it'll be very difficult to as all that and I think another point you brought up the ... really relevant is that\nUm I think I mean it needs to acknowledge it physical presence and they're going to call by the places diplomatic game which says well there's Armenian there's than you know Nicole ... Carl by force that if it some separate entity and I think it's not\nReally a way that build any confidence to solve the conflict you know your I've been I've been to the region you know there is Armenian soldiers serving their the previous two presidents have I mean you are actually from the gonna Kobach\nA I'm are Armenian citizen serve in the military and in the region or you know to ... to say they're not there would be if Israel said you know we're not in the west bank that's like local today and forces you know if it's something\nA four and so I think I think it's also important that I that Armenia ... you know come clean and recognizes its own presence in this region\nWe have news or you mention Israel the commanding general of the ... of the republic of Esteban forces visiting in Israel for the first time I've visited with the Azerbaijan forces yeah earlier this year\nAnd I saw a lot of first rate Israeli equipment I've heard over the years that as about Sean and Israel work together chiefly because that's the benefit of Israel when and if there's a need to use basing in Azerbaijan north of Iran\nHowever it is to just that there's more of a a developing relationship for arms and training\n[noise] yeah I think you know many you know media and sometimes foreign officials I'm a talk about the relationship between Azerbaijan and Israel's if it's some you know marriage of convenience because if it's just about well interest but you know because as they are by Shonda Shia Muslim and and and Israel's predominantly\nA Jewish that for some reason there would be some obstruction to their relations but I think it's exactly the opposite I think that that there's there there is um ... this whole region has nothing as we discuss the in the in the previous discussion between it\nHas nothing to do with with a religion just like\nIn Iran and Armenia have very close you know relations when you know our Armenians occupies territory that lead to you know nine hundred thousand or she Azerbaijan needs to become refugees it doesn't bother the Islamic republic of Iran the same thing there's zero anti Israel sentiments a in Azerbaijan\nI visit there frequently I'd see ... you know probably the Jewish person I feel more welcome a in Azerbaijan than I Do in most places in in in Europe\nUm ... and again this is actually it's kind of interesting because there were two not only is this the first visit of the chief of staff of us are based on in Israel but the last major visit of a senior adviser by Johnny official was may fourteenth ... does that date say anything to join\nFrom the fight against ISIS in Iraq and Syria so that they could focus on Yemen so it has not achieved its objectives and actually I think it's been a largely counterproductive\nThey next on the list to concern Qatar I visited Qatar earlier this year and that was six months into the Saudi led us each joined embargo off cause charge this is the Gulf Cooperation\nCouncil I'd say you could take out the cooperation the Gulf council broken down the U.S is extremely uncomfortable because we've got military at risk Ken the Saudis be can can this moment this moment where the Saudis are vulnerable cannot be used to come this feud\n[noise] I think it can and I think it should be a again here the Saudi ambassador ambition was to get tough with the galleries uh they said the galleries were supporting terrorism and we're too close to Iran they issued a long list of demands slapped on the embargo\nUm do ... did not in fact meet and those demands has survived the embargo\nUm but because of the interruption of economic linkages as ... and so the relationship between gutter and Iran is far more now than it was before the embargo began\nFrom an American perspective still largest US military base in the region as in gutter and of course the Saudis and ... and others are security partners as well and so now we have partners on each side of this fragment of Jaycee block which doesn't make life easy\nFor us and so a really as I think a State Department spokesman a spokesperson said was a view of my ... Iran has emerged as the beneficiary of of the state of affairs here\nTo ask so Ron is now entered into this they're watching the show gee tragedy and is this a an unexpected benefit for them\n... you know if the Iranians have been a notably silent and and this and uh you know in American domestic politics there's the rule of thumb that if your opponent is in the process of destroying himself or his reputation don't get knows way just to keep your mouth shut and watch and\nToaster good fortune and unfortunately I think that's where\nThe Iranians are today because they look at um not just the division between the United states and Saudi Arabia is likely to um create but the empowerment of turkey I'm the sort of moral diminish meant of Saudi Arabia the degree to which this has made business and\nUh and governments around the world less\nInclined to work with\nA and cooperate with Saudi Arabia and from the Iranian perspective that's all good news and they didn't have to do anything to achieve that\nNext on the list and this is more difficult to see but a Hariri the prime minister the son of the slain prime minister was for a time in Riyadh and the question was was he there on his own free will the Saudi Arabians they're now saying he's free to come and go he's just vacationing\nBut when you mentioned Hariri you are plunged into Lebanon and Syria what are the Saudis up to in Beirut ... what is their party Richard\nSo a year ago the Saudis um concluded that they did not like the fact that uh has blah who's a sponsor of courses Iran or within coalition government with Saudi Arabia\nThe prime minister of Lebanon ah and that they wanted to try to marginalize a ... political influence and thereby ... deal a setback to run again a not a bad ambition um but it backfired ah they lured\nA Saad Hariri to this to Saudi Arabia a forced him under obvious dress a two resigned his position as prime minister on Saudi TV a with no real explanation although he was\nRequired to end did blame Iran um but the result of this was it didn't hold and within a matter of weeks Hariri was back having rescinded his resignation he still prime minister and it had the effect of actually increasing the political support for Hezbollah rather than decreasing it so it was one more\nUm kick in the counter productive column\nYou mentioned Israel as a plus because Israel and Saudi Arabia has moved very close together these last years and Mohammed bin Salman is the center of that rapprochement but I see that the Israelis are very worried about ...\nBecause having moved so far with Saudi Arabia they're concerned about losing it ah you also mentioned a positive that the Saudis were ready to back us up in the event the\nIran sanctions a damaged the world's supply of oil especially if the European allies are both those positive now at risk Richard\n[noise] I Would say that the positive with respect Israel is at some risk in the sense that um ... for the Israelis as for the United states the Saudis or a less valuable strategic partner if you could call it that um than they were before the surgery\nA murder given the program that's been directed toward Riyadh uh I I think the oil is a different matter I think that the Saudis\nAh it's it's theoretically possible that they would react to any pressure\nThe world puts on them uh with such anger that they would reduce their oil exports and not make up for the reduction in Iranian exports of fruit and so forth but of course our costs them economically precisely at the moment ah when they have a big plan to grow and diversify the economy\nI'm not saying I won't do it but I think it's unlikely um but uh\nBut what you said also points to you know the potential kinds of upsides that there are in this relationship which is why I say don't just get rid of the thing let's modify its terms um they have\nStopped their previous hostility toward Israel they are helpful when it comes to pressure on Iran and certainly our counterterrorism intelligence cooperation other things as well\nThe concern here is how to go forward and this is a tabletop exercise it's almost like a game of risk in which you're trying to reestablish relationships after uh after you see conflict between South America and Africa for example do\nWhat he is adequate you mentioned the global Magnitsky Act I've also had conversation is talking about\nUh the convention on torture or the possibility of the international criminal court getting involved is that is that imaginable that the U.S would go along with a criminal charge against people in Saudi Arabia\n[noise] well certainly not to the international criminal court I mean the Trump Administration and John Bolton national security measure have made clear that they would like to do legitimize the international criminal court and my understanding is that Saudi Arabia doesn't recognize that ... anyway so I don't think that's an avid you the\nThe global Magnitsky sanctions would be sanctions economic sanctions target financial measures visa bans things like that that are directed at the perpetrators and that I think will happen I'm just in the past Eighteen hours or so I think\nThe secretary of state telegraphed as much um then\nYou've got the broader question of beyond\nPunishing those who are are immediately responsible or as far as the changes you can determine are responsible or what do you do about the relationship more broadly and here\nI where I come down is that the unity of measures are you know to some degree necessary but they're certainly not sufficient with this is an opportunity and to reset some aspects of the relationship between the United states and Saudi Arabia\nAnd to try to move them in a more constructive direction so that they're not engaged in a kind of counter productive uh actions that I described in instead of a you know use this as a wake up call to try to wind down some of the thing particularly the war in Yemen\nRichard Fontaine is president of the center for new American security I'm John bachelor this is the John ...
