right because the problem is one of the problems is that two years ago when the Chinese started this whole thing by making this unprecedented illegal grab a basically to Mediterranean sees\nThat they had no advisors about the United states\nWho knew anything with the party line so they said well the United states will do nothing and of course in fact the Obama administration\nDidn't do nothing but they had no one who really knew what was going on enough to be able to watch those Americans if you push them against the wall they may come out punching and you won't like it if you've ever been a

the Treasury Department again declined to label China a currency manipulator instead settling for a stern warning\nAbout recent slide and the value of the Chinese walk around and then be\nThe treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin was quoted a particular concern are China's lack of currency transparency and the recent weakness in its current same a down ten percent this year\nTreasury went on to say that it estimated the direct intervention by the people's bank of China this year quote has been limited [noise]\nA garden we welcome our friend Alan tunnels into combat on currency manipulation yes or no\nYou take a guard so Alan was the treasury correct in not designating China a currency manipulator for the last six months\nAccording to the criteria established by the act of Congress that set up this process they actually were of just briefly there are three criteria that any country needs to meet in order to qualify for that scarlet letter\nThat scarlet letter has a currency manipulator status and shining it's really just one in the last six months since the last such treasury report came out it runs at a norm is\nBilateral trade surplus with the U.S no one can no one can test for that but it's actually been a net seller of us that\nFor the last few months we just got the latest a treasury data that goes through August actually yesterday [noise] and it's also\nIt's also brought down its global current account surplus which is a broad measure of its trade surplus pretty considerably in the last few years or so again by by two of the three criteria China is in fact not manipulating\nI ask you a garden because you've been keen on this story for some time or the president when a candidate and in transition accused China of currency manipulation was that accurate then is it accurate now\nIt ... it has not been accurate for at least a year and a half maybe two years maybe even more than that clearly China was a currency manipulator in other words it was manipulating the value of its currency to obtain a train trade benefit it did that um by keeping the renminbi low\nBut we also know I'm as Alan just alluded to that they've actually been supporting their currency recently and the reason is as Alan points out is because they're worried about capital flight and it's a remedy is at a low value that encourages capital flight and so\nOver the last six months of the people's bank of China the central bank has actually been selling dollars in order to support the Rehman be yes the ... has fallen but it would have flown a lot more but for the support from the Chinese central authorities\nAdd that to my own educated here on this sounds like if not manipulation certainly putting your thumb on the ... yeah they\nDo but there was some on the scale John ... it's not currency manipulation as defined in US law because to be a currency manipulator for purposes of this treasury designation\nYou've got to fool around with the value of your currency in order to obtain a trade benefits and they have not done that matter of fact they'd given a trade benefit to our exporters by keeping their currency artificially high\nAllen for those of us who don't practice macro economics the way Allen tunnel Senate reality check does why none of us were act is economics like Allen tunnels wise I drew wide currency manipulation happened ... who does it who uses it and why\nWell countries that rely heavily on exports for their growth like China or frequently tempted and often to carry through the policy of artificially ...\nPressing the value of their currencies which makes their goods cheaper visa V. foreign competitors in their own market\nIn the U.S market and then third country markets and in fact\nOver the last roughly Twenty years several countries have been designated by the by the Treasury Department as a currency manipulator is um and certainly in this latest report various countries war or put on an informal watch lists given a so called stern warning not to go too far\nDown the road that they seem to be going on although no one's really sure no one's actually willing to make that accusation formally but\nIt has been used China as Gordon says certainly used at massively especially from the mid nineties to the uh well really to right before the the global financial crisis but the situation has changed but was what's also changed dramatically\nIs that this currency manipulation issue in the age of Trump's trade policy no longer matter is the way it did ten years ago\nBecause the president has already imposed so many tariffs\nOn Chinese imports and is likely I think now to impose many many more so the importance of tariffs to counter currency manipulation has really shrunk\nI'm terribly disappointed Allen that we do not violently disagree on this issue you know I I don't know how that happened that we actually have the same perspective let's go to another issue where we might disagree okay and that is supply chains\nThere's a lot of people out there Allen who say look you know the supply chains are stuck in China it will never ever change agree or disagree\nWait I Want to crowd in with the economist conventional wisdom from lousy economy oh gosh look guys it's my job in life to read the economists I'm going to report what I used to be John I enjoy it a great deal I had an alternative life as an English public school boy okay that's where I Am fine alright\nThis is written from the point of view of understanding the queen okay fine\nThe argument is that the supply chain in electronics specifically electronics is deeply in China deeply engaged in China China was there it's it's a miracle happened ... with the explosion of\nCommercial and retail electronics for consumers and therefore\nIt is not credible at this point at this point they're cagey about this at this point to replace John however there is migration underway to Vietnam and\nIndonesia those are the two

why the disappointment\nAnd it's pointed to human nature and that drew me in because that goes everywhere it's not just China [noise] human nature is when there is a dictatorship or an authoritarian ...\nThere is an incentive to deceive because your job your family your ambition your dreams depend upon you giving information that is favorable to the success of the regime\nYou are no longer in a position or department or an enterprise in these vast things called that the state has composed the state operated on a process\nYou're no longer in a position to say there's going to be a shortfall this quarter or we don't have adequate quality control or the failure here is because we have toxic managers who have to be educated\nYou don't do any of that anymore and what that does is it creates and the Communist Party and an enormous silence around she in which he gets no good information except from a handful of his ...\nAnd it's not even then John and the information is about who's against us because that's what they become good at worrying about worrying about the man who's going to get them in the back what happened in late Soviet Union was it became brittle and paranoid\nThat the description of a nightmare and there's history to say that that's where China's had\n[noise] there's a lot of history and and much of it is Chinese history and much of that is history of the People's Republic because what we're seeing today in Beijing which you just described is absolutely correct that there is the silence that there is an inability to disagree inability to tell the truth to your superiors\nAnd so what's happened is he dreamed paying is just not getting the information that he needs in order to make reasonable decisions\nThe same thing happened to mouths are doing in the late Nineteen fifties you ended up with something called the great leap forward which was insane plan to start out with but it was made even worse and the tragedy is that tens of millions of Chinese died\nThe impart not only because it's that ... was just a loony in terms of his policies\nBut also because he did not understand what was actually happening peasants were starving and at the same time he was told by those around him that the great leap forward his plan was actually working so we're seeing the same dynamic\nMaybe not with tens of millions of people dying now but clearly it's the same phenomena\nThe concern also is that in a deteriorating security condition which is what you are when you're paranoid and there is no satisfaction right you that no matter how many times you both the door they can get in another way your imagination takes over and a deteriorating security situation\nIt becomes very attractive for the regime to lash out and find enemies\nOh certainly and many people speculate that right now see jumping is at a place where he understands\nThat a couple of things are happening first of all he used and secure he does need to have a foreign enemy\nBut also in a general sense China is starting to perceive a closing window of opportunity\nBecause you have an economy which is not growing as advertised you also have a demography which is going to turn negative fairly soon\nAt an environment that can no longer support the economic growth that we saw in the Nineteen eighties and Nineteen nineties so clearly there is a time where Chinese leaders are starting to think\nThat they've got to accomplish what they're set out to do now or they're never going to be able to do it\nIn late dictatorship and this was the Soviet Union there is no succession plan ... did not have a succession plan which is why stay security's stepped in and drop off made himself the boss she does not have a succession plan state security or the pale law will run China after she\nYes and that's the optimistic scenario the other scenario is just that ah the basically the party in the state dissolved\nAnd you have a period of uncertainty and turbulence and chaos\nAnd that has occurred in previous times in China's history so\nThat could occur as well but you're absolutely right see jumping has no succession plan and because of the way that he's changed the Communist Party he's the institutionalized at gotten rid of the rules of succession he can't have a successor because if he does he's gone\nIn a late dictatorship the Soviet Union a coup is less likely than indifference indifference there was eventually code but it was because corporate chef raised expectations\nAt this point I Do not believe that she is vulnerable to a coup he is however

canceled his trip to China\nBut he is seeing the Chinese defense minister in a few hours tell us what you know about that\n[noise] you know what I Do about it is very little what I Would get speculated about it quite a bit okay speculate yeah yeah well\nI mean it's it's utterly fascinated to see such a quick pivot from from China it's of course as we talked about the last time when I was on we we saw a bit of this happened right in here in Newport we're having our ah international sheep are supposedly of the head of the Chinese they'd be was here and actually pull and actually pulled out and went home\nIt displeasure over the situation in the south China Sea he was recall to to to Beijing\nSo that so that was sort of the origin of what we see having that we'll see happening in Southeast Asia now and of course it seems like go try that has had second thoughts as soon as the defense minister to this defense ministers conference between the United states in ... in Singapore and\nSo it is I I'm not sure exactly who gets the upper hand the diplomatically but it's a it's\nBut ... to watch Jim I'm told that the Chinese believe regard or an article of faith especially for the

a permit us ships are our allies in the south China Sea can they enforce that\n[noise] well well I guess I'll take the object gesture things or the second thing I Would answer first I guess that's really where the rubber meets the road is kind of do they have the assets do they have the uh the material the missiles are corrupt all that kind of stuff to actually enforce their claims\nIn the south China Sea if indeed they interpret this as sovereign territory of seems to be the one coming out of Beijing for the past few years they talk about indisputable sovereignty meeting a monopoly of force that belongs to shot up is the waters the claim so\nWhether it has to do was to enforce that I guess remains to be seen as far as the historical person I mean it's it's in a sense it makes some sense I mean big powers of big powers like the United states like Russia or China like India in fact\nWhen they look off sure they do have a proprietary such towards those waters but at the same time if you look at what China is doing today in the south China Sea\nAnd he's only ... what the United States that of the Caribbean and the Gulf during the era of the Monroe Doctrine yes there were they just both vicious claim do certain prerogative but\nCertainly the United states never claimed to own the Caribbean to own the Gulf to own all the\n... with and there are basically get to to make the rules in Washington governing what happened in\nThose expanses so it might be the same thing but it's an order of magnitude greater in an ambitious\nAnd to reinforce your point gym um it was just a couple of years ago when the Chinese sale within ten nautical miles of an Alaskan Ayelet we didn't stop them um we didn't complain about it\nSo you know if the Russians are the Chinese wanted to say on the Gulf of Mexico our position would be yeah go right ahead um less because we believe in freedom of navigation and I think that you know the Chinese always say well would they could never sailed near Hawaii will we allow them to do that if they want to if they have the capability to\nIt's just that of course we don't like it but we don't stop them from it\nI mean we're with potentially the seem to think that that really sort of sort of thing where it used to it I mean there was\nJust a moment Jim Will get you back on the phone 'cause I Want to hear we had a breakup of their Gordon I Want you to go over that point again that the Chinese aggression here that we're seeing is building gradually it has been building for every for many years and in the course of this conversation tonight I see that we've come to accept\nA certain ... a certain amount of claims the Chinese were contending with them we're talking history but I think that's too far for more than just the United states I think they are European allies have accepted that the aggression in the south China Sea I'm even beginning to believe that parts of of East Asia have accepted it\nWell I think parts of East Asia might have accepted it but no I mean we don't accept a Chinese territorial claims and that's why we had the Decatur of engaging the freedom of navigation operation a last month and that's because we do this we do this not only in the south China Sea but elsewhere\nAnd although you know we take the position that the United states will not arbitrator take a position on competing ... sovereignty claims were were not involved nonetheless we insist on an open global commons international airspace international water\nAnd Jim Jim's back with us are we backed up by our allies on this gym will will they speak for us and an episode like the Decatur [noise]\nWell you know what I actually feel better about the situation when I did up to to really you know two or three years ago it's it it seemed like it was developing into a U.S China or us on China thing I Wonder one mano a mano type thing which I think is a really really bad situation if it happens\nHowever we've ... we've started to see the world maybe Britain Israel David show up in the south China Sea the French the French are putting are mounting a presidents and talking about doing more uh Australia has ... has been has been pretty stalwart on the whole thing so\nYeah I think there is I think there's I think our allies and our friends and been nations we would like to recruit to be our allies and friends are ... are starting to realize that you know every every state has a stake in freedom of the sea and that they'd better show up and they better speak up about it in the south China Sea\nList those rights go away

offline riding most recently at the national review\nAll their distinguish publications about aggression by the Chinese\nOr leadership in Beijing the People's Republic of China aggression that appears just continuous with the reputation that China had gained as a diplomatic actor many years\nAs remaining in the sidelines or emphasizing peaceful rise are seeking non conflict Michael a very good evening you use cite several instances they're very well known now\nChina forcing the airlines to remove Taiwan from its websites or China challenging the U.S has to cater in the south China Sea or most recently you've written about China detaining up to the New York times tells us\nA million ... reeducation concentration camps\nThis new aggression does it come from one place Michael good evening to\nGood evening John well you know does it come from one place in in one way it does it comes from ... the president of China no\nHe's obviously the beneficiary of years of policies that have strengthened China but in his five or six years in power\nOr he has moved assertively and indeed in many cases aggressively to throw off the caution that China had traditionally practiced or at least have practiced\nIn the past several decades towards the outside world and you're seeing a China that is unapologetic that is unwilling to compromise that is unwilling in many cases to negotiate\nA and in in fact what I think it's doing is beginning to push itself into a corner but it's not doing so without causing a lot of pain and a lot of disruption abroad\nMichael um see jumping is very different from his predecessor Hu Jintao who was a consensus builder mild\nQuite weak politically or see jumping is just apparently the polar opposite um do you think see jumping is an aberration or is he the inevitable result of the evolution of Chinese communism\n[noise] well it's a great question you know the historian I'm always a hesitant according to\nTo make a conclusion like that and and you know the easy ways to punt and say that that will see but in in some cases we really are at a turning point if she ... paying is able to successfully consolidate power and successfully pushed through the um the\nTypes of policies that he has been doing so far meaning they're not they're not reverse that it's hard to see China going\nGoing back a short of of course the type of collapsed scenario or severe weakening that both of us have talked extensively about\nOn the other hand if it turns out that he missed calculates that he creates a coalition of the willing so to speak that is opposing China if he blunders into a conflict that China's not prepared for that and you can easily see a lot of this being unwound and he and his\nApproach being disavowed by those who would replace him so in in some ways what he's fighting for I Would say is not just China's role in the global stage he's he's actually fighting for the future of China when he talks about the China Dream is he's done since coming into power\nWhen he talks about ... the great Chinese people what he's really talking about is this pathway and we are in the midst of that experiment right now\nYou know clearly you're seeing a pushback from the United states and from neighbors and from other countries\nAnd this is I think causing some political distressed because we've had the ... way of incidents the president have been a ... Paul be recalled and disappeared there have been other instances suggesting political distress at the top um infighting we don't know the full dimension of it\nUm but it seems that see jumping is\nThey're not only for the future of China but he seems to be also fighting as you suggested earlier to consolidate his political position in Beijing because otherwise we wouldn't be seeing these symptoms come so soon after each other\nI think that's right um now\nOne of the things that he's done assiduously since coming into power in late\nTwenty twelve and probably before that when he was the heir apparent was to begin\nIsolating and eliminating a potential other sources are centers of power within a the top leadership of of the Chinese government um so it's not that he did\nNot understand that he would cause antibodies so to speak to come to form and and try to either blunt what he's doing or or you know displace him and\nTake it over for themselves and he's been very successful in doing that with the military are doing it with\nMedia which was already controlled or in clamping down on civil society and the like\nBut you are absolutely seeing signs of I'm I'm not\nUnrest but dissatisfaction in China are there are a you know in the Soviet Union we have to use to have the ... dot underground publications in China they will\nCome pop up here and there on the Internet and then spread like wildfire there are extreme criticisms of him and the the path that he's taking a you see a some concern in the top leadership as you mentioned of course the Interpol chief Chinese\nAre being disappeared this is this is a regime I don't know if I'd say that the wheels are coming off I don't think it's it's at that level but it is is absolutely one where Xi Jinping has pushed so far so fast that there is the beginnings of a push back against that the question is has he been successful enough in neutering\nPotential other centers of power that he will be able to get through this\nYou mentioned the national review on line three hundred and fifty thousand Chinese students studying in America are they a problem Michael that is developing this escalation of aggression he's that turning those students into ... unhappy people are unhappy visitors to the United states\nWell obviously it's it's hard to you know you can't generalize about all three hundred and fifty thousand but what we can talk about John hard the undeniable actions on the part of the Chinese government to mobilize in some cases weaponized the students they've done it lessen the United states but\nThey've done it in places like Australia and other countries where they form a very vocal interest blocks ah and they try to suppress anti Chinese discussion or Chinese um lectures or Chinese events on\nCollege campuses uh they will go out as as large crowds trying to drown out anyone who is taking a critical stance of China they are in other element along with the Confucius Institute at\nThe state uses to try to portray only positive a positive views of China now in the United states but we also know is that the government is very carefully watching them that there are in essence agent provocateurs\nMassive deregulation\nOr renegotiate it the the trade deals are killing large sectors in this country economically\nAnd unleashing the energy sector so I think folks on the ground normal American to understand this because they are getting the benefits of this economy every single day and the opportunities are only increasing in their eyes and and in terms of what they're experiencing\nOn the other hand the Republicans running for election or re election in the house the Senate governors et cetera\nI don't think that they have been particularly effective in getting this message across now it may not matter because again the economy is so strong that voters are seeing it again in every direction so\nBut but I think it's lyrical malpractice for the Republicans not to be touting the economy and their responsibility for it\nAt every turn the Democrats are guilty of this too I mean they they tend to get lost in their own storylines or what every story lines are created it defined for that by the press they tend to get lost in those things\nI you and I were talking about this for ...\nI Wish that the Republicans had been counting the economy and their role in creating this pool\nEvery single day right up to the day of the election they have not done not\nKill I Am disappointed in most of the candidate but I still think that the American people are going to deliver them a better day on election day the most people think but it's not entirely because Republicans have been so great at the ...\nThe New York times reports that after capital and these last week that there is evidence that the Republicans have gained because of the polarizing of the ... electorate over issues like capital and others in other words they're stronger in red states the Republicans than they were before\nAnd while the Democrats are stronger in blue states hardly anybody left in the middle America except for maybe Elizabeth Warren wandering around trying to figure out what she is but the polarization means that both bases are fired up both places remember the story for year was that only the Democrats were focused\nYeah and that was true and Republicans were so self satisfied after the twenty sixteen election\nThat a lot of them in a lot of voters who are particularly passionate about politics just sort of kickback didn't watch what was unfolding which for them was pretty good especially economically but now John I think\nGiven the Kavanaugh situation what practical debacle that was how horrifying that was just so many voters not just Republican base\nBut independent and the disaffected Democrats who voted for Trump twenty sixteen\nThey took a look at this it said what the heck is going on here this is a good man this is a brilliant man who deserves to be on the Supreme Court elections have consequences the country elected Trump Trump's prerogative is\nTo nominate he'd like to sit on the Supreme Court and unless they're Charles Manson that person deserved to be the courts to what is going on with the\n... level that this guy that got a lot of people across the board really bad it got them mobilize\nThe question is whether or not that that energy and enthusiasm born out if the anger of the way Kevin always treated whether that can carry three to collection day I think largely a cat obviously I think if the bitter captain of the day after he was confirmed you would have to be\nMaybe a Republican landslide forget about a blue wave\nBut the timing of this is such a I I still think that it's close enough to the Kavanaugh spectacle\nThere will be enough Republican energy to mitigate any blue wave\nRight it looks like the blue wave is ah the blue a metaphor is no longer useful the times says\nThat in polling it shows than in the rural areas the Republicans are granting straight and for the way to be gigantic\nThe Democrats have to do well not only in suburbia they already have the city's knowing suburbia but also in the rural districts and that's not happening at this time I wanted to buy this up the way up into house which political science says goes to the Democrats the party on on the out for the first mid term of president\nAnd the Senate I've been surprised Monica as\nThe Senate numbers have come in and we're getting likely voters now\nHow strong the Republicans are in red states very very strong and that it will be a credit to such as Joe I'm Mr Manchin senator mentioned if he holds West Virginia\nThe Republicans are overwhelming in Missouri overwhelming in North Dakota overwhelming in Nevada overwhelming in Tennessee or they might even be overwhelming an Arizona I Can't tell this point but whatever that polarization dozens in suburbia it's certainly successful for the Senate candidates\nYes exactly in fact they said it back his really tilted in the ... have are just in the last couple of weeks I always thought that the Republicans were going to hold the Senate\nAnd maybe pick up the seat or to you now we're looking at I don't and Alice yesterday John that said that I sort of feeling we could pick up that\nSenate seat I don't think that's likely\nBut now they've got the average if the Republicans picking up about three or even four maybe five Senate seats\nWhich is entirely possible so Mitch McConnell did they made a comment about Obamacare and said look\nIf if it turns out as we expect\nIt might where the where our party number and they said it we're going to take another step repealing Obamacare which of course gets to be sold riled up all over again and and and go full charge to get this done\nWhat I went on social media especially I I thought the left going bananas over what kind of kind of at\nBoth sides are trying to use these issues in order to generate turned out on election day\nBut remember John it a lot of these key states early voting is already and\nThere are already voting Monica I've saved the this to last because it's your story and there's more to say but\nHillary Clinton Monica it's it's just astonishing to me that Hillary Clinton speaks about what happened in Nineteen Ninety eight with Monica Lewinsky as if it's as if it's it happened in another universe and it's not even connected to the world we live in\nA Hillary Clinton in this last week I think embarrassed the Democratic party if they're paying attention are they\n[noise] the tone deafness is Mrs Clinton never ceases to amaze does\nIt John I mean it's unbelievable she made a comment today that that her husband did not it quote abused power

are based on the border between Iran and Armenia was open fuel supplies food supplies um went from [noise] from Iran into Armenian and and the center of media was able to sustain the war\nI'm like you know that that that open border with Iran with was very important I assume that um during the national ... national security adviser John Bolton upcoming a\nVideo and that is a very convenient if it is that John Bolton is headed into the region to be a year a van and at ... correct\nAnd Georgia and actually Russia which is kind of a complicated visit together to go from Moscow you know to these

Brenda is to run\nFrom ... south of ... through Georgia to the black\nSea and then through turkey under bypass Armenia entirely so they're being left out of the major pipeline that that is ... ... ... that has announced that that that has been knitted together with the announcement of the Caspian Sea bass and joining into that pipeline\nWell you know I mean I think again it's a it's a choice of a army Armenia obviously when there's a war going on and there's snipers and there's minds you know you can't build you can't build a pipeline but um you know clearly if there was\nPeace in the region this would create a lot more opportunity economic opportunities for media or as as well\nBe the question here now is Iran pending these sanctions that are coming on\nIs it possible for Ron to bypass the sanctions entirely and do it without transparency using Armenia I Know that this would be a way this would be all Russian work around\n[noise] um I don't know that I don't think it can solve all

Armenia captured from Azerbaijan and it and it it how it plays a game where it says that well we're not you know that's a dependent they're going to call back we're not responsible for what happened

general\nThese are probably these ungoverned territories are we're we're no for the real ... or the real ... real country that controls the territories doesn't take responsibility or some of the

dinners and as as there by John enclave on the other side of the ... that's ... between Armenia in Iran\nIs that a problem or a solution for the region that Azerbaijan sits there with territory between these two romances as ... um Iran and Armenia\nYeah no I think it actually creates a vulnerability ... by John because it's it's X clay that's part of its territory but it has no ... no territorial continuity so it is dependent on either of flights into the region um or coming in I've come into the region you by by bus from turkey\nFrom eastern turkey um uh but but yet the region that dependent for instance also on um uh it's gas supplies from Iran which has done and us in a swap with a a gas that out there by Sean supplies to to northern Iran so yeah I think that it it ... you know it complicate\nAh the region even more but I think it's very important for us to learn\nUm done we tend to try to think well who's who's allies with who and that somehow\nReligion or ideology will play a role and I think the case of Armenian uh in in the Iran is is sort of the greatest proof you know to\nBe but this idea that um religion plays a role or in in choosing the alliances\nYes

implying\nThat maybe it was on purpose or sabotage or something do you know anything about that\nOh well we have I think much simpler and kind of a more reasonable explanation of this without\nA without going after the ... and stuff like that in ... ah because I think first of all we know from the ... ah that was a waste you know extra dumped in Nineteen Ninety six when a debt\nParticular signal you mentioned did not reach the booster in time and there was no\nA clean ... as well\nAnd those were found a ... from that investigation that was a damage to the sounds sort of self which could happen natural way just because of the same but it's a very sensitive ... which is kind of ... better than the people the booster and if you're not careful enough to do it in that somebody you

sends the command for this special wealth doping on Iraq it and if it doesn't do that some time in time it's ...\n... ... for the rocket them that's I think exactly what's happening to the site\nAnd are we looking at protocols that needs to be change do you have a wonderful pictures on on your website Russian space Web of the assembly the preparation of a sudden has MS ten the failed craft or do they are they looking at the protocols right now for where how they missed this and quality control\n[noise] absolutely as they look in the entire chain of procedures which led to this and say they get to a tell us exactly what was the source of fruit cause of this but they\nTell us that they do understand the process they do understand what happened and uh the only thing left the ... the kind of to establish this entire sort of very very deep roots cause which which caused that\nAnd I think that their way to close from they're confident that it can be a critic\nDavid I'm ... and it totally does NASA play any role and in this investigation and oversight given American astronaut tried on this or used to what what does NASA do or do they just wait decisions coming out of Russia\nI think in

getting light them they will be able to kind of give feedback whether they feel confident enough to ... back on a you know and the next ah no launch was the crew\nAnd it totally there are there are demands for use and to to to and from I asked that have you seen as scheduled changes in any fashion after this accident\n[noise] um there was a slight change which might take place because in fact to Ireland you lose they might actually odds once the next launch a forward because uh because what's going on is there is right now the international space station is under stuff\nThere is only the people instead of six which has scheduled and that could which is up there right now ... and ... the soil switches they will use ... spacecraft which is ... the station\nAnd source sorts of like a ...

to\nAnd its ambitions Brian of very good evening to you thank you for this and congratulations first of all how was it on television was everybody laughing in the studio where they were they joyous there there have been anticipation for quite some time good evening to\n... their ... thanks for having me I'm yes there was definitely a lot of the station that's really historic date for Canada\nI think everyone's feeling very excited still very early days um but Canada's providing leadership to the world by making a product that's helping people and has widespread use legal um bus encouraging kind of better consistent quality I'm adding legitimate employment to the the country\nAs well as increasing the tax base reducing crime and related stigma to some this isn't a new category this has been around forever on people and using candidates for for thousands of years um it's been more this past century where where it's been illegal um and now people are starting to to recognize the benefits all that\nAnd and especially the benefits of legalization\nIn terms of um keeping it out of the hands of miners in increasing the tax base making sure you've got better consistent\nProduct so we take our very proud to be a part of it and really congratulations to everyone who helped make it happen\nYes and I'm certain that take an update the new NAFTA to include a marijuana being important in the United states has become an important part of the north American Trade Organization now what is she got when we spoke earlier in the year\nYou were building very large facilities because your aim as I recall it is to ... is to produce cannabis that can be used in edibles and in that bridge is is that correct\n[noise] um that's right we see a lot of growth coming from edibles um beverages but we'll be having products across all the different particles depending on how people want to consume it\nWill be providing those kinds of products but really focused on on clean and organics were growing unreal soil we don't use any synthetic fertilizers or chemical pesticides such a cleaner\nHealthier product that has a sharper chirping kind of flavors and profile um that that consumers prefer now in terms of ... we were building those facilities were still building them are Hamilton facility in Ontario\nWill be finished by the end of this calendar year and we'll start selling into medical market in January so we're actually not selling today in Canada yet we have sales in Europe in before we do in Canada um and then in Quebec our facility\nWill be finished next summer but even before then as we start building each grow room will will start cultivating and harvesting so we expect to be expanding well started medical and Canada in January\nAnd then during next year will be expanding across more medical patients and then province by province in the recreational adults use market but we've actually it'll a lot of progress since we last talked\nA we purchased a company now in Poland temp Poland which has industrial hemp based CBD oils and from there are selling into multiple countries across Europe\nWere investing in this business to\nActually take some of the technologies we've been developing in Canada or have life has started to us and we'll be expanding our product portfolio exactly into edible as you mentioned and beverages being on the oils they sell today and since we last talked we've also acquired a company in Jamaica or fifty percent of the company in Jamaica\nYou can't have majority ownership there we've we've got forty nine percent and this is a fully vertically integrated company everything from cultivation\nTo extraction manufacturing in retail stores um we've made an announcement last week that we've entered into a joint venture and Mexico which is one of the biggest markets Latin America and we'll be exporting products from Poland from Canada and and from Jamaica\nInto Mexico and then soon to be the rest of Latin America we're also investing and building out the sales and distribution infrastructures\nSo really we're on track to to build out our global brand and become the leading organic cannabis Brent I'm In the world\nI Want to ask about that the facility in Quebec that's twenty thousand square feet is that where the robots are Brian is that you're going to use a robot arm or so\nIn ... in in Hamilton it's it's a hundred and fifty thousand square feet twenty thousand is the indoor part I'm In valley feel just outside of a Montreal and come back that's actually one point one million square feet not twenty thousand so it's much much bigger and yes it will be largely automated\nWe've we actually chose come back because it has the lowest power rates in the country huh huh hum as well as some it's great\nThat so that's where the robot farmers will be in Quebec\n... that's right so you don't have people in the grow rooms um which which has a number of benefits because it's it's a lower risk than of contaminants coming in Raj tends to happen when people are coming in and out and then on top of that because you got robots to lift up the tables you don't need walkways for people\nWhere are the stores to look for and and how are they how are they managed\nIt's going to take a bit of time I mean today you only have a couple dozen stores across the country um it what you'll find is over the next month some over the next year they'll be more and more retail stores opening up\nThere'll be very specific only selling cannabis products with the exception of Nova Scotia where they're selling it in liquor stores as well\nUm but you if you're in Canada in order to on line have it delivered to your hotel um you need to sign for it needs to be of age which is basically Nineteen every province except for could back you need to be Eighteen\nTo purchase it and I'm In in Ontario um there's a lot of I Know American states a lot of big population um adjacent Ontario it won't be until next April you'll be able to find it in retail stores\nAnd come back for for states that are neighboring I'm back um they do have some stores now but I think over the next few months will be a lot more stores and there'll be better accessibility\nAnd the government is handling a slower go ... I understand you gotta start somewhere today's the start date so they're now going to build a the government is handling the the merchandise as wholesalers correct and then there are opportunities for private enterprise to sell it as retailers\nThat's right so for the medical market which is being in place for some time I'm it's direct\nPatient directly to the producer through e commerce so we can sell to medical patients across the country but for recreational adults use um the the provincial government in each and every province is the wholesaler record so we sell to the province\nAnd then they go on and sell to retailers whether it's their own retailers like in in ... back and and and several other provinces or private retailers like Alberta or Ontario as of next April will have a private retail network um\nThe government will still be kind of in the middle there ensuring the right quality and and write controls and excise taxes everything else are collected um and ah and also create and getting getting together wholesale markup as well\nThere I mean the the the provinces when I'm from a financial standpoint as well as right hum reducing crime and and making sure that that the tax basis is strong and and there's quality products out there\nThere's a ... to the way the BBC is reporting this have you heard from your neighbors and Britain are they are have they expressed their envy because of what's going on in Canada\nI I Would say I would have heard from people across all countries in Europe and in fact in in the U.S as well and and South America everyone's looking to Canada I'm being the first kind of significant or G. seven country right to have legalized adults use\n'em and want to make sure that Kennedy desert right and I think what you'll find as more and more countries see the benefits\nUm in terms of providing\nUm basically helping people because I mean there's a lot of medical benefits to it but even if you compare to beverage alcohol I'm On the recreational side um it's also a healthier alternative and um and I think you'll see more and more countries looking at Canada as a role model and looking at how they could replicate it\nThe company is a has an unusual name on the ... on on the markets T. G. O. D. but it is green organic detriment holdings Brian said is the c._e._o. and this is the first day of legal legal\nCannabis in Canada there'll be many more details to Philly and then eventually will

collapse of the hops work I'm far Conrad is the general public tiara 'cause the general Franz Joseph the eighty four year old\nWho ruled by avoiding all problems and yet the war is upon them Jeffrey ... a mad catastrophe as the book the outbreak of World War one and the collapse of the hops Berg empire\nThere are plans general staff plan they've had maneuvers for years where they planned what will happen one more breaks out\nJeffrey there are two enemies that they must concerned themselves within the other one is the Russians the great Russian Empire from the north\nThe other is Serbia but ... is a minor threat to Vienna marching on Serbia is a waste of time and money you emphasize that when the Germans made common cause\nWhen Berlin made common cause with the ... they always believed that\nThe Austrians would go to war with Russia that they would help the Germans whole Russia in the east while Germany destroyed France and the British expeditionary force in the west before they came back and finished it but that\nThe Austrian didn't tell Germany about the Serbian few is that correct\n[noise] well I mean the the book talks a great deal about this in the sense that\nGiven the younger helmet for the younger the the German journalist actually from Conrad the Austrian journalist that she had had intermittent staff talks in the years before World War one they had a meeting and ate in Nineteen eighty nine\nThere and meeting in Nineteen twelve where they talked about war plans but the war plans were always very vaguely elaborated by both men for a couple of reasons first the Germans never trusted Austria Hungarian security arrangements\nAnd they're All right not to because the book talks and fascinating detail about the ... affair Nineteen Thirteen when a when the uh when when when one of the best and brightest and the author Hungarian general staff\nIs discovered to have been selling German in Austria Hungarian war plans as well as you know ah information on Germany Austria Hungarian technology in fortress a provision arrangement and that sort of thing to the Russians\nAnd so the Germans are always catch things close to the vet the Oscar Hungarians under Conrad also shared very little with the Germans Conrad actually had a rubber stamp on his desk in the journal stopped building that said not to be shared with the German general staff and he would stamp documents for that\nAnd the reason they did this is because they they both sides the Germans and the Austrians want it as much freedom of a maneuver as they could and so they didn't want to commit themselves or to definitely\nTo each other because they wanted to maintain flexibility the Germans because they were they were nursing their sleep and plan and they were planning to throw\nYou know nearly their entire army against the British expeditionary force and the French and the west and then only once they were beaten move everything back to the east they didn't want the Austrian saying hey you got to commit to leave it doesn't divisions are twenty divisions out east\nAnd the Austrians because they had this very flexible flexible in theory war plan\nWhere they would have a large echelon of troops that we didn't train for the for the Eastern Front they would have a ... a very small echelon of troops that were trained for the Serbian ... in the event of a two front war and they would have a floating reserve of a dozen divisions\nThat couldn't train for either front and uh the Austrians didn't want to have to nail down that floating reserve\nThey you know because of German demand they wanted to have ultimate flexibility is it's so there was this very a dangerous vagueness about the arrangements between the Germans and the Oscar Hungarians both general staff so that is being convenient but it would prove fatal in war time as you see in the book\nBecause basically what happens is that ah the war basically is triggered by the passionate assassination in Sarajevo and\nUh the Austrians have an opportunity to mass everything against Serbia because so great is the international outrage at this assassination I mean remember\nThese Bosnian Serb assassins killed the\nPrince of Austria Hungarian empire in the streets of Sarajevo he's were Bosnian Serbs it was assumed by virtually everyone that they had some kind of service\nIn government Serbian military connection this was telling the Austrians when they're all tomatoes are going to investigate improve up but in the meantime\nEverybody from St Petersburg crossed a London was horrified by the date so the Austrians actually had an opportunity to rule with everything into Serbia and crushed the Serbs but they wasted the opportunity wasted entire month\nThe whole month of July they were all literally on vacation they didn't even come back to the end of the plan this war that they had been wanting for years there most of my time they get around issuing an ultimatum a month after the assassination\nIndignation has and the way everywhere and now from St Petersburg London instead of people thinking hey Austria has a right to invade Syria everybody's thinking hey Austrian better not invade Serbia\nAnd and Russia and France are saying don't invade Serbia because Serbia has friends so at this point by the time the Austrians actually get around to going to war they no longer have the option of a one front war it's definitively going to be a two front war and yet and here's the madness of Conrad from Hudson door\nHe decides to direct the bulk of the army south against the serves and send only\n... the other half of the army out to the Russians when in fact he needs to be sending forty divisions to face the Russians and ate divisions down to face the Serbs but instead he sends twenty against the Serbs and um [noise] two and a twenty eight against the Russian and they're not nearly enough for him to the Russians are going to build the strength of a hundred and Ninety six divisions\nThe three Army Corps that are sent against the Serbs are in the hands of poke tiara who is the rival of Conrad and post your ideas even less effective as a commander and more hysterical as a man searching for victories and Conrad\nAnd what they what they wind up doing is trying to cross the Green River\nTo press into the mountains and we learn from the first time and Jeffrey's book that the Austrian\nCitizens are totally unaware of how to fight a war they're barely trained and this is the first and best of the draftees\nThey don't have enough weapons is generally a Jeffrey said but they fight badly they bunch shop and charged with band into what you insulating fire and it's a disaster in the heat and they were beaten by their own tactics as I said that correctly Jeffrey\nYeah yes exactly and and and you're right this really hasn't been covered if you look at history the real world one", "show_name": "The John Batchelor Show", "year": "2018", "city":
