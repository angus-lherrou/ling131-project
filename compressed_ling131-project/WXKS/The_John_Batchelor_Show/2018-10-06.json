... this is the John ... show I welcome Adam white he teaches at ... law school at George Mason university is a fellow at the Hoover Institution riding most recently at the Weekly Standard\nAbout the cabin on hearing the question raised these last days and now we're on the eve of the Senate final vote\nThe outcome is not certain but there is a glide path to landing in the Republican favor out I'm a very good evening to you the inquiry you raise in your Weekly Standard piece several days past still useful\nWas the judiciary process of these last sixty Seventy days\nWas that a job interview as has been asserted or was that a search for the truth in a criminal allegation good evening to you\nWell good evening John it's it's always good to be back well I Will say if this was a job interview than it looks increasingly likely to be out of the interview is you're hired justice Kevin all\nThings seemed to be very promising for the judge right now although of course things are always subject to change until the last moment well the reason why I wrote that article though for the Weekly Standard was a\nJudge Kavanaugh's critics kept saying uh the Senate's process is not a criminal trial he doesn't get a presumption of innocence there was no burden of proof on his accuser it's just a job interview in which the interviewer\nI guess the Senate or can can decide however they want the point in my article was that really was looking to narrowly at this the Senate is it's not just a job interview the Senate isn't some corporate HR department of the United States Senate as part of our government and its wielding sovereign power\nIn an attempt to do justice and so I think that the Senate needed to take very careful steps\nThrough the process it constructed a to do justice to everybody involved but also\nTo keep in mind that this won't be the last Supreme Court nomination to the Senate considers\nEnd up the Senate needed to go about its work in this case taking care to set precedence that will allow the Senate to do its best possible job in the future so it's not of course it's not a criminal trial it's not a court this isn't a judge\nA it's not a trial but it's not a job interview it's the Senate's process for advice and consent\nAnd the Senate needed to take that much more seriously than judge Kavanaugh's opponents would have had to do\nYou participated in the judiciary inquiring about judge Kavanaugh to being a member of the Supreme Court you testified\nOr with other scholars and therefore you said in that room and you looked at the senators and their age and you saw the process which is a ceremony advice and consent that process before the Feinstein\nIntroduction of the allegations the first allegation the Blasey Ford allegation and then there were subsequent allegations that process is is that damaged and how long is that if it is how long will that damage last because I think you've thought before the damage and now we're on the other side of it\nWill John I testified on the last day of the original hearing last paddle the last day\nAt that point even the protesters were getting bored and a lot of the senators were there a lot of the staff weren't there I was there to testify on judge Kavanaugh's record in administrative law which you and I discussed shortly yes on the air shortly before the testimony and I think his record as exemplary\nBut it is it seems like a thousand years ago that we were talking about the original hearings and even\nAt that time the process was already coming apart you and I discussed on the air the things that senator Booker and others had done to tried to detonate the hearing\nA and it's very opening moments that flurry of interruptions objections and demands and on my panel last panel of the day a penalty hearings it was largely dominated by the parents of John Dean the former a Nixon White House counsel the Watergate figure\nWas a Democratic senators asking him a question is trying to compare Trump to Nixon and Watergate and so on and so the process was already degraded by the time we got to that last paddle I think that\nA U.S Senator Grassley deserves immense credit for holding it together as well as he could and then when they're came demands for a further investigation further hearings\nI wrote that we'd be standard article to say yes it's it's good to it's good that we had these extra hearings\nBut opening up more FBI investigations to chase allegations that senators had even before the original Senate hearing\nAnd that's the key but the doctor for brought these allegations to the Senate well before the hearing and the senator's Senator Feinstein others we're now trying to reopen the entire process after the fact\nI thought that was very dangerous because I think if we allow too much of that to happen then in the next Supreme Court nomination the confirmation hearing we're all going to sit and sort of wait\nFor the real for the original hearings to and so we can find out what the real goods are what the real allegations will be which will come out tactically after hearing and so I think that a Senator Grassley Senator Flake and the others I think they did a good job\nOf reopening the hearing it allowing a very limited investigation but without allowing the entire process to devolve into a never ending fishing expedition\nIt has confused and disheartening to public Adam you know this your professional you look at it inside your you teach in law school you have young lawyers of the future but those of us who don't go to law school didn't aren't going to go to law school a this was easy to understand as a continuation of the twenty sixth campaign\nThis ... this was about the presidency or who won the presidency and twenty sixteen not about the judiciary branch of the government not about the Supreme Court it's a puzzle\nThis this politicized the Supreme Court now I understand the Supreme Court has a political flavor to it they read the headlines I get that but has something changed doors will we will we see this and this and the scheme of things as\nJust more a ... arguing point in the larger scale build up to twenty twenty\n[noise] a lot of people a lot of judge Kavanaugh's critics have said that what we've just experienced will affect the courts legitimacy\nI just reject that I think that\nNothing happens in the Senate process can affect the courts legitimacy after all a constitution provides for a political process for appointing\nJudges and justices or what does affect the courts legitimacy is how the judges go about their work as judges so the real test of the court's legitimacy now comes a as as judge Kavanaugh or whoever fill the seat a takes the bench\nAnd the court continues its work the court has always wielded immense power in our country and it's often been seen as political and and criticized as political\nThat means I I'm seeing now that because there was a fracture theirs deposited in that fracture and in in two main zones you talk about the policy deposit and there's ... the north end posse south is golden both deposits\nElectron yes it's a a moralistic as part of the the the

Xiong a\nAzerbaijan is a prosperous nation looking to develop into the twenty first century with small business just as the United states is developing which is why\nThe business of the planet is small business gene marks is the small business columnist for the guardian newspaper and other distinguish publications in junior new column and the guardian looks very attractive\nSo I immediately want to go to the question of minimum wage\nYou have written about it in the guardian most recently we've talked about minimum wage for the last year but it's been a debate in the United states especially around\nFast food franchises and extending from the Pacific to the Atlantic city's you're debating whether minimum wage is can be imposed on small business owners and what that does for\nEmployment statistics however we now have the breaking news that Amazon\nIs raising its minimum wage and all of its a hundreds of thousands of employees to Fifteen dollars what was your first impression when Jeff Bezos made this announcement how did you how how did you think this would affect small businesses good evening to Eugene grieving\nJohn up my first impression when Amazon or decided to raise their ways to Fifteen dollars I think they're sending a clear shot across the bell at all small businesses and merchants that they'd better step up their game\nThat's what I thought now first of all there are a lot of reasons behind the scenes where Amazon raised their wages\nTo what they are and people can debate that there's political regions from people you know they're they're actually cutting some benefit some ... plans and their bonus plans for some people are saying workers might be making a little bit less uh Amazon disputes that claim\nOr your Amazon themselves or their their automated near warehouses that it's not even be an issue going forward as they continue to cut down on employees but the bottom line is from a PR standpoint\nThey're paying their people Fifteen bucks an hour which is more than other their competitors like Wal Mart or doing as well they're going to have to respond\nAnd if you're a small merchant uh this is what you're up against when you're when you're trying to attract people I the reason why I I like this is the lesser of two evils John is that I I don't like the government\nTelling businesses what they should be paying their people I've always been non supportive of a minimum wage I think that the federal minimum wage right now it's seven dollars and twenty five cents is\nUnrealistic anyway and I don't really know any any of my clients are paying a yard hourly wage low um I think it should be left up to you know the private sector and the private sector's doing that right Amazon right now saying it's we think Fifteen bucks an hour should be what it is\nSo I prefer to have that then the government requiring it but now small merchants and small businesses are hourly you're paying hourly\nThey've got to respond to something like that and I wrote in the uh in the guardian recently how um you know my my clients that complain the most John about I'm not being able to find good people\nUm I look at the numbers they tend to pay their people less you know they they're you know I just can't find a good person to work in the warehouse for ten dollars an hour and\nThe reason why is because down the street somebody's paying twelve bucks an hour to do it\nSo I Know I think we as business owners have to realize that you get what you pay for\nAnd we do have to pay a little bit more and maybe that doesn't have to be in the form of wages maybe it's more paid time off or more fringe benefits or better health insurance but the tight labor market and we're either gonna have to suck it up if we can or increased prices if we have to do that but\nYou know this is what's going on now and I think Amazon is that they are telling all small businesses by this move we better do something as well and step it up\nHave a column and the guardian recovering the twenty Seventeen study by the University of Washington that mitigate this rush toward Fifteen dollars an hour if the ambition is more jobs now we're in a very tight\nThe job market right now actually the we're tight as an adequate there are there not enough workers one of the one of the\nOne of the practical reasons for Amazon to raise the wages that they need a hundred thousand a hundred and twenty thousand for the holidays and they might not be there so\nBut in any event gene ... things have not changed right on the economics of minimum wage it decreases the number of employees and limits the possibilities for a small business owners and franchises\n[noise] yeah I mean it's it's it's definitely a challenge for business owners to react now again there was a study from the University of Washington that said that it had an impact on employment in Seattle where their minimum wage went up to Thirteen dollars an hour\nBack in two thousand and six team but then another study just came out at at Berkeley which I Know you take it with a grain of salt John it's from Berkeley\nUp and say increase they they looked at a few cities that increased their minimum wages above ten dollars an hour Washington Chicago Seattle San Francisco and they\nThey said no this didn't have any impact on jobs over the years there's been plenty of studies that that you contradict each other on the impact of whether a minimum wage hurts job growth or not the bottom line is though is that\nYou know it it's a competitive market and right now employees um I can have their say they didn't have to say ten years ago when the unemployment rate is so high\nBusinesses have to respond to that and we have to pay more if you want good people you gotta you gotta pay for them or you're going to lose out to companies like Amazon and you have to adjust in some way\nOut of ... or increase your price unless unless the employee is a robot okay let's examine the trend here gene a these are the you have a guardian column about ... ... retail store what does that and what does the controversy\nWell there are um first of all there there's Amazon itself\nOr is it has been introducing cash flow stores around the country they just opened a third casually store in Chicago just recently where you go into the store and uh you know you can pay you know you buy your stuff you take it off the shelf you pay with the app and there's no cash that's involved is an automated store which is cutting down on employees\nTechnology is one way that you get around having to have those employees and so a lot of companies um when they're looking at\nYou know how to save on costs a lot of them are being forced to take a step up and make some investments and self service types of kiosks in point of sale systems and ah maybe selling more on line and doing things that require less people around and Amazon itself it's funny John this is one company that\nYou know they're paying now because they need those holiday workers I\nKnow what ever Amazon says they don't want to have all this holiday workers if it was up to them they would have it all automated and they're working toward that they have more than fifty thousand robots right now that are in their warehouses and twenty different locations around the country and it's growing\nFinally did it I open to four oh one K.\nWant why just wait for the inheritance we definitely got a rich uncle somewhere where one call away from the winner's circle at the derby dinners with multiple forks the vacation home in the country using summer as a verb\nYou don't actually think that game\nWhen it comes to financial stability don't get left behind good tools and tips for say they're gonna be the big go toward\nThis message brought you by the American Institute of CPAs on the council got something to say yes\nOr do you think we're all here because you can't rely on the media calling them correctly Austin's home port conservative talk while longer\n\n\nI'm John bus or the ... the John ... mobile and columnist for the guardian and this is a small business from ordinary business of American law business the business of the planet is small businesses has\nBrought to you by the republic of Azerbaijan which in my visit I saw is an excellent capitalists date with lots of small businesses in all directions looking for more that the middle of Eurasia and the middle of North America together for small businesses and Jean\nThe economy is extremely strong can I say that again extremely strong we have deals in place now that are solving the terror of disputes with our allies that would be Canada and Mexico are allies the European Union Japan is in conversation however\nWhat I learned is to pay attention to the small business because that is the metrics that leads us you told me in the winter of sixteen\nUh watch out for Donald Trump small businesses love him they think they're going to get a big boost from him and I went what now I pay attention again with small businesses are looking at this fabulous climate just fat the markets are up the ... the chairman of the Federal Reserve says things can get better\nDo what to small businesses make of this excitement\nUm met [laughter]\nWell okay maybe a little bit better than many people are happy that's good news um by clients that I talked to a ... they're happy\nThey're there they're looking for employees there they are busy there certainly um you know you're pleased with the way the economy is going but\nInterestingly enough particularly with small businesses and I keep an eye on these guys the question is John if the if they're doing well should they be spending more shouldn't they be hiring more go no hiring it small businesses is up but it hasn't\nBeen at the same level as big corporations and now a new survey a new report that just came out from Pepperdine University um is is actually saying that\nUh the financing among small businesses is is is lagging a little bit this you know this report found out that I'm a third of the small businesses that they they surveyed with under five million in revenue only a third of them so that they plan to raise financing and the next six months\nForty three percent don't plan to raise any financing at all and twenty three percent orange sure what they'll do\nWhich translates into the fact of small business owners themselves as strong as the economy is they're just still cautious we are a very cautious breed we still have the great recession to hard to believe it's like almost ten years ago but it's still\nSticking in our minds let's not forget that the average age of the small business owner in America is about fifty three years old so we're old enough to really remember that recession and before we extend ourselves too much or expand too much um we're really not you know going to going to think very hard about doing that\nSo yes we're happy with the way things are going yes we're happy as the economy is growing but are we really getting the financing that we need every really spending on expansion um it's it's not happening at the page that you would think it would be happening\nIs that how it cost is it healthy ... you have a color as a guardian that looks at the expected rise in health costs and twenty Nineteen right so people\nOr or are concerned not only about employee cost and finding employees and meeting that demand but one of the biggest cost that we're all facing happens to be health costs yeah we've been looking at double digit healthcare insurance increases over the past few years now the good news is that they're actually true report that just came out very recently one from a consulting firm\nBut apple their health that found out that health care costs are really on the expects to rise about four point one percent next year for employers in addition to that\nHealthcare costs as well um based on the Kaiser foundation study that just came out this week also predicts about five percent increase in five percent is like for healthcare is pretty good I mean you're right I mean we're used to a lot more than that\nBut even so the cost of a typical employee for health care is now up around twenty thousand dollars a year it's still significant and the demands for healthcare insurance are higher than ever and they need to provide that kind of benefit\nIs a priority if we want to attract good people so it's certain costs for that and keep an eye on retirement costs as well John which are also creeping up\nThese types of cost or people were a business owners were spending more on our people um and the costs to maintain them and keep them loyal unhappy than getting financing to go out and you know build new you know build new buildings or expand our businesses so I Do think yes that is one big factor that's holding us back\nTo things change first California is looking at a changing small business lending practices you regard this to the good\n[noise] I I I regard it as I Can't believe it it's there's now a ... a bill in California to legislate legislature to build it it's it's pending to be signed into law will likely be signed into law which is requiring lenders to provide full disclosure\nNow here's what the bill requires lenders it's let it part particularly on line lenders they have to tell you the total amount that you're that you're borrowing that that the cost of the financing that term how often you have to pay\nWhat the pre payment policies are these are kinda like standard things right I mean if you were going to get you know alone\nA these are the things you'd be asking for well apparently there are a lot of small businesses in this country that get loans from online lenders that aren't getting that kind of information unfortunately and so the state legislature and California stepped in and said listen if you're going to be an online lender and land in California\nWere requiring you to make sure that your your your clients your customers\nKnow this information that you're disclosing it all to them so I think it's a great thing for small businesses are but I Will tell you one thing if you're a business owner and you're not even asking these questions\nYou better hire an accountant or an attorney to represent you if you're getting any kind of financing even from an online vendor because those people will be asking these questions regardless of whether the law requires them or not\nAnd Michigan a form of association health plans under federal rules is this to work around that is viable we've seen others rejected yeah we're\nTalking about health care before so I I'm a big proponent of association health plans this is a ruling a that was issued by the department of labor it's under the Trump Administration is one of the many things that the Trump Administration is doing so to circumvent the Affordable CARE Act and in Michigan there is now stories of companies that are forming associations\nSo you don't have to join your industry group although maybe your industry group offers them but you can form your own association and if you have more than a hundred employees that are part of this association you're like minded businesses or whatnot you can negotiate better rates because the rules are under Obamacare are not as onerous if you have more than a hundred employees which means that\nYou can cut out some essential health benefits and and and get lower premiums for yourself\nAnd your employees now some people might not be crazy about that but\nYou can't exclude people with preexisting conditions and you can't charge people more based on their health history association plans are great options offered to your employees along with whatever else you're\nYou're currently offering just be where it's a Trump Administration thing John and you know as we've learned by executive orders they can be overturned by a quick this was not law yeah earlier today and tomorrow that get reelected these things go right out the door\nJean Marc sees the small business columnist for the guardian another distinguish publications this is the small business report brought to you by the republic of Azerbaijan which is\nFilling with small businesses as is the rest of the plant that's where the jobs are I'm John bachelor this is the John ...\nAnd ... my painting thinking which not be easy\nFor these guys for\nThe wrong that tend to [noise] keep harmful and\nI can wait in place [noise] finding the names in American and you can get back to me is going on in the last thing you can find a link capes no longer ... in their own\nBut at the end I think I think\nThe American lung association fighting to an ... hanging on the things that make it way beeping\nIs it that way [noise] that that could have been there can be fighting to protect the ...\nI'm going to have the like you can get [noise]\nFinding ... or [noise]\nBoston ... home for conservative saw him even Boston Ninety four five nobody talks twelve hundred and I heard radio station [noise]\nAll over the voting jak Callahan Fox News Mr President I Will vote chicken for judge cabin\nWell yeah especially around it's manmade islands but he got that shallow water um do you know that ... mind works best that's environmental\nSo I'll be fifty two or even potentially stealth bomber upbeat Twenty one up which is upcoming already going to be to eventually could fly near one of those islands marine yet with these quick strike times\nWithout ever having to fight over it or fly low over the water can drop these from fifty thousand feet are higher in the case of the beach to be Twenty one which is very high point of capability\nSo at that point at that point capital ships or cannot operate with any confidence whatsoever in a vast amount of ocean you've ... you've I just put you put them out of action\nYes and you can also with is a\nLaw ships in where they can't thirty and that's the big part is that you know by taking a what they were uh you know it's China has a large amount of their fleet fucking an island or whatever this system you can literally layer appreciate in my field one pass the bill the night but B ... bomber\nAnd that all that combat power will be locked and that island they can't leave until\nLate in mind that that are that area so we're talking not just delete your ability you know better by it\nWhole idea of what mine warfare is and that is definitely going to have a race some eyebrows at Beijing\nProtests and this is for the B. fifty two because the B. fifty two has such a lift capability that's why they're designing all these new weapons for and you can put on a library of your arsenal and and launching\nYes let's put it this way right now of what we know of the ... fifty two if I remember correctly has five hyper sonic weapons systems being developed for it five ... that's what we know about 'em so\nIt it is the Air Force's bomber truck of weapons to talk of the future it's caring big fights weapons\nLong distances and delivering them it set off ranges and do this one of the other great that I could not that Ted\nIs they want to make that outer pile on capable as being a weapon of that when the thousand pound class so that the big big weapons okay\nUm and that's something that would be like a like a hyper sorry goose like your call 'em but even these quick strike by its could get his biggest two thousand pounds so instead of sending a fighter that can carry two of them\nYou can set a bomber that carry twenty four of them and laying it might have killed in one shot\nThe beat fifty to the weapon to fear in the twenty first century who knew and the twenty of now we go to the air force has plans to expand\nTheir operations with new squadrons you will recall that the air force and all the military services\nHave been a guaranteed these last years because of Congress's inability to reach a budget that is no longer the case and what the air force one is striking\nA tie your reporting that they want to go from three hundred and twelve squadrons to three hundred and eighty six that's a lot of new aircraft uh why what is it that they need what capability did they gain with that growth\nSo basically that plan has capability growth and every combat\nKind of it in a category ... they do so air force wants to grow this squad are numbered space in fighter and bomber and refusing ... a lot in refueling\nUm so it's pretty much everybody needs to get that wants to stay quiet which is totally upon how there is no idea how it's going to happen but the take away the Airforce really I'm just trying to get Congress to come up\nWith the reality that there is no aircraft or combat hour period\nYou eaten adequate demand is there to yellow and if we ate until really protracted even a low intensity conflict or whatever so the chickens have come home to roost when it comes to the airport in squadrons be hot bath\nFor that of the Cold War and he has two thousand three\nWe could not now Asian of Iraq with air power to use today like the fact that could be like hey we don't have it so this is a remedy or that the big question is how are they gotta pay\nWell they'll pay for it out of necessity the same way they paid for the fleet after Nineteen thirty nine in Nineteen forty one so let's go to one else the air force is either upgrading or needs to ...\nHas has need for attention the beach to what is that ... ... what is the beach it it it really looks really cool what's it for\nThe beat you up with the beats he was America's stealth bomber you know it was built in Nineteen eighty nine is one of his belt and it's amazing to think of it you know it's a Thirty Years' old or soap operas been around for a while or racial for about Twenty years or Twenty one years\nAnd it certainly is already on the horizon but the Little America silver bullet course it is the most capable air combat vehicle rolls are penetrate deep in the enemy airspace were out to help\nUs or ask an\nAnd want that are ... eighty target organizations you can pick out all at higher air filled in my building with one of those years\nAnd the beat two is operating now in the middle east or I remember reading about that have they rotated them out of the middle east out of out of the cuts are field I think is where I read about once upon a time where I still they're\nStill though they're not out ... to ... a an air for main basis um that they have operational support that there are some in Hawaii right now they're trying to you on that uh that are actually in the wake island worth feeling really caught on which is all do but in the middle East that deal and be\nA lot is riding the better one be the older the older strike aircraft uh by yes\nIt's there there's the ... the one which they operate now have been using against ISIS as I recall that to that is based largely in the U.S and is now part of this ... geo strategic\nA maneuvering in the Pacific out of Hawaii the B. fifty two we've mentioned the grandfather of grandfathers and then there's a new strike bomb or they're they're developing for the for the future how soon as the future for the new strike bummer\nWell amazingly so that it's aircraft is going to enter operational capability and twenty twenty five which is really hard to believe 'em but\nThey've very fast on it it uses a lot of existing technologies are so they're not developing all the avionics and all the stuff that gets really expensive they're trying to use off the show\nTechnologies Flora and packaging that ... very still a cutting edge here\nSo the idea is that one always cost they want to spend\nWhat six hundred million or coffee which sounds like a lot of money but it's not it's the talk of stealth bombers right and they want to buy a lot of them instead of like the beach too which is a death spiral but it's only after the Cold War only only on were built I'm only twenty exist today\nThe beach playing one they're talking at least one hundred but based on like this new book a bomber um oh this is squadron goal but they have it we just discuss we could very well see that a Twenty one go to like a hundred and fifty or even a hundred and Seventy you this\nBecause it's not just the longer it goes on different things it's optional in band as well it could be censored out it can be very upset about the nation's it can work as a the quarterback ... air vehicles potentially\nSo it's not just a

I. U. defense innovation unit but it turns out\nIt is now charged by the new director to take on the China monster\nPatrick a very good evening to you I practice routinely reporting on China and I use the word piracy just to make it a little more romantic\nBut it's my understanding that the Chinese pirates have taken all of the software and all of the patents for the hardware for these last decades is that going to stop that we got a way of stopping them given the new commander of the DIE you good evening to\nA good evening so it's an ongoing effort from that the U.S government is paying more and more attention to now ah the Trump Administration is attempting to\nModify aspects of a the a way that we make sure that other countries aren't transferring to much intellectual technical capital or to\nTheir shores primarily Chinese uh and the Chinese government and intellectual property that has a dual use value so could be used for commercial or civilian applications but also a military applications and part of the push for that\nUh was a paper\nThat was called the Pentagon paper and its authored by a fellow who's going to be the new head of the uh you his name is Michael Brown he's a former Symantec CEO uh and it's a change in what\nThis aspect to the Pentagon was supposed to do it we stood up and two thousand Fifteen by former defense secretary Ash Carter and it was meant to be the Pentagon's liaison to Silicon Valley so it was up to bridge\nBoth the culture and the practical gap that exists between a Washington DC and Silicon Valley to help the defense department really grabbing harness all of the great innovation that was coming out of the American start up saying so\nWhat they called nontraditional players is a little tiny companies that are getting big vc money that produce things for the consumer world\nThe Pentagon says I'm you know we're used to dealing with these big defense contractors that are greater building missiles and ships et cetera but we really want to harness this innovation\nUntil they stood up this office uh and it's had a couple of different hedge but Michael Brown the new head his kind of a\nWhole rash on to ... if you will is a as former a CEO of Symantec and now as the head of the new um he's very focused on\nA reaching out to folks in Silicon valley to help them understand a why they should uh be interested in working with the Pentagon but also to highlight a on Capitol Hill and and uh within the Pentagon the risks inherent in\nUh the increasing amount of Chinese investment in key sensitive technology areas or that also occupy the started seeing a for instance artificial intelligence\nSo it's a a difficult process of trying to get a handle on on on this because it's not one that has a single easy solution on the one hand you don't want to restrict a\nVenture capital money that these startups desperately need but that's something that the government is paying more attention to and figuring out how to do it at the most recently passed national defense authorization act includes a provision to help the government change or how it\nUh determines what sort of a investments foreign companies in foreign countries like China and Chinese companies can make in us start up a but it's also an effort to you is to help\nAnd uh the defense department secure\nInnovative technology solutions from a non traditional players so or not big uh a defense contractors and it's a real uphill battle so it if you if you haven't looked at the paper which we were the first to actually publish the final version of it on defense one uh it it highlights\nUh some of the dangers that uh uh\nAt very least many a growing number of people in the defense department and also think tanks are highlighting in terms of\nA supply chain compromise and other issues from the growing amount of of Chinese investment there are but it's it's not an again to a problem that has an easy solution because it's free\nFlow of capital is also kind of a thing that we're all about it's it's really a big part of America's branch to the rest of the world and so a navigating this new space where a we're watching technology transfer to a\nPotential future adversary what we today describe as they can pay a competing nation a competitor nation uh it's not something that's easily fixed but that's something that uh the Pentagon's outreach arm to Silicon Valley is going to be spending more time\nDoing three three points that you develop in your piece at defense won won the v the industry in this country is throwing all this money on software meaning everybody's innovating out there to the Chinese they're no longer according to his round there no longer copycat\nTheir creative and three there are several Manhattan projects or authored by China a command economy\nA which right now we do or not matching AI is one I Know about but there are several others that could be listed here so what does brown recommend what it what does he need to get to use it to to make his job possible\nWell it it's a good point he does highlight the contrast between the way the Chinese government\nTakes a whole of government and kind of whole economy response to ambitious technological goals and ... them with big investments and things like a quantum computing and and artificial intelligence and those big investments also come with big vision statements that they're able to tie different aspects of\nThe country together into meet the commercial sector that the government to beg you know has a primary influence over there's also the military et cetera so uh one of the things that he's suggesting bound and suggesting is that uh maybe it's\nTime for the United states to begin to match from a government funding perspective some of this research and development that we see coming out of China and also maybe to develop some of its own big vision statements its own Manhattan projects a\nTowards some of these areas hyper sonics we are investing run hyper sonics but it's a it's been an effort in fits and starts and and the Chinese are\nHow are they redesigning it ... as they go\nYeah that's the entire point is to make a a a new\nStrategic bombers that uh is\nActually multiple strategic bombers that are involved as quickly as the threats that it's going to face and that's a contrast to the way the\nCountry used you designed a you know great big strategic entities like this like a you know previous bombers going back to the beach too and and uh the the one cetera\nUh before that as well as a submarines and an ICBMs many of which have remained unchanged basically for decades\nThe point was to have these uh and very exist to deter potential adversaries simply by being in the ground being in the air and being in the sea and so as long as they could continue to deliver that capability you didn't have to change them that much against the\nStatic adversary but I'm One of the things that\nThe air force right now is recognizing a in what they want from uh the new bomber that they're developing and I think you might even see the the same sort of thing come into future language about uh ICBMs and and when the navy begins to talk about it when they replace a nuclear submarines um is this sense that\nNew defenses against us bombers\nThey're going to be more difficult and also change more rapidly than a perhaps the U.S is prepared for at least\nIn terms of the way we used to design stuff and that's because of information technology right that is because\nAh can shooter or software based uh a radio radar um\nSoftware based threat detection software based uh you know methods for\nAttacking information systems that are part of aircraft those things evolve at the speed of information technology which is much faster than hardware evolves a and so what they want from this next strategic bomber is that it be a not only rapidly available but rapidly available in several\nKey areas including defensive systems and so that speaks to the need for a\nA probably new forms of cognitive or electronic warfare capabilities and also a cognitive defensive capabilities which means\nThe ability a innate in terms of the software that's on the plane to detect new forms of radar detection that are being thrown at it and also to uh\nTo execute new forms of offensive or electronic warfare weapons delivery and that's on top of caring whatever payload\nIt needs to carry a but one of the things that they also are looking at is how this thing is going to operate alongside a bunch of other aircraft to create a sense of um\nUncertainty in in a potential adversary and that's that's also a big change from the way we used to think about nuclear deterrence right because\nThe to go back to your doctor Strangelove those uh bombers are flying to sort of you know send a message or by the fighter jets send a completely different message and now the the emphasis on creating a sense that hey you know with a I'm\nA long range strategic cruise missile\nA that is nuclear tipped it's possible to have a fighter jet that also serves in the\nFunction of a bomber um and that's something that they're talking about in in for a couple of years now they've been talking in an abstract way not in a formal way but in an abstract way about bringing some of that capability onto the thirty five\nPatrick ... what I understand they're they're treating air frames like the way Tesla treats its automobiles they don't actually touch the machine they upgrade with software that what they're thinking of here that is that the air frame remains the same but its capabilities will change as they write new software\nUm yeah basically that that that's not necessarily that that's the capability will improve with as soon as you press a button or you might have to install something new but it can improve pretty quickly and do your point though\nWhen David goldfish in General David ... who's the chief of staff the Airforce talks about what he once and future airplanes actually does bring up exactly what you just described he actually brings up Tesla and remote updating\nOf a core functioning of the ... of the systems on board\nBy virtue of just you give them a new payload and all of a sudden you've got an entirely new way of that aircraft injure facing with the pilots of communicating with a command and and really of accessing the world so that is something that\nThey want to move towards this is remote updating of a lot of different aspects of the way these planes function in terms of uh they're sort of the court brains on board\nWe turn and naturally just space act because basics right now is popular because it's building cheaper boosters first stage repeatable boosters that you can buy secondhand in third hand\nHowever now a debate emerges that I did not know about about space X taking orders for weaponized space as I understand that\nPatrick what's happened is that we're no longer debating should they be weaponized it is and it's going to be so the question is how are we going to respond is this a contract or in other words would add the Airforce be outsourcing its weaponized of space to go to space ex\nWell this was as\nAn interesting and I think sort of revealing moment that also occurred at the uh air forces recent confidence when ... well who are basically runs\nSpace acts on terms of the day to day operations there uh she's the president and and the c._e._o. or was asked if that space X would consider delivering weapons payloads into space and she said sure why not\nUm so it it gets into it it's a it's nothing that's become a contract yet but it does speak to a what\nIs the next stage of of the U.S putting things into space and there's a lot of push a particularly from like a girlfriend who's the under secretary of defense for research and engineering to put a lot more sensors in space and also potentially deport direct energy which is blazers or a neutral particle beams a weapons in\nSpace to attack missiles as they're launching during the boost ... this is something that he's talked about uh in terms of\nA potentially of great interest in an advantage to the United states so uh it's no longer so much of an abstract discussion at something that's becoming a a real discussion though not yet connected to a big change in policy where a lot of people are waiting for\nUm the new missile defense review come out to explain that but ... is an example of one of these new commercial private space players that's kind of seeing the writing on the wall in terms of the way one of the world's up probably world's largest space single space customer\nA is talking about what they want to do and and signaling that that's something that they're comfortable with but I you know even though you can say and I think that that certainly Defense Department folks do say that the weaponization\nOf space as it is a thing that is actively occurring that a Chinese anti satellite test which go back now more than ... years are very real and the the facts of them are are known to the entire world\nRussian a placement of\nA robotic entities in space that may serve an anti satellite functioned that's something that a more and more people are talking about and uh it's a matter of known intelligence at this point so even though you can say that the weaponization of space is something that's already happened the differences that China and Russia aren't yet acknowledging that that's something that they're doing\nWhereas the U.S policy seems to be a we're going to at some point announced the possibility of intentional\nPlacement of objects in space a which means that I don't know in many ways it sort of the worst of both worlds there kind of late to the game but they're the first one to take all the heat for it because there is a lot of concern internationally about whether or not that something that the international space treaty would

nearby starting just four million light years away\nWe're able to allow the existence of even fairly faint galaxies at at such this\nDid did we take all of its dust can is that a with a product of all the dust gathered in the local boy\nI think the way to view this is that over time over billions of years the galaxies attract what another through the gravity and the galaxy my foster right and the groups they attract other galaxies into their residences shall we say and the void\nAs a result\nAnd so you can look at\nThat's what's going on as galaxy clusters unfolded pulling in additional galaxies food that gravity you could also look at it as the voice victims there galaxies as the filament\nAttract those the void galaxies toward it so probably the reason that the local she is so very fit it simply because of the local voice has pushed\nThose galaxies has squeezed those galaxies into that sheet between a that local void in and the void on the other side of us so it's it's really a

second which as you correctly say it's one point four million miles per hour that's really fast\nBut okay if you compare that much faster than like going around the START I mean there goes around the sun it only thirty kilometers for second and the sun goes around the center of the Milky Way galaxy only two hundred and fifty kilometers for second so here we are\nThe entire local group of galaxies that's ... ... ... at all the other galaxies in the local group or all moving through the University of six hundred and thirty kilometers per second much faster than we go around the sun will go around the galaxy and the question is why\nWell it must be because there are huge cosmic structures out there that are trying to pull off their way or perhaps push us away at the local boy does what are these things but first let me talk about two other\nObjects that are a very important\nTo our motion one of them as a Virgo clusters of galaxies dislocated fifty four million light years from earth it's the nearest galaxy cluster to us and it's trying to pull us its way through its gravity also at a greater distance there's something called the great a tractor\nWhich is an even more massive clusters of galaxies at it too is trying to pull off its way in a different direction and then you've got the local boy which is what you asked about now Lloyd don't try to push ups and ... don't try to pull us\nThat way because there's very little matter in a void instead you can think of the local void as trying to push us away still the polls from the vertical cluster\nAnd the great attractive and a big push from the local boy explain ... through the universe is very high speed of six hundred and thirty ... kilometers per second so yes we do need to include the\nInfluence of the local avoid as we try to understand that very high speed that we have through the universe or as I say in the article in the sky telescope nothing really matters [noise]\nThe illustrations accompanying your sky telescope peace are revelations to me 'cause they're they're working on this scale and when we come to the local group of galaxies or how we move through space but surrounding us our super clusters or coma cluster the Hercules Cluster\nThe shape bleak concentration the ... cluster are those also exerting a poll upon us are we are we being bandied about by all of that the local is the local void moving because of all those clusters\nWell yes all of these structures are influencing our motion to the universe\nAnd so the clusters try every cluster tries to pull us it's way okay 'cause every clusters got galaxies and every galaxy has math than anything that has math that's got a gravitational pull so every clusters trying to polish pope pull off its way for the vertical cluster the\nEquator tractor the ... and they're all trying to pull\nTheir way and then the boys are trying to push us away because they've got less battered\nThe average and still the local boy this is pushing us away and so our motion to the universe is very high speed is hundred and thirty ... second\nIs is a result of all of those are great costs that cities and then at the end the dish into

to the backup\nThey have a the over the over time they have diagnose the primary computer they're not using it but they try to diagnose didn't figure it out with a bad memory was so that they think they can use it again and that's now crucial here because the backup computer that they're using [noise]\nI'm In the world is standing limited engineering data right now from a short term memory it

computers function they can't even get 'em uh the adventure records what's been going on to try to diagnose what the problem is so what the engineers who decided to do is to switch back to the first computer\nThe one that gave him trouble five years ago\nAnd use that to try to get a record of what happened so they can then diagnosed the problem on the backup computer they've been using for the last five years\nThis carries a little bit of risk because the old computer did have problems they say they've diagnosed it and they know exactly like they've isolated the bad um sections on the

but they've got no response from it now ... mid June\nUm they're hoping they think what's happened is that the it's ... it's solar panels have been covered with dust so it can't get enough energy even

curiosity or a ...\nRight now they are very careful but they're optimistic and I think that their optimism is unrealistic because they have the backup and they understand what's happening and they have\nCommunications with the rover and it's working so I think that their optimism curiosity is ... is is realistic but there's a risk\nWith opportunity they basically stated where we are uh if if those solar panels are covered and they're not getting any energy they're not going to hear from it until those pals get cleared and it could very well be months another month or two because
