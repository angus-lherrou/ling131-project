Callahan Fox News source close to it tells Fox News\nThe supplemental FBI background check into Supreme Court nominee judge Brett Kavanaugh could be wrapped up by late Wednesday potentially leading to a confirmation vote this weekend that hinges on three swing Republican votes and possibly some moderate Democrats\nProvides that ... a candidate did get to keep the the process resolution um arrangement that they wanted I don't think that's a huge deal uh so uh on the it seems to me looking at it for several weeks now this really was about as good as it could\nGet and it is necessary for the Congress to approve this next year and I that's why I Believe that the attention to detail about where the cars must be manufactured\nAnd how much of it must be manufactured in the high wage countries if Canada in the United states I Believe that's anticipating a the Democratic votes\n... this is what Trump campaigned on he wanted to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United states this will help that\nBecause among other things that does require higher wages to be paid in countries like Mexico or or actually specifically in Mexico which gives them less of an advantage now\n... you know how this all sorts out in terms of international competition auto makers are going to have to figure out how to uh not let their costs go way up so that become uncompetitive that's the flip side of raining in this kind of outsourcing to Mexico and other cheap\nLabor markets but you know what they're going to have to do that and probably they'll do it partly through automation which may\nOr remove some of the advantages for American workers but going forward I think the important thing was to get a deal inked now we have that and now Trump can turn its attention to the eight you enter Japan the big issue as we have discussed before or one of the big issues anyway it's\nGetting all of our trading partners in agreement that the WTO needs to be reformed\nTo rein in the bad practices of China China is still treated as a developing nation also the WTO has no rules that regulate the kind of state owned enterprises that figure so largely in China's economy they\nCan cheat legally if you will because the WTO has no rules to prevent them from doing that it's incredibly important we get that done and I think now that's what Lighthizer and these guys are going to turn their intentions to\nLose I've been having conversations about doing business in China with people who travel there frequently it is surprising and dumped founding\nTo hear how aggressive the Chinese capitalists are shaking down and pirating and leaning on anyone doing business in China it is surprising and discouraging to hear how the Chinese government offers free factories\nTo ah to companies to invest in China to bring businesses to China and those free factories become the hook where your your prayed to the supply chain it is surprising an alarming Liz do understand that citizens who traveled to China are routinely minded and watched and persecuted\nAnd must be very careful about how they speak I Do not believe that the Trump Administration has done a good job here communicating to the American people\nThat China is not a capitalist state is its piracy and brutalizes anybody who does business there\nWell I think you raise a really good points but by the way that's going on for Twenty years I mean this is not a new\nIssue I remember reading a book ten or Fifteen Years ago about a fellow doing business in China and he laid out all the things you talked about how it works how you go in set up shop at a local partner two years later you find that local partners taken you know how and built an exact replica of your plant down the road and it's under selling you it isn't\nIt there is nothing honest about the way people do business in China I don't think that's an exaggeration\nAmericans go in there because of the way we are brought up because the way our economy works expecting fair play they do not get that and I uh you know their secrets or stolen by the way the first\nStudy on that intellectual property theft that we've all talked so much about that was done in two thousand three again these are not new problems the good news in my view is that Donald Trump is finally\n... sorting uh businesses and the country to stand behind him as he confronts China because by the way the stakes have gotten significantly higher we're not talking\nAbout a country that is knocking off the way we make T shirts anymore now the country has knocking off are very most sophisticated artificial intelligence our programming\nOr chip companies everything else they want to dominate they've made it they have a program laid out in ... called made in China twenty twenty five they wanted dominate high tech and they will use pirated a means to accomplish that goal so\nI agree with you a hundred percent I think it's\nAlarming but it's not surprising ... the only thing that surprising is the way businesses react after they've been in China for a couple of years they find out that they've been duped but you know what the good news is the message is getting out\nUh I don't you know I think that ah the chamber of commerce crew has finally figured out that this is not a place where they're going to make a lot of money because China won't let them\nAnd and they are perfectly the the interesting thing is a little bit culturally it's perfectly OK in China you're supposed to be brass knuckles fighters for your\nAnd your enterprise and that's what they are\nAnd yet our Liz is it popular known that if the PLO you're dealing with when it comes to technology and high tech and the intellectual property is it properly known that wall way is a function of appeal way they're they're they're spies they're they're\nThey're they Rob everything they touch is that popularly known I I'm not sure I I'm I'm kind of was dumbfounded as to what I've just been listening to\n[noise] I don't think uh no I don't think it's well known but I Do think as if it's frankly a people read the news with any care\nThey will find out more and more about what's going on in China you know for years I Would occasionally get an email from some university professor saying we had a Chinese delegation come to visit our University of Michigan Tech lab or whatever\nAnd I'm pretty sure that those guys stole documents that was just routine we had I mean honestly I don't think anything has been safe or sacred and our dealings with the Chinese I Do think people are waking up to it and by the way now again as to the stakes having been\nIncreased we also have these confrontations in the south\nChina Sea which are getting a little more attention now very alarming a nachos to Americans but to the entire region I mean I you know this is a country and particularly ... paying\nA who has been become incredibly aggressive and\nOn all fronts militarily economically et cetera the good news is what you do hear coming back is the Chinese are afraid of Donald Trump they think that he is unbridled a and aggressive and heat that they really does mean business so was it that really\nWill provoke any kind of changing their behavior I don't\nKnow the U.S embassy a alarm them with what you read of that I mean they they believe they could buy your I guess they think they can buy Canada as well\nI think that's true I I think they felt that\nThat Donald Trump was sort of a blunder bust and he was sort of wrecking all these trade arrangements making people angry all over so they had instituted a charm offensive particularly with the e you trying to make sure that we did not partner with the EU which Japan with South Korea\nIn trade agreements and again with reforming the WTO in ways that would disadvantage that Chinese I think they were very\nUh ... I think they were optimistic remember\nOh I think six to eight months ago they profit for some\nPretty mild a terror of a reduction in ... and thinking I think thinking that that was going to be that that they would ... you know that are\nUm a posturing versus them was sort of play acting and all they needed to say was here's some concessions instead of twenty percent or import duties on soybeans is ten and that's not the right product but it was things like that and\nAll and the Trump Administration turn right around and said no that's not sufficient and I think that really set them back on their heels because there used to American politics and politicians who don't\nDo what they say and do say what they mean a and I think this has been a real education I go back to the first time is easing paying met with Donald Trump or a member of that weekend at mar a Lago\nChuck where ... yeah\nYeah where he ... he excused himself from dinner and basically a allowed us to bomb Syria in a very very obvious message to the Chinese that we mean business and that there's a new sheriff in town and I I think that message was received loud and clear\nLoose peek a shoes that Fox News and she writes for the hill as well and when we come back the domestic news which is led by the stock market doing very well at the beginning of the fourth quarter I'm John bachelor this is the John ...

S. M. C. A. this is the new agreement for North America the three democracies of North America Larry a very good evening to you and congratulations to you and everyone at the Trump Administration\nWho delivered Canada to fit in with the jet solve puzzles that is North America along with Mexico\nI Want to speak to the facts to the U. S. MCA a ... ... ... and in a moment but first trade coalition of the willing it has the ring of a Kudlow invention what does it mean Larry good evening to\nJohn want to be back well look quite simply um\n[noise] what you're seeing now with our our called them renewed relations trade relations with the European Union\nAnd Japan uh we by the white signed day try apartheid agreement at the un meeting last week a forming a coalition a against all the um\nChinese missteps\nIllegals protections feeling you know I ... ... technology transfers a tariffs non tariff barriers so its balance that out very plainly that's the first time\nThe big powers a huge fan of the U.S I've actually come together in a statement\nA which was issued up at the un um the bachelor Lighthizer night one for the press as soon as we got it okay that was a major move and then of course quickly this week we moved to the U.S MCA I gotta learn how to say that you are right called NAFTA\nWhich is actually quite an extensive agreement I'm not sure folks appreciate what's gone on ... problem is China right that's the center of the broken trading system\nAnd we are now on the same page uh in fact that even that the Canadian prime minister Trudeau with President Trump in a in a phone call uh yesterday I talked about how to deal\nWith um unfair trade practices from outside North America so everybody's pretty much on the same track right now and I I think it's a terrific turn for the better and um it's oh it's well you know heart going\nTrade negotiations probably the toughest thing I've ever seen but nonetheless we are in prosperity and I believe these trade deals are going to help grow that prosperity and I'm trying to get the message I Can't be sure but I Hope they do\n[noise] I'm counting Larry twenty eight countries in the European Union ah UK I'm going to include in the twenty eight for the moment Japan and the three\nCountries of North America that's thirty two altogether thirty two democracies\n... uh at this point stating to China that you must mend your ways that you are in violation of the WTO\nLarry there's no exaggerating China they have been brutal towards everyone for the last decade decade this is an old problem that the Trump Administration inherited\nFrom the Bush the Clinton the Bush and the Obama administration and you're the first team that stood up to China and China is speechless at this point thirty two democracies saying no more\n[noise] yes well it's a very important the way you put that\nSome people are blaming President Trump\nA for using all it means that its disposal including tariffs that's always part of negotiations but the reality is dumped by Trump he inherited this and he's trying to fix it\nYou'd like to get rid of tariffs and non tariff barriers and so what I like to have fair trade again he'd like to have reciprocal trade and he liked to have China wipe out\nThe rules which they do not do and having for about Twenty years or as you mentioned other presidents\nHave mentioned it but they always back off\nA President Trump has the backbone as my full support in this and I think you know we may come out of this on the other side and very good shape that may be a tremendous boom took a world economy but it's very important that the allies I've got a call the allies John ... huge and us\nMexico and Canada make their trade deal we upgraded and modernize NAFTA now a we're making our trade deal and we're making our statement and I can only hope that China will listen we're willing to negotiate it off to China\nIn any serious way so far it's been quite unsatisfactory but we'll see\nLarry China's violation of the WTO is not the whole of it this piracy practiced with brutal tactics of anybody trying to do business in China sapped of intellectual property is part of it but also everyone going to China's watched there's intimidation this is not the China Hu Jintao not that China\nDoes the beginning of the century this to Xi Jinping's a tyranny in practice now also being aggressive geopolitically the confrontation with the U.S has Decatur these last days\nI Believe that what you at the Trump Administration are doing is not only talking about trade Larry you're talking about piece of the planet you're talking about a a rogue nation that has to be that has to comply with international law limits\nWhether I'm not China scholar I'm learning fast on the job but I Will say that the brilliant reforms\nBoth the market reforms the trade reforms and the political reforms that were lost by ... years ago uh eighties nineties right or twenties to a two thousand that stopped yes that stopped I'm under President Xi and that's most regrettable\nAnd I think a lot of people including myself think they're moving in the wrong direction I mean for example just in the trade economic sphere\nWhy biggest problems is American companies and it's true by the way other not America these companies want to open in China they are not permitted ownership\nChina insists on these so called joint ventures which are in most cases provides them with fifty one hundred and fifty three or fifty five percent ownership us as a minority stake color white there is a huge problem\nFor the simple reason that the Chinese owners can command the American business people to literally lay down their blueprints\nOn the desk and from there the technology opens up and that's how they do the stealing and that is a force\nYeah what you see the polarization where are the Democrats numbers with women are a strike today or I look for example end up at a Senate race there Dean Heller is a Republican incumbent tried to seek re election or maybe the only Republican incumbent\nTo lose and that's because there's an enormous gender gap for me to that state shots elites among men by about four points but he trails by women about fourteen but we look at more productively red states across America\nAnd here the Democrats have problems I was looking at the north Dakota for example today I kept a democratic senator up for reelection Kevin O's approval they're sixty percent of North Dakota in space he should be put on the court um they look at the issues North Dakota's care about most is our job is Kevin\n... leads the economy he hardly healthcare here for at least immigration so that's a problem for a priority high camp you go to West Virginia John and there's a problem for Joe mansion state that Donald Trump's visit up five times in part to put pressure\nOn match situations like this is ... votes for cabinet ... says he'll win race by about twenty five to thirty points but if she votes against\nCabinet John that lead shrinks to all of two points so very simple for any votes for Kavanaugh game over fifty votes against kept to a game on so this is a very problematic calculation red state Democrats right now\nOne more twist bill I've been told by David Tucker my colleague at Washington Examiner that a democratic operative mentioned to him last week sort of mumbled out of the side of his mouth ironically that the thing to fear for the Democrats as an empty seat on November sixteenth on the court does that make sense to you\nA political act\nUm in other words Kevin ... is not confirmed and the Supreme Court remains at eight seats and that the future is unknown and his Democratic operative was anxious because that would encourage a reaction from the Republicans I guess we're already seeing it it doesn't have to be empty\nOut to be empty\nI did it I think it's two things here number one just the way they've played this game last minute dropping those commission on hand at six to extremely personal that frustrates Republicans but secondly John when you look at survey after survey what motivates Republicans and Democrats the Supreme Court\nIs a bigger issue for Republicans and Democrats plain and simple so uh the issue of Merrick Garland for example you would think Democrats would have been raised to twenty sixteen about miracle and it turned out numbers to punish Donald Trump Republicans but that didn't happen but you're twenty Eighteen this issue does drive Republicans look post\nTurnout in Texas this is ... congressman and Ted Cruz senator and I keep seeing pictures on Twitter of these enormous crowds so has something changed from the red state of Texas\nThey do the work is sort of the beautiful ... people's candidate of the great state of Texas is doing big rallies Willie Nelson those ... rallies and it's all kind of the great progressive could buy a moment but here's the problem ... is very popular a spot Willie Nelson he likes to go on the likes of bill ... Bill Maher show on HBO\nBut it remains to be able to Texas is that progressive there is a month ago and that race Ted Cruz is going to spend a lot of money as they try to introduce federal work at a very negative light to Texas voters but simple leveraging voting to Texas John but there's a governor's race sitting on top of the Senate race\nThe governor has been very popular incumbent Republican seeking reelection he'll win this race by Fifteen to twenty points it's very difficult job to go for a Republican wedding by Fifteen or twenty two a Democrat upsetting Republican and covered so I don't think Texas what's this time but it's just a narrative that the media love the idea of Texas somehow being democratic\nYou remind all of us that the voting is already underway does that favor either side\n[noise] um it it's almost for Republicans in Florida in particular where you look at Miami Dade County which Democrats need to uh to win the gubernatorial Senate races that state and turnout is up sharply or I should say the requests early palaces up shortly so that that\nAs long as the Republicans look at the question of your of your walk up or if he was a day folks\nNow this is the Trump strategy and twenty six team not to put a lot of trust in the early voting\nThe Clinton campaign did the Trump campaign daughter would get a large walk up voting succeeded very well for them so the question is can be a couple of kids do it again in twenty Eighteen ... it's very hard to do it ...\nWe also turned to the year of the woman or the look for the woman you mentioned in your Forbes peace now there is a woman candidate in Tennessee Marsha Blackburn but she's facing a centrist Democrat at least did he passes for a centrist these days\nPhil Bredesen so are the advantages to women when their democratic candidates and not to Republican when they're women Kennedy\nYeah it does work that way for Republicans ... part because of the so called war one in ... the Democratic trope up Marsha Blackburn as a couple of problems uh one is that she is part of the system she's part of Washington and former governor British citizen not so he's running as an outsider\nSecondly it's interesting you look at her on the stump in terms of talking about a couple of trips to Washington She's not talking about well the one thing that the house has done this year which was a tax cut she she stopped bringing that up\nThe decision is made at the major networks that the evening shows especially the show that is popular on CBS I Believe I don't watch the bill I might get this wrong it's going to cover the election as if they're the election desk is this a good thing for the Democrats or a confusing things for voters in general\nOr this is the Daily Show we're talking about which the comedy channel at\nA Comedy Central and this is a bad thing for Republicans secret barge jock like several things have come along in the past twenty five thirty years what you've just test like poison the well politically one obviously being the Internet and yet it Twitter and so forth which next you know\nCollege acting more cowardly\nUm but I think also the advent of John Stewart too I have no personal against the gets but the problem is this is where young people turn to quote unquote losing their probation and he's meditate or not ... they're so young people to form their political views on what is very snide sarcastic reporting it makes them more cynical about the process so I Would just encourage young people just\nLook elsewhere for the news just don't buy the citizens of the\nBill in the next day the Mitch McConnell the majority leader in the Senate says that he's going to bring cabin off for a vote on the floor of the Senate up or down at this point I ever have any special information\nIs that going to be forgotten issue the way we forgot that op ed in the New York times about somebody inside the Trump Administration trying to undermine the president ... the way we've forgotten about all the other scandals unless they're in front of a sad day are we going to forget capital\nYou just all my life I was going to say John two weeks ago you and I are pondering who wrote that in order to start writing the ... and\nNow what I Know I think capital sticks because I think this gets to the heart of a of a central question Republicans the idea of the court the idea of legislative from the bench as something that really does to find the right versus the west so I don't think this one goes away is a campaign issue\nAnd therefore the vote on friday will be remembered both sides will use it in advertising they'll pound is with a cabin all if Kavanaugh forever the court goes away but Kavanaugh is with us is that it\nOr they Kevin O's with this job because Kevin I worked very well for the Democrats terms of votes in the house in terms of suburban districts the one of those folks but it works very well for Republicans had red states so you know what does the Donald Trump thinks he can always get what you what you get what you need both parties get what they need\nFinal consideration has Russia gate disappeared bill you notice I didn't ask about it is it gone roses scene vanish\nWhat has been it gets keep cutting post told the truck um that's one of the variables in terms of October surprise that this could happen trouble of actually meet with him what Trump decides to fire him called the election\nNo no no no not you're not going to happen I I I I I think we've forgotten Russia get Bill I I'm the only I mean I my shall

always say if you get caught we will get you out\nYou may sit in jail for five years we will leave Iraq and that's how the swaps came about right John rash recall it\nIt was great ball was recruited some time in Nineteen Ninety six by an unknown and he was exchanged in the twenty first century and we get and the British gave back one of their recruits say it was a it was an even exchange and he was living peacefully we're told under the protection of the British Government\nBut the point here is is that if the side that\nSwaps the spy then\nTries to kill the spy when is biased safely on the other side the whole validity of the intelligence services saying the person we will get you out is not applied it it undermines recruitment and boot and\nWatched a career intelligence officer would notice more than any body so it never made any sense a and it still doesn't make any sense but let's go to what unfortunately seems to make sense to me and that is the new Cold War\nAnd you and I start calling that the new Cold War almost five years ago it's not so new it's been getting worse\nWhile we've been distracted by judge Kavanaugh all and all the astonishing exploits of his high school years but when you go back and look at what's happened\nJust during the Kavanaugh hearings in the new Cold War it's really astonishing the extremism\nThat's come over the American political class policymakers I find extremely alarming you gave some examples in your broadcast a threatening to attack Russian missile site\nTake out take a hike out that was done by the American ambassador to NATO right and it was it wasn't somebody on pension down in you know Des Moines forgive me to wind\nBut that's a very high ranking and militarized figure the ambassador to NATO um we have I think you also said that a number of the United states government\nSecretary of the interior Ryan Zinke right yeah\n... threatening naval blockade against Russia that's threatening war\nYou have senators John we've forgotten them but two weeks ago they were promising and they're working on today quote\nCrippling economic sanctions against Russia that's called economic war so you're getting these definitions of war I Want to give you one example the pains me a little but it's so last trip that I think we have to realize what's happened to our policy will eat\nI like all McFaul for many years and he's a very nice guy\nBut it's got to be said that he was Bible Haitian a full professor of Russian studies at Stanford University a very prominent you know university and later President Obama's not only Russia hand in the White House but his ambassador to Moscow for two years\nSo this isn't this may be the leading public American authority on Russia at least the media trades seem that way a diplomat and bashed her\nA scholar he is now saying because one counts on people like look fall to stay calm and to avoid extremism but he is now saying\nA in an article in the Washington Post on September twenty eight just a few days ago that won Russia's now the greatest threat in the entire world the greatest threat\nThat the only way to react to a knack permanent escalating sanctions that will automatically uh be implemented whenever Russia does something wrong in other words this term that warfare it's not sanctions\nSpecifically directed anything but it's a whole new policy upon that escalating sanctions and he gives one example that I don't know why is editors didn't query him about this but he says it every day Russia\nHelps the rebels and they're done boss region of Ukraine where there's a civil war sanctions should escalate\nSo three hundred and sixty five days a year sanctions should ask to escalate on Russia that this is a form of extremism\nMaybe in the fall they made it but it reflects what's come over our political class in regard to Russia and I find it all I almost unprecedented one thing that should be added here\nI don't know if there's an analog in history maybe it wasn't McCarthy Era but this thing we call Russia gate I think you'd agree John it didn't exist when you when I started under the rubric of the new Cold War in two thousand and fourteen\nKnown was invented it entirely after the election of twenty sixteen entirely\nWell I I Would argue a little bit it was growing before the election because you remember Mrs Clinton during the debate into sixteen called Trump pollutants puppet so this this story was already out there we know that the famous dot CA by Christopher Steele of so called a\nHigh Kremlin dirt on truck was being leaked to the media to sixteen that's just average DSM through through the FBI but the point I Want to make here\nIs that ... with historians look back\nAnd write the history of this Cold War and this assumes\nThat when this Cold War ... they're still will be historians that it doesn't become a nuclear war or when they write it the way we've been writing the history of the other Cold War which is a big\nHistorical industry new books with pure all the time they're going to note and maybe be amazed by the fact that Russia gate has become part of the new Cold War\nIn two senses it affects the weight Trump can and cannot make policy toward Russia but Russia gate to the extent that it's believed in this country\nAnd I guess the numbers are about fifty fifty people who believe Russia gate demonize is Russia because it accuses Russia all having attacked\nUs during the presidential election into sixteen and now this is a point I wanted to make [noise] we have a series of publication\nIn the New York times ten thousand words a supplement uh in the Washington Post must be five thousand words in the New Yorker magazine by Jane Mayer of various steamed reporter\nWhere the story has

Russians will operate it not sure what it's a powerful system we don't have anything like it experts agree that it has multiple in the capacity to shoot down multiple aircraft over something like\nI don't know two hundred and fifty five hundred I mean it has an enormous range\nIn a fact\nWho could declare a no fly zone over\nThis area of Syria now so this changes everything\nThe Americans are operating there the Iranians are operating there the Israelis oh this is a very big decision he so far as I Know has never given any country\nThere's also for hundreds system which the Chinese one and he may give it to the Chinese but that's a separate relationship\nUh Americans are not in a Chinese combat so\nSteve I talked with them is a former Israeli generally know leads a think tank in Tel Aviv\nAnd he indicated the as three hundred system if deployed and there's some question whether it will be deployed because they've talked this way before if deployed would be in the hands of Russian agents only not given to the Syrians\nThat still doesn't solve the possibility of accident but it does remove the possibility that there'll be another incident such as a couple of weeks back there was a twist here\nIf that system is deployed around or in the vicinity of Iranian missile factories which I Believe was the target for the Israeli air raid that led to the Syrian firing missiles in all directions\nThat means that the Russians will be in a being a place where they have to decide if they're going to stand down\nPending an Israeli air raid it's not a good story Steve it's not going in and meet fashion\nWell let's look at first of all this look at the political applications\nIt means now officially that Russia's become the protectorate of Syria correct\nCompletely correct politically it was a protectorate\nThat is to say putting would representing Assad the president of Syria in world affairs now assuming this has got to be a no fly zone you'll need Russia's permission to fly operation\nWhat must not happen is an American or Israeli airstrike kill a Russian that must not happen\nWell that's why I say we now moved to a new level\nAnd the dangers of the new Cold War while we're sorting out the cabin and all that we've been distracted but this is really something new and important the second thing it tells you is that if you waive the geo political things in terms of victory and loss is\nI don't like to do it but there's no question that when ... entered Syria three just about exactly three years ago September two thousand this thing and everybody in the west that it would be a disaster and the Russians couldn't do anything\nWebsite to follow all the updates on the new Cold War we've been catching up over these last week an item that\nDoes not feature in a headline yet is that the U.S coast guard at the direction of the president and the Trump Administration is deploying to one hundred and ten foot long patrol craft one care they carry a weapon in front and their warships if your a smuggler\nTo you you pray why there is a place called the sea of as a steep what is the the ... why is it now going to become a battle space between Russia and NATO\n[noise] so there's this geography all Russia annexed Crimea\nWhich is a financial with no natural land border with Russia\nExcept through your crying and the Ukraine border has been closed So Russia has had to supply Crimea it's very expensive either by air or sea about four months ago books or seen the TV footage of it it was very dramatic\nRussia's been building I think is fourteen mile bridge I don't know if it's the longest bridge in the world is a very long bridge from southern Russia to Crimea\nAnd it's going to have as I understand it three bridges actually won for automobiles one for trucks and one will be for trains the one for\nTrucks I think I've got this right open five months ago and ... the first truck truck a trunk of a truck across the one for automobiles so like if I wanted to go to Russia and visit Crimea I can now drive a\nWouldn't have to apply\nThat to be open and I think being rail bridge is probably about Eighteen months away that means that the port of ... now you and I talked about or you will remember this\nI Do remember there was an offensive a drunk driving and Mario pull that right a big guns rattled in those last week the hot war\nWell that's right into fourteen when the civil war began a following the fall of Ukraine's president but Don square and the uprising Mary ...\nWas taken by the rebels it's a very very important seaport maybe the most important in Ukraine and I'm not sure but it's very very important and the rebels held it for about two weeks and then the Ukrainian army controlled by Kiev took it back and controls it today [noise]\nSo since the bridge has been Russia has become very interested in the sea lanes of Mary ... some of the sea about his off which is a tributary of the black sea the whole region is the black sea\nUh Russia has been moving\nWarships and I guess these little boats whatever you call them these patrol boats into the area and it's been stopping certain\nBlack burying ships and examining what's on board them Ukrainian Turkish French I think\nRussia has said this is our water now are ... and and legal or if it stays a certain number of miles from Mary ... borders at whatever age three miles or twelve miles but it's been a\nRandomly stopping ships the president of Ukraine ... who has single digit support and is up for reelection quite soon in March I think next year has declared he's going to come from a\nIn the ... see Russia where his naval power which Ukraine doesn't add much there are some ships and these two ships that the United states sent to Ukraine you told me John really are ... are patrol though\nUnless you're a ... unless you're a smuggler no they wouldn't have thought of another warship\nBut the significance of this in my mind is it's been dangerous enough in Ukraine but it's been frozen\nThe fighting has been going on in done boss off the line that divides a gun boss from Kiev control Ukraine has meant that the fighting has been spilled into this other part of Ukraine\nCivil war has been kind of remote\nFrom people that goes on people die every day uh the Kiev armies still shells during the day when kids go to school they're not supposed to but all reports say that they do they're all sorts of proposals to end this war but this is an escalation because it now could become award see and ...\nWhich is a I'm not sure I pronounce it that you Mary ... is terribly terribly important and Russia will now uh bring pressure to bear there\nAs it feels it has a right and Ukraine depending on what Washington does a will do something so we can see here now on water\nThe an ad immigration of foreshadowing or the kind of catastrophe that took place in September in Syria where people died now in this case it's Ukrainian and Russians\nDo the difference between them is often hard to tell\nMost Russians most Ukrainians speak Russian uh as well as Ukrainian so this is a new emerging hot spot in the new Cold War and it couldn't get much worse very quickly depending on what Trump does\nAnd here is a question in my mind that we probably won't discuss tonight and you probably know the answer but I Do [noise]\nWho is making these policies as Washington\nBecause Trump clearly\nDoesn't want a war for a policy with Russia\nAnd yet look at all the quotations and examples that you cited today and recording by officials of the American government they're very warfare Trump clearly is not in control of Russia balls in Washington so why are we have this new and I think more dangerous Cold War\nWe have an almost unprecedented situation in Washington where the president whatever we think about him\nIs not in control entirely at least a policy toward Russia which raises the question who then is just to post script and I'll quit you'll remember I'm sure they didn't to sixteen President Obama got it in his mind to cooperate with Russia against terrorists in Syria\nAnd they struck an agreement secretary of defense carry one to Moscow note with Clinton shook hands\nIt was destroyed by the department of defense which attack Syrian troops and that was the end of that so it's not without precedent conflict or opposition or perhaps sabotage that President Trump faces when he tries to quote cooperate with Russia\nDavid detail here to mention for another week but perhaps oil is above eighty eight above eighty five and I'm told by people who watch it as professionals that is headed towards a hundred dollars Sudan is not in a bad way if oil goes to a hundred dollars do you agree we have thirty seconds\nRussia's federal budget is and the plus\nWith oil at sixty this is this is world prices are rising right to Russia is well above that now but I Will ask your question all water and the world would possess this minister this as

Street Journal member of the editorial board\nRiding most recently of Columbia this is a long and tragic story of a nation that has been ripped apart by narco terrorism gangsters for many decades and the resolution is not as hand if I follow Mary supporting carefully marry a very good evening to\nThe theory was the Nobel Prize winning former President Santos one man well Santos\nHad resolved the drug wars in Colombia and throughout the new world\nWith a peace deal hammered out in Havana under the age of the Castro regime\nAnd that that would lead to consequences that could return the A L ledge gangsters back to Colombian civic society and I was a quill the threat overhanging Columbia these many years but it's a nation turn in half by cocaine your\nColumn points to disruption in this chiefly because the former gangsters the FARC the revolutionary group\nAre not complying or have completely violated their promises and it appears that the new president in Colombia is incapable of enforcing the document in some fashion a very good evening to marry is this a tragedy now or is this a tragedy to being averted in Columbia\nWell good evening John I think the main problem with this so called peace agreement is that the people who were supporting it on a\nBasically bought into the idea that the FARC\nOr this revolution at these revolutionary guerrillas were purely a political group\nAnd they ignore the fact that in the Nineteen eighties they began drug trafficking extortion operations kidnapping operations and important link Columbia illegal mining operations these are businesses where they made millions of dollars\nAnd so from the eighties until today they kind of converted themselves from this political organization into a organized crime I unit\nAnd I'm so Santos go brings them all to Havana and has this so called\nPeace agreement that he does with him he doesn't extract any concessions from them\nHe doesn't make them hand over the money that they made they say we don't have any money he says okay that's fine then\nHe doesn't make them do any jail time he says okay you can go off to these little farms in rural areas where you'll be confined for some period of time where are you will then you can fast your crimes to I'm\nA to a special a peace court\nAnd then you can be reintegrate into society ignoring the fact that these guys are basically mobsters\nAnd I'm a ... which is not to say that I don't think they still have a political agenda but their political agenda is tied to expanding their business is OK so this idea that they were going to\nOut of the businesses and they were gonna do regular jobs [noise] um I think was never really believable I thought it was laughable and you know you know that over the years I wrote very strongly against\nMaking these concessions to these guys who have a whole a history of atrocities and human rights violations against the civilian population of the country\nSo here we are you know I'm not quite two years I mean I'll be two years in November that they've signed these peace agreements and what do we find we find\nThousands of members who were FARC guerrillas so we're supposed to go they said the rank and file guys they were supposed to go to these rural enclave hand themselves and\nSpend time there confess their crimes et cetera they're returning to the battlefield they're returning to the battlefield because they're fighting against\nOther armies illegal armies that have come in\nTo the space where they were and taking over the cocaine business and they're sitting there going wait a minute we're going to sit in these camps were going to get real jobs that pay minimum wage and these guys are still going to be making the money away so they have gone back to the battlefield that's one problem the second problem which ...\nIn mind is even worse is the fact that the head honcho Z who were sitting in the event\nOf negotiating the deal [noise]\nUm have been found are alleged to be still and the cocaine business and I can talk a little bit more about that but the point is they don't want to get out of the business so it's not that the current president\nYou know doesn't want to enforce the deal but in order to enforce the deal or to go to to complete the deal to implement the deal he needs the FARC which signed off on it\nTo do what it said it would do and guess what\nWhat has surprised you know these criminals are not keeping their work\nThe complaint right now you report is from the Colombia's attorney general to present attorney general Nestor Umberto marching in March he knows\nThat the FARC has not complying with the peace agreement and ... and worse in the special piece court they are making a ... or they're making a farce of is there who they're wrong falsely testifying and couldn't concocting documents\nNo uh Martinez has the power of the state and the new president I've been doing okay I can exercise power in some fashion is he limited in in some important ways he politically compromise or to in order to prosecute these complaints by his own attorney general\n[noise] well no I think the attorney general could prosecute them but I think what becomes clear when you when you read about that allegation is the same\nOld tired whole problem with trying to police this this drug trafficking which is that they make a lot of money in this business and what do they use that money for they buy weapons they recruit soldiers\nAnd they corrupt and bribe a law enforcement and institutions inside the country Colombia's courts are very much corrupted by drug money\nAnd this is just an example I mean the the special piece court was supposed to be you know or the one where would interview them and find out what their crimes were and write them all down and this is going to be a way to sort of have a cleansing a spiritual cleansing of the country because everything would be out in the open and the criminals would have
