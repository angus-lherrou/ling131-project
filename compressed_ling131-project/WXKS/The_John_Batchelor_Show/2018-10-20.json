whole of gala\nGala is a worldwide information company it does it end through digital signs\nVery large and very small digital signs for information but that leads us to the question of global information flow and what creates conditions\nFor prosperity or retreat from prosperity where the moment now where the Financial Times is is debating what the next recession will look like so very good evening to you Chris before we got into the next recession\nLet us discuss something that has you you've made available to me and I'm fascinated with the global competitive missed report of twenty Eighteen this is from the world Economic Forum some of its conventional wisdom but some of it identifies the tools\nThat prosperous economy use in order to compete with their neighbors and also those same tools can be used by less prosperous countries uh to get ahead or what is your general reaction to this competitive\nJob of really showing that as\nThe economies around the world continue to move into what could be called the ... revolution which technology sensors artificial intelligence\nAll of the really cool things that the tech revolutions last twenty thirty forty years have yielded that fireman fostering the creative class within those environments in key things the enabling environment\nThe market ability to succeed or fail the human capital the innovation environments within and that\nThe advantages that certain countries have had a over the last several years economically of low cost labor or low cost factories are others are now really being trumped by the\nCulture and the environment that are available at some of the most competitive a economies where you have the most uh centric environment for information technology workers innovation risk taking and it's really building that right petri dish to create the right conditions that's helping use a condom use six eight\nI'm struck by the fact that this is not a zero sum game that candidate and the United states exist ... co exist comfortably on the same land mass and both do very well in competitiveness and that's the same for Western Europe so there's no reason to beg or your neighbor here in order to be prosperous [noise]\nAbsolutely you you can have ... where\nAll boats to the rising tide lifts all boats if you go to the old Mao Susie an argument that uh you get to a population in the world to no longer sustain or an energy consumption level at the world can no longer sustain it never took into account technology\nAnd the evolution of technology being able to provide prosperity such at your Serbian consumer survey consumers demand and that can open up a\nLimitless possibilities from an economic perspective and from a societal benefit perspective where it's not\nA win and be loses both a and B can win and went together\nTo relieve everybody's anxiety the U.S does very well okay fine good we're very we're very good at it but what do we learn what are we good at and why and there are plenty of room for improvement here so I go to the questions that the competitiveness\nA document a asks towards the closed for all of us to debate these don't have answers these are observations and their anecdotal and therefore up and we'll go through them as best we can is there a formula for innovation or can you plug it in\nA do institutions matter\nA is prosperity\nPossible alongside people and the planet or do we have to ruin the environment and turn people into which sites and finally\nShould countries pursue openness or do you is control of markets command economy the way forward there you can immediately think of anecdotes so I'll ask you Chris because you travel so widely is there a formula now having read the competitive as\nA survey is there one formula that works in their ... pillars here are indie administrative security or is there any combination that you've found magic\n[laughter] I think the biggest thing that we see and we do business in the tech world\nDidn't twenty countries around the globe and have developers and twenty countries around the globe those environments that are free open an open means open to succeed or open to fail\nBut they create an educated populace that free to innovate and risk take the more than a society can reward or enable benefit for risk takers the more people will take those risks the more that there is freedom for innovation less central planning less government\nIntervention they're free or the better and technology is is one of those pursuits that you really want to be able to say I have an idea have the ability to chase that was smart people with enough capital to pursue that and having the environment the best thing that government can do tend\nCreate the conditions for success but governments can't mandate success when it comes to tech when it comes to that interaction between tech and consumers\nI'm struck by a little detail here that Korea South Korea and Japan are lab roads because of what the report identifies as it has a ... as a hesitation built on they don't like uncertainty\nAnd R and D is all about uncertainty and trying and failing certainly that that describes our our our wizards the last hundred years I can you measure and can you think of another country to other countries that are prosperous and the top twenty who are hesitant about uncertainty Chris\n[noise] I think the greatest one that we would say is you see some of the hesitancy in Western Europe France as an example failure can be a a real challenge their society as well as from a government perspective not only the the disregard or dislike for failure but the\nPunitive penalties for success in an environment like France if your going into attacking you have an entrepreneurial bent the first thing that you plot is how do you exit France because God Forbid you should be successful\nThe government is not your partner the government is you're over lord at the taxation level and you have an incentive not to be successful in economies like that where the taxes are truly confess ...\n\nI've joined us just as the bachelor show this segment brought to you by scholars scholars leading marketing technology company powers millions of digital signs around the world meeting the wave of retail transformation\nVisit scholar dot com today to modernize your digital experience and I go to the global and American business report it combined with John ... most recent real clear markets where he edits because John is addressing a story that is now in much in debate\nBy American protect American\nMake certain that good don't come into America from the outside and also people from other countries don't come into America from the outside immigration under control H. one B. visas more difficult to obtain John very good evening to you you begin with the anecdote\nOf the people who put together air conditioners once upon a time Willis Carrier nights you know to\nAnd you connect that to a Wall Street journal op ed that ran most recently by Richard Florida and he and a half away\nAnd these two don't exist together job there is there is a conflict here the carrier conflict on one hand the great success and the wall Street Journal's recommendation that the U.S has to double down on innovation how do they not go together good evening to John\n... they don't go together because you think about will carrier he\nDeveloped the air conditioner carrier corps was based in Syracuse New York [noise]\nBut it was as though it was based in Florida simply because the advent of the air conditioner led to people moving down south in droves they can suddenly live and work in a place that was historically uncomfortable to live and work in\nAnd we all know what it's like to go without air conditioning to work to be in hot humid weather for extended periods it saps her energy and strength and she think about the air conditioner it quite literally made the world much more productive and so this is the genius of free trade when markets are open\nIt just though innovations are taking place next door even though they happen on the other side of the world I don't care where the air conditioner was created I just want access to it so it makes me better off\nThis runs counter to Florida and in ... Richard Florida had twice as they say that if the U.S doesn't maintain technological edge are living standards will go down if the other world ... the rest of the world laps us no no no no no no we have lower living standards precisely because\nPeople aren't as innovative and other parts of\nThe world that also suggest John as you said before it presumes that we won't go and get the best technology wherever it comes from or the best or the best equipment or wherever it comes from\nWe're not close minded about what we can buy their hands are long standing example of Home Depot which is as good as from everywhere and innovation from everywhere\nSo this idea that we're just going to buy buy at home and invested home and the educated home is this is this an expansion of the protectionism talk we've had for two years John this out what's going on\nIt is but what's interesting is I don't you know eat and a half away comes from Brookings Richard Florida comes from academe the University of Toronto I don't think they realize just how protectionist their argument is but in fact it's protectionist\nThey argue that if other parts of the world they argue that the U.S faces an assault an innovation from other parts of the world they haven't ruined damaged wrecked Chinese standards of living they've improved it and so what's exciting to me is to think\nAs the rest of the world liberalize as people around the world start um we're pursuing innovation too I\nThink about all the Willis carriers that exist in China that are no longer be having their talents suffocate and such to think about the future of American living standards if the Chinese grow we are going to have living standards in the U.S that will that will stagger is for our advanced they are\nOr you give a wonderful example of the man who is who was Steve Jobs as father Steve Jobs is no longer with us he came from Syria Steve grow up without knowledge of him but in any event he came from Syria what if he stayed in Syria what would we be today John\n[noise] well if he had stayed in Syria Steve Jobs bother stays there there's never an apple it's no mistake that Steve Jobs was able to create apple in the United states the United states doesn't have a technological edge what it has a freedom edge\nCounted ambitious people keep coming to the United states because free people can prosper its people drive progress\nNot countries if the if the U.S had a technological edge then east Paolo Alto it'd be prosperous is Paolo Alto no which the individuals in Palo Alto the prosper prospering in Ron route twenty eight in Austin, Texas [noise]\nAnd so what matters here is that we remained open to the world's drivers because if they get to the United states they have the chance to innovate\nLooked at from the rest of the world\nOur living standards are lower precisely because countries around the world have been suffocating talent forever let's hope the opposite happens what Richard Florida and he an athlete want we want China to thrive we won India's thrive we want France to thrive we want them to create their own Microsoft is if they do\nThink about how will live here the equivalent of what our businesses have done for the world for decades\nA detailed China I've had conversations with my colleagues the last day about boosters about\nInvesting in pro commercial companies that sell or make available boosters for lifting small satellites into orbit commercial small satellites not that great big communications million dollar outfits but\nA dedicated for mining purposes or population purposes a or a ... the weather and those companies are are growing here like mushrooms\nThat the striking thing is the Europeans have noticed and our puzzle how they can catch up\nThe Europeans have only encouraged investment in space launch system's ... boosters\nWith European space agency big space like our NASA they have not made it available because their markets are ... heavily regulated they have not made it available to build companies they can build rockets and sell their I sell access to them to other commercial enterprises Europeans notice the difference\nI I use this as an example of how our innovation leads the world they're going to try to catch up to us good for them but our innovation is an envy for even our best allies\n[noise] it without question and think about what it means okay so the the us will be in the lead in space but if markets are open and free advances that take place in the U.S will lift up\nInnovation around the world the foreigners will be able to buy what we've produced a no one creates things so that they can sell it to small market any any innovator wants to sell it to the world and so if the if Americans achieving in at harnessing something Berlin from space\nThe rest of the world will benefit and just the same if towel to people from around the world achieve in five GE or driverless cars we in the United states will benefit\nAs though it happen next door to us the important thing is that people are free and the trading laser free after that the where of innovation doesn't matter what you would only matters is that the innovation happens\nJohn ten his most recent book is the end of work he's also the author of who needs the fed riding it Rick Flair markets on John bachelor\nHas been the global than American

to today tend to have this fear that somehow they the champion of of the people and the working class and yet we know\nAs as demonstrated so powerfully in this last election but also with the rise of the Tea Party before that and and other indicators that Democrats are representing blue\nOr to not occupy that place of favor a ... and loyalty and the heart of the American people and that they have

Democratic leadership and for blue elites in general that they don't really get it now to to give you another comparison on the eve of the French Revolution\nThere were two elites split with two different visions in France the old elite elite that eventually was overthrown often be headed there was the formal aristocracy a that was entrenched and a\nA N capable of connecting with people of France the otherworldly which was equally wealthy or as it turned out and quite more powerfully dynamic was what we now call the Bush was eat and they were the ones who actually constructed lead\nAnd rammed through the French Revolution and eventually pay became based successor relate to the old aristocrats of the also regime no I'm not saying those lines are quite as clearly etched today because there are plenty of old\nRepublican or money bags robber barons oligarchs big corporate types but the fact of the matter is that the Republican elite today has shifted from\nWhat it was when it nominated Romney\nFor president for example or when it was a invested in the Bush family for two presidencies and it has moved much more into the terrain of 'em\nAnd it's an imperfect word of of populism non elitist based party even though it has an elite elite Israeli more closely connected\nWith the people down the Democrats and this is a problem\nThat the Democrats have yet to come to terms\nI Want to use the the visual of the president's rally in Missoula, Montana within these last ... hours a gorgeous pictures and to us by the White House of the president on stage in his blue Sudanese red tide\nSurrounded by the colorfully dressed and extremely vividly hardworking people of Montana in various uh ... acts of cowboy ... by a hardworking rodeo garb\nAnd uh with lots of

but in in in there looking at a man who's a billionaire over from New York City\nAnd I'm aware of the fact that the president is not is a representative of the populist movements he's not the populist movement itself he's a spokesperson for it but I'm thinking how long Jill we understand that they don't need to\nA ... a\nBay the east coast how long Michael I Am puzzled to myself the picture was

show under [noise]\nI'm joined us or this is the John bachelor show to shark attacks white shark attacks according to the detective work on both coasts wanted Cape Cod and that was a catastrophe September fifteenth twenty Eighteen a shark attack off of Cape Cod\nThe second uh I have a profound worry but not marshal our young men attacked off the California coast a south of Long Beach and I go now to someone who can help me understand these two attacks on two cos\nAnd why there might be a changing pattern in great white shark attacks on people this is Chris Lowe ducks Chris Lowe he's director of the shark lab at California State University at Long Beach\nChris a very good evening to you and thank you for this these two attacks ICU commenting in both cases one in California and one in\nA Cape Cod so let's start with the mortal attack in Cape Cod nine Fifteen Eighteen they closed the beach accordingly\nBut why was a great white shark so close to the coastline and why was this particular man attacked because if I understand correctly comments he made great white sharks don't mean to attack people good evening to\n[laughter] good evening and um yes this is this is a question that that's been kind of burdening scientist for a long time why the sharks occasionally bite people\nAnd in order to have that happen we have to have two things we have to have people in sharks in the water at the same time same place and figuring out what motivates those is really a challenge\nThe challenge it tells me that we need to discover some of the facts about these attacks the first attack ours are met a chi or from bought the Boston area he was attacked while swimming and the shark attacked him so brutally\nThat when he was pulled out of the water has classical was exposed but the shark didn't stay around a there was a trail of blood according to the eye witness who pulled him out of the water and the sharks swam away so is it that the shark bit the wrong thing did the shock feel attacked\nDo we know anything about what our shot why a shark attack some people and bypass as others\nWell I think we first have to get out why shirts might be at beaches that that people use and and in this particular case what's happened is the recovery of the gray seal population\nAnd and it's been pretty much all marine mammals have shown pretty dramatic recovery since there are protections seventies a show it's really been recovery of the racial population and the gray seals using\nThose beaches as important look re habitat or so I was really the draw to bring in large adult white sharks to those areas to begin with\nOr I didn't do so it's it's it's the seals and Cape Cod which are gorgeous but they're yeah they're the bait and uh that brings to\nExactly so we know based on tagging studies that what church Rome entire stretches of ocean they cover thousands of miles a year but their prey like like seals do\nUse land periodically and what it does is it concentrates that pray in one general area whether that be off Cape Cod or off you know California off shore islands those are the draws that that bring the sharks back from sometimes thousands of miles of ocean migrations\nTo these areas where all these foods concentrated so think of it like you know being out on a on a hike or a cross country travel travel and and you come across a Costco and that's where all the food is concentrated in bulk and it's easy to buy everything you need well for white sharks\nThat's kind of what these robberies or act like they're drawing them to these locations in their great places for them to feed for periods of time\nTo the attack in and need is a pop a beach town near San Diego and San Diego county this was September twenty nine twenty Eighteen Thirteen year old king have now at the hospital was attacked by great white shark you've done\nI'm very careful work because the shark didn't stay around to identify what ... uh who what attack keen and you've used DNA how does it work Chris\nWell you know all living animals have DNA and their selves and when those cells slough off their body into the environment they become part of the environment and believe it or not in the ocean there's literally a stew of animals DNA out there\nSo you can take a sample of water 'em and you can actually find thousands of animals little pieces of their\nDNA that are specific to their species show we and I collaborate with a number of researchers have developed a technique where we can go out and take water samples and then filter that water down in probe\nThat do have DNA from all these animals to determine whether or something like a white shirt has been present based on its left off DNA\nWe referred to that as environmental DNA\nTo using a very similar approach what I was able to do is swab teens wetsuit where he had been bitten\nAnd swab the troops marched with a team that penetrated through the wet suit and then my geneticist colleague was able to go through and amplifying demonstrate that there was clearly white shirt DNA in each one of those gashes in his what\nDo you call it the DNA and this strikes me it it's like CSI white shark here\nYou cut is kind of is\nYou can you can scoop water out of the beach area in San Diego county and determine whether white shark has been there within hours within days because ... they use this area of commonplace I learn from you\n... well that's the part we don't know we don't know how long that DNA can last in the water and how recently that sharks been there so when the case of sampling water when we're measuring what we called by our mental DNA that's where the ... in the DNA comes from\nUm we don't know how long that DNA will laugh before it completely breaks down and we can no longer measure it so that's that's something that we're planning on doing next summer is to try to measure how long the white tricks DNA can remain\nIn a particular before it's completely gone but in the case it a wet suit that was different because the sharks DNA had become trapped in the ... show in many ways that as a standard forensic techniques that you it's been used in forensic labs all over the world for for decades now\nAnd we don't know exactly where that occurs we just know that the baby start showing up off our beaches around and made through at about October and and the question that we're trying to figure out is what makes Southern California beaches good nursery habitat for white sharks\nWell a lot of shark species huge nurseries and the reason why they give birth in those areas just because it offers protection for their young it offers\nAn abundance of food and good conditions so that they can grow very quickly so that they can overcome many of the things that could potentially kill them in their first year so\nI think Southern California is a little bit different than what we see off Cape Cod and the reason for that is the adults are showing up at those beaches primarily to feed on seals but in Southern California we really don't see a lot of seals on our beaches there around me off shore islands and that's typically where we see adult white shirts\nThe birth it's a live birth and they're about five feet long that's a big baby but there is no nursing so this isn't a matter of a mother bear protecting her cubs\nBut I learned from you that sharks are warm blooded like human beings and the young sharp sharks are not ready for the deep water is that why they hang around\nWell that's part of it so why church or or what we call ... warm bodied or an do start make and basically as long as they keep swimming they can keep their body warmer than the water now the babies are fairly small and they have all the same equipment to do that\nLike the adults the problem is their bodies are so small that we don't think they're very good at keeping the heat that they generate and therefore they act more like a call buddy shark show during the summer one of the reasons why we think\nThey're in so close to shore and such shallow water because the water's warmer there than it is further offshore the other reason is believe it or not females give birth to their young and they're completely on their own so they have to figure out everything on their own\nAnd they don't know what is it threat so one of the reasons why we think they're in such shallow water is because that's a safe place for them there are fewer large predators and then the third reason is they have to figure out how to eat on their own and the most common thing we find in baby white shirt stomachs or sting rays\nWhich in Southern California carpet our sea floor so this makes it easy\nAbundant food source for them for a naive young shark like a baby what truck\nI also learned that they migrate from your area long the San Diego county to the south or at least they have here to for and you raise the issue of whether they're ... they're changing their pattern because of El Nino or El Nino or law Nino or is this climate change can we tell Chris\nWell we're we're still learning about that but so far we've learned that the young white sharks are temperature sensitive they don't like water too cold and when our water temperatures dipped below sixty degrees that seems to be a cue\nFor them to migrate south to warmer water softball hot during the winter um the following spring civil sharks return to Southern California but what we noticed was during the strong El Nino that we had in\nTwo thousand Fifteen our winter water temperatures never gets below sixty five degrees and none of the shirt so we ... that year left their state so what that told us was that El Nino can completely changed their migratory patterns and the other thing that we're learning\nIs that as our oceans are warming we're starting to detect not just baby why church further north but I Do white sharks are now being more commonly detected off Oregon Washington and even British Columbia\nAs the war as the water warm so great white sharks like warmer water or they can range into the deep cold correct\nThat's correct and but it can't spend a lot of time it those steps so typically they like water temperatures kind of um about sixty degrees up to maybe about Seventy degrees so for adults they're a little bit more temperature tolerant they can tolerate greater extremes in temperature\nBut young lions have a very ... fairly narrow temperature language that they like show but what we're seeing is\nAs our global oceans warm those warmer temperatures are starting to us\nFor at higher latitudes than we're kind of used to so what we've been telling people is look you may live in a place where you've never had to experience white trucks before but the ocean is changing and you should keep an eye out because as the ocean warms we might expect white sharks march further north\nI understand there's an experiment underway in your area San Diego county something called the clever boy this might turn into a mass production it's to warn of sharks to warn to stay away from sharks how does the clever bully work\nSo that clever bully uses sonar so ah basically it's using the sport fishing shown our ships use downward station showing up at this sooner points out in by using in a series of these forward facing sonar bullies you can basically create a video image using sound\nTo track objects that move through that sonar sealed\nSo the idea there is you can have these buoys and you can have a shark move through that accrue stick or sonar field and you can identify that target and say that target you know is the target of adult or that's a shark or you know that's an eight foot shark nope that's a ten foot shark so\nThe technology has great promise it just doesn't cover a very large area and it's very expensive\nIt requires a lot of power to to power the soda so um\nIt it could provide some really interesting data now the question is the California coast is huge so the question is could we even cover enough for the California coast to make a you know technology like that effective as just simply a warning system to let us know when large sharks maybe within coastal waters\nYou put the first one uh south of the bell bow up here you know these things I Do not in Newport Beach and that gained a lot of attention has been affective so far is it warned anybody away from a great white shark\nI'm not to my knowledge and again it's that's not my work that's that there's a company that right you know markets this product um you know we're very interested in their results but so far we haven't heard of any um so it will be very interesting to see what that technology turns out\nAnd and even though they're covering a very small area it will be interesting to see how effective it is in in a death defying the difference between sharks and white sharks in leopard shark some of our non threatening species\nAnd then of course dolphins and ... and some of the other wildlife that occur along the beaches\nYou tag great white sharks or when fisherman bring them to and you follow them uh and that data you're accumulating now have you learned anything new from that that at in this changing pattern because of warming we have about a minute Chris\nSo over the last ten years we've managed to tag about a hundred and ten\nJuvenile white sharks and actually we've learned quite a bit about their migration patterns we've learned about what what cues may drive those migrations and right now we're learning about how the young when I find that a nursery beach and how much time they spend in that habitat\nBut we still don't know what makes a good nursery habitat nursery\nSo we need to develop new tools and that's something we're working on now we're developing a ton of underwater tracking robots and and water sampler so we can measure for white shirt DNA were using drones so we're using a variety of technology to try to answer those questions so we can predict\nFrom year to year where might the shark show up\nChris Lowe Dr Chris Lowe is the director of the shark lab at California State University Long Beach or jaws is a very famous movie from the twentieth century but here in the twenty first century it's much more helpful to think of it from the sharp point of view as we'll watch the change in global\nThis is the John ...\nJohn we can't keep

spring final June offense and he's on the lawn doesn't do very well the allies counterattack on the Eighteenth and John\nI'm now in the twenty fourth of July for Scott has managed to get it and try to work out what to do next primarily to maintain the initiative to keep the gym and on the back porch\nAnd at this point he has no inkling of what he's about to happen and how deep the raw to set into the German army I'm somebody what he wants to do is keep pressure on the front seat Joel I'm particularly rail hopes there's a ... a meal that ... on the pressure not the key rile up sending the British\nUm [noise] some yell they want to put pressure that it's always about maintaining pressure on the gym and all me getting key locations\nAnd primarily maintaining the initiative\nTo Nick mentioned that to places that are going to be critical in these next week for the offensive on me all the rail had and that will be the first battle but before we go there the success of the allies

not going to be defeated\nAnd primary he thinks Hayek is bullshit he thinks Hayek as a man who was a school into the the lines of too many British soldiers so I'm low George's really consistently undermining ache 'em\nAnd doesn't really want to give them any moment 'cause he says that if he gives him the moment they will just become casualties so it's this huge civil military disruption of

social company last year and he's about to take it into\nThe German way against the Russians with their Austrian allies and they're going to lie that's an advantage the Germans have\nJeffrey you tell a wonderful story however the German troops are far more better trained sought better artillery better machine guns better generals and the Austrians and the Russians both of those armies will fall apart in the course of the years but there's that story that is just compelling to me Geoffrey all of us who\nEither wanted to read Greek or can read Greek or can identify with this man is shut a German soldier so shell shocked by his fight in the west that when he's transferred to the east to fight again against the Russians\nYou observed in this a source material that he hit there staring at the ground reciting long passages of the odyssey and Greek is that a typical story of the shell shock and the front or is just to stand out among all the other sources\n[noise] well I got that anecdote from the memoirs of Harry Kessler and a customer observed that and ... wrote that\nDown and he said it was emblematic of the difference between the fighting on the western in the eastern friends to Nineteen fourteen he said that ... the western front\nWas so much more industrialized so much more intense the concentration of of men machines artillery ... was so much more lethal down the Eastern Front where things were spread out quite a bit more the armies were less heavily armed that the stronger and I was very deficient or the Russian Army\nUh it was better than the Austrians but compared with the Germans quite deficient as well plus the spaces where am I Would just much bigger so you had fewer\nUs fewer men in guns per square mile or kilometer\nSo you the the the concentration of fire was was a\nAbsolutely mind bending on the western front and and Kessler was was saying you know when they got replacements from the western front and when they moved divisions from the western front to the Eastern Front in Nineteen fourteen to bolster the ah to bolster the Austria Hungarian war effort\nThese guys they showed up where you know they had a much higher percentage of shell shocked guys than\nThan a German or Australia years there've been serving\nThroughout on the Eastern Front but this explains\nWhy Annenberg and looting doors\nThought that it made sense to try to win the war in the east\nNot in the west and they were always disputing with most of the younger and then fucking high above the focus of the war\nOr they ... north thought it was impossible to wait on the western front because\nThe British and French were just two industrialized\nThe uh the the the British\nIndustry and subsidies we're creating a you know incredibly a solid trench works lots of artillery lots of Shell's yes there is a shell shortage beginning of the war but the correct this\nAnd then they become stronger and stronger throughout and ... or so we can't break through on the western front because these western allies are so well armed the Russians on the other hand\nWe can break through there because there's more space there's more space for maneuver and the Russians are pathetically armed versus the the British and the French\nOr they were they were fairly well armed at the outset but then they're blockaded throughout by the by the Germans in the in the Baltic who closed the Baltic porch and the Turks who joined the central powers ah they closed the the Black Sea port\nSo the Russians so the Russians aren't able to get in any machinery not able to get any artillery but not able to get it any shells or or or or bullets for the rifles in fact uh throughout the war about one third of the troops in any given Russian unit have rifles two thirds attack without rifles and pick up rifles\nFrom ... and that was a reason for the Germans to launch the war in the first place I Believe I read you correctly they knew the Russians a bench Lee would be better armed and so they had to move now before it became impossible\nYeah and they probably and they and they didn't they didn't realize how just how badly they were on that they didn't realize it was as bad as it seemed and so in Nineteen fourteen Fifteen and then you know Nineteen sixteen Seventeen Eighteen is well a or a Hindu burger looting or say look\nWe have to seek decision on the Eastern Front because the off the Russians are big but they're ramshackle we kicked\nDoor and the whole thing will fall down whereas we can't punch through in the west once we take the Russians out and we are they conquered them altogether or we force\nAnd then make a separate piece with us we can then focus everything on the western front or we can defeat the French and the British\nHynden ... seats to work together and they will take over everything eventually and Seventeen and Eighteen but here they build in us terror in eastern army of\nTwelve core six more coming and they attacked the Russians and roll up enormous numbers of prisoners dead and ... are dead and wounded\nAnd killed in five hundred thousand they just roll right through the Russians and they want Conrad to work with them to attack from the south ... Conrad because he won't eat ineffective\nAnd at this point is looting door thinking about taking over Conrad's army he will will eventually but he did he think at this early November\nWell they did in the ... the Germans were were effectively taking it over in the sense that they were increasingly coming up with ideas and increasingly a compelling Conrad to execute those ideas going over his head to the emperor in Vienna he refused\nBut the problem the problem was is that you know you have the Germans on the left\nAnd the center and then you have the Austrians in the center and all the way down there right so if you're going to have a big operation where you try to roll up the enemy flank the Austrians really have to participate because the Austrian because the Russians are so numerous a and but it the\nThe Austrian is just ... whenever they attack their blown back by the Russians and they and they lack the artillery they lack the infantry tactics to actually launch an effective attack and get through the Russians so they make these\nHalf hearted effort to join these German offensives in the east but every time there's stymied thrown back in and the Germans are left fighting alone without ...
