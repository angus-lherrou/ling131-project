it's a great pleasure to welcome Victor Davis Hanson the Hoover Institution\nVictor is the man at the moment because he has been writing for years from California from the Hoover Institution and traveling the country\nAbout the failure of Congress to respond\nTo immigration to migration to the needs of the American people quite apart from the need to have a say the Central American people who are marching towards the border right now we're told we're told they're marching towards the border we're seeing videos emerging toward the border we don't know entirely who they are\nWe're told a little bit that are a hundred and sixty people started out in Central America and it looks like several thousand now we're told that they are being handed things that looked like coupons and we can see the video but we don't know any facts other than the fact that the president is re responded vigorously with remarks in these last hours\nAnd that John Bolton national security adviser and John Kelly the chief of staff had strong words or\nThe wall Street Journal prefers the word explosives in the oval office today there was also a little bit that bolt and and Trump lined up against Kelly that sounds more like a more of a fair fight Victor good evening to you\nThey marched toward the border this is a re creation of things that we've seen during the Obama administration the Trump Administration inherited that policy and I'm going to presume that nothing's been improved good evening to you\nCould evening\nHas the Trump Administration made any adjustments is this provocation in order to show up the Trump Administration in order to take advantage of the Trump Administration how to regard it\nWell I think it's no it's right before the midterms and so I think the international well Central American governments will be encouraged one of our left is suggesting that\nIf there's a melodrama psycho drama like there was in July where families can be separated under the guise of\nBeing an asylum seekers and refugees rather than just people that most people come the United states wanting a better life than that would hurt Donald Trump in the mid term impact people up and down as you remember about three or four points in July of two calls may team and so that's I think that the timing and then\nA contrary they feel that the Republicans\nMight keep the house there might be a border wall authorized and actually bill and so this would be the last time you can get across both I think the mid term is loom large scores for the timing of\nHow to regard this from the part of the partisan the bass first of all the based Republicans responded very well in twenty sixteen to the talk of build the wall is that still the case your measure Victor\nYeah I think it's a it's a much more a winning issue even now than it was then because we've gone through all of these either ration the psycho drama that Colbert or melodrama from I think people are starting to see that the news cycle is is for people here illegally that are committing crimes that are impacting negatively\nCommunities where in California about forty percent of so called Latinos Hispanics expressed the desire to close the border\nAnd the Democrats are there was a great deal of attention to the separation of families over those last month that ... that issue seemed to have been park to the side and they went to a more exciting headlines like Kavanaugh\nJust this issue of the ... of the caravan they call a caravan it looks like a a march toward the border does is engage the Democratic base\nI think that's the effort but I'm not I'm not sure it is but they're pretty cynical drawn I remember it's only based on the idea there's twenty or so million illegal aliens for when there was three or four remember that Chuck Schumer the Clintons Cesar Chavez even were for border enforcement Kobe prop it\nOpen borders negatively impacted a minority communities where they're at competed for social services eroded the wages of union and the level workers but only when they flip California and New Mexico Colorado Nevada do they feel that open borders were advantageous\nSo it's kind of predict it it's kind of emblematic of the current Progressive Party but the law is just\nA useful if not the national sanctity of the abstract so whether it's Kavanaugh in the end of due process we're talking about getting rid of the book but poor college or making fun of like the house all of these positions are predicated on power so open borders now or a good thing and and\nIf they were right wing Cubans they would not want them coming in\nThe Mexican police are reporting various late at a ... a manning the U.S border to prevent the caravan from charging illegally across the border there are those who have need for sanctuary and they can apply there are those who have papers many are boasting they don't\nWhat's so hard about this story victories that I don't I don't rely on any I Can't count on any of the sources the information all seems loaded to go one way or the other so since we had a the upset in two thousand sixteen we have a new president on blow\nIn Mexico who has been a ... who has been cooperative with the Trump Administration in terms of trade\nDoes that suggest that there's going to be a ... a change of tactics used by Mexico this time the caravan reaches the border\nYeah I think there might be a likelihood that they're going to try to help a little bit more than they have in the past because they they have a ... economic remember they run a Seventy one billion dollar trade surplus with us when they get thirty billion dollars and remittances\nMostly from illegal aliens are subsidized by American social programs but I don't think they want to jeopardize that and I feel for the first time that Trump's that type of\nUnpredictable president that might in fact jeopardize that relationship so I think they're going to be a little bit I mean they want them to come across that causes discomfort or the Wayne what's in their self interest\nThe report here from the Associated Press Mexico's federal police commissioner said the officers\nDispatched will support immigration agents Mexico is said migrants will have to show a passport and visa or apply for refugee status otherwise they will face deportation that as an update of what we saw during the Obama administration and the first year of the Trump Administration now the larger story that you're with days to go to the to the mid term\nImmigration is one of the stories that that can be told on the well known cables I keep repeating the political science mantra that we vote on pocket book\nMost important thing did you know the three years ago\nYou manage to all of a sudden\nTheir torn missing Richard Simmons now\nOrigin ... laments section making the insurance companies rich and we're making a pharmaceutical company for at Boston to serve it in ...\n\n... sort of this is the John ... show I welcome my colleague leader reached adopt heart she is the foreign desk and she reports Jimmy routinely on Iran and the matters of a rod dishes about Iran but it's not\nAbout Iran in ...\nIt's about Iran in the in the university environment today and the discussion about Iran and the University of our but today I've told similar stories about China but this is the first one I have\nThat Iran is the centerpiece leads to a very good even do you are a very happy graduate at Rutgers University and most recently within these last days\nYour schedule to give it to give a presentation on campus about Iran in the world uh what was the presentation and why did it not happen good evening to you Lisa\n... uh well this was a ... a situation by my alma mater with by the by the university itself often when you hear a speaker protests that are shut down\nA are cancelled by this all this is usually a teacher or the fringe organization or you know the capital is a complicated or a group that pro Israel or shut down by pro Palestinian group but this was an invitation from the University of south\nAnd I was given the subject of a by the University of south to speak about radicalism on college campuses\nI expanded that to talk to include freedom of speech on college campuses I was going to give a very comprehensive talk about the environment of the college campus today a in light of protests in light of empty hashtags in light of those are good\nEt cetera last week the vice chancellor of a school called me I guess with a former professor of mine that I\nJust want to let you do that a counter protest Shaq was started again you coming to the school speaking and alleging that you are and it's a ...\nA now you're on your belt you very well and those who follow my work very well that the bulk of the work that I Do it in the bending of Muslim the Muslim world\nAgainst terrorism against human rights abuses against yeah again sex slavery against the ice it\nOr something that I've always defended again\nA with a I'll be very ugly and ... a little bit\nNow at the ... Christian I was struck by one at ... and the student is the head of the a progressive students a group and I worked on Bernie Sanders' campaign is also a Muslim students part of the bus look to the organization a\nDeliberately misquoted me a in a speech I gave that Heritage Foundation of two thousand Fifteen which I said uh the uh you know Islamic terror\nA clean to take it expression of the Koran and he claims that he he recorded ... thank Islamic terror picks up the courage and the Koran and for that do that I Am\nIn fact in a lot of the school did not look into the allegations they said that they have to be sensitive\nAh students and shut down\nThe speech and capital my talk now it'd be a statement that school released to the press they said that he talked with his back postpone but when he spoke to me they said that it was canceled I don't expect me to accept another indication from the school\nUh but the last few days this has gotten so much media ... in a cloud of other statements thing that they're in fact inviting me back to school or to do with talk yeah you know and and offered me for different they\nAre claiming that the school that believe in fact in freedom of speech when in fact obviously it appears that they shut down to the beach in my talk so obviously John a very uh\nUh I Would say ugly painful a week that I've had because in my alma mater the I only ever see that this when they talk about I was going to give out the freedom of speech\nA really happy to school not believe in having my reputation and good name or in in this arena or where I have again always always differentiate between the Muslim people are and the hijacking of is lobby in political Islam and radical\nOr at least to this sounds like you're you're helping Rutgers learn something about a game that's going\nAnd it's and it's going on and many campuses and it was directed at you it really doesn't matter how the weapon is what the weapon is\nThat people claim a grievance and the university or the college campus immediately runs away it's very strange I hear the story again repeatedly is all the different subjects but the same matter right at the university didn't look into the person who written the complaint they didn't call him on the\nWork that they they didn't do any how well they they met with the students yeah and uh the vice chancellor told me on the phone that to be honest with you I didn't understand his grievances against you but I have to be sensitive to them because they sound like they're very much injured by you\nAre and they go and buy you ... the Catholic\nUm again these are words and it took to it but where where they get people to sign a petition\nBrother the word Islamophobia right because of the word racist because of the word bigot because of the word humble right if it's a it's a bit down the list\nIt's a template where the attacker has the advantage and you were attacked and you have no there is no easy defense or because of the university went along with it now is the university why sir have you heard in any well fashions from the deans of the professors you were speaking with that they've learned a lesson here\nYou know it didn't seem like they learned a lesson in it if they learn a lesson in so far as to defend their ... me or PR purposes because\nThankfully the silver lining if people like yourself John gave me a platform or or reported on this story and we we want and that is a silver lining to that initially I was very much frustrated because I Do want because they launched\nA very um if the attack again right without any proof but I\nHave you heard about have you heard from the University in anything like an apology\nWell they the apology was that that email that they sent in in the form of a second statement saying that uh we're sorry you should\nUh that's not an apology Lisa that it's not as well and she joins us now and I think that's the old I'm Sorry if you were offended that's not an apology act as\nIf I may be ... by it soccer\nThough when does this mean when when when ... when they invited you when can you go on campus 'cause everybody's gonna want to hear you know\nEveryone wants to talk but to be honest uh John I haven't I haven't made it out the economic it hurts\nI alright alright five it's sooner rather than later right Lisa\nWell I think I'm going to do this speech on I'm On social media that I have a broader audience short I correct yes and I could stay safe because I have received threats when I wanted to go to camp is a and you don't like I I Know I feel betrayed by by alma mater so it's very difficult to stay right as\nI understand it I don't understand entirely Rutgers University Rutgers University um apologies very simple you say we

going through his mind that you could send Fifteen people Istanbul lure someone into your consulate and not have this be a massive international incident\nJust from a practical perspective let alone the heinous nature of this crime let alone the moral dimensions of it so ah I I'm very worried about the U.S Saudi relationship even if we get past this crisis because of the head of Saudi Arabia right now is somebody who I think is unhinged\nMalcolm what ... what are really the options for the U.S\nTo react to this we're going to impose the sanctions on Iran we're going to need the kingdom support as an ally and how uh how the end of the United states maintain the alliance and meet its own national interest and yet react properly to what happened well I I mean this\nA great test right now for secretary of state Mike Pompeo a because you need to balance a few things you do not want to get into a situation where\nAre you you you know uh sabotaging that Mohammed bin Salman is a an erratic figure that uh he overreact and does something you've been more self defeating\nOn the other hand the Saudis need the United states just as much or more I'd say more than the United states in Saudi Arabia and um they are still going to have an imperative an exit sexual imperative to fight the Iranians uh regardless of the relationship for the United states so that's my\nFirst point on that and the second thing is I think the United states and I'm not just talking about human rights are an important American value or that we should have credibility when we criticize Russia or China\nThat's all true but that that's less compelling to me there is a very real cost\nThat we need to impose on the Saudis if only to protect its draw a line to make sure that\nAny other dictator who is America's ally will get the message that you better not go after you know permanent residents in the United states and the third country\nIs that other journalists that mean that that I think a very important thing that it's important norm that we would like was appalled at this point that the Saudis have violated and so they have to pay a price that that I Am not in the camp that says we should reevaluate the relationship I I don't I don't think that's\nIn America's interest by any stretch 'em so there are some options and there was options I think of revolve around a couple of points\nWanted something known as the global Magnitsky Act which allows the United states to impose restrictions on the travel and uh finances of individuals' without addressing necessarily the military to military or the eloquence relationship between Saudi Arabian ...\nAnother thing I think is again to resist the temptation to go along with the Saudi cover up a net does not mean that Donald Trump has to\nYou know give a speech where he claims or haven't been summoned but just not having the United states\nYou know ... you know how sign on whatever story the Saudis are going to give us about\nTheir minister of intelligence and it was ... and you know the crown prince of know about it if we believe that that is not true then the United states that don't have to have an obligation\nTo go along with that and that's an important point as well and then I Would I Would ask the state department to investigate the disappearing journalists I Would um\nYou know I Would I Would I Would think about you know not necessarily a wholesale suspension of arms sales but something where you know they got the message that certain systems they might want that aren't exactly necessary but I think they have to be that there has to be understanding that they pay very heavy price at this point\nEven if I think it's unrealistic to the United states can effect\nOr you know some sort of changing the leadership at this point because I haven't been Solomon has eliminated all many of his rivals and a lot of ways so you know in the world is stuck with them but that's not necessarily a good\nThing if I were on the eve of the Iran sanctions on the eve yeah is that is that a significant factor just a coincidence\n[noise] well I mean I don't know why ah again I think that uh any rational person they would have been in the room when these decisions are being made you know would have said this is crazy to to do what you're thinking you're going to do here but\nUm you know there I think that there was a mistake from the Trump Administration which was that they basically looked the other way when you saw all the sort of fines calming\nHariri thing or you know some of the purchase I mean we we we've heard rumors that it wasn't just the Ritz Carlton House arrest where he you know got a lot of money in back taxes and the claim there were some members of the royal family who had much more grim\nFate or out of helicopters released this has been reporting in some places so the U.S should have been a little bit fervor on these things maybe you have dissuaded\n... Mohammed bin Salman from thinking he could get away with something like this and it's all that kind of speculation and by the way it's an argument also for taking a tougher line with other allies like general the the in Egypt\nWhere you know I laughed I heard something like sixty thousand people are arrested not all of those people\nAre Muslim Brotherhood you know terrorists I mean there are a lot of you know regular dissident liberal that you know only a few years ago a decade ago George W. Bush made it a big way of\nFighting for those cards and rejections and so we need to send a message that our allies are going to be held\nTo a higher standard than uh\nThe world world's rogue states like North Korea Russia countries like that and again it's not just to make us feel good because you have an interest in making sure\nThat journalists like myself are not going to be abducted and killed if they are going without ... what are some other countries\nYou lie like his Bloomberg View\nAbout them\nOnline conference presidents major American Jewish organizations I'm John bachelor\nYou all know that I traveled to the Republicans ... this past summer it was my second trip in two years broadcasting the richest as the Caspian Sea bass and I've discovered that Azerbaijan as a country of bountiful resources\nThe farmland produces the fresh food in Eurasia the energy sectors are expanding by the minute now reaching out pipelines to Asia Minor in Europe\nTo help with energy security for our allies and for NATO\nWhat I've learned is that as a by John is a prosperous country with big dreams and the leadership to support the dreaming of freedom and growth of the legendary Silk Road I'm most privileged to have the embassy of the republic of Azerbaijan in the U.S to support my weekly business reports I Will be highlighting what I'm learning about Azerbaijan and the Caspian Sea regularly\nFrom food to energy to a knowledge economy the republic of Azerbaijan and the Caspian Sea bass in is a region I look forward to exploring and I invite you along [noise]\nBalance of nature's fruits and veggies in a capsule\nI spent years studying how to make this the best I didn't make this because I wanted to make a company other companies are starting to catch on to this and I buy every single other product that comes out so I can look at it and see it in test it and I fear that people will buy some counterfeit don't be fooled this is the real stuff we have absolutely\nThe best process and I can say that because we purchase every single one and check them out\nI don't think that was on the market nothing ever worked for the first thing that's really worth nothing to compare with the benefits of balances nature\nFor a limited time used discount code John and we'll take thirty five percent off your first preferred set of fruits and veggies and have them shipped to you free call eight hundred two four six eight seven five one\nThat's one eight hundred two four six eight seven five one or go on line to balance of nature dot com and use discount code John [noise]\nNow a year in rock spotlight Seventy three\nMain in\nRolling dunes your back on top of the number one album in the U.S and the u._k. and the number one single Angie\nSaying let's get it on as the number one single\nMarvin Gaye policy went on Seventy three Stevie Wonder is number four albums and his vision and Florida Man Leonard Skinner relief duty when we\n[noise]\n[noise]\nWho would you want to wear on their eat out the middleman db was down in yogurt\nFrom Nineteen Seventy [noise]\nAnd the king dies Elvis Presley spends his home in Memphis, Tennessee at the age of ... to ... seconds ... seconds collaboration\nSilly releases this album the stranger goes number two in the U.

major American Jewish organization\nWe're going to turkey and the reason is that everything right now lines up the turkeys in the story and to help us very very carefully because there are a lot of coincidences here is Steve Cook the any Enrico macho guy senior fellow for Middle East and African studies at the council on Foreign Relations\nSteve a very good evening to you okay a one or two private aircraft planted Istanbul Airport\nAnd very large men get off associated with security services then proceed to the\nEast on both conflict of the ... of the kingdom of Saudi Arabia within hours a man who's been held for two years Andrew Brunson\nAnd a pastor charged as a spy or a security risk by the Turkish authorities is released coincidence or do these dots connected in any fashion good evening to state\nComing to you um you know to my mind I it is a happy coincidence that the government of turkey\nThat at a moment when the government is Saudi Arabia which is an adversary a turkey is under fire for the disappearance of a journalist named Jamal ... gee I'm the Turks\nSuddenly a release a this pastor Andrew Brunson who's been held since\nA number of months after the attempted coup in into two thousand and sixteen I think the Turks are looking to ride the wave of goodwill coming from the release of Brunson\nAnd the outrage here in the United states over the killing of ...\nUh to their great benefit\nMalcolm you have written a obviously a lot about turkey and try to assess\nA president or the one's intentions this clearly was a godsend for him at a time when its economies and clubs they've had this new focus a Ford the public attention so the question is what does how do they benefit will to crush\nThe oil refinery the major oil refining turkey get a waiver to continue buying Iranian oil after this November sanctions\nDo you think that um that this will boost are the ones efforts to transform you know the new turkey is he called it and give him a cover after his horrendous actions including arresting a hundred thousand people\n[noise] it's it's really rather extraordinary uh I think that the Saturday missteps in the disappearance and presumed murder to mock show she\nUm had made air to one a paragon of press freedoms and protections when we know that he's actually the world's leading jailer of journalists\nUm and he is riding a certain amount of goodwill on it is true that the major Turkish oil refinery to press wants a waiver on when it comes to sanctions on Iran although it seems that everyone wants to hang tough on on the question of sanctions\nIt it it turns out that actually\nTrade between turkey and Iran was higher under sanctions that it was after sanctioned so and there's all kinds of incentives for Turkish ministers who engage in graft and corruption around these these sanctions\nAired on after releasing this American ... been in prison um looks like he's going to hang up and try to defy the United states on on sanctions but overall he's looking forty good right now I'm at a time when his economy is on the verge of collapse so I think\nUm Saturday missteps or have really helped a lot of ways it's a it's it's a rather stunning turn of events\nYes just last week Steve we were hanging around the water cooler thinking now food and air to one and Rowhani talking about invading the sanctions and ... about the loss of turkey and now Turkey's back\nIt's it is this what turkey has been like for the last hundred years since the end of the Ottoman said goes out of favor in favor out of papers it's cyclical\nTo some extent cyclical course during the Cold War every time we had a problem with the Turks who were swept under the rug because the Soviet Union was the overarching threat to both countries\nUm now it's kind of come in and out of favor although official Washington has tried to continue to sweep things under the rug I think with the return of Andrew Brunson a there is a a brief respite in the tension between the two countries but there's a long list of problems between\nTurkey in the United states chiefly um the Turkish intention to buy Russian air defense systems from uh from Moscow uh the\nUh help that the Turks have given the Iranians in ... in evading sanctions the U.S relationship with Syrian a Syrian Kurdish fighting force that the Turks regarded as terrorists these are these are just three of you know Fifteen or so problems between the two countries\nSo it's likely to rear its ugly head again after the good feeling after the release of Brunson\nUm but you know official Washington has a has a long history of sticking his head in the sand when it comes to a Turkish misdeeds ...\nBut there are other aspects of this that again get little attention as people just focus on the murder and how they murdered them how they cut them up I'm ... and one of them is the regional message both what the United States does if they don't come down strong enough or they come down to strong our allies read this\nAnd one in particular and I was hoping you could comment on something that is sort of baffling we've seen how prisoners OCC was United States recently met and he very positive and yet his rhetoric\nAnd some of his speeches have become a more of a throwback to the anti Israel language of the same time that they are fully cooperating in in military and security cooperation\n[noise] yeah it's interesting I mean it it comes around the same time as the annual Egyptian celebration of their quote unquote victory in the October Nineteen Seventy three war\nUm but I think that you know there is a limit for the Egyptians when it comes to cooperation with the Israelis and I think that\nAt least publicly I think that the military to military and security cooperation is extremely important to to both parties but I'm seeing is vulnerable politically he has been consolidated his power\nPulse to in March the band America releases their debut

[noise] early\nThe Seventeen Israeli town a rocket fired from Gaza long range lock struck back ... that's a large city to the north south the Gaza Strip a lot of Russian immigrants live in ...\nI visited it was because they'd rocket at a school this looks like a much larger rockets struck this is how moss Malcolm Hamas rocket\n... this was an upgraded grad missile with a bigger payload and larger and it hit\nA house in ... in which I Am a single mother and her three children reliving but you know they get usually a Fifteen twenty twenty five seconds warning but she heard as soon as you heard the sirens that an incoming missile was on the way they quickly went into the basement\nThe whole front to the house was shared off this explosion took a concrete home and shattered\nSo this was not a a small weapon this was significant license significant impact um it and certainly in Israel the fact that they attacked that's one of the red lines Israel can't tolerate the can't you know it's one thing when the shooting mortars across and\nThey made life miserable for half a million more people in the south the fires from these balloons the incendiary devices that burning tires that has caused respiratory illnesses amongst many children are and they they burnt half the far as your gossip about twelve hundred actors\nOf land but and about altogether between farmland that land about ten thousand acres destroying crops killing wildlife destroying forests\nAnd and Israel has demonstrated such incredible power it the attack on the ... goes beyond that\nThe response was immediate and yet the response has not adequate Malcolm because their other aggressions or the tunnels where are they\nThe tunnels are very serious matter and and you're quite right the people of Israel are demanding harsher response is I think Egypt\nMaybe others are urging the Israel to a moderate its response and not to pack and at the they began to get to go ... in ... she was started it again or between with the ... with us\nOr as you know there are layer upon layer here yeah Hamas versus the PA um us versus pigeon other groups and you have of course turkey and Bobby running route car and Bob\nUh the war with Israel so many things in this ah onion that you can take layer after layer but the the Israel or the IDF attacked twenty targets military targets somewhere rocket installations others\nBut one of the most important was the tunnels and these are tunnels for terror they're very sophisticated these are not just the saint castle operations they have they involve the costs of perhaps millions of dollars they hit their electrify day of like the air conditioning\nAnd they are developing the Palestinians to Paris developing new means new technologies new materials that can deflect attention Israel has technology they use a combination of\nAh the sensors territorial censors 'em and they use intelligence and at at the logical sensors\nTo um to gather information they destroyed sixteen tunnels this year including the one recently which was a huge one\nBut the estimates are that there are perhaps thirty attack tunnels in several dozen more that are defensive and bites offensive I mean that they're used to hide arms died soldiers underground so that they can go in a surprise attack with it or when they come under fire they can hide their\nAh we've seen that these that they're getting more sophisticated and the rockets and mortars that are are um are are being fired\nAnd be a so Israel has to develop new methods all the time to detect the tunnels because they're only purpose is for terror they want to kidnap they want to murder\nAnd the uh you know they have the fence now that's going a little Israel's borders so it helps protect somewhat though not the\nUh completely so the the tunnels remain a really serious or a danger and that's why the idea of hit them and try to hit other infrastructure without causing civilian casualties and nobody notes this but there are no reports about civilian casualties\nMalcolm who claimed credit for the rocket attack\nNo one and it's interesting how ... both said wasn't us we're investigating wasn't us and um that seems to be quite common in the middle east today but the fact is that\nIt has to be you can't fire from Gaza without them knowing especially you know a a large rocket and being able to track exactly where where it's coming from and who was behind it\nAnd the you know the Hamas is in charge and if the you know when you're in charge you're responsible even the EU issued a statement that said that the indiscriminate attacks against civilian\nPopulations that are not acceptable I Wonder if discriminate attacks are but they said you know that rockets and he has to stop but they will take no action they don't do anything to implement it\nAnd the meantime you have the escalation because it's diversion from the internal problems you know the PA barred the oil from going in now Israel has closed obviously the crossings and stuff because they placed bombs on them are on the Israel's border there are no Israeli soldiers so it's not against\nOccupation and that's come us itself

United States that the United states has reinvented the way that they uh that that we achieved space uh and and and can take advantage of orbit is very interesting development\nYes they do they do have the European space agency but as we've learned big space isn't the answer what's going on now is commercialism of big space and you note in this report that they're they're trying to\nMatch by Americans space with by European space have they got things that we want to buy Joe have they got a small business\n[noise] bear satellites that communication satellites are excellent they have things that are worth watching for sure but they don't have a robust launch industry they got a very good space sport and South America where\nA bear expanding than the kinds of space a fact that they can launch with the the Italians they brought in with their big a large system which is which is coming out of line next year the Russians lodge from French beyond which is the European space pork and South America\nAnd it's it's all good but that used to be a position that could dominate the industry and they don't dominate anymore and the United states does and that's what they are worried about their where they're going to lose their autonomy when it comes to space and the space industry\nAnd they look at the commercial space effort and the United states investment into the commercial space industry and how the government that ... to do more things in the military industrial and then that's aside and they say what about all the you know we're we're falling behind what can we do to catch up\nWith this report and that's what I was reading about uh in today's are right up\nThey do have lots of ... but looks and bugs and investor in commercial that's what they need our flag of convenience yeah what they need what they must have because I see China's ... by\nBy coming up with what they call small sat private companies which are actually an extension of the pie LA a launch vehicle system but what they needed something like rocket lab I mentioned rocket lab Joe cars rocket lab is one of a matrix of small sat launch post are companies\nThat are looking to win contracts commercial contracts and rocket labs has now chosen wall of silence here on the east coast Virginia\nFor its launch site and that's an example of what you have throughout your book\nBay as a because the the whole ... the the multiple the multiplication of launch vehicles is what's driving this story here not having really one launch site which by the way I mentioned Joe is in the new world\nNot just having one launch site but having many launch sites and having the flexibility of companies to compete for those launch sites\nWe're seeing the space industry led by the end it's it's hard not to ... ... about this because the United states did a very\nCalculated gamble and it started in the Bush administration and Dorothy is through the bothered Mina stretching and the Trump Administration is embracing it and doubling down on it in many ways\nAnd it's the United states is doing something different approaching space in a completely different way and it's paying off\nEnormous dividends NASA\nCan now rely on cheaper launches focus on a more ambitious ex exploration\nRobotic and manned flight as well and the commercial side\nWhile but you know they were small satellites coming up on what you mentioned rocket lab that expand greatly the number of places I can get involved in a number of missions out there more missions means happy space sports and I you know this experiment that happened with these three subsequent administration's they may not be another policy that\nIt has survived those three minutes rations intact like this not one but wildly successful um\nIt's starting to pay dividends they're there and what's happening now is the launch system's getting into space as being commercialized now they're looking at\nHuman space flight commercialize it and also landing on foreign\nBodies on celestial bodies landing on the moon is going to be leverage by commercial technology\nBeing military launches per although of billions of dollars pouring into military space a lot of that as being leverage in a B a B commercial space companies that are coming on line not just space to actually they actually lost the most recent one\nBlue origin um there's a new rocket I'm ... America hey that's being tapped by the U.S military so this robust industrial base is really paying dividends and ... and enabling US government to do things that are lapping the Europeans and and are keeping pace with\nThe new stuff with the Chinese are doing and and winning the United states off of Russian human launch vehicles to all these things are happening right in front of us so if it sounds like we're being optimistic or or being ... were just you know for me it just reporting what's happened\nIn the you you single out in your article in Popular Mechanics and the United kingdom space industry or is that all in all lead situation are they aware of the problem more than Europe\nThey have a a big steak is but I mean especially in satellite manufacture I think it's like forty percent of the commercial communication satellites have\nHenry a very good evening to you I did not know that the U.S was the leader\nIn anti GMO activism\nHow does it work here how is it working in Europe right now good evening to you and me\nAnd John well there there are many manifestations of\nGenetic engineering activism you and I have been talking about this for years so uh there's a ... Harris meant of academics\nAre there are misrepresent patients about ... I'm a genetically engineered organisms and also the herbicide like ... say that her years with them\nUm and a ... law suits and all sorts of manifestations but specifically\nA what my recent article was about was that you use or misuse\nOf freedom of information request a to hire as academics at a public institution\nAnd so I'm there had been a professors or who have been a Harris than intimidated by these mountains of freedom of information request type the University of Illinois\nUniversity of Oklahoma law school Washington state university University of California Davis and on and on and on and a among the worst was professor ... fold up a plant biologist at the University of Florida who uh\nWho how to turn over tens of thousands of emails a and T estimated that his institution a public university to spend over a million dollars in a vetting managed to decide which ones were disclose the ball and which ones work\nUh now this technique\nThe freedom of information

of information a ... a documents\nAbout from a various universities\nAnything to do with a biotechnology company or a conversations about so called ...\nUh and uh it's very intimidated because researchers up neither of the time nor the resources are to contend with with this kind of thing\nAh the the activists I should point out are very very well funded by the upkeep pockets from the organic industry\nOn both sides of the pot and uh also\nBut they share the very same agenda\nUh with the Russian government batches a unleashed its ... and a and an agent uh to uh to compromise American R D than a commercial ballot ...\nThe U.S right to know is the chief NGO are advocating the nuisance suits against universities but I'm struck Henry by this a parent\nOr this apparent sympathy that the u._s. right to know has with the anti vaccine activist as well is it the same group of people I mean do they have to have do they do they take phone calls from two directions and are the university's aware of this\nWell I ... the the universities are aware of it if they are if they read the expos those of us are to us right to know and some of these other groups now you you're rightly asking what the connection there is\nNot only are the groups like us right to know\nA funded by the organic industry they're they're they're ... um their ... their fellow travelers if you will or the natural products industries that ... ... ... quack chores who don't like vaccines\nAnd who don't like a legitimate pharmaceuticals\nWhich they regard as the competition and so or whether they're simply\nType technology cooks or a taking their marching orders from that be a ... ... quack chores who also fun to work both a is anyone's guess but they they certainly are a shells bought

rent\nTo a country first seal activists who and this too and these two instances are looking to undermine are challenged best practices in Europe the European does your opinion to have a way of defending itself Henry or is it all on every man for himself\nBut I think it's a it's every man for himself because the the uh the Harris Mitt is going to universities primarily in Europe\nOr the European Union\nAnd the many of the agencies of the United nations the food and agriculture organization un environment program and so on that are based in Europe or very genetic engineering and anti

John I I'm not conversing with the nuances\nOf a European freedom of information law but the fact that there that it it goes to litigation or suggest said yes but uh uh it's more lenient and I'm more

catastrophe the outbreak of World War one and the collapse of the ...\nThe story so far prepares us for the catastrophe that is now to fall on the people of the hops Berg empire officer a hunger and the battle of limber again Rob a rough this is the north of what is the em [noise] called ...\nParts of it are now mostly Ukraine parts are Poland\nAt this time there are many Ukrainians living now remember this whole thing is made out of pocket tribal pocket everybody with different languages and different histories but they're all niche and together supposedly by their loyalty to\nThe hops birds to the old man however this army marching in the ... is running into the Russian Army Jeffrey we will run into the Russian Army with the Austrian game plan which is always attack though there are number\nThere's a man named ... commander a man named Bruce Ackerman are they aware as they plow into the Russians that they're out numbered and overwhelmed and being pushed into a strategy that can't possibly work\nOr not not initially they have there's some cause for hope ah you know the the central assumption of a stronger in war planning\nBefore Nineteen fourteen was that the great war would be against the Russians and even if they were able to fight with the serves the Russians would intervene and so the bulk of their strength would have to fight the Russian and so\nHad pondered how the the relatively small after Hungarian Army fight the vast Russian Army and this is this is a really uh\nAnd flexing problem for the Austrians because the Russian Army is going to advance on a very broad front from the Baltic Sea all the way down to the to Ukraine\nSo all the way down to the nice stir so where do where can the Austrian strike with any hope of victory well there was no hope of a victory in the sense of breaking through or sweeping around the Russian flank in March into St Petersburg what's\nThe what the Austrians always plan to do is to give it a short sharp jab at the Russians and knock them back and inflict heavy casualties in tear up their railways and retard their mobilization\nBy time for the Germans to win in the west and then try and support the troops to the east so often bag and a ... often bag and ... the three generals on the on this uh Eastern Front uncle and then north route are often back in the center of brutal been in the south at ...\nThey were the army's that uh we're gonna make the short sharp jab at the Russians and try to throw their mobilization of war\nThey called it brought out that was attacked\nIt's kind of like the the US marine corps you know hey did a little right at the middle this was Austria Austrian armies slang for you know sort of a macho attacks you know smartly delivered without a lot of preliminary fire maneuvering and flank and just spray up the middle and uh you know over power the enemy with your mainland is as it were\nThis is early September Nineteen fourteen and you haven't seen that illustrates to me how nothing was going to work at one point six Russians patrol get lost in the woods\nAnd they come across to south in Austria and they try to surrender the Austrians instead you report one of the Austrian officers says in check to the Russians let us surrender to you and so six Russians take prisoner two thousand Austrian\n[noise] yeah and this was you know this was a month or less into the war and already extreme demoralization on the Austria Hungarian side and this was you know for many reasons first because the army was already suffering badly from nationality problems before the war\nParticularly among the checks which for one of the more sophisticated and and numerous a national minorities in the empire and they they held a lot of slots and the officer corps they were an industrialized rich province but the checks\nOr really treated like second or third class citizens and they thought this was particularly appalling because of all the concessions given the Hungarians and Eighteenth sixty seven the checks it always held out for the same kind of concessions and didn't get them so by the time they get into the war in Nineteen fourteen\nYou see extreme disaffection among the checks both in the on the Russian front and on the Serbian front ah when we talk about the Serbian front we see whole check Eunice dissolving under fire and in this case that you just cited of this to battalions of check infantry surrendered by their own officers to patrol of six Russians\nThis it it doesn't get much worse than that\nBut as for the actual plan for the offensive there were two options there was either a ... southern stroke\nFrom ... to try to get around the left flank of the Russians are there was a ... northern stroke\nA northern blow to try to get around the rights of the Russians and the problem is that the Russians were so numerous and they mobilize so quickly unexpectedly quickly because of this huge French investments in in Russian infrastructure before the war so they could now mobilized and deployed far more quickly than the Austrians are even Germans it anticipated\nThey have so many troops on the line very early in the war that the Russian that the Oscar Hungarians really can't get around either flank with any hope of success\nSo in the end they launched this first battle of there's a battle called crowds Nick and then a battle called comb are off these are the first the opening battles on the Eastern Front both are are you know a small time Austria Hungarian victories but they're rapidly absorbed by these huge Russian numbers and the tables are quickly turned\nAnd then after that I mean after these these short sharp actions to the very beginning of the war it's all downhill for the Oscar Hungarians\nThere's the photographs in your book on September tenth Conrad the commander of the overall army but that's certainly the commander of the strike north and Archduke fried Rick I think they call him ...\nAh they travel to the front for what you say is one of three wartime visits and they're standing on a road looking off into the landscape it's very flat and behind them well look to be a number of German officers German Natasha ...\nAnd they look ignorant no one's briefing them I guess they hear gunfire in the distance in this picture and accurate presentation of what intelligence they had about where the Russians were\nWell that's a great picture and uh and it it's interesting because it shows the the the very strained\nRelations between Conrad interested Frederick they're not really like ... who worked very much in tandem and are very effective pair\nIn fact a freezer ... militarily inexperienced and Conrad is very nervous and thin skinned and so there's sort of gazing off as if to try to divine what's happening\nThey had good intelligence in the sense of that all of their frontline units were from the second army and the and the third army\nAnd the fourth army and the case of that photo they're all in contact with the Russians and they're passing back information that they are in contact with a division or a brigade or a core or whatever\nSo they have they're pretty good information plus they've got some limited aviation capabilities so they're getting flyer reports giving them you know as a bigger picture of of of Russian movements but it's just that um\nAs I talk about in the book their whole strategic conception was deeply flawed Conrad really believed he was an exponential of the offensive any really believe that if he just kept attacking the Russians he would somehow over all of them he would somehow destroy their morale and throw them back and make them quit\nAnd um this was not a view confined to Conrad I mean you see this all around Europe in Nineteen fourteen the French are are are just as bad in this respect the battle the frontiers and the battle of them are and they're launching these high concentrated attacks at the Germans and suffering previous casualties but the the the the the difference is that\nThe French rapidly adjusting to shove pulls everything back and change his tactics and goes into trenches\nAnd Conrad never read thinks that I mean he does obviously by Nineteen Fifteen sixteen but throughout Nineteen fourteen and the first half of Nineteen Fifteen he's just like attacking relentlessly and his general just saying you know ... we can't I mean we're we're being were being destroyed\nAnd the troops won't do it they they they won't go forward they've they've seen this this movie too many times\nAnd and yet Conrad who in you know you mentioned that photo and it's also quite good because it captures the essence of these two men who were shot two generals par excellence I mean they only go three times in three years to the front\nAnd uh and uh so they have very little sense of what's really going on and what it feels like to attack Russian quick firing artillery heavy artillery and machine guns and they're they are trying to make sense of the battle in and despite being briefed and everything else they're still or in these\nAttacks in the book is a mad catastrophe the outbreak of World War one and the collapse
