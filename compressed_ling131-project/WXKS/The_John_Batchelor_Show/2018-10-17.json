prominent central bank is its economy is not that important Yemen's God we don't talk about Yemen central banker Nigeria central bank\nThe central bank the feds power is an effect of the size of the U.S economy it's kind of like giant stadium lots of people admire giant stadium yeah well New York and the giants they're rich and so they have a nice stadium the fed has an effect of all this and so the ... this notion\nThat it can allocate credit and set the proper price of credit on the way the economic Nirvana is laughable\nWhat's remembered that when we borrow we're we're seeking money for all the world's resources trucks tractors computers desk chairs labor the fed can create that and the fed certainly wouldn't have the information to set a price\nThe fed is a rate follower it cannot create a booming economy any more than it can reasonably taken economy we act in the real economy as though the fed doesn't exist\nLet's go to a country other than the United states or Italy or the European Union that you profiled recently John in an article that you published it four sisters Yemen a war torn\nFailed state twenty six million people well it started there I don't know how many of

John and how does that teach us\nWell because there's this assumption even in most\nSchools Austrian Keynesian you name it that because central banks have essentially the power of the printing press they can fund unlimited government spending\nBut such a view isn't true\nOr if it were true that while Yemen's got a central bank um why doesn't that just print more Rielle to save a country that's descending into chaos a more government spending to basically spend the company the country back to normal\nWhat can't do that in fact Yemen central bank had to borrow two hundred million from says Saudi Arabia central bank just to stay afloat\nAnd it's a reminder once again that\nThe fed is relevant and its relevance is vastly overstated because the U.S economy is relevant that's where it gets its swagger from it doesn't create economic health in the United states doesn't create good times and the United states how could the fed possibly do that but\nIt's large because it's backed by the most productive people on earth Yemen central bank can't do anything in fact it's got to go hat in hand out to other central banks just to stay afloat precisely because countries at war don't have a condom use generally Yemen doesn't have one chance at Central bank is utterly irrelevant\nAre we reacting to central banks we eyes in the conventional wisdom or are the central bankers reacting to us John conventional wisdom how does it go\nOh as a conventional wisdom says that we basically follow what the central bank does and and if the fed is raising rates that's going to weaken the economy and vice versa but in reality think about it the fed follows us\nI mean let's reduce this to the absurd what if the fed raises the funds rate to five percent more does anyone think that banks will suddenly pay five percent\nFor no absolutely not they'll they'll ... they'll low ball each other to see who what customers they can steal yeah ...\nThey would the fed is a rate follower look the feds rates are low because banks overnight or presently lending to one another\nOvernight at a lower rate let's also add that most lending certainly any dynamic lending in the most dynamic economy in the world occurs well away from banks that as a rule because their margins are so slim cannot take big risks and so we're following the fed at least the media is\nThat has nothing to do with an economy that's the most intrepid dynamic in the world\nThe fed is it yesterday thought thank goodness that you and I are discussing it ... I I don't mind saying we're just ahead of the game give us five years most people agree with us why did we ever take the Federal Reserve so seriously\nAnd the answer John is that I don't have an answer is that okay I I Can't answer that question to answer whenever I see\nMarket whenever I see the markets sell off because of something the Federal Reserve might do or did do I think to myself I've got a call up to me because this doesn't make any sense\nThat's right well it it's it's a good way of thinking about it you know in mid all this amid all this talk about the fed what we're ignoring is that Mike Pence vice president Pence what ten twelve days ago gave a very loud speech about how the u._s. was going to resume much bigger tariffs on China\nKind of thing that would spook markets the Trump Administration announced last week that it was going to severely police Chinese and other foreign investment in twenty seven different sectors in the U.S that's called market intervention imagine if the Trump Administration said we're going to police Blackstone Klein or Perkins\nAnd black rock imagined the market reaction this stuff is probably what's scaring investors not the fed playing around with the rate\nThat has nothing to do with what actually happens in the real economy\nJohn ... is director of the center for economic freedom freedom works his most recent book is the end of work\nAnd before that who needs the fat I'm John bachelor this is the John ... or so [noise]\n\n[noise] this corporate profile but it just brought you buy the green organic touch my take on a comedian licensed cannabis\nProducers quickly becoming the world's largest organic cannabis brand God has a massive fully funded expansion underway building nearly one point five\nMillion square feet of hybrid production facilities capable of producing over three hundred Seventy five thousand pounds of premium organic ... ... is a global company will operations across North America\nCentral America and Europe for the company has a proven management team with significant experience in consumer packaged goods and consumer products Aurora ... says invested over Seventy eight million dollars would be to God with the ability to invest even more\nThis corporate ... has been brought you buy the green organic dutchman one of the largest Canadian ... producers of cannabis ...

a region well worth exploring I welcome\nMy colleague Richard Epstein he's a professor of law at the University of Chicago as well as at NYU he\nIs most importantly is senior fellow at the Hoover Institution writing most recently a defining ideas on climate change or as it has been said over many years now global warming\nThe inner governmental panel on climate change from the U.S has issued a new report that is more alarming than the last report\nIf I understand this correctly we're in deep trouble if the statistics demonstrated here are accurate they're claiming that an order to save our understanding of how to live in the temperate zone we must from we must reduce carbon dioxide admissions by almost half\nBy twenty thirty that is in the mirror twelve years and make carbon dioxide emissions neutral by twenty fifty that is within sight of everyone who is in their thirties and forties right now it's just tomorrow\nAt the same time that kind of dramatic change in our carbon dioxide emissions will reduce our GDP by fill in the blank will we will not be\nCapable of pushing a button and ordering Amazon anytime you want Richard I'm very good evening to you I Do not believe the BCC wants to talk about the GDP and gross but that is a major concern you have to have\nIf we're going to follow along\nAnd the recommendations the eye BCC is making let's get let's get right to it Richard\nGDP is the major threat yes we're going to talk about forest fires and hurricanes but the GDP is the major threat and they the the those who advance global warming fears do not want to talk GDP good evening to you Richard\nElderly the it's a very difficult thing to estimate\nWhat they're trying to do is to say that we have to have radical changes in the way which everything is put together a not only the way in which the energy industries work but everything that we do with respect to land transportation and so forth or they have no recommendations is to exactly what should be done\nIf you thought that there were massive inefficiencies in the industries that we have out today somebody said you had to make them better than they are\nThey say okay we'll try but they don't identify any particular vulnerable points inside the system of production of distribution and so forth and in fact if you look at a relatively unregulated economy the United states the iron is without any prodding from\nThe IPC see the Paris accords or anything else\nWe have by their own stand is the best measures of all these things name when affect\nThe United states has managed to increase output while reducing\nCarbon dioxide missions in the last year two thousand and Seventeen nobody else has done that\nThe real opened in the room is China who's\nThe missions total is twice or as well but they are still committed to a coal economy they may cut down the amount they are going to increase it but they're not going to cut it down at all so essentially what they're doing is they're trying to get everybody else to cooperate knowing that China will not this thing becomes a total impossibility off for anything that you want [noise]\nAnd so what are the changes that you could start to make is a very fair question to ask\nDo you want people to ship ... like you wanted to make sure that the food supply is going to be very very short they are trying to stop innovations and drugs and pharmaceutical the basic history as a kind of a deep on this by all the standard measures that we have agricultural productivity\nIndustrial safety in the like the world is much safer place now than it was it Nineteen Ninety three and a much more productive port so one would have thought hey the trend is go in the right direction or what we really want to do is to continue to hold our technological edge and to avoid making any of these precipitous remarks\nAnd they're doing exactly the opposite direction without the slightest acknowledgement of the ways in which the changes have gone from either their\nWhat effect does this have on the GDP nobody really can do but it's likely to be extremely substantial if you do it but it will not be done the willingness of people are actually to go to bed hungry and cold every night in order to change a carbon dioxide\nIt's down the road is non existent and if you actually try to look at the science or they do is they say\nIs we're lowering our target from two point though to one point five that's not often bases zero with the base of somewhat higher than that because they're trying to get back to industrial pre industrial time and say it's a ... percent reduction in carbon dioxide admissions if you haven't shown any past dislocation\nNobody in their right mind would rely on a series of highly controversial models\nTo push things in the opposite direction when all the models that proved to be rolling up to date so I Would say in effect that this thing is going to be stillborn from the press it will get all sorts of abstract support but it will not get any admissions or any support from any administration that actually has to do it\nEven those states that have try something is modest the carbon dioxide acts have essentially realize that they're highly expensive and they produce no short term\nBenefits in the new cars forest fires California had a bad an early forest fire season there were metrics just suggest that the global warming trends or the climate change ... at trends have contributed to\nFires by you represent and I believe correctly because I've read about this as well\nThat the builders and the cities that have spread into unusual areas of California have also contributed to this sense of emergency that the fires are getting hotter and bigger but at the same time we're not we're not able to do anything about it so at this point\nThe PC is measuring the forest fires will deepen because of global warming can we make that direct equation Richard\nKnow this book you're talking about changes in temperature at the global level now which are running in under ten degrees\nA tenth of a degree in a year would be an enormous civil wrist is this just in the last Eighteen is increase has probably been in the order of about one tenth of a degree and I was standing at Thirteen percent increase in carbon dioxide levels what really determines forest fires are a bunch of other things like the ... much of a\nBasically fungible material fish unable material burn up all material which gathers and if\nYou were to improve the management the public lands for example would make it much greater difference in this area of forest fires than trying to do anything for global warming\nThe contrast between fires on private lands which are very low and on public managed lands are very very great\nAnd the larger question of does Harvard does any college\nThat participates in federal dollars\nDeposit comply or violate title six of the civil rights act of Nineteen sixty four which to quote from bills column\nProhibits discrimination on the basis of race color or national origin in any program or activity that receives federal funds or other federal financial assistance then quote bill a very good evening to you\nThese two things do not go together titled six and what we know so far about harbored ruling in I arbitrary fashion to my knowledge\nAgainst Asian Americans and in favor of other ethnicities on the basis of how well the Asian Americans must do as opposed to others a very good evening to you and can we leave this is a paradox or must we started out good evening bill\n... well it's a mess John I'm either because the Supreme Court has basically ruled on a couple of these cases of with affirmative action that it's okay to discriminate little another word race can be a factor but it can't be the deciding factor but\nYou know where you draw the line is um is unclear um ... the reason the Asian Americans are complaining is because\nWe sort of know from places like California where they have\n... where they prohibited um race being considered that Haitians make up about forty percent at Harvard there about twenty percent of the school even though the population of Asian Americans says you know skyrocketed in the U.S and the number of applicants to the schools\nHave skyrocketed in two thousand nine a Princeton did a study on sort of penalty universities and they found that on average in African American I mean a I'm an Asian American would have to score four hundred fifty points higher than a blackout applicant\nI think it's two hundred Seventy points higher than a Latino applicants and a hundred and forty points higher than a white applicants to get in\nWhat strikes me and your measure here is that the United states is the center of great interest around the world were a global global focus for people to educate their children that were not just national boundaries anymore right come from everywhere\nAnd I it strikes me that Harvard's unhappy decision making is based on a parochial model a national model that's out of date that fifty or a hundred years behind\nWe're we're we're attracting the best and the most eager from around the world and Harvard doesn't want to change that's why Asian Americans I mean nine ... nine out of the next ten\nPeople to become middle class will be in Eurasia not in the United states there and vicious and good for them and Harvard isn't recognizing it\nWell I think that they would they would say is that they value diversity by which\nAs we know they don't mean diversity of opinion [noise] um they mean racial diversity and they believe in their own balance and that they they are the people that should be allowed to seek that balance now for many years um when\nThe uh the victim so that\nKind of process for white applicants people thought\nWell that's okay ah for diversity we you know minorities Latinos and African Americans are taking their rightful place and whites would have to give a little well now it's another minority\nSuffers as discrimination it defies all the stereotypes and it's because\nThey say they have this formula for diversity and and you and I are both friends with for trip seen a lawyer right in with a law professor NYU is written\nVery good articles on this and his view as they should be free to do that or we should just get rid of the title fixed because the people who are rejected would have good offers somewhere else um [noise]\nAnd uh it would free us up from the government getting involved in this bill would Harvard does is Harvard is only in court because it takes federal dollars if it didn't take federal dollars it could run it's this mission the way you want it to 'em but title six supplies to entities to\nGet any federal assistance and that includes not only grants to the schools but if any of the students getting any federal financial aid that counts too if they gave that up and they have a thirty nine billion dollar endowment um they wouldn't be in court\nThey wouldn't be in court but they can't give up titled sex you point out that they are and dominance thirty nine billion dollars and they're not going to suffer damage to that in order to comply with federal law so the the result here we're headed towards\nA a crash these ... these two things are going to crash and we're picking Harvard out because it's been especially creative vintage discriminate\nOn the one being sued right but everybody everybody knows that other ... other colleges other universes right through all the same ...\nAnd in fact John to your point there was an ... brief um submitted a by many of the other schools including Yale or because they do the same thing everyone knows are to stand in for um uh most of our leading universities\nSo let's mention Hillsdale because I Know the facts here support that Hillsdale has made a stand in not taking title sex and what does that make available to Hillsdale that Harvard can't how\nWell the interesting thing is Hillsdale and Harvard make the same argument we ought to be able to wear private institutions we ought to be able to run or admissions the way we want to\nInhale ... case the way they want to is they want to be colorblind in back in the seventies the department of health education and welfare wanted Hillsdale to count all their applications by race and gender and they didn't want to do it and still founding charger I I I don't know when it's from Eighteen Twenty one or something\nI made it the first school in America to be open to everyone regardless of a race or gender so it was open to women\nAnd African Americans I mean long before the rest of society integrated they famously refused to play in a Nineteen fifty six bowl game their football team was undefeated\nBut the bowl official said you can't field you're black players they said okay we're not come and then so this is the schools had a long tradition of this and they were fighting\nOr they were fighting for different things from Harvard but at the same principle they were fighting for the right to do their own emissions in a colorblind process so what they did\nIs um after a Supreme Court decision\nThey decided we're not going to take any federal dollars anymore we're going to do it our way we're going to forego federal dollars and that includes financial aid for the students that was a that was a hard thing to do you know today I'm more than Thirty years after they made that decision they only have an endowment of six hundred million or so\nUm but they made a decision they stuck by and I pick up the stronger place for it\nWe have a minute sale and it ... it's impossible to walk by Elizabeth Warren and not bring her ended at ten\nElizabeth Warren making claims that are do do do indeed creative about her heritage or make a mockery of the whole idea at Harvard that they can decide what you are on the basis of their categories and not just the fact that we're all mixed up we're all mixed up\nRight I mean as my colleague James Freeman wrote today you really have to wonder what does identity politics mean if you're one\nOne thousand and twenty fourth and you can call yourself

Senator Warren clicking\nHere it's just ridiculous I mean I think we owe her a a great thing for exposing\nThe silliness not just behind her claim but the whole idea of this stuff and uh I think she's

they're not interested except when they need some good publicity and a brush rape and yet suddenly we have major\nPolitical scandals are the kinds of that could very well result in a transformation a bilateral relations between the United states and the countries involved\nAnd in the forefront seem to be our there's no doubt about it intelligence services consider all night here in the United states what we call Russia gate\nWhich is based essentially on intelligence agencies allegations about what the Kremlin did to cry\nSuccessfully are unsuccessfully to compromise President Trump then we have you mentioned it in the United kingdom the attempt it appears to kill a a former he was actually a British age and they turned agent\nHe had been swap living in England but an attempt they say\nBy Russian intelligence agencies to kill Mr screwball who had been living quietly in Salisbury England and his daughter and then we have now almost recently this some of them in Turkey in the consulate of Saudi Arabia\nWhere say journalists to Saudi journalist who was residing with a green card in the United states and actually a Washington Post columnist who apparently was killed in\nEach of these cases the leading actors are said to be intelligence agencies so you would agree with that premise so far\nI certainly do agree with it and I'm On a on a layer it a little bit Steve\nThese intelligence agencies have their own ideas about how to oppose there or the other country and they always have and in fact in reading about how\nThe Soviets thought of America and how Great Britain thought of the Soviets it's exactly the same the Soviets wanted Margaret Margaret Thatcher to lose in Nineteen eighty three\nThey were and they worked very diligently to undermine their I\nDid I get ... cyber warfare to see how the first chief directorate Senate illegals and to influence in betray\nThat the federal government and in fact they supported labor Michael Foot was a longtime\nConfidant of KGB of agents so Steve it's it's not it's a revelation to me that in the detail because we now have the filter of Russia gate but I don't see any update whatsoever save the it's like both both sides have these template of how to disrupt the other government\nBut this takes me to a number of concept that is always put out there when we try to figure out what actually happened evidently Russian intelligence agencies were involved in this for Paul fair but the question is\nDid prove know about it or was it in the word is used a rogue operation\nSo what I Want to do\nYou suggest that we need [noise] excuse me John its end of allergy season\n[noise] um we need to rehabilitate the were rogue it's true and history teachers is this recent history too that if it's quote a rogue operation it could just be a commercial criminal\nActs because these guys\nHave all sorts of freelance operations they were for the official intelligence agency but they freelance at least Russian intelligence agencies have they work for dark money people they get involved in all sorts of criminal activities and occasionally somebody once and debt\nWhich has nothing to do with politics but I Want to go to the other possibility that these rogue operations\nAre actually political that is to say it's possible because you have is in history to use adjusted just before that they are run by opponents of the leader a router I Moscow right out of\nSaudi Arabia to disrupt a foreign policy but the opponents don't right now we have a history of this and the Soviet Union for example\nGoing back actually to Nineteen twenty four but the one that keeps coming to my mind I Can't place the date but it was the early sixties when there were no diplomatic relations\nBetween the Soviet Union in West Germany and ... the Soviet leader decided he was going to restore formal diplomatic relations with\nEast Germany and in the run up to that of course Joss enemies ran a number of operations to disrupt it to sabotage it including a gas attack on the west German ambassador\nAnd it almost destroyed Khrushchev off a plan but it's ... per pulled ahead we also have fairly well documented that when Eisenhower increased shelf began their d'etat after ... death [noise] uh and they had a third meeting planned in Paris\nOr what it must have been Nineteen sixty I think that someone\nSet the YouTube spy plane over Russia it was shot down\nThat disrupted eyes or an hour and ... did not meet again that was the end of that they taught and records seems to show it was set by the CIA the plane belong to the CIA that forces in the CIA perhaps the director\nDouglas himself was opposed to detente with Russia so we come back to this idea that what we casually referred to\nAs rogue operations could be\nPolitical operation involving the highest level policy what are the opponents usually intelligence agencies or the intelligence agencies themselves are opposed so we do not know\nOr we may find out we can analyze but we can't be sure whether in the case of the attack on script Paul and the United kingdom\nAnd on the case of the killing evident killing of the Saudi a journalist in um turkey whether the leader of the country\nCorrect ... and I'm ... had been solving knew about this or these were operations against these two leaders remember that at the moment of the crop\nBoth leaders at different times were making a major effort to prove their image and\nThe judge just a moment Steve I have an example from the other side from the old Cold War professor Stephen F ...

I Can't be sure I really can't what how he served Margaret Thatcher\nAnd how he served Ronald Reagan and how we serve Great Britain the queen decorated him but he look from the Russian point of view to be an arch traitor\nAnd part of the apparatus that destroyed the Soviet Union it would appear that that was an accident that he didn't mean to destroy the Soviet Union what he meant was to encourage democracy as you said at the time in his in his in his country do we have actress today\nIn our agencies that my five and my six CIA FBI\nWho believed that they are encouraging her strengthening democracy by undermining it you see my analogies state\nI Do but I disagree with you on one point but maybe it's not a disagreement maybe you didn't mean to included I think if a case of the Russia gate allegations against crop\nWhich are also allegations against ... that is ... pride long ago to recruit Trump or compromising and he's been success\nAnd it's still happening on him and and run and run to\nThe right it's sad it's sad that is clearly a political agenda no question about it a Obama's intel cheeks particularly John Brennan editors CIA\nPursued this agenda record is clear Brennan's made no bones about it\nThat he was a kind of godfather of Russia gate allegations very early on and he still punctured out today because he has occurred chunks some network and he gets in the New York times on the op ed page when he wants to but it appears to be also a line of the people Trump\nAppointed to these agencies [noise] therefore if they corporate position we can't say oh it was just Brennan no it was a high level of the CIA and it seems clear to me\nThat from the beginning when Trump first outer these words earlier in two thousand and sixteen cooperate with Russia they did not want this pause\nAnd they continue to not want this policy and therefore in the case\nOf these intelligence operations that involve Russia I think we can say that they are intensely political and we can analyze them as part of the political story so it raises the question we\nRaised it before because there have been episodes I remember in July how long are we forget there's so much News John but we spoke in July or when after Trump what the Helsinki to meet with boot and in their first formal summit\nAnd when Trump got home he was literally accused by the New York times in the Washington Post and by John Brennan himself\nWho is now retired of treason\nFor doing what I was simply having having add a joint press conference with ... and this has never happened to an American president\nEvery president since Roosevelt and met with the Soviet or the Russian leader Trump is called treasonous for doing this so it raises a question of who's making Russia policy in Washington\nIs it Trump or is it forces with the backing\nOf the intelligence agency so we come now I Do in my head and I'm not a conspiracy theorist but if we agree that intelligence agencies have been major players in high level politics particularly foreign\nWell ... the history of the history is adamant on this Steven leader for the first cold Gore and we agree on yes so as

heavy sanctions against Russia and they've got them and they're promising more which they call crippling Trump doesn't want them but for whatever reason he goes along so it's worth of acts asking how these sanctions against Russia and against too\nA badly damaged the Russian economy\nTherefore ... standing in Russia and the short answer is though they hurt and they hurt ordinary people in some

John bachelor show Bob's gym and he keeps the website beyond the black he's the author of Jonathan [noise]\nThat story of Apollo eight in the great success of Nineteen sixty eight\nNow available an audio version we go to the news right now very sad news of the loss of one of the heroes of commercial space Paul Allen\nOne half of the genius putting together Microsoft Paul Allen devoted himself to many many activities and\nExperiments and funding a brave funding but the his work on the brain especially but Bob is going to help us understand the investments that Paul Allen made into commercial space shuttle launch Bob a very good evening to you I did not know Paul Allen was ... lost to us at sixty five\nA clearly a it was a very well to do man but he used his money for invention and too especially invent dry and a lot so let's define what is try to launch Bob in what is the state right now\nTry to launch was Ellen's idea of his way of reducing the cost to getting payload into all of it or that we've talked about it a lot of times on your show John what they did is they purchased to a seven forty sevens and they use those in their engines\nTo build what will it would be the largest airplane ever launched they call it rock or oh she names of the legendary flying creature\nUm and they've been doing taxi tests on it recently and building up to speed on the runway and they hoped in a multitude of launching the idea was much like I'm\nNot from ... packets his rocket launches under the bottom of the L. ten eleven a wide body plane ah this this giant plane would have a rocket underneath it in the fuselage what it takes off any runway which gives you lots of flexibility as low as your costs enormously takes off\nTo hire you know goes up to a pretty high altitude and then it releases the rocket which then goes into orbit and you save money in in your infrastructure on the ground you could flexibility your customers because she can launch any inclination and location and uh you have a much more flexible and when you watch them where you don't have to worry about a lot of range of issues\nMuch fewer and and that was the idea of the company has been building the plane for a while they've had a problem getting someone to build the rocket that would go underneath the plane\nUm and they went through over the lead K which is now the Grumman who had built practices rocket than they were ... they were trying to space X to do what they turned it down\nThen they said they're going to put Pegasus rockets under rock but those are tiny rockets they don't need rock to really do that so this year the company's shuttle launch announced that it's going to be building its own rockets to go under a rock um uh several versions of water which would be a completely\nA a a a some kind of like a um\nMany shuttle in a sense it would launch from the bottom of the plane\nGo into orbit drop off a payload and then it could come back in return to earth\nAnd so that would be useful belongs system and so they made that announcement that's a few years down the road a lot must be pointed out he had shot as Paul Allen's death and this young age is is going to be a factor often is a factor for companies like this because\nThere's no question this is a visionary approach which carries great risk and what what do those kinds of circumstances you need a specific powerful wealthy each individual with vision\nAt the end of the company to force it through when things go wrong a corporate committee type situation\nIt shouldn't often chickens chickens out they can't get it done if anything goes wrong they lose focus and so this ... we don't know yet how we set the company up who's going to be in charge afterward there's no real names haven't been brought up about that company\nAnd so we're going to just have to see how it goes to they could affect them um I Will say that um\nI I had my concerns about them because they lack of getting the company to build the rocket underneath the ... the ... airplane I'm at the same time ... switch to getting government money rather than to building that's rocket independent government\nThings we might be losing them as a low cost rocket company and then this is a company that might say that they provide some competition to space X when we need that competition so we just don't see how it plays out on its last though there's no question of it he owns two for sports teams a lot of ... pay a lot of money went to a lot of good cause the\nBrain now as we have a brain Institute I mentioned it's often a ... a useful for items and science and nature magazine I'm presuming that will all continue he does have a family but strata launches our focus on commercials space I I go from one ... one law to one failure in the failures so used to launch\nMost recently spectacularly failing the rescue of the astronauts cosmonauts\nThere's an emergency commission set up in Russia to investigate this becomes a long process Bob what does the law so you mean for the immediate future for our traveled to hire staff and for missions to earth orbit\nWhere it's a little unclear yet what the

forced back onto their own territory the the the Austrian Empire\nBecause of all the internal Russians that went on during this last war of Eighteen sixty six\nThe emperor felt compelled to make an arrangement with the Hungarians where he divided the monarchy into to have the Austrian half a Hungarian have called in Austria Hungary granted the Hungarians of parliament\nIn eastern Austria and and then there was a German Parliament in western Austria and so really the ... the country was the the the idea of the emperor's idea was that he was retrenching that he was shoring the empire of for the long haul after the defeat of Eighteen sixty six foot what\nAmerica's asked if he really talks about in the first third of the book is how this ... this great compromise of Eighteen sixty seven with the Hungarians\nRather than strengthening and retrenching you'd actually desperately weaken the monarchy because it creates it exacerbated the nationality problems that had already been quite sharp before Eighteen sixty six but they became much sharper after eating sixty six because of this compromise with a Hungarian basically\nEastern Australia the part that was taken over by the Hungarians as part of his great compromise of Eighteen sixty seven\nWas with Hungarians were actually minority\nMajority in eastern in eastern Austria this area called translate the any of the area east ... river where slobs and remains\nAnd the Hungarians where you know about a little less than fifty percent over there and the and and the majority were slobs and Romanians and so the Hungarians ruled eastern Austria\nWith an iron hand they insisted on Hungarian in schools and churches public office administration\nAre they in franchised only seven percent of the population you had to be a wealthy educated

Hungarians Romanians they all wanted to have more say in parliament they say a Ukrainian speaking university Ukrainian speaking schools more Ukrainian deputies in parliament are checked deputies or polish deputies you name it\nAnd the emperor was you know constantly trying to juggle all these things making little concessions here and there but having a really hard time keeping it together the only thing that might have served as a hardcore was the Austria Hungarian Army and yet the book shows quite convincingly\nThat this was a lost cause too because the Hungarians very deliberately\nWhittled down the army in the years after Eighteen sixty seven making made it increasingly small weak underfunded under gunned so that by the time you get to Nineteen fourteen it's an army the size of the Serbian Army ... ludicrously old fashioned artillery bronze guns often without crews shields\nVery low caliber short range\nHardly any heavy artillery at all\nNot nearly enough machine guns fewer machine guns per regimen battalion then the Russians even who are also very backward\nAnd you know at a in a dismal level of training\nAnd the other thing the Hungarians do in order to keep the Oscar Hungarian Army small because they they don't want to pay for it be they view it as possibly a conquering force if the Archduke ever takes over he makes no secret that he wants to re conquer hungry dissolve Austria Hungary and reestablish the Austrian Empire\nOr you know the Hungarians are are taking so much money out of the army when they get to Nineteen fourteen it's it's it's
