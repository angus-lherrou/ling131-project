five percent beating estimate it is also filled with details that I Need help with so that's why lose peak\nWho writes at Fox News and the hill\nShe's here to help me because the big number three point five percent sounds good Wall Street journal says strong I'm happy consumer spending sounds good but Liz there's a hesitation here in the analysis connecting it to the Federal Reserve connecting it to the business environment\nYour first response when you heard this number what ... what were you looking at where water the strengths and weaknesses good evening to\nGood evening John well clearly three and a half percent was better than expected the expectations are more uh tempered at three three three point four percent not a huge difference but definitely on the upside uh and as you point out the the best news certainly was\nThe consumer which raised a because the spend about four percent more uh and that that was\nGood news because consumer spending is really what's going to drive the fourth quarter obviously the holiday spending season is incredibly important that's where you get a huge amount of the yearly a consumer of layout and that's going to be very good for retailers and so forth assuming there's no change that I don't see really see\nThat all the all the consumer data from the fed beige book earlier this week and from this report is is very good that the element of the report that was not so good was a fall off from the second quarter in business investment and it was pretty dramatic and in fact you know I think it was way\nLess than people expected and what's important about that is that business investment is expected to drive productivity gains and\nOf course it's also a political issue that that\nAre Democrats have made much of the fact that corporations have gotten this big tax cut\nAnd the money is supposed to be going into building new plant and equipment just what we saw in the second quarter a but in fact uh it it didn't happen in the third quarter and so I think the question is is this a temporary blip this is a somewhat erratic series or is it a sign that the tariff discussions\nA wage\nPrice pressures all these kinds of things that are\nBeginning to strain corporate margins a little bit also showed up in deferred spending um\nSo ... you know the the the question and it is important because if you don't see productivity improvements which we have not it almost a decade then you really make the case that wages wage growth is going to continue to be stuck in this very slow court or um\nOverall I think it's a little too early to assume that uncertainty about the trade battle has really put a ... in ... in the corporate spending\nI think we have to wait another quarter to see whether that really manifests itself a and again we had a very big number I'm trying to remember exactly the is it seems like almost close to eight percent in the second quarter so it's probably not so unexpected that you would get a downturn\nIn that yes that eight percent on the second quarter I'm told that includes the energy sector putting a lot of money into development because we're a super power and that that took it up way high\nAlso this point eight percent on the annual right it's our point eight percent which means we're extremely extremely modest and the third quarter I'm told that that number is going to bounce around a lot we are going to get a second and third pass at this so I'm I'm not I'm not putting\nA I'm not putting any I'm not putting down what you say I'm just puzzled here if we have a complete picture because we're concentrating just on one day\nAnd there were some other ups and downs as well in the second quarter you had a real lack of spending on inventories we sort of expected that to come back and the third quarter and pump up the hill\nRon number and I did on the other hand there was a big surge in exports and the the trade deficit narrowed and the second quarter that helped GDP and conversely a an ... the widening of the trade deficit and the third quarter\nA hurt the growth rate over all that kind of balanced it seemed to me in the second quarter those two things inventories and trade deficit sort of balance each other out and I think again in the third quarter what we ... you know bottom line there are a lot of things that\nI should say the other weak point a was\nA residential construction or\nYou know home building has clearly being hurt\nBy a higher mortgage rates higher interest\nRate I'm shortage of supply the with the ... and they ... the market especially for new buyers\nYes but I think that I think the good news there at least if you kind of go back one step household formation numbers are still quite strong so at some point this is you know people have to live\nSomewhere and I think this is a market I think this is an industry sector I should say which in two thousand Nineteen could prove to be a source of strength for the overall economy because it is clearly lacking\nThe Federal Reserve project has guesses about what Nineteen and twenty are going to look like and the strength three point five percent which I'm told by Steve Moore\nA took a wee wee the gas prices took some points out of this may be a to point free ... so we're in a place where that that all of a sudden that gas bike hit the third quarter but the Federal Reserve production projects two point five and twenty nine teen to point\nA to point zero in twenty Twenty one pointed in twenty Twenty one well they revise that now because of the three point five or they're going to stand pat on their gloomy this\n[laughter] well I think they're going to probably continue to look at it at a downturn ... I don't mean a recession but a downturn in terms of the growth rate ah I doubt that these numbers will change that I think the real issue confronting the fed is that inflation the price to later a inflation numbers generally\nAre incredibly modest and so you know the conversation that's kind of developing now is what is sort of the neutral rate\nAnd is it two percent is it more than two percent or because you know you look at where our rates are now and compare them to for example a German bonds three point\nThree percent and ours are now a well\nOver a two percent so what what's the difference there I mean is that really makes sense are in other words are we really kind of a ham praying or grows by jacking up rates a little bit too aggressively kind of like President Trump has talked about or is there really a good solid reason for that\nSeems to me the inflation pressures are usually coming from two sources\nInto innovation into practical product use\nTo look inside them because there are two more categories will mention them the emerging markets and then the ones that are very weak this is the East Asia but I Want to go inside this this is the fastest growing group on the planet and the solar system\nAgain Taiwan and Singapore\nOr Hong Kong Japan Republic of Korea and news a New Zealand\nInside this however there are strengths and weaknesses for example Korea is an innovation powerhouse because it spends as Chris just indicated four point two percent of its GDP on R and D but it's very weak in the labor market according to the global competitiveness report\nAnd in products product markets there's not much competition do you feel that in your work Chris\n... absolutely ... in South Korea specifically you have the ... the eight large\nDominant companies in certain sectors are the Korean government has set up ... you would see is kind of two pillars so\nLet's talk consumer televisions as an example we have Elgin Sam's calling us the two large competitors the south Korean economy is very much oriented towards a large companies working very closely with the government as you've seen with some of the corruption problems there at times too closely\nBut the government having a direct invested a investment in support of those major employers in uh the basis of those employers having large employee bases in really helping to drive the economy for\nJapan which I Would have thought was perfect America because that how well they've done these last Seventy years their fifth overall income global competitiveness is good for Japan but\nThey according to this study how weak institutions and we corporate governance says that show up in competition with American firms\nIt very much does the Japanese economy is that there's great innovation there's great research but the Japanese a historically in business has been very um a\nCautious towards restructure towards layoffs some of the what you'd call creative destruction that happens in the U.S of a company may grow company may fail people fall out of that company and start new companies in Japan it's not quite that way you have much more of a government a\nDesire to minimize unemployment to in many cases supporter prop up businesses that may not be economically viable simply to keep order and to keep employment at high levels but that kind of brain some of their competitors competitiveness quite frankly\nA surprise to me Australia I talk often with Australia I follow the governance it's part of the Anglo file world it's very good about growing it has a vibe vibrant population\nAnd its fourteenth overall and it has some to grow but that's the envy of most of the planet but these sites labor rigidity and we can't invasion is that your experience and can you explain it\nIt will I Would say is ... Australia still\nPrincipally export economy with a a\nPrincipal client of Australia being China so if the Chinese economy a catches a cold Australia catches the flu or they're they're very much dependent on that export economy you also have very high minimum wage a a lack\nOf kind of scale innovation of growth and that ability to challenge income and sees Wiley a very\nInteresting place in some very very smart people besides to a certain extent the high labor cost in the ... the the lack of major brands that you would see converting are investing can continue to hold the economy ...\nIs that are they self ... or the Australian self aware that their weekend innovation but they've got the education and the skills and the resources to be strong and\nYou see it in tech at least is that some of the best and brightest from Australia especially in the tech world just simply leave Australia to go to work for American or European or other tech companies there's not the ...\nIn his base of tech in Australia that you see in many other countries so the best and brightest because they're portable because their workers and the knowledge economy simply leave\nSo there's a brain drain and it's caused by Australia's not responding to the competitiveness I'm a competitiveness a report now we moved to the big uh the the emerging markets which are all the excitement I was very much surprise to see Malaysia grouped in with China\nAh which ... they both have thirty points to the frontier that means to a hundred the u._s. is doing very well we're not at a hundred either nobody is it a hundred according to this Malaysia before we go to China do you do you sense that Malaysia is growing very quickly and that is innovative\nMalaysia's growing very quickly you have a rising consumer are rising middle class there that is very success oriented quite entrepreneurial a Malaysian starkly had been traders and very open to commerce as a whole I think the big thing that we watch they are simply\nBecause the government and whether the government stays in a liberal western democracy type style or swings towards the potential more fundamental\nI pick up on that on the charts saying that they have weak institutions that's the way they expressed that ah and there's not stability with the institutions weak institutions in Japan too that means I translate that Tammany Hall a lot of back scratching All right onto the mainland China\nChina's emerging technology along that the emerging technologies of Asia break down into three groups I've mentioned the top group Malaysia and China Indonesia the Philippines Vietnam Thailand and Brunei or in the second group and at the bottom in Asia in east Asia's Mongolia Cambodia and Laos but we're going to tend to\nChina China's said in this report and it's very generous did just a it's an inflection point to move from an investment driven economy to a consumption economy is that happening\n... because I hear routinely that China is not diversifying its economy not switching to the consumer\n... with the time that I spend their I'm always absolutely fascinated by the consumerism and the incredible modernization where the some of the best\nConsumer some of the best capital of the world are there in China\nI think that there's a very very rapid rise of the middle class in China in that embrace of consumerism that politics aside you have a motive needed very intelligent population that seeks to bring China to first world status and they understand how to from learning from the\nKoreans or the Japanese or others to look at how to embrace technology how to embrace consumerism to really mold and economy in the model of us\nSo they're aware that they have to work on consumerism that that is the missing piece of their economy and are the institutions permitting them to get to that or to allow shopping you know that's what we do crafts we shop where shopping were great shoppers are they learning from\n... from

John ... a segment of bumps or by gala gala a leading marketing technology company powers millions of digital signs around\nThe world leading the wave of retail transformation visit scholar dot com today to modernize your digital experience the business of America is small business this is the American business report with gene marks\nWrites a small business column for the guardian as well as the Philadelphia Inquirer a very good eating to gene there is good news in all directions for small business as the small businesses of America have been telling us for several years things are getting better all the time indeed we have a three point five percent first round report\nOn the GDP for the United states consumers are spending an eye fees on that because that's what small business cares about you have reported that\nThe fed beige book is indicating grows steady growth going forward although there are trade concerns will mention that but do small businesses continue optimistic or is there some hesitation is winter approaches in the north good evening to\nJohn it's great to speak with you yeah all all that information or that you report it is accurate the ah ah GDP numbers came out day is three and a half percent yours above what estimates were expecting um the economy um as continued to grow um some people are are forecasting more than a four percent\nUh yeah GDP increase in two thousand and nineteenth or wait to see on that a jobs numbers good consumer spending is up consumer sentiment is leveling off a little bit but\nThat could just be a monthly monthly blip now\nThe Federal Reserve um every month they go through and they they surveyed their um their their regional banks and um they put it together actually until like sort of a quarterly report that they like to do it to twelve regional banks Kobe the fed beige book\nAnd what it is it's again it's just a it's it's an anecdotal survey of how things are going in the different regions of the country and I'm ... page book or results were were released today and uh reporting what we all know already economic growth is\nSteady although most of the regional new Federal Reserve's reporting that businesses and all across all regions are\nStill are concerned about tightening labor market higher wages um is a potential concern for for businesses as well as trade and now that's going to impact a you know a lot of states economies I mean John some states you know California\nA twenty two percent of their GDP comes from trade with overseas partners I mean Michigan it's like thirty eight percent it's a it's a big numbers um so\nSome states themselves are are very you know are relying on on on trade Canada Mexico or are the biggest trading partners as well of course is China\nSo right now we're at a stage and trade where you know you know North American trade seems to be on a good track\nA there's been some agreement there still has to be signed by the president and um as well as the Mexican and Canadian a prime ministers and presidents are but China is the biggest you know and so uh you know a lot of the Federal Reserve regions are concerned\nOr either I I Will restore itself 'cause you know I watched trying to very carefully there will not be a quick resolution to that because\nBeijing is not prepared to change its business plan where it has become the number two economy on the planet\nBy pretending to be a developing nation and therefore it can subsidize it can steal it can cut corners they can ignore international agreements that's not going to resolve itself quickly until the leadership in Beijing resolves to join everybody else and play by transparency in rural so I go to\nWhat's wrong here in the United states right now\nAnd you mentioned it there's a shortage of workers Jean and I ... that has to be a continuing concern for small business\n[noise] yeah it does I mean I I wrote about this in the Philadelphia Inquirer um you know just a a week or so ago how employers not only in the northeast region but across the country continue um to to have a hard time when when when the unemployment rate comes out and shows a historically low rate lowest rates and show them the late Nineteen sixties\nUm you know the Trump Administration shears the economist year uh but uh you know my clients and small business owners around the country or not cheering\nWhen they see that because it is it it makes them it makes it very very hard to attract you know new employees to their companies they are fighting very hard against larger companies\nUm they're dealing with a companies like Amazon as well as Wal Mart target that are paying higher minimum wage is going what what a lot of small businesses\nCan't afford it is you know it's it's a good the good the bad we're seeing a your growth God I mean it's great that unemployment is low but a lot of small business owners are finding it very very difficult to find\nPeople I can tell you that you know some of the things that I'm hearing across the country as I speak to groups I meet a lot of business owners\nMany of them are reaching out to high schools technical schools community colleges nurturing relationships with students I'm really at a at a high school age inviting them to their companies offering internship speaking at the schools themselves\nThat has become a significantly more popular way for small companies to try and attract workers um into their businesses um and they've been forced to do this and be innovative with programs like this and some of them are really succeeding\nGene you know a deal about personal income tax than business taxes so therefore how do we all get to be Jared ... pushed her if there was a formula that you can lead on well ... shots for like\n... about a week or two ago the New York times had a front page report about how Jared Kushner had not paid any taxes in the past five or six years and [noise] you know it was kind of referring you know in ... do you know what kind of sketchy deals is he doing worries\nCheating the government out of taxes and that that's just not the case I mean whether or not you agree with with Jared Kushner is politics or not um she did not paying taxes because he took advantage of certain incentives and the tax on set up that have been around for a while that I think a lot of business owners need to understand as well Christians in the real estate property business\nHe buys buildings in rehab them renovate them and rents them out\nThere are some specific depreciation allowances that are allowed for businesses like him so he can take some upfront deductions um that that offset any income that might be coming in business owners themselves have the availability to take some significant deductions on capital equipment\nThat they buy from many case up to a million dollars a year John\nAnd if you're a business owner and you want to buy equipment like Jared 'cause you don't necessarily have to pay for it you can put a down payment you can finance the rest as long as you put that equipment or that property in the service\nAnd in December Motown holds the top spot with number one hits

American business report Bugs Bunny gala gala a leading marketing technology company powers millions of digital ...\nAround the world leading the wave of retail transformation visit scholar dot com today to modernize your\nDigital experience gene\nWrites for the Philadelphia Inquirer his small business column\nAs well as the guardian we go to optimism\nAnd post recession high and small business I liked this talk gene I liked the fact that businesses are happy small businesses especially but is this in the rearview mirror you've been traveling do you feed is routinely or are those worries we've evidence this evening a crowd again\nA combination of two John I'm capital one bank um they just came out with their latest small business growth index ah they do this twice a year and this index found that sixty seven percent of small business owners think that the business conditions in the area are good or excellent\nAnd that was up from sixty percent uh this time last year um they also found that a third of them plan to hire in the next six months which is up from\nTwenty five percent over a year ago so is it that's all good news\nUm but that that small business growth indexed also found that there is some current concerns that small businesses have things that we just talked about in in our last segment obviously finding people are but in addition to that you know the high cost of healthcare you made a big concern among business owners\nTaxes and their impact on on their business whether tax reform will have an impact on of course trade a could have an impact like we talked about before so the optimism is still there a business owners are are happy and looking forward to a good holiday season but there are some concerns that still weigh on their mind\nAnd here's a concern that I didn't know existed but Jean's column and the guardian points this out that we're looking at a nation of lawbreakers who don't mean to but you know intention\n... is not something you can plead in court you either break the law or not what it's about five and how is it making people I'm troubled well it's\nNot just bought a fire but it's it's any music streaming services and so you know\nYou might look because my sister she she runs out of the family doctor so she's a small business owner she runs a practice down in Philadelphia\nAnd she streams a spot if she's got music playing right over the speakers for her patients in the waiting room to here she's not alone right we go and coffee shops or restaurant boutique hotel and they're all yeah training the music right right turns out that all of them including my sister are breaking the law\nThe the license agreements for that streaming music as evidenced by a company called soundtrack your brand or who is a company that goes after things like this\nUm it said that eighty three percent of businesses small around the country and around the world or a listed Lee using these services Spotify apple music for public consumption you're not allowed to use it for public consumption that your own personal service\nYou oh these people are you a license fate and because nobody's paying these license fees it's costing the music industry more than two and a half billion ...\nIt's just like it looks like the the little sign on mattresses right I mean [laughter] penalty of ... do you have these writers write I write a which which was a threat in my youth but then I learned that we were all going to go to jail together so I relax\n[laughter] well I said a good luck to soundtrack your brand and good luck to the music industry try to find all those millions of small businesses are collecting royalties [laughter] I don't think that's going to happen any\nTime that you've alerted them to the possibility that the that the that the music police could be showing up at any night knocking on the door saying where they are and I'll write\nA entrepreneur as we celebrate them in our business in our world in a in America today you have the king of Prussia a new guys we have the Silicon Valley new guys there in Austin, Texas how is just that they make bad decisions given that they look so well to do\nWell there is a new study that came out as well that I wrote about on ink dot com and it's got a great Dane John it's called\nCurb your enthusiasm is the name of this study was done by researchers from the university a bath and Cardiff in\nLondon School of economics and you know and you know what I found it found that optimistic entrepreneur is earn less money they surveyed a bunch of entrepreneur is in the u._k. and other parts of the world and they found out that ...\nThat have a more optimistic outlook of the world are turned out that they made worse business decisions than entrepreneur is their business owners that were more pessimistic hat so it turns out that if you're a glass as half full person\nSometimes you can be blind date by what the right decision or not as opposed to being somebody a little bit more\nHow shall I say cynical and John I'm a I'm a CPA cynicism comes as part of my job and so I I feel I have nothing to worry about there but if you're that kind of a person you might want to temper it down a better at least surround yourself with somebody a little bit more realistic\nFinally we have a minute and a report from Philadelphia this isn't the Philadelphia Inquirer a very well informed about China and China and tariffs what do they want\nThey want to see the the Chinese published a punished excuse me in fact from a recent study by a company called on this by cell they study choose thousand entrepreneur is an overwhelmingly they supported President Trump's move against China\nSo you know the president has support of the small business community behind them and doesn't surprise me again I think I mentioned earlier businesses have been complaining about you know China's unfair trade practices and allegedly taking of technology and all\nThat ... they're pirates their part it's it's not it's not a debate here there are pirates but I what I welcome is that small business owners in Philadelphia a city you and I love right that there are the front line of foreign policy thinking good [laughter]\nThey're they get it there one with Capitol Hill in fact they were probably ahead of Capitol Hill at what took a while for the members of Congress to realize

surprised if they do try to do a active signal to the rover a few\nMore times beginning in January and that will be after this very very busy fall season when there's lots of planetary probes needing access to\nTeach space network communications that will catch one of the reasons that stopping now I mean you've got hired but you've got a a inside landing on Mars you've got a you've got coming up on the fly by a New Horizons are the kind of a belt object\nDawn Dawn a series dawn in Syria who know Juno Jupiter yes yes Juno\nJupiter you've got various Mars orbiters and so so this is and you know now they have a pro heading towards murky mercury and you also have to sell the puck approach so it's a very busy season and so that's one of the reasons they want to\nHold off I suspect they will try again come January\nJust have to keep our fingers crossed that somehow that solar panels get revealed one of the concerns is that uh the cold temperatures will ruin the\nBattery for good and because there's no dust in the atmosphere think about it's always warm on a cloudy night when the sky is clear nothing to hold the heat it and the Dusten was holding the heat and so it's gotten colder\nAnd so it could very well be that opportunity is finally left us where\nCommon for a opportunity okay just sit right there will get their soon ... to suit or walk right up and say that is ... it's All right we go to ... to uh this is the third row her so why why did they were\nWell here's the deal they originally going to land in late October and grab a sample um but the ... who\nDoes has no tiny dust ponds no soft mood sections nothing at all it's all over rubble pile of of boulders and rocks and that's a problem they hope to have a landing area that was enough that was at least\nSixteen meters across that's about what is that it's about two hundred feet [noise]\nUm but they didn't find anything that why what they found those something the best they been able to find something twenty meters across about fifty the forty feet\nAnd so they decided to do additional rehearsals or hold off until January the landing and so they've done now\nThey don't want our our solar earlier on and they this month they've done now to over our souls I have links to the pictures I posted the closest image and they don't have any scale so it's very hard to know that we do know\nThey were going to try to get within twenty meters of the surface about sixty feet so that's probably what this is so these are very tiny rocks hum how good that their aim was I don't know they haven't lived released a press release\nThey now have an a couple of months to relax because\nI'm the son is moving in between a ... and the earth and so therefore communications is not easy they won't lose communications but because of that they they got to hold off on these more complicated knew this would just have to wait and see what will happen in January\nWhat is Parker [noise] they ... if you remember was launched a few a month or two ago\nUm to do a series of increasingly close fly buys of the sun to tell us something about the atmosphere of the sun and the corona and did a flyby of ah Venus in October early October\nAnd what was the key here is that this week it turns itself around and took a look back and took a picture of the earth ...\n... posted up behind the black it's not a particularly spectacular\nImages an unusual picture of the earth the moon Bob I'd have to say I wouldn't immediately recognized starts out\nNo you wouldn't basically looking as low resolution close up of of the earth the moon picking behind so it's just a bunch of pixels that's slightly oblong because of the moon's presence what's important about this image isn't the image itself but one could point that the instrument precisely\nTo look at the earth and it demonstrated to that the instruments wide field camera is working properly\nAnd that's really what it was done forged instrumental operational test to make sure everything's good and that's what's good about this and so what are the wedding towards the sun and it's not going to burn off\nAnd Bob the Parker probe is a new information we're gathering up are backing up we have a couple of sun probe is up there now so different different this is a\nBig star remember it might be an ordinary style but it is a big and so we there's a lot of things we just do not know and we've never been this close when it would no previous probe ever went this close to the sun so we're going to be diving into areas we've never seen\nYou know at the same time it's going to be looking at other data to come from other theories you know it's always the same there's some things you can from something should learning new the big thing is it's getting close to the side and that's what's important\nSaturn has a ... named ... and ... and not a rock star suddenly they're stripes on the on I didn't know to look Bob but I clearly from this report you're pointing to these are mysterious tribes why\nYes um what they what scientists have done as they look back at the archival that are of Cassini which is unfortunately no longer around Saturn\nAnd ... and the image of the talk of the ... and they would they then defied was 'em long narrow stripes scattered across the surface that generally tend to a hundred kilometers in line for so that's approximately thirty to three hundred miles long\nThey tend to be very narrow two to three miles and the brightest in trust surrounding terrain that parallel to each other and they ... features and straight are not affected by top hog if we think of a road that goes straight along the county line goes up and down and around because it doesn't turn just doesn't\nMake noise that's part of the same thing with these the suggestion they also parallel to the equator\nThe suggestion is that there's some kind of they were laid down from um external dust on materials that came in from off the planet and this is not unusual in a violent of Saturn um you've got the Saturn's rings and a lot of material being transferred between point dazed point base\nAnd so that's Paulie they think what's going on here but they do not know\nUm there is a great quote from them the quote the material could have implications for the biological potential of the sub surface ocean\nTo be honest I'm not sure how they connect but that's what they said and\nThey wait wait wait do that again biological interpretation\nI yeah I don't know why they say this but you know they're always trying to sell their projects and anytime they can talk about life\nOn it I Know I was thinking that this was crop riding in some fashion you know the way the way the aliens take an oath wheat fields and signal to us\nYeah I don't think that's the case it's more likely if you remember on behind the black if you do a search on behind the black you'll come up with the great images Saturn some of Saturn's tiny moons near the or inside the rings and they tend to\nBe have these gigantic riches at the equator because they they gathered dust from the rings at the equator\nI'm so they almost ... and saucers and well he could be these a parallel to the equator and they'll lined up with them or it could be that this is just dust being picked up from ... how it has any implications biological but nonetheless they make that point and so let's give them more\nMoney our friend Alan Stern has another great idea this is the man who are devoted ... more than half of it live two New Horizons which is now in the ... after the fly by Pluto what's the latest about\nWhat they did is him in a few other scientists and engineers did some research to see how could they go back to Pluto and the most effective manner that they they had been in this there's a debate you know we want to go to Pluto again it off the planet the the whole plan and we've only seen half but they also want to get a ... a pro about the type of delta do research there and what\nThey did is they said if they use to a a an eye on type propulsion system that white was used on dawn which allowed to visit more than what asteroid they could launch a probe to object Pluto and then using share on as a flyby technique\nOr leaves all that at some point and then use the the iron propulsion to travel throughout the type of belts in other words they get to bangs for one book and this is the proposed they said this makes sense and this allows them to get everything in one mission and so this is\nProbably going to be opposed to NASA or others and they're going to try to make this mission happened and I think that's really really exciting jobs\nZimmerman he keeps the website behind the black when we come back engineering I'm John bachelor this is the John bachelor show

worker's party because not only the collapse of the economy on their watch\nBut also that gross corruption I mean it was dumb believable the way that they just a ... abuse their power to enrich\nThemselves the business elite and um and the party and you know all the while that people are learning about this there also\nAre hurting economically they had nearly three years of recession then they had\nA very slow growth in this year and next year is not for cats do much better so they're looking for other idea and both ... while he's not a market liberal he's basically I Would say the added\nAntidote to um to socialism and we can talk about that a little bit more because I think that it's not entirely clear what his\nWhat his solutions they're going to be but I think that people just\nStarted saying anybody but the socialists and that's how he got where yet\nYou've taught me over the years that Brazil's a hybrid mixture of socialism at one scale kind of redistribution and back scratching and also\nA day just to economic forces enterprises that are vast and take\nAnd ... capital and don't permit on from porno worship or experimentation is both an arrow both in are all going to answer that these big ... like Petro bras and ... and then the peasants who are who are who are bought off with a broad\n[noise] well that's the sixty four million dollar question and then of course you know he hasn't won yet or people I talked to give him between a Seventy and eighty percent chance the prevailing on Sunday [noise] but um uh even if he does win\nAll it's not clear his he's been in Congress for twenty seven years is voting record is bad for the state you know I mean\nThis is because we talk about right and left and I think sometimes the language gets very confused but you know he's not a free market guy up according to his is history a that being said\nHe has a University of Chicago PHD economists who is who is chief um advisor and consulted on and he is also made certain commitments for example he says that the central back must be independent\nAnd of course the central bank last independence during the ... the government\nAnd that was a big reason why they got into so much trouble and they got back to double digit inflation and so forth so\nHe's made some commitments that I think are very encouraging he's also said that he will privatize\nAnd you have to remember that under Lula um and ... the state with getting back into all kinds of economic activity\nSo both so now he says he will will reverse those decisions he'll get rid of those state owned enterprises that I think there might be somewhere around fifty of those um but he also has stopped short of saying for example that he's going to privatize cut your boss he says he wants to keep in state and what he called\nStrategic companies and that's of course a disappointment to those of us who believe in the market um but I think a lot of people are just hoping that uh that um you know in terms of orders of magnitude he'll get closer to market economics then obviously than the P. T. is\nEven if he doesn't you know do the full Monty\nSecurity uh I Do I have never traveled to Brazil but I read anecdotes just say that the streets of large cities can be dangerous because of abduction dangerous for the well to do does both an arrow speak to that is is what he says credible\nWell first of all I Would say that most of the danger we talk about danger I think like with respect to homicides most of that of hers in poor neighborhoods and the\nThe major victims of the high a homicide rates are um the poor\nI mean they're the ones who are killed in these bad neighborhoods and that is why I'm despite the fact that he's been accused of being a racist and so forth um he does have some support not huge um but he has some support or some significant for it I Would say\nFrom on people in those neighborhoods\nTo the disruption of a money making operations is silver mine and ... them all the other cat defend itself or is in the hands of people who don't want it to defend itself how to say\nWell I I think that\nYou know what we have to bear in mind when we see this caravan and I I Am a believer that it is politically organized an onslaught designed to wake habit\nTo create disorder to ... to create a problem for Donald Trump ahead of the election I totally believe in all of those things that being said you have an enormous amount of number of young as you say young male but young people in Central America who don't have jobs\nUm who who just have you know almost absolute despair in terms of their future of course they want to go to the United states but not by the way the way some native is field because they want to come here and um you know live off the off the welfare state\nThey want jobs and they see the United states is a place where they would have opportunity so you know if you start organizing and you tell people okay we're going to use\nUm strength and numbers to get into the United states you're going to get a lot of people to join you I'm having said that I think it's really important to understand\nWhat is it an economy that these countries that it's making a these young people so desperate and that's why I wrote that column about the silver mining Guatemala because that's silver mine was implying well over a thousand people and all of a sudden you got the um you know NGOs coming along and say well\nYou know the challenging the right of the silver mind to operate because\nSupposedly um they didn't\nUp properly consult with a indigenous group in the area before they began operating silver mine and you know you dig down you find out first of all that that the senses of the most recent census when the wind was started found that there were to do\nThat to GW oh indigenous people in the whole area where the silver mine was operate\nThis is the ... is that how you say it ... the I guess it's\nA shame to and you know I'm not I'm not a you know doubting that\nThe shank have rights but on ... you know the inside the the property there was not the impact on the ... community that there is that the mine is charged with being sort of you know sensitive too and uh once they proved that the court\nSaid well okay that may be true and we acknowledge that there were only two there but um\nWe think that the government should go back and interview and look into it more and you know they've been dragging their heels on the line has been closed for well over a year and a note into a year and a half I think\nAnd all these people who were working for the mind and by the way the mind with not accused of any environmental degradation it wasn't a cute that any labor violations it had spent millions of dollars in the area on education and community um\nEnhanced meant for the people who lived in the area and now the sudden the mines shut down all these people don't have a job and um\nAnd and by the way the mind also\nThe court had the option of saying that the mind could continue to operate a while the government went and did the consultations with the indigenous population and the court had done that in other cases but in this case decided not to um\nI think that there's a lot of questions about how those judges made their decisions um but regardless of that the bottom line is that here you have the Guatemalan a Guatemalan governmental institution\nUm you know deliberately shutting down a source of employment and wealth creation for a large number of people in a very core part of the country\nAnd this was in an isolated event this happens over and over again in the country\nAnd um I think it's one thing that we need to keep in mind when you see all the people that of course our hearts go out to them we say you know that they need jobs and and they're moving through Mexico now because they're desperate but you know what you're nice country due to make the where they are where these people live\nUm you know more attractive for them to stay\nAnd there's plenty they can do but they have to have the political will to do it as I said this is not\nUm this this movement of people through through Central America and Mexico is not accidental these people are marching in lock step they're organized\nI'm not saying that the migrants themselves are necessarily political but it's a political movement\nThat is is basically on as I as we said in our editorial earlier this week it's very similar to when she del Castro unleashed all of the migrants from the port of bar Allen Nineteen eighty extremely just said that destabilizing\nOn and difficult for the country that is out to accept them and um so I think that the Trump Administration is right to be a challenging um uh the the organizers of the larger than to be talented people that they this is not the way that we accept in Nebraska\nAre you mentioned Cuba's so for the final minutes here you have a column about Cuba's conduct and you identify it as a as a master of Venezuela what we're seeing the catastrophe event in Venezuela must be looked at\nAs what Havana once is this what does this help Cuba to have the people of Havana are the people of Caracas without food and resources\nWell that doesn't care if the people of that well I don't have food resources Atlanta wants to control Venezuela and um if that means that as well as to empty out and there's not going to be any when they're at the very small population of added a care about that but then I had done that to the island itself or sixty\nYears Joe this is a um a matter of geo political strategy on the part of the van and and yeah I mean I think that uh it's quite obvious that the Venezuelans would not be capable of the kind of in ... intelligence control\nOn control over passports or the electronic voting systems they ID cards\nOn the spy on people that has you know it hasn't chemical everywhere and that's a that's a very Cuban I'm a a strategy and tactics\nOn that ... has been using at home for for many many years\nSo I mean the reason I wrote that column is because people keep saying what can we do to help the Venice well and you know because of that they're they're they're quite um\nYou know they're they're suffering a lot right now and I think that it's just wrong to think that you can solve this problem and crap is this problem that has to be solved the Nevada and this is the problem that was\nBad aged in a bed it by Brock Obama\nWho basically supported um the dictate the military dictatorship of the doubt Castro gay that oxygen gave it food gave it support when it was breaking down and that gave\nIt to you about the life plan it needed to keep going and to reach out and to expand it was already working on this expansionist a project in bed at swell up but\nThat very much helped on the Cuban um military dictatorship continue and I'm so somebody has to do and I'm assuming it would be the Trump Administration or the next us administration but\nAt some point there you know that the democracy that the region have to get together and and tell her that I Know my you know and that hasn't happened then and and the ... the result of that is is what you're saying that as well right now\nVery Anastasia

didn't declare war on turkey but he was a on scene and so uh and he talked to everybody there and he um\nLearn everything and so he was able to\nUm to Washington or his point of view and his point of view on more or less dominated in Washington is what was going on there he was very knowledgeable and he uh\nUh his destroyers went throughout the black sea jihad and so on and so he was very
