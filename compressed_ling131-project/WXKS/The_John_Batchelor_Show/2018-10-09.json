Gordon\nThis move by ... to leave town going and fly to Beijing\nIt looks like it was unscripted it looks like both sides are being rough on each other did we anticipate this did we see this coming Gordon good evening to\nGood evening John ah I didn't see it coming um I think it was very welcome though the secretary Pompeo was candid and Frank when he got the ...\nIf you look at the words that were issued by the state department as pump pale left for the Chinese capital they were the usual sort of we need to have constructive engagement you know we need to have results oriented diplomacy it was all sort of very um benign\nBut when he got the beach and he said two words which are really critical and he said that we have quote unquote fundamental disagreements with China and that's absolutely right and this was important for compare to say because he's showing the Chinese but we're not afraid of friction in the relationship\nWe haven't been that way for about four decades so it's very important for them to see there's been a pivot in the American mentality towards China\nThat we are willing to assert our rights and the rights of the international community and then we're just not afraid of Beijing anymore really really good move on the part of the secretary of state\nMr Wang began his meeting with Mr pump pale by accusing the U.S of escalating trade friction causing trouble over Taiwan unjustifiably criticizing China's domestic and external policies Gordon this is not about trade isn't this I mean they're not limiting themselves to terrorists here\nYou know they certainly not and and the Chinese are pointing out that across the board the United states has new policies for four decades in the American administrations Republicans and Democrats liberals and conservatives have actually put the success of China's Communist party as a goal of American foreign policy\nWell Trump is first of all a ticking policies that are under cutting China and he's ignoring China and other policies and the Chinese have got to be extremely concerned because right now the U.S is taking a position which could lead to really severe consequences in the Chinese state\nTried friction we understand check their the two systems do not work together China practices piracy the U. S. practices WTO but causing trouble over Taiwan that's a new one to make Gordon has there been something new they've been complaining for years is their twist and that story\nWell I think the twist is that a first of all when president firing when of Taiwan um went to South America she made to very high profile transit stopped in the United states the Chinese were happy about that they're not happy about legislation that worked its way through Congress and Taiwan\nAnd they're concerned about another set of arms sales so you know\nIs a one nother level of disagreements between the United states and China and it's good that we're defending Taiwan because at some point we have got to make it clear to Beijing that they cannot alter the status quo across the street by the use of force\nAnd seizure paying has been effectively threatening the use of force for quite some time now we've been lured him now we are starting to take the position that yes his threats do matter and they need to be countered\nUnjustifiably criticizing China's domestic an external policies garden I think that means that we're suspicious when the head of inner Paul returns to China and disappears and resigns I think that me and that's what China's sensitive about what's happened to the head of ...\nUm before I answer that John I think that the Chinese were specifically referring to America and criticisms of the detention of about a million ... John\nI'm In camps which resemble those um that we've seen in a prior a totalitarian states um these are concentration camps John these are crimes against humanity um essentially what they're trying to do is to liquidate an ethnic group\nAnd they're doing it in ways that have resulted in the torture and death of leakers this is something that the international community cannot ignore but going to the head of Interpol which is absolutely fascinating\nYou know we've learned that among home way hum who was the head of Interpol since two thousand sixteen um went back to China in September he was disappeared I'm now Interpol has received a message that he's resigned there's been a notice from China that he is being investigated for a serious preaches\nHis wife is complaining she's not in China and she's complaining that she's not heard from him so clearly this was an ambush it wasn't planned\nAbsolutely wasn't planned and it shows that number of things John one of them is that um the disagreements at the top of the Communist Party have become so severe that they've basically broken out into open warfare\nI the reason why I get to that is that China really wanted to have the head of Interpol to be a Chinese national the Communist Party official and they were successful in that\nThey come into my garage and we have a conversation about all the big stuff in life\nGo check it out WTO with mark Marron right here on my heart radio\nThe original real life comments section\nAlways having to deal with some kind of ridiculous drum liberalism Boston's home board\nTalk bachelor show hunter [noise]\n\n\nI'm John bachelor Thaddeus McCotter joined us from Detroit Gordon Chang's here from the east coast and we go to Frazer ...\nSingapore author of red capitalism\nA gentleman I'll take the first question with Fraser and then we all a phrase or a garden I've been discussing the missing in action press the Chinese Communist party member president of Interpol discussing the fact that the Chinese authorities have turned out a long time successful Financial Times editor from Hong Kong discussing\nThe freedom of navigation chicken a game of chicken with us that's Decatur last week and also puzzling about Wang Yi speaking in Tempe partly to Mike pump pale in the capital these last hours that something happened that you can see from Singapore that we can see here has\n... has as Xi Jinping ceded control of the\nFace of China conquering the world because they're acting right now a unpredictably good evening good morning to you\nThat ... Martin are using the gentleman and I don't know in some ways that I think any ... ... ... ... ... if you understand the nature of the Communist Party and if you understand China but of course from the site it really is quite shocking and the case then tripled cheap\nYou simply could not make that up if you if you had a fictional story but the head of Interpol was abducted affects disappeared by the government for corruption but his government push to put in there just two years ago no one would have believed you\nUm the the visa case in Hong Kong and of course is Betty wedding in terms of Hong Kong freedom we know that aggressive positions are you trying to see there's China is under a lot of pressure at the moment\nAnd many of these things have come at the same time clearly pressure from the Trump Administration has caused part of that\nYou have economic problems on shore that some degree of political infighting I don't think she did things going to be any time soon but the Chinese are clearly straight and\nThey had at the airwaves but a long time and they're not getting it that way anymore and the fact that\nWind ... Mike Pompeo is basically telling you the Chinese are just really upset and ... and they don't know really hate to this bond and changed our model garden\nFraser um the the Chinese ... seems to have lost the cue cards um\nYou you talked about many things just now I'm One of them was the economy where is the economy at this particular time you had the big reserve rate reduction ratio reduction pumping a lot of money into the Chinese economy more than a hundred billion US dollars um\nIs that a sign that the economy is slowing or is this just a precaution\nOh I think again why isn't anyone think the economy's not slowing\nEconomy has been on for quite a period of time you can clearly see a lot of stress and it's not always be although the stock market or rape id yesterday NATO was being shown in the listed companies and art bondi also whatever often a lot of private companies that are real distress\nYou see signs of distress and the property market it does not mean that we're not going to fall off a cliff thought there's going to be leaving moment per se but there's clearly a lot of stress and the economy we have had to build up a credit card to tighten diner not realizing that problem\nBut they've become so addicted to credit over the past decade or so that it it gives some very little room to maneuver and this is just another one of those pressures in that caught me and of course you saw the Bloomberg story last week about the big ... going right at heart all that stuff and take the Chinese manufacturing\nAnd you know everything basically that is simply no a bit of good news coming out of China\nThat is a phrase or do we anticipate this unpredictability ceasing anytime soon or is this just something kind of open ended\n[noise] um I live there's going to a bit like the stock market that feed the volatility at ... am I mean again I think what the Chinese are struggling to find is a model itself I knew model and it's not even clear to me that even trying to look for one they have been still use of how to engage with the way we can get\nUS President understanding the soft low and gauge meant policy is trying to Iran rings riding to others um and now when they're faced with problems you know they're fighting back and and and the way to do and the case of Hong Kong but it's fun to beef up\nYou know this Hong Kong independence and I'm against Hong Kong independence I though the vast majority of Hong Kong or there's only a small number of people talking but I think it's highly unrealistic but the very mention of work\nYet at the Beijing rattled Juanita by separatists parts of the truck\nTalk like that and so you have this completely in temperate behavior complete over reaction as you solve with if you could be the case\nUm ... this is remember when it comes to the Communist Party loyalty and belief that belief in the park is all that matters so almost regardless if I were to let things appear as long as the people are supporting the sensor supporting Xi Jinping supporting the party a lot of what seemingly the rational behavior Cancun and your\nFriends your garden tells me that they're putting more money into the economy does some hundred billion or more that's the way they responded to recessions once upon a time is there a recession\nI it's always difficult to really know that the technical definition of protections in place in China but that is as I say that it's straight they know that the way they are under stress it all back at that method the\nPumping money into the economy what's\nInteresting as well as earlier this year with the talk of by a rushed infrastructure projects that to to boost growth and tax cuts to help ... um and so they're going I Love this thoughts and there is no longer talk of\nThe labor teaching in the economy even though the accent that it's a tremendous amount of credit that basically the bargaining that caught him but they have the state that legitimacy on that caught any continuing to go and keeping the whole show in the early so I ... at any of that built to change course night when you're under ...\nGarden Fraser you're quoted in the F T a day ago um that the\nPrivate sector and China just exist really at the tolerance of the state sector that see Japan has been using this trade friction with the United states really almost as an excuse to titan and to increase the role of the state sector you talk a little bit about what's happening and private versus states business at the moment we have about a minute fraction\nSure ragged and look I think one of the key things to understand about China is a ... but he is it would appear that it's become over the past ... years or so everything that the discretion of the state and that you have a leader now who is much more focused on a strong central state\nI'm very much a strong are under the leadership of the party and that's going to be true in private businesses as well be obscene private businesses you know kind of money off over the capital control\nIt partly I caught dining on that and it partly basic thing look all resources should be Marshall ... the central state and under the direction of the party\nAnd not let that does not mean everything's going to be nationalized but everybody's had the ... at least sharks and private enterprises are realizing look I've got to fall it line by that that could be helping out with private public partnership type of project\nOr anything like that is that it ... the private sector was never an independent from the state was operating at the ...\nOf

especially in the panhandle\n[noise] well the law of unintended consequences or the Democrats I think at a\nPretty sound strategy which was the either get to block Brett Kavanaugh from the Supreme Court and see if they can win control of the Senate and um basically\nDeclare the seat vacant for the next two years after that or the rev up their troops through righteous anger or to Republicans so it seemed like a no win situation for them it's now much more mixed as David mentioned [noise]\nUm I have observed mid term elections now for a long time and what of observed is if the campaign of the last month and she's on issues as opposed to personalities or scandal or something exhaustion is\nA Republican send you to better the issues and with Brett Kavanaugh's victory they have the rule of law they have a Supreme Court ah they have the behavior of the Democrats to run against\nAnd I think even though district by district it may not affect Republicans' chances I think in general it is given the Republicans\nThat will fire up their base that weren't there before before they had to talk about tax cuts and all the stuff that oh well you've done for us already what are you done for us lately so I think the Republicans are revved up and we have a real campaign on our hands\nThat is you have questions ... yes gentleman of the media learned any lessons from the Kavanaugh confirmation battle David you are no [laughter]\nLook I mean I'm I I think there was a good reporting during the cabin a fair and I think there was a bad reporting it I don't think the media is going to be any different than it's ever been uh some of us know what we're doing some of us don't readers and viewers will make up there\nMinds I I mean look I I think the focus on the media is\nA little bit overblown I understand what frustrates a lot of people but you know believe it or not it frustrates a lot of people on the left to just for different reasons\nSo they're going to hate us and that's that's just the way it goes meaning left and right I I just try and do my job\nIs to find I think the Kavanaugh controversy represented the clearest possible indication that we're moving to a British style of journalism or journalist take sides\nWhere some outlets are clearly leaning in one direction and others are leaving and the other direction and I think that was made explicit you read reporters who even though they may have had a semblance of objectivity and they're reporting were declaring their partisan feelings on Twitter\nEven more blatantly so because it was such a fast moving story so I figured it was a clarifying moment for many viewers and readers in this country that all of the things they have suspected I end up almost half the country and the latest he'll newspaper poll says the coverage was tilted against Kavanaugh was unfair\nUh it just accelerated all the trends about media skepticism received these lo these many years\nDavid you're reporting from Tennessee included a day I have a Tennessee\nA resident who is working for the Democratic candidate for Senate and is not happy with President Trump was and I wanted you to comment on that because it seemed a Americans their individual if he can't generalize what did you learn from our debt\nSo fascinating um she's a volunteer for the bread is in campaign and that's how I met her she is a registered Republican\nAnd that always voted Republican until twenty sixteen and she is somebody that\nHas not a given up for views um even though she's given up supporting a Republican president\nShe still fiscally conservative socially libertarian a one out of a way to tell me she leaves and the second amendment even though she be okay with it you know what I Would label it too many style at least a compromise legislation on guns they they are and this even though in the district she is in in suburban Memphis\nShe will not make a difference because Tennessee is just one of those red state that you're not going to see the blue wave blow through even if there is a blue wave\nShe is a the quintessential married suburban Republican woman who doesn't like Trump and because she doesn't like Trump is voting for Democrats to send a message and when I asked her about her views because I wanted to establish\nA Republican bona feed but also to get to the heart of what her she was and she told me it\nComes down to the president's behavior and his ... and the way she believes he treats people and she said you if you can't do ... be a decent person and lead in that fashion\nThat ... that's enough for me to excommunicated and she told me she probably would have voted for Bob Corker reelection she doesn't see why not but just simply because Marsha Blackburn is a Trump supporter and because of the way she feels about Trump's she is voting brothers and it's there are women like this all over the country in districts that matter\nAnd if Democrats win control of the house on November sick it's going to be because of women like her\nA job in the puzzle for me about the Democratic approach to Capitol was that it change the subject for Trump did they do that on purpose did they think that Kavanaugh could be Trump how did they how did they get to a place where they stopped talking about what was helping them which was the president's tweets\nBecause the Supreme Court was so important to them and they are at such pressure from their\nBase they had to act and do everything they could stop Kavanaugh\nSo they thought and they threw everything into it uh I agree that many voters are in the position that David found this woman or the other hand the last few days I've talked to voters who say\nWell you know I still don't like Trump but at least he stood up to the bullies are no other president whether it's the name was Romney or Bush would have stood up to the ... bullies they would have pulled Kavanaugh there would be a big until the Supreme Court today so\nWell Trump is disliked by these people there's also a sticking admiration that by his methods and by his stubbornness and by his stern is he got something done that they want it done which is a seat of the Supreme Court and they're not going to vote whereas before they were going to sit home\nThat if you're in a blue state with a dominant by Democrats in this cycle was there any change in the attitude towards the Trump during the Kavanaugh hearing that you could discern\nWhen you could see a certainly with the Republicans they may were very very engaged in this very upset\nAnd I think one of the things you're also see amongst the electorate especially in the ... as you get towards the center is a lot of the tactics that were employed by the Democrat democratic base or a mirror rabid partisans are we're not perceived as well\nAnd they were perceived as forces of Robert Kennedy recalled disorder and lawlessness and those do not play well for the Democrats here with the vast majority of the center here in the state now whether we'll hold off me a blue wave I don't know Michigan I think it'd be purple at best\nThis election but people are very concerned about the way that the left their grass roots quote unquote have gone about trying to express their quote unquote rage and resistance\nI'm speaking with my professional Thaddeus McCotter David ...

I'm\nA way that we're factories and other things the day or worked in the same factory\nUm ... you know was simple it's one of up several such places in fact more than people realize you know this is an unsung place people do newspapers don't write about the harmony and initiatives that have been taken where people living together and working together\nSaturdays Malcolm is Beppe precisely why it could have been targeted because there was comedy they're there because it was successful and because it was breaking down such barriers and stereotypes are way I could have been targeted\nThat it could it we're not ... it's not clear whether this is work related or what the motivation for this guy but it's the incitement it to the ongoing excitement and that that is fed into to the Palestine community that leads to these kinds of actions we can't say yet attended typically what\nWas but certainly um you know something that a ...\nCompounds to tragedy and a regretful in this but should be a message and yet we see a bus continuing the today again are all sorts of a horrific threats and and the negative comments both directed at the Palestinians in Gaza\nWhere he ordered them to cut off the flow of the fuel and threatening\nThe book the Israel from Israel that was going to deliver it for the next ... threatening to people who were going to work on it\nAnd at the same time we see them continuing to incite the rioting\nAnd the and know condemnation of it no condemnation when innocent are are killed Israelis were killed including um just to fold recently uh so it it it creates an atmosphere where these kind of ... even if this particular one may have had some additional motivation\nIs outrage the foreign minister of Iran meeting was lab or off the foreign minister Russia ... was working to in some fashion defeat or work around the sanctions his Russia working with the EU Malcolm or these separate enterprises\nIt's separate enterprises but you're right on both counts on the first one lap Robbins every for meeting about\nUh oil and you know that Iran is accused Russia and ... and collaborating with Saudi Arabia to lower the price of oil and yet there there's no evidence been proven given for any of these accusations\nAnd yet ... are meeting to to talk about a a energy and at the same time not only report last week to remember that Volvo and the German banks and build major publication called for\n[noise] um them to to pull out to for for they're not to beef or a ways to avoid the sanctions we see the oil industry really mobilizing to town which was amongst the first to pull out or the first\nIs the French oil company said they wouldn't join us efforts to bypass the sanctions they said they can't afford to be banned from the U.S financial system any the the Italy's major and a\nConglomerate oil conglomerate said we have no presence anymore in Iran and were whatever contracts expire in November\nA subset of the same that refinery in Spain said they're getting one shipment and that's it in in a I think in November and then and we see the overall numbers dropping to Europe from eight hundred and forty three to four hundred and twenty two thousand barrels\nAnd I think it's um and and the top executives said\nThat they didn't see anybody willing to trade Iranian crude\nSo the efforts to bypass it we see that the Iranians are lashing out in many ways they're going today the case against the United states sanctions and seizing property or was opened at the international court of justice the Hague by Iran against us us I think is\nNot at all I'm a concerned about it but the counter message and measures and the U.S finding again today that Iran has the leading state sponsor of terrorism and counterterrorism strategy\nPuts the focus on Iran and its proxies Hamas and ...\nA John Bolton spoke about it today and very strong a direct terms in and said that I'm a radical Islamist terrorists groups are the preeminent transnational terrorist threat to the U.S\nAnd so the new threat at a new strategy to us includes pursuing extremist to their hopes of cutting off the source of support I e some would say Iran\nSaturdays we also sees me you was also in many ways tried to incite Israel isn't it [noise]\nThey ... you ... is is simply outrageous and given their failure to condemn you know we have this situation in in the south\nPotter W. J. are the ... the great lakes and we welcome Indiana home line many weeks away back however three quick items before we get to Indiana's exploring\nAncient treasure is a one on Azerbaijan won on Morocco and one on these ... these are all three extremely positive stories Malcolm\nIt's good to be able to report them first on as ... as a story about the how attribution is really a model of moderation and of tolerance and especially given the neighborhood would you visited and I'm not knowing the contribution that ... makes to stability in the region and\nWhile people criticize it and there's always a legitimate criticism against anybody that fact has its record is remarkable it has reached out to Israel they are working together and economic and security in other areas\nAnd other Arab countries are now turning to them to say how do you do that how do you how can you balance it because many of them want to follow the model\nAnd I think when we talk about models king Mohammed the six foot Morocco has once again demonstrated again a moderate leader showing Islam and its best face um has announced\nAn order that he had ordered the education minister said I'm a I'm Suzie to incorporate Holocaust studies into the country's high school curriculum and this is reported in the press at ... we've talked about this uh we've seen the curriculum and he said education has the power to fight against discrimination is racism\nAs well as the ugly phenomena of anti Semitism this is the king of Morocco and Arab country was repeatedly set this high standard one that is reflected in ... as well where in twenty six hundred years of Jewish existence in the country that was never anti Semitism in the last example\nIs not your more out who just won the Nobel Prize for uh she was a captive taken by Islamic state and sold and slavery in this horrific story we hosted are here in New York she was held on amounts in ... remember in the region of northwest Iraq and\nTerrible things happen to so many so many disappeared and we're so but she visited Israel in ... twenty Seventeen and she said like the Jews the cities have an ancient history\nAt thousands of years old and despite recurring persecution both people have survived she said my time in Israel showed me that in the wake of oppression and genocide of community can emerge stronger and she is really\nA model what Nobel Peace prize unlike some others who have received it and I'm quoting Yasser Arafat\nAs it by Sean Morocco and they use ETs of Iraq who are now the UCs are many countries after the crimes of the Islamic state now we turn now Malcolm puts down is a very proper clothes and puts on his hat puts the bowl with down any reaches into his pouch Thaddeus\nYeah when you talk about winning a Nobel Prize you'd like to tell us do if something can you can you tell us about the world's oldest breweries in that way [laughter]\n[laughter] uh well this is the site of and I'm going to be reviewing and the next\nCouple of weeks when God when we'll be back on a regular schedule some really exciting things that have been found but this is in the ... north of hyper which I'm John visited in which is northern Israel it's served as a burial site for them to to the people and they found there the world's oldest brewery and\nIt seems that they were able to ferment I'm a different kinds of grain and perhaps used in a burial ceremony it seems that this I'm a site was a one way where the burials took place they found a platform of flowering plants\nAnd they produce a soup like liquid an alcoholic drink and\nDifferent than what we know is today's beer but brewing beer with Stuart only to go back five thousand years but this may turn the history of his head so in a lot of bars now you can have a dispute about how old the um\n[noise] the preventing of beer or was they found these three small picture mortars to were used for storage one for pounding the Bering grains and before the fermentation and the the site I'm sure will become a great a visiting site perhaps a great\nPlace where is it again Malcolm review what the geography\nIt's it was in a cave ... south of hype up which is ...\nIsrael's north it's the largest city drop it alive Israel's ah ah north and as so maybe a wasn't\nThere at city there now come it\nIt it was it that to paint settlement it was I'm a ... that they believe the people there than the two feeds buried the some of their dead in these in these caves\nAnd that the um the discovery indicates report raises questions about uh about them they they ... between the paleo lipstick and the Olympic periods\nAnd and give that gives us insight into what they were eating and discovery of traces of wheat barley based alcohol in this case\nSo it's really very interesting I think it's still a lot more to be found there but I'm a lot of people can be hosting it all\nRight a preview Indiana of the upcoming weeks\nWell tomorrow there's going to be a very special announcement and it's a one by the Israel Museum in Israel antiquities authority of\nOf an inscription I have not yet seen it's been kept under real wraps\n'em and they're going to announce it tomorrow so next week's report we will have an update on it\nAnd also review of some of the amazing discoveries including um the bullet the seals with the names of both ... and the profit or share Yahoo ...\nAnd the letters while some of them are not clear by piecing it together they believe that this could have been made and made seeing a connection\nAnd uh the reason we're previewing Indiana's because the overpass try so we just have a couple of minutes here can you go over your tribes India\nWell one of them of course if we remember this that the loss theater which is I went back to to visit um which was discovered under the western wall underneath Wilson ...\nI remember I remember yes\nVisible structure remaining from the Temple Mount compound of the second temple period and they uncovered this three hundred two hundred seat amphitheater from the Roman period and a eight large or ancient stone courses built of of enormous stones\nAnd this is as I said the last ... charges that once constructed a big bridge that led to the Temple Mount that they would cross over to go into the temple itself and it stands above the foundation of the western wall a and this\nThese discoveries are open up a whole new era underneath that we don't know yet what outs ah um\nWe were going to find but they considered that one of the remarkable discoveries um\n... you know it small compared to the big Roman theaters that that have been found but ... meeting Kerry could well have been a place where Rome and leaders got together with they held discussions of city council or something of that kind\nFatty who have thirty seconds to have a question for India now I have no question other than you know how quickly you changed during this segment from your street clothes into your Indiana class Saturday was clobbered at ten times nothing\nOn you there's a telephone booths here\nBut they they do you remember the story about the toads John and that is so I didn't even get to to remind everybody about the four thousand year old to\nEnjoy some where they found the ... the as part of some sort of a burial ritual uh in the uh that was um ah found in the tomb itself along with the other uh items that that ah\nWhy why did they find ... Indiana where they find a toads remembered that I have yet to be added frogs they headed fraud yes we knew that we have in what struck deeply with you right we had to solve the added frogs it's true it's an unusual mentality I was the highlight Indiana\nAnd she had a whole lot of the ... brewery in the day decapitated frogs that is McCotter W.

Marshall use the term ... of the indigenous people so that that wouldn't happen\nA but it hasn't been that at all the it is truly been that of a war to its guardian the relationship has been that a meaning that\nNow the indigenous people by and large are considered to be not competing in the same way that we might say but teenagers incompetent and therefore might have a guardian for a teenager or a person with some mental disability so it might have a guardian to prepare to\nAdvantage of that person now the federal government acts as the guardian to these wards and we literally and the legislation passed much later Eighteen Seventy seven legislation\nOr called them a incompetent until we deemed them competition imagined today if I said African Americans or wards of the state because they're incompetent I mean that would just be that would be ... she couldn't imagine saying those words and yet that's the way we\nTo this day a treat American Indians\nSo we're stuck with early Eighteen century land a language which of course was inherited from the early ... or early Nineteen century language when heritage from the early Eighteen century language\nWhen the quake or the Quakers now I'm not talking about gun and we're talking about Quakers when the quake her colony saw that there was profit in the ground in the in in the soil and\nDidn't take advantage of so much as they used survey ers and law and the courts and the assembly to slowly encroach upon Indian hunting ground now we come to\nWhat happened to the Indians the west or the Native Americans in the west the indigenous peoples\nIf I recall correctly Terry there were a series of steps late Nineteen century early twentieth century where a large pieces of territory were feed it to the Native American reservations and then they kept chipping away so that it got smaller and smaller do I remember correctly\nYou have it but you have a perfectly correct or I'll go back to the black sea reservation ...\nOf the black sea reservation was a ... was easily three times what it is today a until somebody said hey there's a smooth beautiful country up there why don't we call it Glacier National park and the people who really want to do that to\nNamely the a finance ears of the great northern real love which ran through there they wanted the place to take tourists\nAnd so the federal government said that the black sea you know that reservation we gave you well we didn't really mean to give you the west half of that reservation\nWe're going to protect it as a national parks and here I Believe I Can't remember the number precisely but it was around the million three hundred thousand that they paid them so this this chunk of land\nA so they did in some sense get paid but again that was the guardian who was negotiating contracts with the guardian [laughter] so the ward really didn't have much say\nSo these loans were were taken away and it through this process for the girl reservation in Montana last significant coal losers because of the northern Pacific real world road wanted them so they're no different than the story you told about Pennsylvania\nThey were left them with parcels so ah are seated land that was far smaller than the original territory that was a to B Indian reservations on of course then there's the trail of tears that the Enron and moved to the American Indians moved to the Indian Territory in Oklahoma which is even worse\nTerry symposium most recently in Washington is renewing indigenous economies we've\nWe've put down an outline of the crisis which is going now more than ... we're we're looking at three hundred years here so we there what is to be done when we come back ... percent of the Hoover Institution I'm John bachelor this is the John ...

Adler is a is reacting to that and trying to tend to his own base\nAnd the talk of impeaching an associate justice is up to the court is straightforward Andy or their twist here\nThere are there are a number of choice John one is that uh the the constitution says that ah you know justices or the Supreme Court served during good behavior\nOr and that that is a ... I Believe as well to other a judicial officer of the United states and ... a strong argument to be made now I don't think that this has ever been a\nLitigated and I don't know that it would be litigated because the constitution really does commit\nA the decision of what an impeachable offenses to the house of representatives and then the Senate gets to pass on whether it's a with multiple or not\nAh but the issue the issue would be can you impeach somebody from a judicial officer on the basis of a a non judicial acts and things that have nothing to do with his um responsibilities as a justice of the United states\nUh and in particular acts that happen thirty six years ago that according to the people who raise them or go to his character but don't say anything about his conduct as a judicial officer\nVarious [noise] this uh granted a representative mad lives for racial appetite for impeachment if\nDo follow through with it or this present some problems for ms ... Ford yeah I think that would be tremendous problems for for um professor Ford\nBecause I don't think and this was another reason why I think that this doesn't have a chance of actually going anyplace\nI'm One of the astonishing things I think that he is that that uh happened during the hearing and I refer to it in a column I wrote from from the hill by explaining that I you know I come from the\nFederal court rooms in New York\nOr not from the Sigmund Freud theater on Capitol Hill or but they actually have two people who have told die\nAnd metric Klee irreconcilable\nStories that the the two versions of events are completely diametrically opposed and be figuring out which one is true is vital to how people should think about this controversy and in where I come from which is the world of a of a prosecution in courtrooms\nWhat you would say looking at something like this very simply somebody's lying here and we got to figure out who it is\nA sun house for three weeks Washington they decided to tiptoe around that issue which is the main issue so we got a bunch of psychobabble regarding professor Ford that you know perhaps a\nShe was right about everything she certainly went through a terrible traumatic event she certainly was the victim of sexual abuse or some kind but she's simply wrong\nAbout the identity of the perpetrator even though it's somebody she testified that she knew beforehand so this is not mistaken identity situation a and she was a hundred percent sure according to her testimony that it was eight or and then on the\nOn the cabin on the side of things he was such a compelling witness that nobody\nDared during the hearing call him a liar to his face so the myths about him is that uh he had occasionally a few too many beers when he was in high school and that maybe he committed a sexual assault while he was in a drunken stupor and\nForgot about it for thirty six years which seems to be to be equally preposterous um but the the\nUnfortunate ... result of all this is we never really\nHad a ... a real fact finding proceeding about who was telling\nThe truth and well Kavanaugh has the better of the argument because\nA Ford story is completely uncorroborated he gets to the Supreme Court with a cloud over him because too\nMany people on Capitol Hill including Republicans conceded the credibility and sincerity of professor Ford's account\nOr even though they they say that you know it must be mistaken identification which is exactly what she says it wasn't\nAbout lessons learned are quite separate from the particulars of the forward remarks and Kevin remarks is it your measure Andy that this is now the ... now to be the new standard and advise and consent that you search for a revelation\nIn ... in June of twenty Seventeen that is that a man named Michael Saltsman and attorney for\nPerkins coy ah representing the DNC and connected to the Clinton campaign\nMet with at least once met with a man that by the name of Baker James Baker chief counsel of the FBI\nPrior to the seeking and securing the fights award met with James Baker to pass information about interference by the Russians and the twenty sixteen election\nAndy when this news came last week it received no attention whatsoever even on our a Republican channels because Kavanaugh overwhelmed the news cycle it struck me at the time with my mouth open this this is a fact that we've needed for a long time did it strike you that way Andy\nIt sure did it was a and it's interesting that it came out as you say overwhelmed by the Kavanaugh story because um what this fact is is something that you would not knowing the Kavanaugh story which is called cooperation\nOr this is actually what we've been discussing in talking about all along it goes to what the FBI and the Justice Department knew\nAt the time that they went to the Pfizer court and importantly John what they withheld from the ... the court or we have to underscore here the Perkins coal week\nIs basically the law firm cut out for the Clinton campaign it's the nexus between uh the FBI and\nThe which got the ... and the Clinton campaign which produced it so this was a very important development and probably even in in a time when um when we didn't have an overwhelming story like Kavanaugh or it would have been ignored\nIn the mainstream media is not the conservative media Saturdays\nAnd he wouldn't miss will come out sooner if it weren't for the ... the FBI and the deer ... views regarding some of the documents are barely ... believe it was forty three I think like that\nYeah well ... foot no forty three is something that we've we've discussed a particularly at the time when the house a report came out the house intelligence committee's ... new noses committees\nA report or that footnote was very important ah at the time because it was indicative of a lot of the information that the FBI had that was being held back and the ... the moral of the story back then\nIs that while they were you know ranting and raving about how they couldn't disclose this information because national security was at stake and methods and sources of intelligence would be compromised what we find it again and again and again is that when they were withholding information it's because it's politically embarrassing\nAnd I don't want to say that you know I've I've worked\nIn this ticket I don't want to suggest\nThat there is not national defense information that's important that message and sources of intelligence not important\nUh to to protect but at the same time it has long been known that the government's ability to classify things and to have this under this whole ... of secrecy is a very convenient way to hide a misconduct and wash\nRod Rosenstein the deputy attorney general received a ... a ride on air force one within these last ... hours and the president of the United states speaking glowing Lee of his work and that his work will continue no hand whatsoever\nOf retribution because of trash talk perhaps a mischaracterization of trash talk by Rod Rosenstein and the president and may have twenty Seventeen so we set that aside and I asked is puzzling question about this Aspen revelation uh the\nDeputy attorney general had reason to have the five ... in front of him in may twenty Seventeen when he joined the Trump Administration after all there had been free of them already and he was looking to sign the fourth in that fight the war and he had he had Michael Jordan's name\nI'm puzzled Andy when you have evidence that the public and the Congress\nThere's not been told the full truth over the acquiring of the fight the war and and the allegation by the by many that device award process was abused when you have it in front of you are you not\nCharged responsible compelled to reveal that fact as opposed to say keeping a concealed which is what Mr Rosen's dean and his allies have done for Eighteen months\n[noise] they should be the most transparent people of all John and yet\nA there is opaque as a as anyone who came before them\nAnd I will say this for attorney general and deputy attorney general Rosenstein I think he tried very hard in his last house testimony not to answer the question of whether he read what he signed off on and I would I Would caution that\nThe attorney general's signature that should give Rosenstein is do which is not much\nOf the attorney general's signature on a ... an application\nIs a a basically a certification that all of the legal requirements um have been all those boxes and the statue would have been checked whereas the when the FBI signs off on it they are\nVerifying your purporting to verify the information in the Warren nevertheless I think in a situation like this if he didn't read every word that warrant and ask hard questions before it went to the court a that is really a serious dereliction of duty\nAnd I would also point out or as we've discussed a number of times every single warrant including the warrant that Rosenstein signed said that the FBI believes that the the that not only Carter Page who was the subject of the war but perhaps other people in the Trump campaign\nParticipated and coordinated in the Russian government's\nInterference in the twenty sixteen elections specifically the cyber espionage that representation was made in the war and as an assertion that representation was made in the war that Rosenstein sign\nSaturdays and to date are we seeing any evidence yet I keep waiting\nYeah you would think that um we don't we have seen the evidence but that ... that Rosenstein would have seen and been aware of the evidence when he signed that warrant in June of twenty Seventeen because that was the fourth warrant they had been at it for\nYou know I mean they were essentially editor for the better part of a year but they had been at it for about nine months\nAnd Michael assessment is not it's not in consequential that Michael assessment at Perkins call I represented\nThe cyber wing of the department and he was connected to crowd strike crowd strike you will recall from your distant memories of Russia gate before Kevin ... crowd strike is the organization that told us it was the Russians who hacked the DNC server\nAnd pass that information on to bad parties one of whom might or the allegation was was the Trump campaign so soft and Andy fit it's if we've been building a jigsaw puzzle these last years\nSuffering piece fits right into a missing whole right there right there are we going to get back to the

Research Center so they they said that this ... rising inequality is going to make it difficult for those at the bottom to rise up but as they are very study makes clear\nThe Asians are rising and rising very fast and the United states all an economy as individuals and they're doing very very well so it's never explained why\nThose rising to the top would make it difficult for those at the bottom to\nCut basically emulate what they do um in fact this is a great story it's a sign that race doesn't factor into one's ability to uh increase one's economic output in the United states that were basically colorblind if the Asians can thrive that's a sign that we don't have a race has a problem\nBut there's just no explanation why would the implicit in this idea that um and increasing gap between rich and poor among Asians is bad for the poor Asians is that a\nSomeone say a black person who's very successful should stop doing that because he would be holding down other black people or the Jewish people who are very successful should avoid six should avoid financial achievements beef their achievements would hold down Jewish people why is it that Asian achievement\nIs going to be a barrier to the achievement of other Asians there is no explanation\nIs it's the puzzling here John might be where I just recognized this talk about inequality isn't inequality an expression of success when a when a when a country has an economy that's working very well it increases inequality but of course the rich and the people where the jobs come from so\nIts upside down to say inequality should be eliminated it should be encouraged\nOh look let's be very clear yes John ... absolutely in fact\nThe the the ideas that you and I believe in and that many of us believe in our the ideas of rising inequality the free or the people the more there is inequality\nThe more that and the economy is taxed much less the more there's capital of the natural talent on the way to talent realizing its full potential our ideas are all about inequality and that's a wonderful thing because and economies just a collection of individuals is in the countries where where people are equal or there's lots of misery\nIn a country like the U.S we see people constantly rising up this a sign of economic freedom\nAnd for Asian Americans you would see there's a an unhappy unhappy study showing that Asian American applicants to major universities such as Harvard I think that's the one example in front of us right now are being discriminated against with some strange formula so Harvard in it's\nOdd way a seventeenth century America represented here in the twenty first century is trying to stem the results of a successful economy that Harvard has contributed to for the last four hundred years wow John that's the paradox\n[noise] it it it it's an endless paradox and and that's the one thing I Would say that the Pew report adds that it's\nEducational inequality that's helped drive this\nWell even that's not really true look at China it's one of the least educated countries on earth and it's getting richer richer shameless South Korea free people\nThrive that's the big driver of inequality and people are free or in the United states had stayed do much better and so the the ... education just ineffective all this rich people want to educate their kids and increasingly fancy schools the Asians as long as they're free will do well they don't need Harvard to lift them up they just need freedom\nTo John ... he is the editor real clear markets he's also the author of the new the end of
