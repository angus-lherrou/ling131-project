Sunday Morning local time about eight thirty in the morning and our labor class\nThat the best we have destroyer in the south China Sea a freedom of navigation mission or the Decatur was shadowed by a Chinese warship that Cain we're told from the U.S Navy's report within forty five yards of the bowels of the U.S has Decatur\nGotten Jerry Hendricks United States navy retired aviator\nIs now at the ... however I call upon his knowledge and also writing regularly at the national Review Online about navy capabilities to comment on this issue generally have very good evening view of the report from the U.S Naval Institute is that this is not business as usual\nAnd that the Chinese commander made a decision that was reckless in the extreme or to take his missile cruiser and use it as a I either us threatening ramming boat like the like the Iranians do in the Gulf or\nAs a man who's lost control of his of his sense of space a kind of lose the bubble you've taught me in the past is there any way that incident could have been a miscommunication on the bridge the Chinese ship or an accident good evening to you\nCould even John no there there are no accidents when you're a maneuvering nine thousand five hundred ton destroyers a up alongside a eight thousand tons destroyers or I should say rather see vice versa the Chinese Lou yang destroyer\nA came up in an overtaking a maneuver where it was behind the USS Decatur and our labor clash destroyer which was conducting a freedom of navigation operation in the south China Sea\nSailing past us some of these miss claimed artificial islands or to demonstrate that the United states is not recognize them as is Chinese territory\nAnd the this Lou yang a destroyer came from behind\nPassed down the laughter porch side of the Decatur and then closed as it was passing the the caters bow close to where it was within forty five yards of the bow of the\nDestroyer the American destroyer this is a very unsafe condition or this is not something that the Chinese commanding officer did by accident he has an entire crew there with him\nOr he also has a political comments are on board this was an act of Chinese foreign and military policy an act of intimidation against the United states and and seems to indicate that the Chinese are become increasingly desperate and some of their activities in the south China Sea uh I think some of the\nEconomic tension or from the sanctions and the tariffs are beginning to wear on them and they're they're running out of chips to use on the table and so they've escalated at sea\nIf there is a detail that the secretary of defense Mattis was scheduled to travel to China and either the schedule the trip was been changed her called off of the Chinese called it off can we connect that fact with is a threat in the south China Sea\n... the the cancellations there's been a series of of a tit for tat escalation between the Chinese and the Americans\nThe Chinese it sent a very senior uh essentially equivalent of a three star admiral over to visit and he departed early as an act of protest and I believe that are in response to that response or some other statements by the Chinese defense minister\nSecretary of defense Mattis than canceled his trip to China which have been a long planned and\nSo you're really seeing the the slow shut down a one on one relations between the United states a defense establishment and the Chinese defense establishment things are ratcheting up becoming much more tense and we're seeing it play out both at the geostrategic level as well let's hear on the ship on ship level\nUm and I think it's important to understand this is not\nLike the ... the three incident from two thousand one where a single\nThe Chinese pilot came out flew aggressive maneuvers around one of our large a multi engine a reconnaissance aircraft\nAnd then collided enforce that airplane to essentially crash land on how nine a high non island this was a full ship so you cannot write this office simply the action of one bad actor and the Chinese military this is a move by the Chinese military and hence the Chinese government against the United states\nIs this Cold War activity is this what we faced with the Russian Navy in the north Atlantic and the Pacific\nYes it is so it it is I uh I put out on Twitter last night this isn't the first time the U.S has been to this rodeo in Nineteen eighty eight a in a very famous incident\nA China or a Russian a Soviet Union a ship a cruiser at that time came out\nAnd actually cites wiped 'em where we made a a actual connection between the United states a destroyer the region the USS Karen\n... class destroyer and one of the Russian warships in the black sea uh there were other ships there that the u._s. was doing a freedom of navigation patrol there\nAll the Russians tried to actually come alongside and actually move the American ship out of the way and the American ship did not altered course in fact stood on as we like to say maintain its course\nUm until the Russians broke off but we actually had physical damage between that so the U.S navy has experienced in this that wasn't the only incident during the Cold War we had a number of those uh but it looks like the U.S and Chinese a relationship is beginning to get to that area of tension and what's important to understand is\nThat incident in Nineteen eighty eight happened very near the end of the Soviet Union when they were feeling a lot of tension from the United states and again I think that what we saw here and just the last Seventy two hours in the south China Sea may demonstrate that the Chinese are feeling a lot of tension\nBoth from a military standpoint but also an economic standpoint\nAll the tariff war is not going in their favor right now\nYou have a piece of the national Review Online right now anticipating what the army the navy and the air force need for the future I Want to shape that to China and the and the western Pacific East Asia\nDo we have the fleet to his capable of responding to these reckless incidence by the Chinese would it have been better for example we've talked in the past if we'd had a frequent class to run the freedom of navigation act and not put in our biggest battleships\nWealth John I wrote this this essay at National Review online a which appeared yesterday in response to a series of opinion pieces that have come out recently that was arguing that we were we were doing wrong by making investments in increased capacity meaning growing the size\nOf the Army Navy air force in the navy and in fact these are these other voices were arguing that the money would be better spent in in investing in increased capabilities more high technology and my argument was that was

forty days he says that he's not on medication now he's off his blood pressure\nAnd I think he'd been taking met her medicine for cancer so that he had a variety of of afflictions that he's feeling better about but Heathrow remark at the end that I like you said this is especially for people who don't like diets have always failed diets do hear that a lot Dr\nWe do here that we hear the people obviously is feeding a at a level they've never done it before\nBut we hear people tell us all the time how easy it is and it's easy to follow I mean you're eating regular food eating regular vegetables regular fruits regular protests we do modified mixing of certain things together because of different hormonal disruptions we do a minimize fats oils that are coming in because the body is\nBurning it's all fat for fuel that's really the key here so minimize that but it's actually there's nothing on the food that you can't pick up in any supermarkets\nAnywhere in the world anywhere

why they were selected to be the national kind of church and\nIsrael can you give an example of an up or\nAnd that they participated in in the past something that would describe where what their skill set is for because everything I've seen about the IDF as they can handle themselves\nShore um but the IDF wouldn't necessarily respond to a terrorist attack let's say in Tel Aviv I'm of the sort\nThat happened but there was January twenty Seventeen with um because the Israeli Arab name not shut down um who went to Tel Aviv and shot up\nUm some people sitting in a cafe that it would be a mom that

be properly described as as participants or parallel to power to\n'em so in that structure they would be um they're above that they're the there's a there are units that are comparable to fall to an Israeli police but also um in the Israeli\nMilitary or the way they dress as um as locals and go out um this unit does much more than that\nAnd they prevent many many attacks that's why when people we discuss sometimes to to the statistics that John and I about you know how many attempted attacks and the tremendous record and it's because\nThese people are able to infiltrate and able to to carry

back to a live show hundred\n[noise]\n\n\nI'm John ... knock on the whole conference a presence is here and\nOne of the state that is part of the solution for the troubles and they'll avant is Lebanon it's very difficult to follow especially because\nLebanon is dominated by a bad actor has below underground and above ground and these last years it's been a placing Malcolm is that fair that has ... turned it into a recruitment and money center but no transparency for governance no credibility forgotten do\nDo we want to go to Lebanon and find out the status of what could be the beginning of a remedy although Lebanon is overwhelmed with refugee camps these days we very much please just speak again to ...\nShe's the Friedman visiting fellow at the Washington Institute's good dual program on Arab politics\nI needed a very good and you and thank you for this I characterize Lebanon to me as non transparent but the reporting Malcolm has done these last month is that Hezbollah is still a heavy hair is there any brightness we can report tonight about Lebanon good evening to you\nGet a little kid to a and thank you yeah that definitely my pleasure [noise] uh I'm Sorry to say that no there is nothing ... a good coming out from an economic the country what we're going to be seeing soon and that that on as the worst situation [noise]\nAh we're looking for day people are thinking that the formation of\nThe government that finally going to happen to\nThe end of the week or next week\nProbably everything about the book is going to change everything for Lebanon but\nThe problem as now that has ... actually controls the institution when they won the election that made on the ... election they made sure that\nNot only they won the election that their own and extreme too weak to have any leverage over any decision over the country for not only have a lot when one of the argument that are going to\nControl the government no matter what shape the government and the other night they only have two ... and peas and one hundred twenty eight a steep and the argument which is nothing\nBut they have a bunch of and I do I go to do whatever it takes uh to to to the to keep up on our that's how they're going to control nothing on the other like basic and we're seeing a lot of functions like a day but they are cash economy meaning that it's not going to change much so\nAs long as the allies are not threatening or sanctions nothing's going to change if the government just one after that the very very bad economic economical situation and then on we are on the verge of an economic collapse\nWhich is not going to be good for ... for government doesn't matter what governments we habits longest corruption that keeps them for a government ... has but luckily choke\nI'm the only the only good thing I can face day and as long as Iran economy stumbling husband like financial situation has not looking as good as the court so there's an opportunity there\nSo we need to know what permission to to known it was\nHe kept the United nations is you know expose the the says well the building a um a missile production site in Beirut\nWhat has been the reaction in the country what is the ... an oath to say it's got a couple of parts you can ... the together\nAnd what is your reaction of the people in Lebanon with the ones who will pay the price for this I mean I Know that there's been resistance at times to ... below was building into the the what do you call them the missile rooms that are the ones saying he ... he does that play out now\nUh I think exposing these my size after he is very good uh became the title of the Lebanese people especially the Shia community minded that these factories and that hideouts of of besides the weapons are mostly based under a population of shock you meet the population\nAnd this is good because these guys did not want any war anymore they cannot afford to have another war whether Israel or among themselves and why they can't they they've lost too much a husband and I know that and also they know that\nAny a war also means that they have to the to lead read a lot of refugees knowing as you said that we have a lot of effort you that the country so they can't go anywhere they have to deal with them with them and reconstruction of Lebanon like the one that happened in two thousand and six is not going to happen again\nIran cannot just send money back to the way it did until after six so they don't want to uh the people do not on\nA has little to expel a to to put them in danger of the way it is but the thing is they know that people know that has happened inside the size and I've been on heaven under under the people's house\nThe question is not whether actually the ah the on the side of the the question is that they know that the messiah factories where the weapons are being converted as an injury the red line\nAnd this is less carrying the people is that nothing you did not come out and say have a lot of hiding and we all know that everybody knows that any kind of it with that\nBut he came out and said something much more interesting and much more scary than these people is that these facilities to convert to weapons and they know that for Israel to sit there at night that's where they are actually bombing Syria and everybody scared that\nHas been the looting the acidity Trump give it up and on and what are they doing\nI think more exposure and more accurate exposure and not by not only by ... by the international community and general including the media would work would go a long way in terms of getting the people I'm actually ask them questions and ask them has a plot to remove these weapons or at least\nControl what three the under their houses have belonged to not be able\nTo um and I know from incidents after two thousand and six when people ask\nBut not to move my size from under their houses and the lengths that I've seen that with my own eyes so it's it's it's it they do it they don't want to upset the shock immunity and they don't want to deal with stress\nBut how does this translate all the political level with ... you know saying no use for two days and it ... it doesn't get an agreement to resign and will be re appointed how does those concerns of the people translate out in the political realities of Lebanon today\n\nCome on line with me and we go to our\nMan on the front lines and the new Cold War ... senior vice president of the American foreign policy a policy capital you on a what a flat or you know so just a moment years ago about ... wrote a book about Russia collapse of Russia what I did not understand with the irony of the word collapse\nI didn't realize what we were talking about was at\nAn enemy of the liberal order and that's what we now see an enemy of transparency and a what we is deemed to be the community of nations\nAre these last week said than non display in all directions you like can you help my audience understand\nHow it is that Russia gains by being a prankster at best and Savage or worst against his neighbors against a transnational organizations what is in it for the for Moscow how does this to vent their story good evening ...\nRight so a good evening so it's a great question and I I think are a lot of it goes to a a a sort of a stems from the understanding that\nUh the Russians or feel like they're in a box right so so the way I look good way to think about Russian foreign policy is is that Russia is constantly testing the contours of the box\nThey feel as Biden reporting set a dozen years ago that the end of the Soviet Union with the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the twentieth century and it needs to be revised ah in Russia's favor and so uh what Russia is doing is a constant process of probing\nOr they're looking for weaknesses in the west weaknesses you know why and solidarity ... in political cohesion and where did they find in a an entry point they act as arsonist and a fire fighter they\nBoth create a problem you know political problems security problems and then they posit themselves as solution to those problems\nAnd in that way they increase their geopolitical position at the expense of western nations and in particular the United states\nThe report we discussed last week and I saw came into the press and the ways they were to about ... um the Iranians evacuating the ... air force base to allow Russia stole the history ... missile defense system in Syria [noise]\nSo what do you think this means is is this a Russia really advanced and get ready to turn over to the Syrians is this a change in policy for the for the ... and ... is Russian now looking at his future as an arm supplier two former allies of the United states\nRight now so I think it's a great question because uh the delivery of BS three hundred anti missile system is not without risk for the Russians the Israelis have said uh you know very forcefully that it the delivery of the three hundred is not going to interfere with Israeli military aerial operations\nIn southern Syria and that they can defeat the three hundred if they want to and ah if they do defeat the three hundred a there is a a you know there's going to be a lot of egg on Russian faces and I told my ...\n... that you see a tea for the uh moved out of the Iranians the uh taking over control of by the Syrians that's a little bit of plausible deniability\nIt gives the Russians political cover to say if the at three hundred malfunctions or it doesn't function as well as it should they can always claim user error because the less confident people are now in charge\nThe Russians would permit the S. three hundred to be out of their control you learn is that is that credible\nWell I I think so and the the interesting thing is that the F three hundred is is a is being built\nA lot at the top of the line right anti missile defenses and but it's actually not right there with the Russians already and have been for several years working on the U.S four hundred there's not a not a technical slouch by any sense of the work\nBut it is technology that you've seen the Russians become more and more liberal in sharing with their strategic part\nYou got that Malcolm but if it's in the hands of the Syrian right right\nIt puts them at a disadvantage it's a it's a serious move gas ... with were very broad implications even for the stuff we talked about Lebanon before\nI think in and he has nothing good anticipated along with others uh and now you have in the buying the S. four hundred yet the Turks talking but I mean the history hundreds it's it's um it's a big move from the part of Russia now and and the exporting these things it's obviously a profit motive involved as well\n[noise] right and and this is why I I think this is the point I was trying to\nMake which is that at the at three hundred and becomes more and more of an export commodity at it becomes a more international lived uh the\nIntegrity of the system uh is uh going to be tested in many different ways and from the Russian you know they used\nTo have a very strict command and control over this technology increasingly as they as three hundred goes into service against potential adversaries that might defeated\nA there is a level of possible deniability there is a level of separation at the Russians need to create from this\nSo that if if things go ah don't go Syria's way uh in the case of future is really a aerial operations and the Israelis happen to defeat the system a there is a Russian argument that says well they weren't using it properly the technology is perfectly viable\nUh this is really use your air\nYou John been on the forefront of discussing at sesame analyzing the Chinese involvement in international affairs or\nAnd and you know and you wrote a very interesting piece the which is something we've thought about a lot in about ... about the Chinese targeting the Muslim population there um it was so ... what is the the ... can you can ... the policy\nAnd and what is being implemented obviously human rights abuses are are incorporated in that policy but is the new anti terrorism state law and it's a barrier structures are going to really make a difference in this regard\nAnd I mentioned that ... the foreign minister chastised ... a secretary of state Mike Pompeo because the Chinese are claiming the the detention of up to a million weaker is is a domestic matter you turn on a plane in January a lot\nAnd I think this is really a big story that are not nearly enough people are talking about what's happening in ... in this autonomous region a which used a majority Muslim now it's a a minority Muslim but still very heavily populated by uh the waiters and now Muslim ethnic group\nI'm In China a there is a massive a crackdown police a state control crack down on everything from a you know the prohibition on Islamic traditions on a Islamic dietary restrictions shading of beer it's re education camps\nOr you know the math attention of of it he said over a million people this is a a a huge international story and it's one that I think the Chinese guy\nAre quite assessing at you know the the depth of it and the importance of it the Chinese really aren't grasping quite yet but here\nOn Capitol Hill this has become a real policy issue it is hot potato and it's something that Congress has taking up they've already had multiple hearings on this\nThis has the potential uh particularly the Chinese are transparent about it they had the potential really to become you know a a another a spoken the wheels of the U.S China relationship in a very serious\n... senior vice president of the American for U.S foreign policy council in Washington

the United nations UNESCO takes kind of action that it ... what's the source of money for the pet right now I'm a\nWild aside from the taxes in an internal income they still get money from the Europeans they get money from a Arab countries supposedly for social welfare but we know that it's it's all it's ... and the Arab leaders say it but they don't let the u._s. ... view of us is limitless\nSuch very much is limited any money are going to them and we were a sizable contributor correct yes we were giving them about half a billion so have they replace it no they're not able to cause the Europeans promise but they don't deliver\nAnd the um you know the Russians aren't giving the money Iran and turkey get money in Gaza\nFor um pitch by Palestine's Islamic jihad come us to others but not to to to a bus nobody wants to see the regime's collapse and that's part of the problem so he uses that as leverage against the against the west\nLet's let's do a positive story the USS raw smoke just a destroyer now seen in a ... and what's the significance as that ... support south of ... a major port it's a and the um uh oil and others are things are are exporters from there\nBut the important is this the first time in Israel Seventy years that you've had a story us destroyer visiting\nA ... it's a message it's a message that ... years since Israel's creation is the first time that it's ever happened\nAnd and what's important is it just as a ship on active duty in Syria so that ships have called high hide from it yet and if they do joint exercises\nBut this is a message and it's and the fact that that are taking a ship from the there and and give me I guess guys aren't or and other things but it's meant to be a message to the region\nAnd believe me it's not a message that's lost on on anybody especially as they find a new territory tunnel or you know from from God's to two hundred meters into Israel and only because the advanced technology that Israel's using were they able to\nTo discover it but it shows that there that there's nothing just changed it to continue in the same way that they have\nAnd then the ... of you next go\nTo again declared that rituals to

organization that we are out right Israel is out this year and they said to do which one we were we we will not be a member\nA and as you try to rewrite history but it's just such a blatant act any rewards than the extremes that terrorists 'cause they say look we're winning we're getting what we want the United nations moves in that direction others are moving in that direction despite all of the terrible things that that um\nThat they had been doing and and I just said it a few of this stuff just from this week so it's you know it's horrendous\nAnd you know we see it also in regard to Iran we see in regard to other places they run goes to the international court adjusting states you've got a clean hands how can you go to this place they just sent in Seventeen\nOf the drivers you know we talked about the truck drivers Seventeen of them now are facing death sentences for what cause they demonstrate that gets high fuel in the sand in Iraq and Iran yeah and and the world by\nAnd just allow these things to to go on and and spends all the time and especially if you win\nThe condemning Israel and and this is this is\nA lot of funny stuff going on yeah a everywhere else editor it's kind of one\nGood piece of good news which I should the University of Michigan they finally diminished ration stood up against these these bbs professors especially one who refused to write a letter of recommendation because it's one of the study in Israel is something that is done automatically and uh they got a very sharp reprimand and sanctions\nAnd finally they acted after weeks of of the discussion\nBut it's important that you got to stand up against even if you don't speak out if you allow it on a campus if you will out at the when if you allow it on all these fronts you're only encouraging it and more and more innocence will die because of the\n... get on my show where I don't know all the facts now but I had a communication from her today\nThat she at the ... and she was

McCotter W. J. are the great voice of the great lakes and Andrew McCarthy\nOf the national Review Online we are in pursuit of a puzzle the puzzle is no longer\nJosh Russia gate the puzzle is also Rod Rosenstein the deputy attorney general of the United states these last days have created a significant number of questions that do not have answers at this moment to my understanding gentleman a very good evening to you since last we spoke\nRod Rosenstein much in the news yes for the ride on air force one and the and the generous words by the president of the United states about a conversation with Rod Rosenstein but at the same time the expectation was that this week the residency and would be testifying to Congress the Judiciary Committee\nAbout the events of may twenty Seventeen much in the news since the revolution in New York Times weeks past\nThat Rod Rosenstein joke Joe remark George mentioned in some fashion spoke of the twenty Fifth Amendment\nAnd that in itself is surprising given that it doesn't seem entirely logical that the deputy attorney general re speaking of an amendment to remove porch accept a foreign unfit president to step to the side and also spoke up this this report in the New York times wearing a wire which I think is Justice Department\nOr a speak for a using a lifting device or in some way to and they're a person's remarks that can be used against him in future in court\nAnd the New York times reported that and it was at the time regarded as either in jest or speaking light of that is not know that is no longer the case because since then\nWe we have ... of James Baker the chief counsel of the FBI\nAre testifying the to the Judiciary Committee\nThat he believes that Mr Rosen's genes spoke of this wire and spoken the twenty Fifth Amendment more than once and to to people it goes to report in the administration\nSo I come to you Andy first if I've got the timeline correct so we get to this moment when Rod Rosenstein expected to testify to the Judiciary Committee not only will not appear so far\nBut also will not pass to the Congress notes from that period of may have twenty Seventeen to justify his remarks that he was not being serious good evening to you Andy\nGood evening John well I think that one of the things that are ... ... is unrealistic about the reporting John or at least something that's being skipped over without more uh without the thought that it deserves is why Rosenstein was suggesting\nThat the president the tape recorded in terms of trying to make a decision about whether this is jockey or whether there was something serious about it obviously Rosenstein did not want the president a tape recorded because he was trying to make a criminal case\nOn the president what the the thought that was going through Rosenstein is mind during those eight days when he was we know distraught because of the reaction particularly of Democrats to the memorandum he wrote a in support of\nThe ultimate firing of of uh of FBI Director called me\nA what was going through his mind than was\nThe potential that President Trump because there was a sort of erratic performance because there were were differing rationales offered to the public for why Comey was fired because Rosenstein was being bitterly criticized\nWhat Rosenstein was talking about was gathering evidence\nTo indicate that President Trump was unstable for purposes of ultimately supporting\nA twenty Fifth Amendment move so the idea is they tape recording of the president and the discussion of the twenty fifth to the twenty Fifth Amendment can't be separated or this aggregated there there are two parts of the same all\nThe idea was that Rosenstein himself or others\nWho were having meetings with Trump in the White House we're going in there to\nUh in Rosenstein is mind record the president not just so that they could have recordings of the president it was in order to try to provoke conversations that would show he was unstable in order to get some momentum behind this whole twenty Fifth Amendment pushed so the thought that this was a joke\nTo me is really quite unrealistic when you think about not only those two things the recording and the twenty Fifth Amendment but also the fact that this whole eight day period\nBegins with Rosenstein very distraught\nOver the fact that he's being criticized for the call me memo\nAnd ends on may seventeenth with Rosenstein\nNot moving forward on the twenty Fifth Amendment by appointing Robert Mueller as special counsel is nothing jockey alert about anything that happened in that eight day period and again I think it makes no sense to talk about whether Rosenstein mentioned\nTape recording the president because I don't think there's any ... if ... if Rosenstein himself as admitting it but claiming it was ... that means is so much evidence that had happened that he doesn't feel like he could deny it so then you have to ask yourself must ask yourself why on earth\nWould he be talking about that and he was\nTalking about it in the context of the twenty fifth\nAmendment Saturdays [laughter]\nCameo all because of as you said before his reputation correct It's really about him\nI really do believe that he is and I think again we have to go back to that timeframe it's very easy I always find in these situations when you're looking back\nIt's hard to put yourself and to put our listeners in the framework of what was going on then versus what's going on now but what was going on then if you recall is\nThe Trump Administration was trying still to get up and running\nIt was trying to get its own appointees in place which is in large measure are still has not happened at the Justice Department but I I Want to underscore at a time when it was very difficult for Trump's nominees to get confirmed\nAnd get to work in the various agencies that the executive branch\nBecause there was so much resistance and opposition to Trump\nRod Rosenstein was ... confirmed by a vote of Ninety four to six with overwhelming democratic support and when he wrote the call me ma'am oh\nWant to stop their compulsive eating and start living a healthy her wedding life over a year's

colleague Andrew McCarthy about rod rather than being in his decision\nNot to appear before Congress not to give Congress\nContemporaneous notes of the events of may twenty Seventeen when from James at from a Andrew McCabe the former deputy\nDirector of the FBI and Jim is James James Baker the former chief counsel the FBI when we're told Mr Rosen is being discussed the twenty Fifth Amendment and wearing a wire those important days but at the end of those important as\nMr Rosen's Jane after considering other candidates appointed Bob Mueller Robert Mueller a longtime friend of James Comey the fired FBI Director to be to be the head of the special counsel investing investigating Russia gate but now we get news and who knows if you can confirm it because it's the leak through\nA known sources now we get news that\nRod Rosenstein argue with James McCabe in front of the now momentarily hired Robert Mueller\nAbout recusal and recusal over whether McCabe ... shorter could or should not have worn a campaign T shirt and a family picture supporting his wife's bed for state Senate I Know that is all you have to go back to twenty sixteen\nBut the ... identified with the Democratic party very prominent in the Virginia politics and a Rod Rosenstein apparently had this argument why we know this now\nAnd the I'm going to guess that there's that there's a competitive leaking going on here from attorneys because this very much looks like Rosa themes leading against McCain whereas this started one McCabe lead against rose machine or and\nOr the Congress with ... ... a a permission leaked against Rosen seems so the public is like a tennis match Andy the public's go ahead going back and forth from court to court how do you how do you interpret this latest leak we ... we can't confirming\nThat Rosen's dean is having a an argument in front of Bob Mueller\nI Believe John that it's a defensive or or maybe it's a I Would I should say is the best defense is a good often\nOn

important may ninth to may seventeenth\nPeriod that we've been discussing we'd heard a lot about Rosenstein in connection with that particularly after the New York times article was concerned so I think this is a peace with\nThat and why now I say that this is the best defense equals a good offense\nApproach on Rosenstein part what I mean is if I'm McCabe or frankly if I'm Jeff Sessions\nI hear Rosenstein talk about conflicts of interest and I think is he kidding\nIn in terms of him pointing out my potential conflict of interest between ... as opposed to his actual screaming concrete\nConflict of interest is almost hilarious I mean if you think about it McCabe may very well have had a conflict and certainly people at the bureau thought enough that he did that he was

both criminal investigation involving the president\nAnd the congressional investigation involving the surveillance of the Trump campaign Rosenstein is an essential witness so he has the conflict to end all conflicts and if he was raising conflicts with other people\nAnd not recognizing the clear conflicts that he had a I I gotta say something's wrong here we've got about a minute ... go
