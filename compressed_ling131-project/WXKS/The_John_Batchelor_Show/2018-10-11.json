extension used due to leave in a couple of months anyway so the Hong Kong government really wanted to make a point they have never\nUnder British colonial rule or under Chinese essay our special administrative region rule\nEver denied a journalist visa extension of foreign journalists so this is a this is a a real sign they did this seemingly to punish Victor because you happen to be an officer of the foreign correspondents club\nWhen the head of a a a a pro independence pro Hong Kong Independence Party a came to speak their so Victor in a way was an innocent a victim I think wrong place wrong time but I'm the Chinese and the Hong Kong government are really I'm trying to prove a point you didn't mention that this very same political party or has now been\nOutlawed again this has never happened in Hong Kong so yeah I think you you put the Dutch together and were seen some pretty concerning a circumstance\nJust a detailed outlawed that seven ambiguous chess\nWhere they've they've banned the political party to Hong Kong national party which is pro independence in the process of being banned it's being appealed but it has it has been banned that it's never happened in Hong Kong\nSo garden that sir Robert ... the first prime minister of Great Britain banning parties that would be the early Eighteen century that's where we are going\nWell yes we are and it's not just the Hong Kong national party I'm Mark there are indications that they're going to go after another group lead generally by students Joshua longer as\nWell known internationally by now but there are thinking of going after his group as well they haven't done it yet um but I guess the indication would be let me just throw out a theory that if they can get away with banning the Hong Kong national party then they're going to start going after other part is as well\nWell I think you're probably right we don't know but um we can see the writing on the wall which is we're seeing loyalty test they've ... they've ah prevented some people from running for political office because they haven't sworn allegiance to the PR see where they made a mockery of the oath of office\nSo in almost every aspect of political life into a certain extent in media and and I guess you'd say more broadly throughout civil society we're seeing a narrowing of the bounds or to put another way and expansion of the no go zones the red lines and\nWe're unfortunately I'm getting a fair amount of uh the government is getting a fair amount of support from Hong Kong or elite sending in some of the media did\nSomething happen mark since you were here before was Sarah did a red light go on or did something or something at ... towards suggest itself that this was coming well\nWe went back to Chinese rule in Nineteen Ninety seven and so this process has really been going on for Twenty one years there's been a a kind of hammering down and I think that's been particularly pronounced since the uh Occupy Central the umbrella movement of four years ago it's been a very very\nConcerted effort and Beijing has come to the for a lot more and has not made any pretense about letting Hong Kong people run Hong Kong which was the original promise\nWhich was a promise and the joint sign of British ... declaration of Nineteen eighty four\nYou know mark if you go back let's say five six years in Hong Kong no one was talking about independence and what you have right now is China by throwing a fit has actually created the movement that it's now trying to press so it's sort of like creating its own opposition\nAbsolutely um you make an excellent point the uh first time that I saw anyone march under any sort of independence banner was in mid uh two thousand fourteen there were two or three people underneath the flag and now you have\nBroad support particularly among young people I'm not talking majority support but double digits support for independence realistic or not people are really pushing back against Beijing Beijing created this movement though\nYeah and one thing that's interesting you know when when you go to let's say a noodle factor noodle shop you see people wearing

Gordon it's ... ... it's the best bet that the Dalai Lama hosted at the White House every president as far back as I can remember it's Tibet\nSo are we are joined by\nA young graduates to a post graduate student at the University of Rochester Rochester a essay who came and he tells the beginning of the star mark Clifford of the south China Morning post former editor is also here when he'll ask questions just the beginning of the story that he's disrupted and his plans to hold an event about Tibet\nAnd she gets information that it's not going to be invited on ... it's not it's not pleasant for the University of Rochester to have it on campus because\nSnowflakes yet so far\n... so say who you're going to have this event in a mate auditorium in on the University of Rochester\nCampus march thirty first of this year\nJust hours before it's supposed to occur you get ... off into a remote classroom you know well beyond um any place where anyone's going to go and you of course afterwards want to go and find out what happened you'd go talk to the dean of students what do you hear from the deep\nSo what I heard from the dean on my personal conversation with him was that a um he actually had to re book the room um after it getting canceled because she didn't want the university to look like it was censoring itself\nUm and I don't know if she meant this on a on a on a goodwill or whatever it may be but um he said next time that I I have an idea about holding this event\nI should go and and and talk to the Chinese community first in the university before I hold this before I hold this type of event so that um this type of incident wouldn't occur again\nI'm at and at that point I all I knew that the student group pulled off and and that was the main issue however the weird thing is that up until that time I'm even ... which I actually talked to the dean five days after my event occurred on campus thankfully\nAnd up until that time I haven't got I had gotten a single email from the student organization that actually pulled out from the event\nAnd so she actually then suggested that I go talk to the student organization about what happened but uh all he knows his that was the student organization that pulled off and that was the main reason\nAnd then the upshot of all of this is basically the University of saying that the Chinese students get a veto on what can be hosted on campus which really is essentially what said you know they tried to prevent people from going to your event how many people eventually showed up in that remote area\nOh I'm unlike unlike what a lot of people believe ... over Seventy people show up\nMost of them were but we had a diverse range of students but the most of them were students at that either came from mainland China or those students who are a Chinese Americans but other than that we had a other a diverse members of the university community\nSo despite the best efforts of perhaps the Chinese government but certainly the administrators at the University of Rochester\nYou get an inclusive event talking about Tibet a sensitive subject with Chinese mainland students Chinese Americans in a good cross section of the University of Rochester yup so it was all for naught all of this attempt to ... your um event off campus right\nDetail garden or cooking a lot of diverse characters who are also the Centers for the future those are young people they have long memories well\nThey do John and this indicates that a lot of the effort so\nSo the Chinese government um and the Chinese security services to censor in a press or a counterproductive it just doesn't work ...\nTo mark because he mentioned the umbrella movement the a yellow umbrella protests of Hong Kong those where young people those\nWere young people and just to wrap up or what Gordon set out I mean think about this is quite chilling it the the uh or would you said John that the Chinese government in Chinese people in in Hong Kong Chinese punitive Chinese students associations have a veto over what can be discussed on campus and I when I find\nShocking is it administrators go along with this so much the time that people are so scared about a little bit of money that's being doled out through Confucius institutes or or they just allow themselves to get intimidated look over their shoulders and it's not usually some high level pressured some\nMid level person who just decides they're going to pull the plug on some inconvenient event\nTo these Chinese students there at at the University of Rochester they're paying full ticket they don't have scholarships here or there on money from home money from mom and dad what do you know about their\nResources well from what I Know a lot of them actually do pay out of pocket a film them are ... are are on some form of scholarships some from what I've heard is a government scholarship\nBut from a from what I Know recently is that some of them even um I get sponsored by somebody to come here and study right so um they're paying full they're paying full top dollar um\nAnd that's good for the university university where you see what the motive is here they don't want to disrupt their a flow of ... mainland China of course there's a Chinese is a student association\nYeah there's a the Chinese students in scholars association is on most or virtually all campuses where there are mainland Chinese students\nAnd really this is essentially an organization although it was supposedly Chinese students and scholars is really run out of Beijing and is intended to monitor um students also to organize them for political activities on American soil this is a violation of American sovereignty clear and simple\nAnd the thing here John it there's a lot of people to get angry at one of those people or set of people are are basically us politicians and us leaders for allowing Beijing to operate on American soil violate our sovereignty year and year out and we don't do anything about\nIt I say I've seen too many Alfred Hitchcock movies so I have to follow this course have you heard talk is their noise about Chinese spies among the student population reporting back to Beijing\nWell I'm over the years uh in in in the University of Rochester I'm I have heard bits and pieces yeah my Chinese student colleagues that um\nBut I Am struck by how the Chinese with their confidence in the long game our\nAct I would say they were acting rattled if they were a couple of cowboys wandered into my ...\nWell I think that there are increasingly assertive would be the nice word aggressive belligerent are less nice words um\nAnd it's not clear whether it's a coming from some kind of bravado were some real sense of confidence or if they're actually speaking to impress their boss in one he's got one Boston as a matter of fact that boss guy named should Jinping\nI'm ... probably should have been meeting pond pay oh went on a previous visit he did meet ... first\nHe sends him to a subordinate to subordinate give him a tongue lashing and you know as as we were discussing before we went on air Jon usually in diplomacy you're behind closed doors right you don't do that kind of thing you issued trying to make a point to to someone your boss as well as the guy on the other side of the ocean\nYou know the other thing here is that what the Chinese are doing when you look at the actual actions you know canceling dialogues and and the rest of it\nOh yeah see dialogue cancel the middle of October very significant\nThere's this ... security dialogue canceled Tobar there are a lot of milk Tamil exchanges that have already been cancelled are clearly they're not going to put on anymore or at least in the near future\nUm trade talks have been canceled all these things that have not occurred have generally been for the benefit of China throughout the years and for Beijing not to go forward with him as an indication that yeah they're throwing a tantrum but they're doing so in a way which is counterproductive to their own interests\nSo that shows that there's got to be some sort of stress and the political system right now because they're doing things that don't advanced or cause in when countries do things like that you know something is fundamentally wrong at the top and mark\nLife in Hong Kong it's I'm I'm not been there\nBut Gordon tells me that it's a magical place that is par space colony part of part of the Asia economy is they're anxious to talk about this is their whistling past the graveyard talk how did they regard these in these notes that are discordant well\nFirst of all I think it's remarkable how much space Hong Kong people preserved for themselves in the Twenty one years since um the People's Republic of China took what was a British colony back\nInto Chinese hands Chinese sovereignty a lot of people thought that this was going to happen much faster so we've had a half a million I'd say probably a million people out in the streets in two thousand three protesting against proposed national security legislation\nFour years ago we had the umbrella movement where the center of the city was occupied for Seventy nine days\nSo and the one hand that's that's remarkable to Hong Kong people are like water they're usually very gentle a few drops here and there and every once in a while they get together and there's a cascade of torrent that\nSweeps away um be what's in the way however the last few years have been really tough and there is as I said before a very concerted campaign to narrow what is permissible what can be talked about in Hong Kong um\nThe the leading pro democracy newspaper website apple daily is a has been way you know it's been the subject of a boycott and its print operations and on its website so we're just seeing more and more ah actions with this sort and I I think it's got people feeling pretty discouraged pretty beaten down into 'em\nUp for the most you know people who care are nervous and then on the other hand much of the business community ... of course much of the government much of the elite is saying don't worry everything's going to be fine\nBut it doesn't look like things are going to be fine because you do have\nYou know you especially you got to have a large portion of the population that's not buying into this if you go back to July first or June thirty I'm\nNineteen Ninety seven I'm the last day of British Rule there was this euphoria that China was going to take over and if you would pull people then which I'm sure somebody did you you have like Ninety nine percent of the people saying this was really\nGoing to be very good but doubt if you were to take that same poll you have people say look I don't even believe I'm a Chinese I I'd they they're saying for instance I Want to be independent these are voices we hadn't heard of six years ago so it seems to me that with Beijing is doing\nIs I'm actually making Hong Kong much more hostile territory for its interests it absolutely has made it more hostile rhetoric and the thing that's important here today is ten ten doubled ten day it is the national day for Taiwan the republic of China\nA lot of people in Nineteen Ninety seven were saying look Taiwan you too can become part of the People's Republic this is gonna be okay because you're going to have autonomy and Hong Kong we're going to be the shining example that leads you people Taiwan\nBack to the Chinese and it's not working out that way Hong Kong is now the negative example for Taiwan is the example for people in Taiwan and say look we don't want any part of this look with these Chinese did to Hong Kong\nMark I tell a story there people waiting to board the aircraft at Kennedy and Newark to go to Asia right now so they're listening to us All right I tell the story an anecdote no names\nOf the young men who does business in China and I asked him about the security concerns we see them that reported in the newspapers all the time\nA Chinese cyber theft\nUh also minders when you arrive in China and the mainland China and Hong Kong mainland China\nAnd uh the secure the iPhone is not secure anywhere really unless you turn it off and maybe not even that he told me that when he does business in China which is not infrequently he leaves all of us electronics in America\nAnd when he arrived from the mainland he's aware that there are a mind or is there no where he is he has face to face meetings and they exchanged thoughts and then he leaves the country now she has a particular technology I won't name at but it's highly highly sought after around the world\nThat is a story that I Would expect to find in a thriller as I get on the airplane as I'm sure people are reading thrillers before they fall asleep\nBut I tell this story to those lines at Newark and at at JFK because I think something has changed I don't think that was true ten years ago when Gordon and I started talking there's a level of surveillance and now suggest violence is close\nWell there's certainly a level of surveillance that would prompt a pretty much any foreign business person going to China to leave their electronics and home you're absolutely right and most and anybody who knows what they're doing doesn't bring their phones and trying\nAnd without our electronics without being able to travel to China as a a capitalist you have already exceeded to the power of the anaconda you've already surrendered some of your freedom well or looked\nAt another way China's surveillance state is at war with its attempts its own attempts to develop a more modern economy China's largely I'm buying\nBorrowing begging stealing technology and a lot of hard work pretty much caught up in his pretty close to the technology frontier but how are they going to get farther if their own people can't talk can't trust each other can't do we chat which is like what's that um\nAnd our um you know under a state of surveillance in Canada thinking talk freely I mean it's this is really China's dilemma\nYeah and and this is going to be important because obviously control of technology artificial intelligence quantum commuting\nComputing quantum communications five gee wireless biotechnology biotechnology all of these are really going to determine the course of the twenty first century\nChina who stole a lot of it in some places it's actually a head um but it's only been ahead because they've been able to get foreigners to come and to take foreign technology\nUm being able to develop on it's on its own that remains to be seen\nWay thank mark Clifford from the from Hong Kong he's a former editor of the south China Morning post which is the daily reading and Hong Kong I'm

backs and waiting for it to pass good morning to you\nIn college I Am actually I don't think China does have a a a response China has got used to effect in way of dealing and many of those headlines

is being a change of ah you know focus and Washington\nAnd elsewhere and even in the even the German than I realizing hey China is not our friend it's not our partner or we have to be much more circumspect and I don't think China has a response primarily because think about what's happening here you're basically asking to China to basically ...\nHave a different model from the past twenty or Thirty years and it just doesn't ... ready for that that doesn't know how to respond no print challenged\nYeah I think you're right freezer because what we're seeing is\nKnow confusion on the part of ... you know for decades they've been able to get their way they've been able to you know smile and that doesn't work they'd been bullying they've been been intimidating they've almost always gotten what they want\nNow they run into somebody called Donald John Trump and it's not working for them and I don't think that they know how to deal not only with Trump but also as you say with the English with the Germans with everybody else\nThis is a real moment of time where the world to bits and in ... new policy in Beijing has yet to figure out\nHow to deal with this\nBut I think that's right because there isn't a simple will Trump has made a big play for the deficit and not told me how things started the deficit is too big that's one major and I would argue pretty ... manager of the overall relationship between China but even if China just starts buying more stuff from the states where there's more oil or you know\nEnergy or if it's the grains or whatever that fun fundamentally doesn't solve the problem off and on level playing field when it comes to China at certainly doesn't solve the problems is the political problems in China you know and and China clearly it's if it's not panic it's clearly a flailing around and you look at this Interpol chief\nThat the Chinese ... that only two years ago a year he's been disappeared in China um he's under investigation for corruption so much for the anti corruption campaign ... two years ago in the first place\nIf wherever you look at China that that in math\nYeah and and when this this whole thing about currency manipulation I think is endlessly fascinating for decades China yes did manipulated currency in other words they drove the value of the ... down in order to gain a treaty advantage for their exporters\nThis year of course the renminbi is falling precipitously against the dollar and other currencies but it's not because of Chinese currency manipulation as we define that term it's because the Chinese themselves don't want to hold their own currency\nSo they've been actually supporting the renminbi and that's the opposite of currency manipulation\nAnd that just shows the fragility of the Chinese system and I think we're going to see other symptoms of that for Jodi in the economy in Beijing has got to deal with that in a hostile environment because countries like the U.S are not trying to support China anymore\nFraser I Want to press you we spoke with mark Clifford our colleagues about Hong Kong and how it's regarding these\nTroubles moments how is Singapore dealing with this

I looked at my window and see the harbor from the office here you know\nFive reasons of ships go through Singapore's ports on on a on a weekly basis in the hundreds of thousands of containers um and so the global trade is very important to them that obviously concerned about trade wars\nThat obviously concerned about China and climbed on there to depend on Chinese to to as well but they're all from the sidelines that are clearly nowhere near the thick of it in the way the Hong Kong is but a lot of people in an age are white because they simply don't know how you the shake site\nAnd of course there are there and what he does well is because many of the complaints against China they know to be true\nThis is ultimately you know it's not calling China's bluffing anything it's calling the ... and saying look stop bullying the kids\nWere not going to take it any longer things have got to change and so that it's changed coming in no uncertain how that comes is it going to be an inclusive change where we can all still continue to grow but on a federal level or is it going to be at retrograde change where you know China becomes more inflated and global trade suffers I never want to become a somewhat isolationist we don't know yet\nYeah Frasier I don't know if you went to the ... conference in Singapore which I think just wrapped up but Ian Bremmer of Eurasia Group the risk consultancy said\nLook the world is changing and we just don't know where this is going and what you just talked about in terms of uncertainty I think is a theme that you hear around the world

of these two candidates especially because these are Republican conservative voices or not and the ... the president is as you as you said right after the election attitude and\nSo how do you measure these two candidates for the attitude no Donald Trump good evening\nHi good evening to you John well those individuals are extremely accomplished a very smart people I'm\nDina Powell as I understand it had served in the number to post at the national Security Council under general McMaster when he was a national security advisor very close to ... you will recall that the president then\nDispatched with general McMaster and replaced him with John Bolton the one of the big reasons why Trump replaced ... twofold actually\nOne personally they didn't have much chemistry they just didn't get on but the other reason is at McMaster as accomplished as he was an is Mick master in many ways was deep state McMaster wasn't tablet Schmidt McMaster was off brand\nTo Donald Trump\nAnd well he shared a lot of the president a policy inclination he worked against him in a lot of ways because he still cared what the establishment thought and sought to preserve establishment influence uh out the NFC\nAnd brought in a lot of foreign policy establishment types that were working off in their cross purposes with the president and his immediate team on major issues like ending the Iran nuclear deal getting out of the Paris climate accord\nOr confronting China on their currency manipulation and that the trade deficit renegotiating NAFTA and so on [noise]\nYou know there were just too many problems in the mix master relationship with McMaster\nWas fired or let go a dean of how his deputy also chose to to leave because she didn't want to work after John Bolton that not all of that's understandable I think that\nUh the president's daughter Yvonne coach who's very influential\nProbably suggested to the president that it would be wise after the Kavanaugh hearings to replace a woman with a woman and maybe that argument has had some traction with the president he might understand the politics in those terms but I think Dina\n... herself as accomplished as she is is off brand for the president and setting aside the gender issue here and looking at looking at the clues you know we really need to rip please Nikki Haley was somebody who will continue making the progress\nThat she made at the un I think Rick Grinnell far far better choice were Gillette Grinnell it's like an extension of President Trump he is he dead tired ...\nUh by the way he would be the first openly gay a UN ambassador a which would be sending a real signal\nTo the rest of the world wouldn't it\nOut at Grinnell is he broke last diplomatic you spent many years the United nations under five un un ambassadors\nA nominated by president of both parties Brock Obama George W. Bush and so on so he's got a wealth of experience he knows the institution better than anyone I've ever seen and he knows diplomacy [noise]\nThe problem I think John is that in some ways ... victim of its own success he has been a tremendous US ambassador in Germany he's\nEssentially one of the few us ambassadors on the continent who actually know what they're doing and he had tremendous success in leaning\nAn chairman corporations major ones like Siemens and Dinah Miller stop doing business with Iran in the face of new sanctions on the Iranian regime and the withdrawal of us from the Iranian nuclear deal\nHe has to hit the ground running he doesn't waste any time he picks up the phone and talk to the CEO's these companies himself he does all if that's\nThe hard work and I think the president like having him there I mean the word is that the German Chancellor Angela Merkel is a little free to frack which is good and I think the president that the only thing that might be a little low to remove him from the center of Europe and bring him to New York at the un\nBut my feeling is that he should because I think given all the success he's had in Europe he could have even more sitting in Turtle Bay confronting all of our enemies and dealing with our our allies on a more regular\nPost Kavanaugh Monica we have to we must anticipate that this is a conversion consent post and that the Senate will weigh in and that very loud voices\nUm voices we heard during the cabinet unhappiness will speak again there are several senators running for president others raising money in these last days now this process wouldn't happen until after the election but in any event that's an opportunity again to raise your profile for the Democratic primaries\nThat begin pretty much the competition begins right away and twenty Nineteen and the speeches in Iowa so I note that MSNBC and the red ...\nCorrespondent for MSNBC Andrea Mitchell has already declared Grinnell very controversial that talk for unacceptable because the explanation he offended and angle America all that that translation he's not\nA one of us okay fine now that's the recommendation but it's also warning Monica didn't Mr Grinnell went through a rough process to get to Germany didn't it was a long wait and now\nLong way thanks to the Democrat Chuck Schumer\nAnd now they're rearm so does I mean it does Grinnell won a faith that pummeling again after Kavanaugh\nAbsolutely he would uh work as a as a friend of mine and he is absolutely fearless and the recommendation that he makes on Glenn Merkel nervous is a good thing and the presidents seizing loves Rick\nBecause he's a fighter um I also think you know\nThe assumption that Tina Peng would sail through it's also a big assumption I mean we don't know what they're after the Kavanaugh situation I think anybody that the president put up for a major nomination it's going to have to go through the ringer\nSo the question is who is willing to take this on who is willing to fight back I mean I think either one of them would be up for the fight but I think if you weren't looking for major major appointments in the cabinet at the un\nWho are extensions of the president and his populist revolution then I think the choice is obvious that it's Rick right now\nJohn Bolton a longtime colleague of ours and I miss him I miss your John Bolton but you're in the national security advisor and you're not you're not permitted to talk freely John Bolton said to favor Richard Grinnell rich Rick Cornell is that does that sensible the Monica that the national security advisor wants to have a\nA a voice in choosing the ambassador to the United nations\nYes of course recall that John Bolton served as the U.S ambassador to the un he knows institution very well after\nBeing humbled by the Democratic Senate led by Joe Biden yes I Do recall\nThat yes and remember that President Bush had to a point there during recess made a recent appointment because Bolton was so controversial in the Democrats made life a hell\nI remember that ... was only there for a limited period I think it was a year\nMaybe because it was a recess appointment and so Bolton made tremendous progress there\nBut he couldn't he didn't have enough time to actually start to reform the institution which I Know is really heavy lifting it's turning around a battleship in the middle east the ocean but Nikki Haley may tremendous progress in that direction\nAlthough with regard to Iran North Korea\nYou want somebody to succeed her will continue the boat and Haley legacy of confronting our enemies are dealing with our allies and trying to reform the corruption at the un law standing for U.S interests in ideals I think they again the obvious choices wreck\nMonica crawl in London Center for policy research on John bachelor\nThis is John ... and I ... we know that marketing or customers is a challenge businesses of all sizes share we can help not only does ...

they are we believe a centrally unchanged over all these billions of years and so our ability to fly New Horizons across what Roosevelt and observe ultimate truly up close and other corporate belt objects in the distance is\nSomewhat similar to making an archeological dig into the history of our solar system and how the planets were for\nIt it's very high priority scientifically the national Academy of sciences ranked that is the highest priority or at the time that the New Horizons was getting started and now we're at the the second stage of culmination\nOf achieving the national academy goal\nExplored the Pluto system as you said and twenty Fifteen and now at New Year's eve and New Year's day turning twenty nine ... we will make the first ever close up flyby of corporate belt object and we're going to revolutionize our knowledge\nWhat we know about it what about the dangers yes the risk out there and they've crowded\nIt is not crowded or the quicker both is fast in fact that the surface area of the corporate belt is larger by a factor of several than all this space from the sun out to the planet Neptune\nAnd so even though the Clipper built just teeming with small bodies were small planets they are individually separated like great distances\nSo there is no significant risks to the spacecraft in crossing the Quaker belt which will be doing\nAll the way out into the into the twenty twenties as a matter of fact because the court for both goes twice as far out as we are now almost\nBut there there may be dangers\nAt the fly by because it's both ... has large numbers of moons or rings or other structures we don't want to fly through those because our speed is so great we're traveling thirty two thousand miles per hour that almost ten miles per second\nAnd striking anything even the size of a rice pellet\nCould treads the spacecraft so as we approach ultima\nWe're using the on board cameras in radio and pictures back to look for moons rains other hazards if we find them in our path will fire the engines and divert to a safer close approach distance or in order to make sure that everything goes well\nDavid\nUm you're you're flying by it this huge speed how long do you stay getting pictures of ultimate too late or is it so quick that you you you don't spend much time getting pictures or how is that determined\nWell that's a great question you probably remember as we were on a ... approach to to do that we started getting pictures that were better than what the Hubble Space telescope to deliver a couple of points out that's because politicized continent like\nThe size of the United states uh but ultimately is very much smaller it's about the size of Chesapeake Bay and\nIn in a on the eastern seaboard and so although or cameras can currently see it it's just a thought in the distance we're still Seventy million miles away we're closing it almost a million miles a day\nBut we'll only resolve it and be able to get high resolution pictures\nAnd images and other data types only in the last day before the fly by in the day of the fly by and we only get one shot at that if it doesn't go well on those two days\nOr will come up with half a low for no loaf at all so we are planning very carefully and testing all the fly by plans to make sure that this\nVery high speed flyby of the small but scientifically valuable target at the frontier of our solar system is successful\nWe're we're we're looking toward ultimate to lay but we have some hints about what you're heading towards an over the last year I Believe this summer and the summer before teams went to a remote places on earth Argentina South Africa ... or Africa\nOr to view\nOf the object using a method called transit the transit system how did they do this Alan and what did they learn about ultimate tool using the transit system\nWell this is a type of transit it's called a stellar occupation and which are we predict mathematically we're on the earth multiple will make a stars week out as it passes in front of and then we position telescopes in ... the expected shadow path of ultimate\nAnd from timing how long\nThis star weeks out we can determine the size of ultimate too early and by doing that at a whole series of places in the shadow we can map out its silhouette it shape\nAnd that's important because Bolton is so small and so far away that\nEven the Hubble Space telescope can't resolve it it's just a point to flight\n... this is the only technique that allows us to determine the size and shape [noise] uh and we were successful at that uh one of our teams on New Horizons are are grown based astronomy team led by Dr Mark ... deployed over ...\nAstronomers with two dozen telescopes to Argentina in the summer of twenty Seventeen and then again to Senegal in Northern Africa this summer and in both cases or they were able to get in the shadow path watch it wink out a with a\nOne or more telescopes and as a result now a pretty good deed on the size of this thing is I said it's about the size the Chesapeake Bay ab ... miles across [noise] we have a pretty good indication\nOf its reflectivity as a result of this because we can combine its brightness in its size to calculate how reflective\nSurfaces and it turns out it's quite dark it's about as dark as a bare ground\nAnd in addition we mapped out of shape and twenty Seventeen and it looks like something called the contact binary in other words it looks like two lobes if you will or two years ... years that are uh\nProbably connected together may be orbiting one another but in any case a very exotic shape probably telling something to us about how the early stages of planet formation took place\nWe're speaking with Alan Stern Dr Alan Stern is\nThe the guy for a New Horizons

millions of years ago\nBulgaria however I learn from the news most recently visited a delegation from Bulgaria visited Baku\nSpeaking up for our energy and prosperity and military cooperation madam ambassador a very good evening to you the relationship between Bulgaria in Azerbaijan it's not obvious when you're in New York how does it work what do these two nations find\nIn each other ... coming from different parts of Eurasia to work together good evening to\nGood evening and it's the bachelor and thanks for having me you're absolutely right after about ... uh um strategic partners and in fact after ... biggest partner in the caucuses\nAnd as far back as three years ago in two thousand and Fifteen when my president visited Bulgaria there was an important documents side and the declaration of strategic partnership that\nAre covered all these areas that you've just mentioned it also it um elevated the level of friendly enabling relations between our countries to the level of strategic partnership\nAnd in this partnership and as a just a close interaction multitude of the areas of common interests energy being one of them and I think for the time being the most important one is that into the other than Thirteen before my president visited Bulgaria there was\nUm an agreement signed on the delivery of the gas resources advantage of resources specific the gas from either by John to Bulgaria and I'm a effect if a transplanted\nSo right now we're working closely with the Bulgarian partners\nUm and was very much helpful and we um are looking forward to Bulgaria constructing a key element of this um delivery that is the interconnect or a grease Bulgaria\nAnd we visit this project to be fully operational um ended up next year already twenty twenty\nAnd we'll be able to supply one billion cubic meters of gas to Bulgaria this is at a very serious amount given the fact that Bill Gates has any new editor demand varies between two point seven to three billion\nSo that means that that's our budget out a little bit ... basically I'm delivering one third of vulgarity us against them at most important that\nI recently our state oil company has expressed interest in I'm participating in ... so far only five percent of all guinea has been guess if I\nFelt a so called it's covered the looking into possibilities off the um disability study to check out what the possibilities are for either by just participation in this project and in fact uh\nWhat is even more important I Would say is ... role as a transit not only as an end user us as a consumer of other but\nAnd I guess but as an important trends that top and point all the Balkan Peninsula because\nI'm next to it is Serbia is um Macedonia ... so I'm I'm I'm Montenegro and other countries that are clearly interested in Azerbaijan a guest to be able to diversify their gas for polio\nAnd will be coming to Europe specifically to go get it with our own volumes are they competitive price\nAnd voted it will benefit not only as the user and consumer of this gas but also as a country that would receive entities\nYes let me let me recover for those of us who are not living with a map Bulgaria is on the black sea bass in its borders Romania\nMacedonia Serbia do yet is Greece and turkey right and the southern ... the southern guy slide and the accord or this now under construction starts in the Caspian Sea at Azerbaijan passes through the ... through Georgia\nAnd then crosses through turkey\nOr and through turkey it must hit Bulgaria that's why I'm Talking to the ambassador these that's the interconnected part but after Bulgaria the possibilities are mug many first of all the possibilities to go through Greece across the ... under the Iranians see to\nItaly and southern Europe but you're also saying that these guys can connect to the Balkans and slow in Eastern Europe as well as I understand that so it can go in many directions from Bulgaria\nYeah absolutely and in fact the southern gas coded or that we've been talking about is um the one that stretches up from the Caspian Sea is a right to ... percent across a Georgia and turkey but then ah\nFrom time to stop it turns into top uh from\nTurkey to Greece obey any entity but\nUh we the connector I'm Talking about is a new one it is a it is not being built yet and they sent their connector a connects Greece from basically tap Greece to Bulgaria that is that's very interesting project to key one because they brought in not only as I said full Bulgaria\nNow as such but if all the entire region because it increases predictability a supply and it provides additional opportunities for for a wider\nBecause he ... to benefit from this resources\nAnd Bulgaria needs energy to grow all countries need energy to grow and it's not\nObvious where they're going to gain that except from well there are competitors ... there's Russian gas and there's a Caspian Sea guests and it's good to have multiple choice so this relationship the strategic relationship between Bulgaria\nAnd as about John makes sense for energy what about the military cooperation how does that were best at her\nWell as far as the military partnership is concerned about ... and in Port in NATO member and does it by John is a a one of key partners and our geography for NATO's partnership for peace program\nThat's why we are I'm very much closely cooperating will Bulgaria within NATO bilateral and of course within NATO given different training smell every um corporation and recently we hosted a huge exhibition another by John that symmetry affair the biggest in the region\nAnd it drew two hundred and twenty four companies from twenty nine countries\nEconomic environment because of the inflation that he that had come from the Nineteen seventies and the oil or the oil shocks and the Democratic party was very comfortable in control of Congress had been for thirty forty fifty years Laura\nA very good evening to you what does Nineteen eighty to show us about where we are in twenty Eighteen good evening\nGood evening John thanks so much for having me on well I Do think Nineteen eighty two is a fascinating year to go back and look at first of all we had a Republican president um who was facing his first midterm which is obviously where we are\nIn today's world in twenty team but what is also interesting about that year is that it is in fact the same group of Senate seats that were up that year that are also up this year so when we go back and we know that every senator served six\nYears in the Senate\nWhen we actually go back thirty six years from this year we get to Nineteen eighty two so this is the same classes of senators that are standing for election we also had essentially a new\nPresident who the country wasn't really certain about in fact his approval rating within the low forties that range between about forty one forty two percent\nAnd what you ended up having was a year where the president's party a lost twenty six seats in the house but they picked up one seat in the Senate\nAnd losing in the house the house did not change hands as I recall the ... the Democrats were comfortably in control but that those twenty six feet gave the Democrats decided advantage as you were going into eighty four\nThat's exactly right so what we're really talking about here is that the Democrats were already in control but with Reagan's when in Nineteen eighty he had had some coat tails and had brought 'em some Republicans with him\nYou saw the Republican I'm conference shrink um shrink by twenty six seats after eighty two and that made it really in some ways the reason why Ronald Reagan had to start working with Tip O'Neill\nUm was because it's forced them to find those compromises because he just didn't have enough\nOf even a minority and Congress to do a lot\nWith or four weeks to go we're doing political science here on the midterm uh twenty Eighteen someday forty years hence someone will have this conversation about twenty Eighteen P. C. right they're fine we're going to divide it into pieces the house that we've been addressing right now and the Senate\nPost capital because that looks to be the event of the moment although the hurricane surrounding us and that could change the vote in significant states like Florida and Georgia a law\nIn the house of representatives right now I have not seen and I have not heard from conversations any significant change in the house races that are most at issue which would be the suburban districts\nWhere the district went from Mrs Clinton over over Donald Trump but it has a Republican representative at this moment\nHave you seen a cabin or change in those districts\nNo I think if anything what we're seeing is that sort of more of those college educated white women in the suburbs um I think\nThe cabinet situation help them make up their mind and mostly help them make up their mind against the Republican Party um if you look at some of the underlined data what\nHas been most fascinating to me and the recent polls is it it appears as though the to swing groups now in the actual electorate are\nI'm college educated white men\nThey are now split essentially um I think the last poll I saw said forty nine forty nine between the two parties in terms of which party they favor\nAnd I'm white blue collar women um who are still leaning Republican I'm forty nine to forty five but are much closer than they were when I'm Trump was elected in\nTwenty sixteen so what we have right now is that the white college educated women have moved more decisively into the Democratic camp the\nUm blue collar white men are decisively in the Republican camp but there I'm sort of spouses and mates and friends are not\nNow we go to the numbers that I had over the last week I have had twenty three losses which is the best case for the Republicans and thirty three losses which would give control to Nancy Pelosi do you see anything in that range Lara from your information\nWell I Do think we're probably starting up more toward the thirty five or I'm forty seats and the reason why I say that is right now if you look at the cook Political Report they've already raided\nFifteen Republican held seats as leaning democratic or the likely democratic\nSo if you're already starting with Fifteen before you even move to the twenty nine tossup seats\nThan it it starts to become pretty easy to\nGet above thirty because if you just assume that out of the twenty nine tossup seeds fourteen or Fifteen in other words half of those are going to go democratic\nAnd then you add them to the Fifteen that are already there you're already it's thirty\nAnd that doesn't even include the twenty five Republican held seats that are leaning Republican but are certainly I'm more up for grabs\nSo I I Do think one of the things that makes this different than Nineteen eighty two is that our um parties and our country has sorted more and the polarization is much more real and\nIt's also true that Republicans hold many more seats and they held in Nineteen eighty two and that in and of itself makes them more vulnerable\nAnd the fat imagine I Want to go to the police that it was just going to say so I imagine\nWhat you're looking at is something more like thirty five forty seats rather than twenty six\nIn the Senate much more difficult post capital we hear stories the momentum I certainly see the test or is a toss up\nUh the strength was clear when you saw a mansion vote for a for Kavanaugh that secures him in West Virginia\nMcCaskill in the high camp became under question but the places that I'm paying attention to our Tennessee where we've seen good numbers for black burning these last days and Florida where we've seen good numbers for Nelson\nSo right now in Nineteen eighty two they're Republicans picked up one feed is that credible for you to pick up a won the with the numbers we're seeing now\nI wouldn't be surprised if it ends up being a plus two or maybe even a plus three but a lot of and that would be a net gain um because a lot of that ends up being how do those two open seats\nReally do land I don't know that we have an understanding of which way Arizona's going or which way Tennessee it's going\nI think there's also kind of the wild card about Texas um just because they said or has been such a strong candidate he has raised 'em as much if not more money than I'm Ted Cruz at this point\nAnd I do think that there is some difficulty for Senator Ted Cruz in turning out\nTrump supporters because of the contentiousness at the primary that they had in twenty sixty\nLara Brown of George Washington university for weeks to go today minute ... through a barbecue today my new son and I threw a barbecue there were burgers and chicken I burn

that will be recognizable to\nNeal block a in block be they're looking for a way out and they see\nIn the springtime and in the summertime and through the end of the fall before winter closes there's a rice field or near a block be how is it that they come to decide on a tunnel from block be\nWell they they attempted many ways out they as soon as they got into the camp in in the fall Nineteen Seventeen they ... and tried to figure out a way to numerous attempts to get out jumping fences\nBreaking the wall nothing works riding out in the garbage bin ... um you know any number of\nUh of perplexing content and they ultimately decide that a tunnel was really the only way to get out from underneath a these three series of of of walls and so they begin um but first they need a place to start the tunnel\nAnd in block be uh there were some stairwells that went down to the sellers and there was a partition wall that sort of blocked out underneath the stairwell arguably show that prisoners couldn't jump out at the guards coming down the steps but what it became was this perfect entry point\nA hidden underneath the stairwell where they could start a tunnel through the wall and then to the closest the um field\nThe officers are taking the title but there are um soldiers allied soldiers president who are orderly who are treated as servants are Batman and the Germans do not regard them as suspicious so our officers masquerade as as orderly is that how they get actually it is because black\nThese ... are divided into an officer section an orderly section and this there was a new orderly section so they need to recruit some orderly to help them provide uniforms and then the officers a change in a room walk\nAcross the yard go into the orderly quarters go down the steps go through this fake wall that they engineer or to tap open enclosed at a seamlessly so it couldn't be discovered to begin to talk\n[noise] yes and they see the rice fields and they know that as

with them because of the order of laser caught there'll be ...\nCorrect I mean if you were an orderly and you were caught escaping I it was it\nWas in many ways the death sentence because you would then be sent to a coal mine or salt mine or other rather work camp a that was very brutal uh ended life expectancy life expectancy at those cancers sometimes worse than the front\nRafts foreign is

Canadian officer named ... on a who was a six foot six feet tall um and just a monster of an individual I Can't imagine um him trying to take this tunnel which was so small that you could barely even raise yourself up on your elbows right\nNow everybody has a feeling of claustrophobia and every time I watched the great escape I have that feeling there was a wonderful twilight zone episode was about a tunnel where that meant got stuck on the title and that was the scary and that nobody knew how to get him out that's about to happen\nThey start the tunnel and what you said Eighteen by fourteen an oval shaped\nYes an oval shaped tunnel I'm Eighteen by sixteen inches yeah\nAnd they're digging with what what are their till they're\nDigging with whatever they can get their hands on and
