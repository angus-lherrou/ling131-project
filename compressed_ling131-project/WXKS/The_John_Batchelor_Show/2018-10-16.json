current Afghan government is illegitimate but in June two thousand Thirteen when the top on open this office\nIs the Americans watched in horror as all just zero had its cameraman you know steady in at the ready to watch as this office was opened the ... the first thing they did John was they unfurled a big banner that read Islamic emirate of Afghanistan and that was a big problem in the eye of the Afghan government and us\nSaying no we consider ourselves to be the only true representatives Afghanistan that Afghan government is illegitimate and they have never come off that message wants and so what's what's striking about all this is that\nThe U.S says publicly any way that our goal for the talks as they get the top on to reconcile with the current Afghan government well how can they do that when they very consistently through the years have said the current Afghan government as illegitimate it's a puppet of the Americans and we're the really the real old only real game in town\nThe memory and Vietnam crowd in here forgive me Tom I'm older and so this is the boomer fiasco to review a there are analogies there are mismatch as as well one that comes to me immediately\nIs that the Taliban leadership will not negotiate or to ride Ashraf Ghani the president of Afghanistan and these dialogue looks as if ... is not represented in any fashion the Taliban wants to negotiate directly with the Americans that's a great victory for the Taliban at the beginning\nWell you're exactly right John and that's the whole that's the whole point here is that they're using these negotiation\nDirectly with the U.S to try and drive a wedge between us and the Afghan government and this was this causes a lot of embarrassment an added to the tensions with atomic cars like when he was president\nSeveral years ago when the bomb mission try this because there were so many problems that arose out of it was embarrassing for Karzai and his government now of course ... puts his characters are all sorts of problems there but this was you know he's still nominally our ally and to basically engage in these direct talks with a tub on\nIn a manner that sort of offensive to his legitimacy of sovereignty is very problematic and there is a sort of a with this time around that same thing which is sort of which again is a problem\nNow again the the the dish junk here is the U.S is saying that the Taliban needs to come to the table and reconcile in some fashion with the current Afghan government\nThe ... says the Afghan government is illegitimate we're not going to do that well what's the point of the talks if the central go all the talk from the American side is something the Taliban is saying is just not doable and that's really the central question here as we move forward\nA wise man much taught me that everything has a price do we know what the Taliban's prices in dollars and cents are they looking at a large transfer of cash in some fashion the way the north Vietnamese and the Viet Cong finally negotiated\nYou know I I Want to be very careful I have to speculate here because we really don't know what their prices and all this and again you know their prices going is influenced by the fact that they smell a desperate negotiator on the other side of the table so they realize that we're desperate to get out and they're looking to extract more concessions just as they get in the past they use these past negotiations\nTo extract all sorts of concessions from the American side without really giving anything up in return and I think you know there there are some different ways that this ... this could play out\nIt could be the case of dog was not willing to give us much of anything um or could be that they're willing to grant is sort of some sort of withdraw timetable for Afghanistan and the price of that could be for example that several provinces that are are firmly under the ... way now I'm basically are untouched as the U.S withdraws basically giving them\nA de facto safe haven as the U.S leaves and then therefore they can use that of course once we're out of there to basically start consuming and taking over more Afghanistan once again\nIt may be that sort of that sort of arrangement\nUm it was a big things keep an eye on your to John is at the U.S has bag the top on for years to renounce al ... and of course they won't do it they haven't done it yet\nAnyway and in all these years the Taliban has refused issue even just a generic statement her announcing all ... and there's there are a lot of reasons for that one of which is that there's plenty of evidence kind of the tub on her main closely allied to this day\nAnd that's deeply problematic here because remember all kinds of the organization is still alive it's you know it's lost ... lost a lot of its top leaders but there's still a very much into a kind of organization in Afghanistan Pakistan it's fighting and they definitely have one eye on us\nYes in the close of your piece that and you have limited amount to much of time I understand that but you suggest that a Taliban aggrandize by direct negotiations with the U.S let's hypothetical\nAh taking the U.S promises in some fashion becomes the the nucleus of a of an average that so why are you can use throughout the throughout Asia spreading into the subcontinent reading damage\nOn you know ... his argument I'm also hearing okay to argue that the Islamic emirate Afghanistan as the ...\nIs the nucleus of a new caliphate so remember this has been totally misunderstood\nThere are a lot of people even in the ... field who have said well kind of doesn't really want to seize territory build a cow that nonsense you can go through their literature through the years they're very clear that there are all to Michael and what ... saying is that the Islamic ever Afghanistan is the nucleus or the crown jewel of this new imagine\nThe law he signed on to that that she is that he's identified says\nThat his argument that they'll cut his argument that was Osama bin Laden's argument and so this is something that could easily have ramifications for outside Afghanistan\nAnd does the American side ... or the Trump Administration acknowledge that that is that suits a lottery to negotiate directly with his ... his agents\nWould only be blunt John I talked to a lot of American officials um I don't think it's widely recognized inside the U.S government at all with all kinds of positions on this and I think there's been a lot there's been a very large incentive to downplay or dismiss the kite angle on all this why because it's very inconvenient to sort of justifying this sort of\n... and wouldn't look up to say the U.S retreats from that al ... yes no that that's not acceptable by your making the case here that's why he has been outspoken with his ambition\nAnd by refusing to negotiate with ... with with the ... the president of Afghanistan that is what they're putting together they're putting together a ... endorsed by the United states of America\n[noise] yeah I mean there well the the crown jewel of the nucleus of that would be endorsed by the name ISIS America certainly because that's basically we're saying that the top on stage is legitimate\nUm by ... granting them this I mean you know when you look at all kinds of Afghanistan today John we do our analysis based on multiple different sources\nPrimary sources of based on what kind of saying us raids Afghan rates you know who they go to target where these guys are where they're fighting remember the reporting out of guys in the early this year job where you had all these foreign fighters they were mixed in with the tall bond there were there were part of this large scale solving God's either ...\nOf all kinds of presents there's all sorts of data like this out there to sort of sift through well we've been saying oh we're ... consistently is that a lot of people in the

J. are the great but the great lakes joins man we're welcoming Gordon Chang\nOf the Daily Beast we're going to move\nThrough several anecdotes about the Chinese Communist party these days were puzzled by these and take sleep diet because here to for over the last ten years Gordon I've been talking about\nThe Chinese Communist party's diplomat they are black they are peaceful rise they hang in the background in fact an anecdote from\nFrom the twentieth century when the KGB followed Chinese diplomats in Moscow or Leningrad cause they routinely followed everybody back in the old Soviet days\nThat was the best suited to have because the Chinese diplomats were so boring predictable and never went anywhere did anything interesting and so everybody wanted the Chinese Communist party detail if you're going to learn how to travel people around Moscow\nToday I imagine it's very difficult to follow them\nGarden a very good evening to you tantrum tantrum tantrum worthy of preschool from senior Chinese official last week we spend a deal of time talking about how ... the foreign minister had chastised Mike Pompeo in public on deservedly cell but the part was the part that was interesting\nWas that ... acted as in Iran a tab stamping funny throwing thing and I puzzled about it and you said well here he is\nThis is why this is so extraordinary they're frustrated but now I see other officials imitating weighing eighty or imitating some model what has happened in court and why are they acting this way these are diplomat good evening she gotten\nGood evening John and that is I think they're really two reasons\nFirst of all I think China really is frustrated a lot of things are not going it's way and so the Chinese are just not used to it for their confounded by the situation\nUm second of all um and this is a background reason but it does explain the behavior of Chinese officials\nAnd that is that a sea jumping just demands maximum position\nAnd so people have to demonstrate their loyalty and the demonstrating the loyalty is to either going after Americans or jailing um leakers at an unprecedented case or whatever\nTo show that they are on board with these programs now she's programs are really likeable I think a lot of Chinese officials understand that there are not in China's interest\nCertainly the Chinese people don't like many of these but that's what the demands and so while he is still in control they're going to do what he requires\nThat is a garden are there any problems within China itself bitter exacerbating the pension from the tantrums Communist Party officials\n[noise] well I think that the the part of the problem or is that when things don't go well I'm you know if you go back six seven months or so ago um\nEverything was going China's way um and so I think Chinese officials just got a little bit flabby in a sense and that's understandable um because they had been bullying people and people had been actually doing what they want and that includes not only countries that are small but also large countries like the United states\nFrom you know but Trump decided that he had enough of that and so he's pushed back I I actually think that you know you're starting to see real problems in the economy\nAnd and that is really something that is concerning the Chinese um you have for instance drops in auto sales consumption all the rest of it that really nobody foresaw I'm just a few months\nTo go ... let's let's turn this a little bit and talk about the Chinese economy because you've written about and most recently the national interests\nOr the pocketbook issues drive our politicians when the economy is bad there is no place to hide although they try especially at election time I'm going to guess at the Chinese are exactly the same\nAs the United states except that they don't have election time may have one party all the time you publish that what we have here is a damning Chinese J. D. pay going forward and strengthening American GDP\nThat's not supposed to happen now she has the long game does he have this short game does he understand that this is a cycle and that he can take a recession and\nRecover from it yeah actually I don't think that they want a recession they don't believe that they can accept one so they're continuing to pour on debt and you know something which is really worrying China got a lot of praise over the last three or four years over climate\nUm they've made certain climate promises people put it on but we are now starting to see that there are increased use of coal I'm more missions more CFCs going into the air and that's largely because they're really pushing the factories to produce\nSo we're seeing I think um some very short term thinking because they just don't know if they can get to the other side of this you know Trump is confounded American politicians well of course he's confounding the Chinese they don't know what to do they don't know how long the quote unquote trade wars going to last\nAnd so they're pulling out all the stops and it looks like a little bit of panic on the part of senior Chinese technocrats\nThat is part of the problem with\nCommunist Party has said that liberty is the enemy of prosperity and security and so when there is any kind of recession or any kind of economic downturn and they're going to do everything they can include including their own their own country to try to avoid that aren't they\nYeah well they certainly are and and the bigger backdrop which we've talked about before is that the June ... ah in his term is general secretary so we're now talking about six years has really started to\nTurn his back on on the things that may China's economy pop you know it it's reforming opening up our are no longer the by words today we're closing the economy down over there they're going back to state dominated markets and state determination of prices\nSo you know at this particular time um this looks really bad because it shows that um this is the way that ... thinks\nIt's going to emit they might be able to do a little bit of short term getting through it by determining markets but they can't really have a long term solution here and you know you're absolutely right this is I think the inevitable result of communism see jumping is not an aberration he's the inevitable result of China's Communist system\n[noise] but anyway but yes I think a\nA this ... this is clearly a you know a warning a and I think we're seeing two divergent patch or you know the last June prejudice or June of two thousand Seventeen\nA President Trump and president moon agreed on ... ... pressure and engagement as the policy and we saw that execute for the last year but now that South Korea had three ... inch ... were ... and ... ... ... ... ...\nJust middleman them know that the nuclear program or South Korea or wants to engage in maximum engagement\nDavid just a moment I Want to check with Gordon on this uh Gordon\nThe concern that you've had for some time about these summits the first one and now the proposed second one is that Seoul is is taking advantage of it or is weakening faster than the conversation permits\nIt's so it's still being driven by another concern gardeners Beijing behind this weakening of sanctions by a prospect of commercial enterprise\nWants the sanctions to be weekend because they've talked about this in public but what's really driving event here John is not so much the Chinese but it's ... yeah\nI'm ... number one goal matter of fact is number one to number one hundred goal is unification of the two Korean states so he's doing everything possible to help Kim Jong on\nHe's very pro North Korea his advisors in there you were advocating the overthrow of the south Korean state by North Korea so right now you got a political establishment and so that really is very pro Kim I'm very anti US\nDavid David the concern here is that there's something sinister is there or is this just along frustrated trail of reuniting the Korean Peninsula or how how to regard this from a great distance\nWell it's either it's either sinister orange naivete and I think that uh that Kim Jong ... I mean the ... in one piece at any cost and I think that that is really is driving a Porsche is that he wants peace and he wants to be the one to bring peace to the Korean Peninsula\nThe problem is he is making South Korea vulnerable uh in his idea of maximum engagement of course we'll go against the sanctions are in will actually could potentially strengthen North Korea\nOr in show whether he he wants to unify with North Korea under North Korea's control which I don't think he does a I think he is has the misguided belief\nThat if he engages with with Kim Jong ... and he like President Trump believes that he can trust Kim Jong il and that's where I think they're both making the mistake 'cause I don't think Kim Jong Eun and be trusted a show he is embarking on maximum engagement and\nTo go back to the earlier a editorial that you started with a United States has got to enforce sanctions and if South Korean banks are providing financial uh services to the north they may be violating sanctions the warning\nYes the editorial goes on guard and now I'm ... I'm ... this this is the editorial on October Fifteen from so these incidents clearly showed that the U.S now regard to stop the south Korea\nAs the weakest link among its allies international sanctions against North Korea that justified Gordon\nSome ways I think that it is John I mean one can argue about the Chinese or the Russians or whatever but you know Moon Jae in is definitely very pro North Korea and I hope Dave is right that he's just naive instead of malevolent\nUm but he's acting you know if he were malevolent um he'd be doing exactly what he's doing now so I don't think it really matters what his intentions are it's just that\nUm what he's doing is under cutting the American efforts to um denuclearize North Korea [noise] we've seen Moon Jae in actually become ... spokesman um that started in March and continued now uh every time we\nYou're about something favorable about Kim Jong when it comes from ... in this is extremely worrying John\nWhat about the Europeans David are they getting ahead of this as well I note in this editorial it talks about France and it also mentions the IMF in the world bank\nBeing asked to play and play an active role so is is the U.S going to be in a position the way it is say with Iran negotiating directly with our allies not to aid a sanctions Arab state\nBut I think this is yes we are becoming isolated because uh again that's Gordon said Moon Jae in is reaching out\nAnd he's made the statement that the international community really needs to reward North Korea recognizing it for the pledges that it's made and we should keep in mind North Korea has done nothing of substance\nOr indicated sincerity to dismantle its nuclear program but again a Moon Jae in is reaching out uh and of course the French said that they would certainly assist in denuclearizing\nShould North Korea do that and of course in addition to being the mouthpiece and spokesman for Kim Jong il a Moon Jae in is also becoming the messenger because he intends to deliver a letter to the pope inviting him to pee on young\nGarden you have a question for David\nDavid I'm six months from now do we impose sanctions on South Korean banks of the south Korean government to on South Korean enterprises for violating sanctions\nWell I I certainly hope not because we must step back and remember that the you know there is going to be no success on the Korean Peninsula oh without a strong rock us alliance and so we I think this is a warning to South Korea\nDon't do this but we really have to uh to work on a lion's mane management uh and and rebuild a some of the bridges and some of the fissures are that are are are appearing in the alliance this is really important\nI and I think the United states has being proactive in giving this warning so that we don't have to a sanction them because that would be a terrible blow to the alliance and of course means right into Kim Jong il launched\nA desire to split the rock us alliance a divide and conquer divide the alliance to conquer the rock\nWhat's this look like David a best case scenario from ... to ... to government could do governments one peninsula did they have a working working planned in mine or are they just smiling\nWell that's long been a proposed by many past leaders are certainly by the north I I Believe that the north proposal to have a one country two systems is really a to support its support it's a version of the south and eventually dominate the south\nI think those in the south who believe that there can be a one country two governments are that can gradually unify\nI think that is the ... that exists there is no end of the nuclear program there is no end of the crimes against humanity as long as the Kim family regime exist there really needs to be a United Republican Korea\nThat secure stable economically vibrant non nuclear and organized under a constitutional liberal constitutional form of democracy determined by the south Korean people eight nine ...

headline Elizabeth Warren disappointed after DNA tests truth zero trace of presidential power\nYes yes uh what where I did see the Cherokee Nation rising up there's a detail here that's important Elizabeth Warren in the past claimed connection to a great American tragedy a great American crime that the trail of tears\nThese people were were robbed by by Andrew Jackson and the U.S Congress they were thrown into a migration that's left them without good options in the unsettled part the frontier that we now call Oklahoma\nVis vis fast was vouch safe not only by the president of the United

the Native Americans did they call a so called Indians were wards of the state and they remain wards of the states so I Do not believe Elizabeth Warren wanted to wander into this\nAnd have to explain

equally despise uh she just reminded everybody I mean that there's just no way around this there's no way out of this and the best thing she could do is protect her\nEye to remind everyone who wasn't with us in the twentieth century uh to to to follow the partisan politics\nThe Democratic party rationalized Bill Clinton's abuse of Lewinsky by saying that she was an adult and these were adult decisions and it was none of our business because it didn't affect his presidency John\nAh has the Democratic party found a way to square the circle are they just going to ah they just got a leftist spin out in the next cycle and certain Democrats will campaign against Bill Clinton is that how they're going to resolve this\nWell the culture warriors of the view program at ABC who died in the wool liberal I'm addicts have decided to curl Hillary over the side and say let's just not listen to her anymore uh I Wish it were so simple because Hillary Clinton as one hundred percent name

we do today it was any send them and he was high a column that it was probably used to in another place and then moved to this location where they also found what they believe was a pottery a factory\nMaybe for people entering a Jerusalem it but it was certainly a maybe originally using that Jewish crafts and building and it has the name\nOf the I'm a non yes some of those are less uh and the name was inscribed on part of a Roman structured during the first century bc\nOr which was found in it earlier excavation ... before they pave the road at the convention center so ah the ah the

Revolution that we're a bit disgusted the parliamentarians ends and made England fear so that they became\nResentful of anybody speaking of what's it called leveling there were also a moments in the American revolution and the American civil war where the English Crown found it easy to preach to the people that that is these are radicals or not to be accepted\nIn any in in any civilized place but Burke had an observation\nOf what was the what was the driver for the depravity in the French Revolution and what was the driver for the disorder and violence in the American revolution how did he explain it to his parliament as he addressed and Peter\nWell he addressed that many he address them and uh what started as a letter to a young man in Paris who could not understand why Edmund Burke the grey wig quit the friend is all of that all of her career had defended freedom explaining to the young men wacky Burke was not on the side of the French revolutionary\nBecause the French revolutionaries Burke argued for the first time in human history [noise]\nThought a kind of revolution that was theoretical in dogmatic aimed not only at changing who governed instead of the king\nThat people let's say it aimed at changing opinions\nReligious faith\nCost them and so on it's thought to be Burke called it a quote total revolution and this he said represented a new one ... threat to three to freedom because freedom depended in significant measure on inherited customs inherited\nTraditions the Brits were ah Burke said men of quote now and taught feelings I taught feeling\nDidn't mean they were crude and vulgar he meant they didn't have to go to college in graduate school to learn how to live a life for freedom because their traditions taught them how to live a life suitable for free men\nAnd I I Want to translate this and other because birth didn't have the word he saw the French Revolution is a threat to freedom yeah as a threat as and we would use the word totalitarianism today yeah\nAnd he didn't have that word but he feared what he saw which was a transformation of the French a tradition a transformation of in into something that was violent and dictatorial and he rejected it quite quite different from how we saw the American revolution how did he hold the American revolution\nOh yes I Am quite right and I I I'd like to underscore your point on while he didn't have the word he clearly had the concept and mother of\nA totalitarianism total revolution while the French revolutionaries did not have the technology that would allow them to monitor monitor people in their homes they certainly have the aspiration\nShared by totalitarian of the twentieth century even remake human nature and of course the American revolution was fundamentally different the American revolution was we would say today and I think accurately and broke understood this very much you could call it a conservative revolution in what's at\nThe American revolutionaries were not attempting to change dog much change religious faith chains custom and tradition quite to the contrary they thought to preserve the way of life\nThat they had that brought over from England and the seventeenth century Burke warned of this in Seventeen Seventy five he said he said to a he said the parliament those Americans actually they don't have a legal right\nTo be represented in debates about taxation imposed upon them but you're never going to be able to convince them of that because they're too much infused with quote again that fear love of liberty\nClose quote which they get from being British But then having that are energized by being three thousand miles away\nSo the Americans were preserving a way of life from what they regarded at the abuse of power by ah by the British king and in fact\nThe Americans introduced the constitution that was designed to keep government limited so actually fit and could continue to live the traditional way of life or we should say if they wish to break with tradition\nA matter of conscience they were also free to do so under the American constitution\nI Want to I Want to go over a detail here Burke was inheriting a tradition that he's English yeah and the tradition was hard fought from the sixteenth century through the seventeenth century to the glorious revolution through Cromwell to the glorious revolution and I've recently been reading Peter there's a new book\nA young Benjamin Franklin in which the author Nick bunker takes us back just sixteenth century England when the first of the lord start partition up the land and taking away arable land and grazing land from the from the ... from the peasants\nAnd make them a wage slaves said they're imposing a kind of slavery on the people who resent it will revolt and that rubble takes a hundred years but we come to John Locke and the early shows berry and the glorious revolution all that transformation that tradition that Bert takes for granted\nThat data he's inherited over a hundred years that's a tradition that our forebears came to America to speak for themselves and I've often had I've had it wrong my whole life America didn't invent this tradition we inherited it from our English for bears\nI I think that John that formulation is a exactly right I only quibble with ... one small prey type said a burp took it for granted in a way ... took part it took for granted until the\nFrench Revolution then he saw the tradition which he knew to be the source of his freedom was under with under profound threat and so that's how that gives birth to what we now call modern conservatism wedding and heritage or of this English tradition of freedom\nSees the rising a direct threat\nFrom off the within the tradition the French Revolution to freedom and their began the great and recurring challenge for those of us devoted to freedom which is to somehow reconcile the claims of individual liberty and tradition\nYes we we we

was a situation in the state of\nIllinois where they put a ban on women working the majority opinion said there'd been recent cases about privileges and immunities which indicate that\nThe federal constitution does not give protection to women um who wants to enter into these occupations\nUm and so therefore the cases out and this was probably an incorrect reading of the stature of the constitutional prohibitions but take it and then there was one judge who in concurrence\nBasically announced that the national biological condition of women was such that it was perfectly appropriate to keep them in the home domesticity became not only virtue by the legal requirement to\nWhich the obvious answer is if you open up the markets and more women want to go when they do currently there they will do so men want to go and they will do so it turns out or if you actually look at the way these markets are organized today this free entry and exit but this by no means\nAnd the density of men and women in all kinds of places in all kinds of firms in the law and the same thing is pretty much true in every other occupation\nAh within medicine within ... within science there always tend to be sub specialty is heavily female in the heavily male\nAnd these numbers have been roughly constants or the last twenty or Thirty years so unless there's some major\nLegal course they're not going to switch suit\nMahler against Oregon is an ironic case it was from\nTo Nineteen oh wait and the man who wrote the brief\nUpholding the statute which had a minimum wage law for women only was none other than Louis Brandeis who was probably the most prominent lawyer in the United states at that time it was I thought a dreadful briefed that he wrote a buddy persuaded one of the conservative judges a man named ruler um to uh basically to\nUphold that statute instead of strike it down in that particular case all the women who were hired were fired and replaced with um Chinese workers so it wasn't as though it did them a lot of good and then the long run most women rightly in my view of come to the conclusion that sex linked um minimum wage laws are flatly unconstitutional\nOf course of what it is that they do this so what was the heroic advance in Nineteen oh eight\nTurns out to be a constitutional on par nibble offense today\nWhich indicates just how strange in a funeral all these issues are open up the markets certainly but does that mean parity in every position\nNo because the available pool was not based upon the number of people in the United states by sex which is what Jerry Brown thinks about it's obviously going to be dependent upon the number of people have the kind of qualifications it unique forgiven kinds of jobs\nAnd who knows what that is a but the one thing that is quite certain and many advocates for women on boards agree with this point is that the last person who knows what to do about this is the state of California and it turns out that it's really complicated if you have\nA poor people on board and they want to add a fifth of all of a sudden they have to have two women that means you've got to go to six but once you're six you have to go three women so now you're at seven and it's very difficult to fill seats on boards and if you're going to try and\nFill hundreds of seats literally on major public corporations with a group of women and then you're going to face the other question can you have a sex only\nRule here and wound acknowledge that this was a constitutional difficulty but\nThe wages that you're going to pay for the men and for the women are going to have to defer a because the men essentially are not going to be in the same demand is the limit is it'd be a very strong demand for the query and can you buy sects used different wages so the companies may be completely box spin and most people say oh my God was aboard you put people on because of specific\nAreas of expertise and it may be that there are many many women with MBA's an advanced degrees\nBut the question is you know something about a particular form of solar energy development and if you don't you're not the kind of person that you need for that particular board and we do know that you know for example if you look in applicants and schools\nDo social work eighty five to eighty eight percent of the albums tend to be female you'd do naval architecture it's over Ninety five percent male so the sex declaration begins very early on and it works its way up through the decision tree to boards of directors\nOf Richard ... is there any indication anywhere from the empty I studied the one I'm reference before\nA is there indication there is are there metric to demonstrate that parity such as California is recommending would grow the economy would lead to prosperity ... I haven't seen anybody able to come up with a study that demonstrate that\nWell they purport to do so the number the size of the game that they claim which is roughly twenty six percent of the economy priests opposes that women\nUm oh ... did was to break down all the rules of comedy all the rules of customs there's nothing in the constitution which\nSays one Supreme Court must have nine justices\nBut from the civil war on it's always been\nThat way and everybody's respected that rule any unilateral deviation from that rule by either party is an open invitation for disaster retaliation and so forth and it will blow the company up as far as I'm concerned\nSo I regard this as well dangerous an irresponsible but I'm constantly challenged by people to come to baseless with me because\nThese people are so angry about the capital issue\nThat they really are willing to blow up the machine in order to get even with what they regard\nLet it go unless I go to number two the recommendation and I've heard Gerald ... who is the if if the Democrats control the house of representatives slated to be the chairman of the Judiciary Committee speak of impeaching justice Kavanaugh is that a practical thing well regarded\nAs a very dangerous suggestion\nIf you're talking about the situation in a nomination for the Supreme Court but the advice and consent function of the Senate the Democrats have a perfect right to vote against capital for any reason on and on and so you don't care about burden of proof\nIndeed all the Democrats who were convinced that misplaced before it was correct were also adamantly opposed him before you go into an ... it's a criminal trial and all of a sudden they really are due process rules and there are examinations and all sorts of other things and to somebody to sort of announced that you're\nGoing to do and impeachments situation means that they have to assume that they were right on the particular case and it seems to me that the reason the NY voted not change is that the uncorroborated clams on the one son did not stand up after\nMultiple FBI investigations and not only\nThe denial by justice ... uh but by all the corroborating evidence that was introduced on his son I regard this as a terrible idea it will simply keep things worse and it will try to create a stain on the court I thought the best thing that happened or the other day is when he was sworn in\nAll eight other justices of the Supreme Court came to the ceremony if one of them had been absent it would've been a terrible signal about the legitimacy of this\nAnd I think in effect what happens is\nEverybody should accept the appointment justice cabinet oh I think made a serious mistake in the way and when she got so angry although I forgive\nHim for that but I think going forward what we have to do is to get all this and everybody has to behave as though that never happened and that includes a justice cabinet she cannot sort of try to take this out on anybody knowing everything I Know about his character not personally but from other people\nI think he's up to that task\nConstitutional overhaul that can take many faces let's say that the president no longer has authority to appoint a Supreme Court justice and it's passed off to Congress or other recommendations as well or is it very unlikely we'd overhauled the constitution but it is to just it as a remedy to uh the Kavanaugh unhappiness\nWell the two things one it'd be an absolute me late to sort of assume that the Congress gets to pick somebody without a nomination the process of nomination with advice and consent for principle offices into our judges has been with us for many years it's obviously\nA political process but things are worse the important constitutional change which I Am in favor of making is to make these appointments for term of say Eighteen years Fifteen Years right\nTerm limited next recommendation term limiting it\nHave defended that for many many years I think it's absolutely critical\nThere is a factor in the United states all article three judges as they're called have lifetime terms so now when we create a specialized tribunal there is an enormous resistance on the part of everybody to make them article three judges it's much more efficient to put them in a bankruptcy court and so forth\nWhich has a fourteen or Fifteen your trip we should make that the\nConstitutional norm I had a recent discussion with Jeff Rosen an Adam lift tack on that and Adam who's from the New York times and I disagree on many things but we were one on that particular propose\nAnd term limits ... ... is there a number that they talk about Richard that everybody's Fifteen\nTo Eighteen years you don't want it to be a short his political appointments but you don't want it to be so long or the other restriction which I'm In favor of is getting people out at seven eight I'm saying this when I'm Seventy five so I'm now barred\nFor life but I Do think what you want to do is to make sure that you don't get these generational shift in fact I Believe the same thing is true for the Senate and the house the libertarians always used to say three in the in the house at six years and two in the Senate I thought that was much too short\nWhen I'm In favor of something like ten in the house in four in the Senate or twenty and twenty four years I think there's something deeply wrong with the process when the head of two committees based on seniority about eighty five years old trying to figure out the way in which the future should do I thought Grassley behave admirable I cannot say the same\nThing about Senator Feinstein and will not but if you're thinking about this is a process you do not want people at that age taking dominant positions in the United states if they're still vigorous they can do all sorts of things in the private sector but incumbency is not a rapid or sensible road but figuring out the way in which we govern this country\nAnd finally the McConnell rule which Mr McConnell is called the Biden role this is to suggest that in the final year of president said the nomination wait for the people to vote before the new president or the continued president make the choice\nIs that a recommendation that could be institutionalized\nIt's already there this is something which you don't need to do by legislation um let me go back and say what I thought about the McConnell decision backed is respected Merrick Garland point number one is gone with a perfectly qualified judge a judge of some genuine distinction and a great deal of affection by everybody who knew\nThere was no issue about quality whatsoever and uh that\nPoints just should not have come up but\nOn the other hand it was very clear not withstanding the fact that it was sixty three notwithstanding the fact that it was more conservative than the other four liberals on every major vote he would have switched essentially\nThe other side and that includes campaign financing it includes guns it includes affirmative action the whole ... an abortion now I think the Republicans should have said\nWe don't care about the next election we just don't want this guy and we think we want to keep this open\nAnd we lose the election then you get to a point Tim and somebody else I think candor would have been much better that Democrats were perfectly candid their attitude was if they had even\nA majority of fifty one forty nine there's no way they would have confirmed capital and the only grounds of objection that they would have made a what we don't want to switch it over and at that point they would have done something which I\nThank God the Republicans did namely that would not have had hearings at which point we would not have this terrible situation what happened this time around is the Republicans knew if they played it safe they don't win fifty one forty nine fifty two forty eight with Gorsuch it was fifty five forty five ... not going to get that the second time around\nWith Democrats knew they play it safe it's fifty one forty nine and they lose so they have to blow up the entire thing\nWhich is why long before we actually got to the sexual scandals involved in this case the Democrats were having\nPeople come into the courts they were having points to borders that were grandstanding in one form or another and keeping secret information which they laid a load on the ball and I think an effect that is what I regard as is not a not acceptable if they all of them in a house that day number one we will not vote for\nThis man right right because we dislike him I'd say thank you it's an understatement at which point I Would do the following thing I say good we don't have any need for Harry are you convinced you don't want him we're convinced that we do want him why do we want the craze if you do have a hearing I have another recommendation\nWhich ... go ahead try to never\nLet the candidate speak because oil do is you have people try to trap and had to make them appear insincere exhaust them in one thing or another the older practice was people could

men who lead America to war when the decision is made in early Nineteen Seventeen and the Congress votes to declare war against Germany I guess the Kaiser and come in on the ... the men who lead\nAmerica to war our college about another West Point or the ivy leagues and he goes along as a driver for the officers is in the summer of Nineteen Seventeen\nAnd yet there are many instances where it's revealed to the officers to the men will become flying officers as well\nThat ... has a skill with engines and he has a skill as a mechanism but they won't let him make the leap\nAnd that's important to understand about ... because that's his motives here\nShe is not just an ambitious young man I learned from you that he is crop he is trying to break in to\nThe dominant class in America and that's not allow\nAnd it burns it he keeps a close diary much of your book is based upon his right can you see it in his notes\nAbsolutely there is a moment you know he scraps to get overseas and he's going to fly right you just said that and what he's talking about out but he has to be a driver so they take one of the top you know race car drivers and what do they do there were chauffeur well\nHe transformed the bay no mechanical he gets along with everybody they say\nYou run you become the mechanical you become the engineer you put together America's new big airfield over there and you put together you take care of all the planes and building at an all like that um and but that's where you can do he says no no no I'll do that but I Need to fly\nHe gets over there and he is with all these Ivy League kids who've never met anybody like Edie Edie is a tough talking rough around the edges kind a guy who's now the chief\nEngineer at S. it in the American big American field or does he do with these Ivy League new flyers coming over and there are striding never stop there are going to debate war this is great stuff he puts them next to the German POWs with ten buckets on the

remember now she can do everything but he's regarded as the working class as an educated and America is flying cars going to be led cheaply by Harvard but by college graduate\nThat's not enough already and he is going to teach yourself to fly he has moments here where what you could say is that he's he's we're battling\nFrom class warfare itself which is destroying itself in the trenches by Nineteen Seventeen justice is a nightmare around do you don't have time and your telling of the very busy lives\nTo observe the fact that Eddie is outside of history at this point because history is a

it it's not self election he doesn't have a mentor\nOr he's frightened he's even he Asia fear of heights fear of flying by overcomes that you talk about his willpower what does he say it is in his notes how does he talk about his conscience\n[noise] you know he um is for the first six months of flying he's nauseous all the time I'll throw up as cockpit will come down to throw up is you know he has high problems you had an injury to wanted his eyes and an accident when he was a kid\nThat his left him you know with some depth perception problems this as a kid\nA young man who flying is not natural immediate you'd think oh it must have been natural it wasn't at all so this is where this willpower comes in he had the strength and the focus to get ...\nTrue it to be bothered and yet at the same time he was very clear about acknowledging that fear was an important thing to fear feel because people flyers who didn't have fear who weren't scared\nWe're going to die and they did in droves
