they make such a mistake to\nWell the calculation [noise] almost certainly is that the November of the midterms are going to be decided by\nTurnout Republicans Democrats and Republicans on either side and that um this anger at the cabinet or confirmation is animating a democratic voters\nUm but there is a cow sort of a ... a ... a simultaneous calculation about\nPeople who declare themselves as

that\nAnd some of us for instance the Senate Democratic Senate candidates that are in tight races like Heidi Heitkamp Joe Donnelly Joe mansion ah\nAnd the like um they had been trying to separate themselves and and change the subject from book went on around the cabin all the violence and demonstrations that went around it a surrounded the Kavanaugh's confirmation\nSo in other words I don't think that this is typical of the average democratic voter anymore\nWhat I suggest it on my column is that the national Democratic Party is being taken over by what I called the code bank laughed and

John bats are Pacific wash with Jeff list we go immediately to San Francisco Jeff the news that the streets of San Francisco are no longer acceptable is reached here in the east coast so that it becomes a routine feature however there's a new mayor\nAnd there's reason now for San Francisco compelling reason to clean up is it happening good evening to you John\nTierney John it continues to be a problem for San Francisco a problem if they just cannot get their hands around every time they think they're headed in the right path or a new problem pops up it's kind of like that'll whack a mole game\nBut the problem is now spreading outside the city in the sense that it's become a reputational threat to the city and we're already seeing\nConventions pullout from the city of those are huge money makers for the area we're seeing a other areas outside of the United states say maybe you don't want to go there any more for their uh you know to their national don't travel there it's not safe it's clean\nAnd unfortunately San Francisco which one time was really one of the most incredible cities are in California certainly not states\nUh is now being looked as kind of a sad joke and it's a it's one that you keep your repeated over and over it's seems to be on the front page of every\nPage every day in ... what's the worst part of the San Francisco just people listening to us if they need to go there for business what should they avoid Jeff for this street life we're not talking about violence in after dark we're talking about walking down the street and daylight what's the worst part\nYou would probably want to steer clear of areas around the six center and what they call the tender line which is kind of what wall people refer to as Skid Row type areas and then when you go down those streets it's a drug needles everywhere human waste everywhere\nAnd adult in daily life in the middle of the day ride but the but the police force parking but they don't do anything about what's happening on the sidewalk\nThat is the big complaint that they seem to have enough resources to write parking tickets and Jay walking tickets but not enough to stop the climate and the fills\nThe way we offset how bad it is in San Francisco as we raised immediately to the story of Los Angeles Jeff downtown Los Angeles I recall from my trips there and especially back in Ninety four during the year the quake\nDowntown Los Angeles is near the city center staple center and over to the train station was a replica of the ... and the ancient ... old California life with lots of tourists in restaurants and merchandise what's happened [noise]\nOlder street which was the center of that area you're talking about was a place where tourists would come or families would go on weekends where schools will take their kids on field trips to learn about California in Los Angeles as history it's heritage but now that has been changed because they put a whole new homeless shelter in the area\nPlus a continued growth of the homeless population the problems associated with a downtown\nSo you'd have tourists not visiting anymore you have merchants losing a lot of money you have schools pulling out these educational opportunities and some of these merchants or even a ... attempting to sue the city of Los Angeles saying why did you put it right here right we're trying to make money now you're scared everyone off this is what's happening in downtown LA\nMayor Garcetti is running for president I Believe is T because there's a new mayor in San Francisco but mayor Garcetti is extremely extremely practiced in managing the city is he responding\nHe's responding very lightly he says the right words but nothing seems to really happen that there's a problem with trash right now in a number of the downtown city areas where it it's piled up in some places five feet tall that's not an exaggeration\nAnd you have a you know farm and just coming out of the woodwork and so his response to that is all three hundred thousand dollars that\nFrankly the problem is in the millions just for the clean up the downtown area but that's about all he does is just for the for some money or that we're not seeing any long term plans for sanitation for homelessness for the woman problem\nIt's it we talked about this for a long time John but it really is getting worse it seems like it's it's like an exponential growth of these problems\nThese are the two big cities have California Jeff I think Los Angeles has a GDP that exceeds the planet Mars so their resources there to deal with it is there the will of just pick up the trash\nThere's the will to pick up the trash\nThat's exactly the problem is that the money is there are the resources there it's the will to get it done regardless of what they say\nWe've talked about type is on and off over these last month we got the fires took precedence for a while uh where is it ... and uh what can they do about it\nThe first big outbreak of type ... started down in the downtown area we're talking about\nAnd ... in Los Angeles in Los Angeles\nIn Los Angeles I'm Sorry [noise] and uh the outbreak is spreading because they believe that uh that homelessness and all the all the associated problems that go with that being cabinets down there are creating a lot of trash a lot of waste a lot of food scraps and then all of the animals all the rodents department that come in\nAnd it's tied to spread by fleas and now\nThis this outbreak is really threatening to become an epidemic it's moved out to Pasadena which is a very nice city it's the place where they had the annual Rose Parade every New Year's\nAnd its move west to Long Beach or out near the beach and very nice areas out there they think it's moving along a trans accord or their though the rail line the light rail line but right now they don't have any answers and they don't know how to stop this aside from just telling the people watch out get vaccinated those types of\nThings are the homeless and the big homeless ten so they in Pasadena and Long Beach as well as Los Angeles\nThere is a pretty sizable population a proportion wise in the Long Beach area because there are a lot of resources it's warmer weather out there\nNot as much in Pasadena past it hasn't been as open to it but frankly whole assistance now popping up everywhere and places that you never saw before even on the outskirts of some of the you know Tony is neighborhoods in Southern California\nThe department of motor vehicles now Jeff we in the east and certainly in the heartland of America have experience with the MPs and large cities\nSo you're going to have to come up with a whopper here to top bar DMV is where you go into a DMV Audi office you expect that the calendar day you started in will be the same calendar day UN didn't but it'll be dark how is it in California\nOne can only hope and pray that it will be that way even though when you make appointments\nYou can wait in line between two to six hours actually for some people even you know the legislators are saying what do you mean you're not even doing what you're supposed to do so how do you know you shouldn't be\nAudited it's just it's crazy and uh it's getting worse there because the bureaucracy the rules about the ideas and things like that are making things more difficult and more like say during the appointments\nI'm beginning to feel better that I live in Los Angeles All right Jeff how you are at the California State University at Long Beach or the executive director of media and you solved a shark mystery how did you do it [noise] [noise]\nOnly six of them are not us based we dominate the world in branding conversation what Chris just referred to so Chris\nThis requires an information a burst of information is social media right now capable of providing that information about these consumers what they want where they're going what what their dreams are\nYes great question I think that the the social media aspects to a certain extent might be starting to pull back a little bit there's the ongoing discussion in the U.S in\nA the you especially with GDP are in the regulatory environment that the Europeans are putting forward where that smartphone that you carry on your hip while an amazingly functional device is also\nBeing used to harvest data around you the consumer in a in a business model like a Google using Android\nSoftware or you're not necessarily the consumer your the product the amount of money generated and you can see Google's market cap and the bottom line by pulling information on that consumer selling that information to branches is amazing slash scary at times but I think what you'll see is that\nMobile device has been one of the key indicators and the the market is moving a little bit from the customer being the provider of all that data to the customer more opting in and building those circles building those engagements that they wish because there is a tremendous amount of what we'd call at\nFatigue in the world you might have fifty apps on your phone but you really use the same four or five for the majority of the time spent how do you better reach that consumer an environment where the consumer does not feel like your spine are stepping on their privacy but you also wish to influence their decisions and try to guide them down a path\nWell the old fashioned way would have been you look at the bottom line each quarter about how much you sold and where you sold it what is the new fashioned way how does it work Chris\n[noise] I think that the new fashioned way is really what can you do to convert a customer's whether it be intent whether it be a thoughts towards your brand no longer is it simply a I win you lose where\nIf I as a customer decide to trans fact that I'm going to have that customer from now till the end of time roughly forty\nTo forty seven forty percent of customers will go into a retail store for their first purchase but once they've done that first purchase and I know the quality or the capability of that product and I'm happy are satisfied with that product\nThen why wouldn't necessarily go to that retail store again I can simply have Amazon ship that and show up on my door at no cost and with a hundred million users of Amazon Prime and the U.S alone today\nThat's a real factor or threat to the physical based retailers of them becoming show rooms for completion by the direct sellers\nI think that the capability or the requirement is for a brand day retailer in this dialogue with customer to give that customer reason to continue to engage and continue that relevance and to be of service to that cost on an ongoing basis if you're not\nIf you're not engaging in driving a deeper relationship than the opportunity for that relationship to be lost is very high\nI read in the economists that this challenge of how to\n... how to have a conversation with your customer going forward is also true for the millennials the new generation that have according to the economists reporting a profile that is very different from the Gen x ers or my generation the boomers\nAre for example there are hesitant about long term commitments and therefore the large car companies are moving towards a subscription base for an automobile rather than making a big financial\nOr a big financial commitment over time thirty six months or five years or something like that so within branding is a is a dialogue that's going on now with the consumers who will be dominant in the year twenty thirty I mean the rich people in the United states\nIt you're exactly right every Twenty years plus or minus each significant generation is going to dictate the way that they want a Brian to interact with them\nAnd they vote with their dollars which is why it's such an interesting thing that they will choose their brands choose the relationships that they wish increasingly with the millennials is\nDifferent from Gen x her baby boomers their technology natives they did not grow up in an environment where smart phones or tablets or interactive a TV\nDid not exist so they're they're native to technology and in many cases where [noise]\nA millennial or a baby boomer would consider hey there's not an associate on sale for to help me Gen extra would say yeah I really don't want someone bothering me I Want to be able to use technology in a brace at technology because I find this to be the way I Wish to communicate\nIn the voting with the dollars is ultimately what you see in many of the rise of certain retailers the fall of others\nThat those retailers those brands are listening to their consumers and you can react you're never going to for say customer to a particular path that they are not aligned with whether that's\nA North American shop or whether that's a an Indian or a Chinese shopper they'll gravitate to what they are most comfortable\nWith right now according to Brookings a three point eight billion people who qualify for middle class right now that's going to grow according to Brookings in the next twelve years the five point three my mathematics says that's a more than fifty percent almost sixty percent increase so\nThe fact is that growth is going to come in ... in Asia which is why I mentioned that that nine out of ten of the next middle class people the people who will come into the middle class for consumption are in Eurasia I read in the wall Street Journal that there will be a big expo in China coming up\nA is China the epicenter of that next nine of that next billion or is it spread out in many cities in to raise your Chris\n[noise] you know it's a great question I think that the\nChina is certainly a very very big factor but never discount the growth that India and never discount where India will overtake chimed in terms of population\nA little bit more in the areas of rule of law a little bit more with English or understanding and tradition as it were I think that the big three being China India and then Malaysia Indonesia as a combined\nArea those are probably the three points up the triangle the difference being how those different brands\nUnder God or those different cultures understand and react to branding in\nShanghai in many of the main Chinese cities that are extremely accommodating for western brands you'll see Chinese consumers where there may be knock off brands for sale they want to buy the original item they want to buy the iPhone and they want to buy the Nike sneakers because they believe in brand\nAs much themselves and understand the quality that that can days in that relationship\nYes according to the ... brand network that I'm looking at the top growing brands right now everywhere in the world in the solar system our Amazon and Facebook COO surprise right and that means that they're all headed to Eurasia Chris regal is the c._e._o. of

in a customer what we call the moment of decision I'm In a retail shop\nI'm looking at a shelf I may have a screen on that shelf I may speak to the consumers mobile device or may interact with that consumer in some digital form to serve that consumer and help them gather the information give the messaging or information that would influence that decision so it's really\nVisual and digital

John ... show it's a pleasure to welcome loop coffee who is the director of the Douglas and Sarah Alison Center for foreign policy at the Heritage Foundation\nJust returned from the Caspian Sea bass and I talk about it a deal I'm keen on looks observations I was there in July and August\nAnd the heat of the summer and there was great news anticipate the signing of an agreement for the state of the Caspian Sea bass in to share energy pipelines future development on the great Silk Road look\nGood evening to you and thank you for joining your back from the Caspian Sea bass and there was anticipation of success you been there since are they celebrating our they disappointed what is the word and back to about the working together with their neighbors good evening to you\nThanks John and good evening and thanks for having me on yes I just came back from a either by John I was in Baku had also a knock shove on which is a separate region of Azerbaijan a boat for very fascinating place to visit I've been to ... number of times\nBefore but you're right this was the first time I've been since the agreement on August\nAnd John people are very optimistic and excited about the agreement I think that most of the countries around the Caspian are happy with the agreement to other than Iran\nAnd I thought was interesting uh looking at some of the reactions of social media many Iranians felt like the President Rouhani of Iran betrayed or the country and betrayed the people over the agreement because\nIranian see themselves as having this a historical legacy in the Caspian region and they feel like they should get\nMore ownership of the Caspian than what they are getting out of this deal but nevertheless putting aside the concerns of the concerns of your average Iranian which let's face it they have a lot of other problems right now\nPutting those to one side this agreement does offer a lot of potential to bring new oil and gas resources from the heart of Central Asia and the Caspian base and to\nEurope and many of America's allies in Europe\nYes this is the southern gas car door and uh I've tried to do I've described it to the audience Lou kinda want your help to it say it take connection from the ... the natural gas the there are two platforms developing but also from Turkmenistan also from Kazakhstan through\nAzerbaijan and then through the ... through Georgia\nTo turkey and then across turkey through the Balkans including Bulgaria into Greece under the tire rainy and see and all the way to Italy so we're talking about not just the riches of the Caspian Sea bass and are we talking about energy security for a Europe that's how I saw the possibility Luke how do you ... yeah absolutely\nThe you know the ultimate goal was southern gas court orders to allow Europeans to get gas from places other than Russia or Iran\nAnd so we're we're talking about right right now in terms of like practical deliveries of natural gas to Europe using the southern grass court or we're talking about really either by John\nBend the future because of this Caspian agreement we could see this expanded out to Kazakhstan and also Turkmenistan because they're on the other side of the Caspian\nAnd there's been this debate over the years on building a pipeline connecting\nThe west eastern side of the Caspian Sea where you have Turkmenistan for example with the western side where you have either by John and the reason why a pipeline is required as because unlike oil or natural gas uh it's very expensive to ship\nA by by by boat you have to liquefy it Ellen gee you've heard that term I'm sure many of your listeners have\nIf you have to liquid liquefied natural gas so it's only profitable to do that when you're when you're traveling more than let's say\nA two thousand miles or so whereas the distance between the two coasts or the Caspian we're talking only about three hundred three hundred and twenty miles so into a pipeline is constructed is not profitable to move this gas\nTo Europe through the Caspian but tell the agreement an August a pipeline was unable to be constructed because there was no legal framework to do so and now there is so there's a lot of optimism about Europe able to get new sources of\nOf uh of gas or to diversify where they get their energy from away from Russia and the more from other resources\nAnd many of your listeners can be thinking well how does this impact me and and the United states and that's actually a very simple because\nMany of our European allies NATO for example we're obligated to protect to through the NATO or the north Atlantic treaty and it's in our benefits that they have security and energy independence away from Russia because that gives Russia one less lever that they can\nPool to apply pressure on many of our allies\nYou mentioned Iran and it's unclear where that had it but it certainly is a rough neighborhood Azerbaijan lives and I want to just to attend a moment to Georgia because this pipeline goes through Georgia and George gets seized from it also gets energy from it Georgia is a threatened state\nOf the south caucuses it was pulled apart and the two thousand innate invasion by the Russians has not been put back together\nAnd I see the court or or at least this agreement in the Caspian Sea as one additional way to backup what's left of the Georgian governance is that a fair generalization look you study this area very carefully\nAbsolutely that's a that's a very important point that is actually often overlook to Georgia is very important trends that country and what the Georgians what is as much energy\nTransiting their country going to Europe is possible\nThat only because you know from an economic point of view Georgia would get transit fees they they are able to get a certain amount of gas and oil from might as well by John because of the transit\nFees and the the transit rights but they know that the the the more oil and gas transits Georgia to get to Europe and and to get to the international markets means that there's more international concern and focus on Georgia and as you pointed out Georgia's already\nPartially occupied by Russia in fact twenty percent of the country is occupied by Russia and they know that if Russia tries to take any more land a there'll be a bigger international attention on the situation because of the oil and gas traveling through the country\nThe Silk Road so it's a theory it's a dream it's an imagination but they have a port at Baku they're waiting for the development of the Silk Road how close are we look to getting that trends that uh the pipelines the highways that term railroads\nAnd just ... it is really a convergence of lots of different technologies and tools and information that we've gathered as a community and the science space for the last ten years\nOf the idea being that you can arrange DNA or nay into these ... structures and when you make despair ... structures we now have a way to introduce genetic material into cells and into tissues throughout the body\nIntroduce it in a way that it won't be rejected that is right introduce it in a way that it doesn't have toxic side effects that are damaging to other healthy parts of the body\nThat's correct yeah the idea here is a big code if you will inside the cell\nIs the DNA and we want to find ways to get our own code to go inside the shell or inside the tissues in the body and spirit for that's been a challenge of and so editing a DNA or nay inside the body is something that has been a real I'm hurt a hurdle for the field to get over\nA will be create ... said what we do is we create a system that is a little bit of a Trojan Horse\nThat allows the DNA or to get inside of the cell allows us to now start correcting faulty DNA\nOr in some cases like cancer or putting in kill switches so that we can actually genetically target cancers and are able to get rid of the cells that have a particular gene of interest or that may be leading to a shelter will be no one of the body like a cancer so this is generally called immunotherapy\nVeto therapy is a one way to use a DNA productively inside the body\nYou meet a therapy space right now is as you mentioned it to your intro is very hot topic this year actually very hot topic absolutely a Noble Prize just went out a few weeks ago uh for some of the developers in the pathways for me to therapies a gym Allison in us to go home Joe\nShared a Nobel Prize for this idea that you could use the body's own immune system to fight cancer\nAnd in fact there are drugs that are now on the market that are helping patients with cancer use of their own immune system to fight off a cancer causing cells\nBrain I GI track lungs skin there's the list goes on about where this is useful their cells all over the body that can go awry and you have a way of treating the cells without being rejected does the\nS. N. A. does they sustain itself the body will attack something from the outside eventually does it a road or does it does it stay with us\nAs you mentioned we kept busy at actually cure we're developing drugs and many different therapeutic areas I mean some of the first therapies in these areas that are genetically targeted so the idea is to go after the underlying genetic causes of disease\nAnd sure enough it correct the genetic defects that are inside the shell um you can create sustained medicines are ones that are actually heading towards cures\nWhere we created a way to modify the underlying disease source and we're not really just talking about treatments anymore but we're really talking about opportunities for us to correct mistakes or inside the code itself up for um diseases and all different types of Oregon's\nThere is a video to several videos at a company or a website and the emphasis is on three dimensional why is that important David three dimensional approach\nOne of the discoveries that we made that was the basis of execution was bad cells and tissues don't like two dimensional a linear DNA origami that's floating around\nIn fact your body to ... to try to get rid of the DNA in our day I'm over evolutionary time and that's been a huge challenge in the field for the last Thirty years because people have always looked at two dimensional structures and tried to puzzle over how to get those into the right cells and tissues\nWhy the three dimensional sphere ... structure is so important was the discovery that we made at Northwestern university it's part of my PHD work in a laboratory of a gentleman named ...\nAnd what I discovered in the ... group was that when you create these three dimensional structures now this was a key that these cells recognize the cells like a three dimensional structure\nAnd now are able to take that DNA into the cells productively where we're able to make genetically defined medicines\nWe have an FDA Europe has an FDA Asia has asked everybody has FDA's where are you in the process of getting this to market to the physicians in our FDA process\nSure so you're correct there's different jurisdictions all over the world right we're currently working on clinical trials in the u._k. in Germany and in the U.S\nAt ... going to run our first us based trial in the mid ... therapy space using our spiritual nucleic acid and we're in dissipating starting that trial in patients with cancer before the end of the year\nI'm sort of the end of this year twenty twenty Eighteen our expectations that we're going to be injecting the first patients with our meta therapies\nAnd how long is the process if you are successful I mean you're learning from this I understand I'm not presuming success right away but how long has the process for the FDA\nLong process to get through the stages of clinical trials success along the way so we're starting with a phase one be to trial or we just announced last week successful completion of a phase one trial\nUm after you get through the phase two trial you face three trials and then out into the market\nThis process can take a meet us several years to do a one fun part about making DNA based medicine is the front end is much faster so we can sit at a computer we can design and medicine and we can get into patients to test it out to see if they can work much faster than traditionally done indeed a development space for drugs\nIn our conversation David you gave me a vision of the future vision of the twenty first century you use the word decide you can see an individual's DNA and respond to what is that where we are going in that it's\nAbsolutely so I mentioned that we had the idea of DNA and the structure of DNA solves since the Nineteen fifties\nAnd two thousand and three we declared success on sequencing the human genome and that tells me how your DNA John is different than my DNA\nAnd what at the individual nuclear base level the A's the g's and T's and sees underline the fundamental aspects of life or different between you and me in different between a disease state and the non disease state\nBecause we had that code book now in front of us we can actually sit at a computer we can type in the code of medicine that we want to make and I can design a drug that will work and your cells and will not work in my cells\nAnd so we're at the point now where we've got the code and we've got the tools we now have the spiritual nucleic acid which we think will allow us to make designer precision medicines that will impact lots of different\nAreas for one person walk into an already jewels do one person comes with an affliction or is diagnosed with an affliction and you respond for that person or that family I guess it would be similarities and\nThat's the vision for the future right now what are the areas that we're focusing on a genetically defined disease and these oftentimes are inherited diseases that pass through generations of families a spinal muscular atrophy is one of the ones that were working on these a severe disease that affects a motor function in children\nAnd that's an ... an inherited disease that's genetically based\nBut you can sit and you can look at that type of um a change in the DNA for the different patients and you can see how one patient is different than another patient\nAnd my vision is that Twenty years from now you're going to be able to walk into your doctor's office and walk out with a medicine that specifically designed to go after your fault the DNA switch 'em inside

must captive bred captain Brennan who was in office or country as well was thrown from is caught his first thought was that it was a rocket attack\nBecause that was always possible without amount of ammunition on board a rocket comes in and you're all blown to kingdom come see you're kind of you're living with the fact that when things go wrong we're in trouble that's what you're living with\nThat is correct but it turned out it wasn't a rocket attack and knew said these who knows that there were ... men for the Viet Cong who knew that they had limb pit mines have they ever tried to attack like this before\nThey had about four years earlier attack in Las T with\nA minute but more\nRecently there had been um a rocket attacks or the Tom Green count\nAnother LSD was attacked by rocket with some loss of life on it so that was the initial fear would that it was a rocket attack you\nAre working all the time on this supply ship because you're the supply chain you're delivering food stuffs and ammunition and gasoline to small boats that run up and are those the ones called ...\nThey are they're called PBR as I'm I'm actually the um\nA lot of them look like little monitor ships like from the civil war had little gun turrets on them and they would um it was a salt patrol boats\nAnd they were tied up next to or attached to or in this construction around a west coast so you actually have a city of people and and and uh and warships around you\nThat's that's correct we also had a over a hundred and fifty US Army soldiers stationed aboard who would go out on these PBR as a matter of how you were you know you know cold to duty\nLet's be detailed about this because teachers made available to me a history of this it was a hundred and Seventy five soldiers the nineteenth century divisions third battalion thirty fourth artillery as well as the crews of the Navy's river assault division plus the crew of West coast okay\nYou're in trouble Peter you're in trouble and you're an officer to take charge but you've lost all lights and you have to put together a shift to write it how is it that you solve the fact that the ship is thinking at this moment well\nLS cheese by their very nature had balloting tank so that they could ah go up onto the shore\nFortunately we hadn't lost all power and uh uh although a lot of the senior petty officers were either killed or injured there was one petty officer who went to his damage control station which was on the ballot that ship\nWhere there was a a pumping a facility to deep ballast\nThe storage tank\nA garbage ballots tank\nAnd when they damage control system the officer or a gun in communication with among found powered phones cold them what to do they ... the tanks and the the ship at one point in time cap and brown and felt that we were going over\nA but fortunately they were able to the ballot is so that as much water was coming into the um ship from the um\nOpening from the damage from the buying them the mining there was as much water going out to the emptying the ballots thanks\nSo it's like you meant the pumps ... Eighteen century and ah the captain Aubrey was in charge I'm thinking of the Patrick O'Brian series that operate would say everybody on the pumps you are going to work twenty four hours\n[laughter] that's that's about it now the ... river is a is a title river right it goes up and down in that in it as a title river are you at high tide or low tide at this point\nYou know I I don't recall there wasn't a lot of title of variation uh uh in the ... river at that time\nSo what we have now is the ship is not going to sing by what they think that and at this area of Vietnam is always going to be vulnerable to follow up attack so at this you don't know if there's going to be more mine she had\nNo idea if they're going to be more mind we have no idea what's going on\nA bus you've got injured

business in this case in the person up Jeff Bezos in the news always Amazon is a worldwide brand that growing by leaps in fact it is the number one growth around the planet everybody wants to be associated with Amazon why\nBecause it's a good business practice John it's focusing on the news that Jeff Bezos made when he declared that all of the Amazon will now pay Fifteen dollars minimum wage that has been an ambition for many unions especially in fast food franchise is these last years in some cities have moved in that direction\nBut Bezos makes the decision for his publicly traded company to go to the Fifteen dollars and why is the subject to this cat and he's calling John a very good evening to you Jeff Bezos is a very good business that\nHe has gained great wealth because he's aggressive and far side what is the the and the Fifteen dollars after all US dollars to the fact that minimum wage is not about growth good evening to John\nAnd John I think what he's ... he's always known that\nPoorly paid workers are incredibly expensive or the media have focused on hourly wages at Amazon but that's never been the principal or the the sole way they've they've compensated their workers all the way down to warehouse workers narrowly workers you arrive and you are awarded\nTo shares and then you were able to gain a new share every year\nNow so what they're doing is that they are um ending that form of compensation hourly wages plus shares in St there'll still be higher hourly wages plus there'll be a share a bind plan that they will Institute for all their employers they ... they want everyone there\nTo have skin in the game\n... Amazon would not have three hundred thousand plus employees if it didn't pay its employees well it just does so differently and so ... says inside is that he's going to pay more and then also figure out a way to get them shares in the company\nPay more also you consider that Bezos has his eye on Washington how does the Fifteen dollars help him deal with are very very powerful state\nWell this is the unfortunate part I my sense and I can't prove this I'm merely speculate is the is the basis looks back to what happened to Bill Gates Bill Gates didn't have quote a man in Washington and he paid for it\nDearly with a wasteful lawsuit foisted upon them by the department of justice and so my sense is that is a base those fears that he fears\nThe success of Amazon getting him in trouble in in Washington and so there's also the political aspect of it I don't think this was ... for a second I find it offensive when people say described this great businessmen as a crony I think he also did this to kind of signal to Washington look at me\nI'm doing these things that you want a instituting a higher minimum wage that's going to force other business to do it\nUm I think he would have done it any way but I think there is that fear [noise]\nAnd because Bezos is often in the news because we're watching him he said global businessman he's looking out and the future for Amazon I I think the anecdote is that they're\nThey now have warehouses I think it might be in Hong Kong but I'm not sure where there are very few employees I remember the number four and because they're mostly are going to what we can call robots\nHow ... how does Fifteen dollar minimum wage fit into the world that Amazon is going to which is to automate as much as possible [noise]\nWell actually it doesn't it at all but it doesn't not no way that most people think based on his doesn't want low wage employees\nAs any businessman nose blow wage employees are expensive he wants higher paid employees\nAnd so ideally the scenario would be to automate that would be the reward that would enable him to grow the business even more and attract workers\nThat would command even higher wages for being much more productive than is important to be as some people said in response to basis as decision that he was just calling for a Fifteen dollar wage as a way of putting out of business his less automated competitors\nAll the more realistic assertion is is the basis wouldn't have time to focus on them and this scenario\nAll businesses want to automate all businesses would want to automate whether the minimum wage was zero or whether it's Fifteen simply because when you can automate employee functions you can pay your workers a lot more and when you can pay your workers a lot more than ... you're able to do that because they're more productive they're less likely to leave\nIt cannot be stressed enough that low wage workers are very expensive no business would go out of its way to grow with them\nIs Jeff Bezos the crony\nHe's the opposite of a crony I think that what needs to be stressed is that because Amazon is so large because it's so valuable successful he has to worry about Washington in the ... in ways that a small business does not and so it I don't begrudge him\nThe need to occasionally thrilled bone to Washington to say oh I'm for a Fifteen dollar minimum wage he's not foolish he knows that this can be a barrier to employment for some people\nBut he has to police masters who don't care that he's a great businessmen and precisely because he's a great businessmen wants to cut 'em down to size so he must needlessly\nAnd and unfortunately play the Washington game on occasion\nI Know John in Europe parentheses in your column you mentioned that if that's what I was interested in cutting down the number of workers he must pay he wouldn't have bought whole foods that you you to say that labor intensive is an understatement good heavens\nWhy isn't that true he's doing this as he's starting to add a brick and mortar stores in the form of bookstores and he's doing it as he buys whole foods\nUm he ... the best way to reach customers has to have on the ground stores and so this is not about taking out as competitors again no one wants low wage workers think about any business you weren't you want to get the most talented workers who logically costs more\nThat's the path to grow businesses don't become brilliant and successful by exploiting their workers Amazon's not going to be the first\nWe go from one self made man Jeff Bezos and the future is bright for Amazon that is a solar system brand for heaven's sakes do another self made man or is he he is now the president of the United states Donald J Trump the New York times has reported\nBe employment\nFor Americans right now is Rosie but we can do more than that we can analyze why it has lots of room\nAt ... here was chairman of the president's council of economic advisors this is two thousand sixty two thousand nine he is now professor at Stanford University's graduate school of business he's a fellow at the Hoover Institution riding most recently at the wall Street Journal about America's economy\nAt a very good evening to there is the concern that ah that as the employment number just sends and we're now under four percent that there's trouble I had I think sometimes it's called inflation sometimes it's called overheating however you lay out numbers that are very convincing to me\nAbout the employment to population ratio that tells us the right now that American Jobs will just get better and better in the foreseeable future what is the employment to population ratio called the E. P. O. P. good evening to you at\nGood evening a well that's a standard measure that economists particularly labor economists like to use uh the typical number that people are familiar with of course is the unemployment rate the employment rate isn't quite the opposite of the unemployment rate but it's close to the opposite end it's the it's again the metric that\nEconomists prefer we actually prefer uh employment rather than unemployment so let me just tell you what that is here's here's how you want to think about it take the\nTotal number of people working that's essentially the number of people who have jobs and divide that by the number of people who could have jobs now when I say could have jobs the way that the bureau of Labor Statistics defines that\nIs I'm a in a particularly grand way and that is anybody sixteen over could have a job so Ninety year old could have a job someone who's in school and high school could have a job\nSo what that means is that the employment rate is never going to be a hundred percent because you're going to have a\nSignificant fraction of retirees it's never going to be a hundred percent because you're going to have a significant fraction and school but the number that we tend to see is going to be somewhere in the neighborhood I'm sixty one sixty two percent then in the last a recovery at the peak back in two thousand seven\nThe employment rate reached sixty three and a half percent uh and that was about as high as it got for a while and then it started to go back down as we hit the recession so the question is where we'll go and where does it need to be in order to in order for us to be at full employment and\nJust in in a one sentence the answer is sixty one percent it's right now about sixty and a half percent so we have about another half a percentage point to go\nThat means that there's growth they had and that translates into lots of jobs but I learned from you also\nThat it really matters this idea of full employment that really matters having to do with the Federal Reserve and everybody watching that are ... are the people who who follow I think it's called the Phillips curb are they aware that we have room to grow on is that is that reflected in the feds remarks\nThey are this is a debate that has been going on inside the fed and actually with me I've been in touch with a lot of fed officials\nAre about these issues for a couple of years now and you know to be honest that everybody was on my side I think that history has actually proven correct because a couple of years ago\nI remember the unemployment rate it just you know some below five percent everybody said wow you know things are great where at full employment and I said we've got a a long way to go and again it was because\nAnd looking at the employment rate rather than the unemployment rate and a couple of other indicators as well\nBut based on those I said we're gonna we're gonna continue to grow or going to continue to see rapid job growth for\nAnother couple of years and in fact that's what happened so the fed is certainly aware of this but the reason this is relevant and as you just pointed out is particularly relevant because the fed is concerned that uh we may be overheating and they're trying to get ahead of the curve\nAnd in order to do that of course they've been raising interest rates and uh uh as we know that's a cause some volatility on the stock market over the past couple of days\nThe White House the Kevin Hassett and Larry Kudlow they're ... they're watching these numbers as well\nHave they got a persuasive case given these I mean there are some surprising demographic numbers now and I've never seen before the lowest unemployment for some of the most vulnerable populations in a generation maybe two generations is that ... is that significant for growth\nOh it is it is absolutely I mean it's it's significant in two respects first of all it's a measure of where we've been so it's a measure of growth it's a measure of our success [noise]\nUh but the other thing it tells us is where we can be going and ... for that I Would say\nYou always want to focus on the prime age workers and particularly in the last couple of years and those workers who are between twenty five and thirty for your years of age and mostly men actually in that group ... mostly men because the women have been doing fine but the men have not\nAnd recently if you look at the past few months what's happened is the employment rate among those among that group this twenty five to thirty four year old\nHas picked up and picked up dramatically so that's good news for a couple of reasons first of all those are people who we'd like to see back in the labor force of the ones who should be working\nBut second it also tells us that there is demand out there for people there are jobs available and when those jobs become available people will fill those jobs so again another indicator that the economy is continuing to expand\nWage growth that is also an indicator to watch how does that translate because there's been a complaint especially by partisans in the Democratic party that the wages in not growing means that this is a rich man's economy and not for everyone what his wage growth tell us about overheating and about jobs grow\nRight okay well you know you raised a couple of points one is that the distribution of the wage growth who's getting the wages and who's not that's one issue but I I'm going to speak about your second one because that's the one that really it's more closely to your earlier an issue about whether the fed should be concerned about this\nWhat the fed worries about is that wages are growing more rapidly than they would do permissible and permissible is kind of a funny word but they have a rule and their rule is look at the rate of wage growth and compare that to the summer of two things one\nProductivity growth and second inflation targeting inflation so we know that the feds targeting inflation rate is about two percent they'd like to see about ... percent inflation and the economy they think if you're below that that's not good they think if you're above that that's not good so they'd like to see two percent in addition to that\nThey are quite happy if wages grow by the rate of productivity and and the reason is that if you're producing more output and that out but it's going into the economy\nThen if wages are growing at that same rate that's not inflationary because the output is there to cover those wages so what that says is that if you look at the numbers for the recent years\nThe fed would allow us to have wage growth that about three point three percent that's the some of the two percent plus the productivity increases\nOver the past couple of years actually passed year it's been two point eight percent so we're still below that which means we have room in terms of wage growth before we're in a situation where the fed worries that if there is overheating in terms of what is sometimes called wage pusher cost push inflation\nAnd was there was chairman of the president's council of economic advisors two thousand six

reported by the news back at the bike and our cows but jumped so the investigation underway\nBob a very good evening to you I was I was keen on this twenty four hours later because this\nProfoundly affects now than it's planning for I manned spacecraft to and from the I asked asked and for plans going forward what do we know now about what happened and what is the state of the rock costs most ... program good evening to you\nCould even in John well okay what we now there have been tentative um\n... reports coming out of Russia that suggest the problem occurred when the strap on suicide boosters up the first stage separated it appears there is a valve that's supposed to open\nTo [noise] to release a door done didn't oxygen and I suspect also that action helps push the side a saw strap on so way\nAnd for some reason that valve did not open\nAnd it appears they think there was a collision occurring when those first those\nThose are strap on separated or maybe a ... a collision occurring when they first and second stage separated them to the core stage in the middle separate slightly after the trap ons release this is somewhat\nPulmonary we don't know yet they picked up some debris of the first stage they're still looking into it they've opened a criminal investigation this is very Russian\nUm but in this case considering that we had a a someone ... to hold an assault used capsule there before it was launched in at hiding it I don't blame the Russians here for being a little bit paranoid even if this is their culture\nUm the status for I assessed down the road is interesting job this all use capsules have a two hundred day life span in space\nAnd show when a crew goes up on it's a a shawl use that capsule should be used to return within two hundred days which will protect seven months\nUm eight months something like that well the crew that's up there now there's three people up there they were going to come down in December\nBecause that's when they're soy use a capsules warranty runs out well right now the Russians have said they're not going to launch a manned mission until they launched at least one on man so I use first to make sure everything's okay [noise]\nUm [noise] but these guys have to come back in December that's when they weren't too runs out on this or use lifeboat so what I think is probably going to happen here is that the December flight they're going to try to figure out what went wrong and get it fixed and do the December launch\n'em a without anyone on board and what that will do\nIs that will give them a new life both that can give them two hundred extra days that way I assessed will not have to be left on male\nThey put an unmanned craft up to par cat ...\nYes exactly and me the craft that they're now they stuffed with stuff why not you can take advantage of this to bring stuff back and they'll just send it back on its own\nUm in fact I I don't know off the uh that's probably the grass it's got the hole in it so there's another reason maybe not to put people on it and so uh this actually might work out very well it's not great for the crew on board because they're basically gonna have\nTheir mission and um I've been told by it costs ... to take long missions like the shooting you know how long emissions supposed to be any kind of pace yourself to do that mission now suddenly you have to extend it it's hard but they can do it and so that's where we stand\nIt might be that I Will be unmanned or that would be the first time an Eighteen years that no human insurance\nSpace is pretty impressive situation um there'll be a tragedy will lose\nThat string I was really hoping that ... Newman's would appear in space for the rest of our human history [noise]\nUm but that might not be the case I as a self they say can be manned in space operated in space for that anybody on board with a by mission control but less maintenance questions involved for example the two astronauts that we're going to be on the Soyuz craft one of the they were trained to do certain space walks to do maintenance on the station\nWell they're not there and the Russians have said they don't launch these same two guys in April because they got to get them up there to do those maintenance space walks there's also might impact the investigation and they only because they were saying they were going to do an Arab during one of those space walks they were going to inspect from the outside the whole uh\nAnd so this is a complicated situation will shift to see how it plays that in the future\nJob I'm going to press on this because you know there was talk of a criminal investigation has dropped or is that still on\nThe vi V. or the science the engineering investigation and the panel that's doing that has also opened a criminal investigation Russia is I mentioned the Russians\n... that's not unusual for them to open criminal investigations this kind of thing they have a different attitude than we do but considering the fact that they had what looked like might have been sabotaged on the Soyuz capsule it's an old right now and considering this has happened and considering they have so many problems they've had\nThey've had six failures of soy use variations\nThe Saudis rocket and the last two years for I'm Sorry for failures\nBut either way there's a lot and so they're paranoid right now and even little culturally that normally similar paralyzed the Russians you know the whole statement just because your parent it does not mean somebody isn't out to get you and it could be very well the case here that there is\nThey could be great dissatisfaction within the engineering or crews that build these things because they don't get paid much effect that pay pittance compared the engineers the rest of the world and the management is not great\nAnd detectives generally been poor and so Russia's very unhappy country right now so I wouldn't be surprised if the criminal investigation\nThey must go to the U.S side how can we get a spacecraft ready to do routine back and forth and the IOC says to operate as if it was so are you\n[laughter] well right now our schedule is that a space X is going to do is unmanned test sometime in January and then five months later it's first manned mission that that's not that's not an operational mission that's still a test mission", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The John Batchelor Show", "city": "Newton", "day": "13"}
