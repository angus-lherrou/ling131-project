being a communist state and and in fact became\nA very much a nationalist government uh with ... uh economy economic er into effect is but the reality is that a Beijing talks globalism it talks a come by a by act\nProfoundly nationalistic and his uh his projecting its power for nationalistic reasons it requires control access to resources and food supply in a way which the United states has never had to do\nBecause the United states has had ample domestic a mineral and agricultural resources whereas the ... seat does not so the SEC is literally knows that it's life is dependent on continuing

much to the mid ... century or so there was this great feeling of\nInferiority which is now being ... a addressed and Chinese people flocked to a authoritarian leadership\nIn the knowledge that that was restoring prestige and tried to to China in a way which had not been seen since the brief a rise if you like of the doubt and produce a sushi or who died in Ninety nine hundred and eight\nGregory I want to apply this to where you are in Australia because Australia's economy has prospered these last decades on the Chinese demand need for resources but\nWith the Chinese assertion of nationalism I note that uh that Australia is taking note of the chat strategy that China's used in the south China Sea and it's looking at the coral sea has something to protect from Chinese encroachment\nIs Australia swinging tours nationalism is Australia moving back towards the commonwealth is it understanding that China is a nationalist bread and not a global is market\nIt's certainly a arouse a lot more discussion than it did a China had made massive encroachment into the the the political structures in the in Australia\nAre literally buying off politicians form a new south Wales probably a cop for example a bit became a lack of Beijing and and so on and he was the foreign minister in India in Australia or just recently\nSo uh so yes there's a lot of concern about undo Chinese influence in Australia\nAre and in China is buying up agricultural capabilities and lands and so on ... a company's him and lands here so that they can really feed into the the Chinese food requirement\nOr as a result ... is now starting to import food from other parts of the world because it's exploiting the bulk of its Its Food stuffs to China\nOr this is not a healthy situation for the ... over a strike a and but the but distributed being massively organize more than most countries in the world is eighty nine foot six five percent ... so uh the the\n... been voters tend to think are in short term and short term say they want what they want when they wanted a they don't necessarily think about this long to balance of the nation state\nBut that is starting to change again and it always changes when hardship\n... visited upon our country and although you say a stray that will uh in the in recent decades because of the boom in exports to China in relative terms Australia's GDP whilst it has been growing\nHas been growing less rapidly than that of its neighbors they or India or which was marginally with this huge population was marginally bigger than Australia a in a in GDP tempted Nineteen Seventy eight and there's now a massively bigger than Australia\nOr China was a Chinese GDP in Nineteen Seventy eight was double Australia's now it's nine hundred and thirty percent bigger than Australia's or Indonesia was\nI had a in Seventy eight had a GDP of Fifteen Percent of strays now it has a GDP Seventy seven percent that of a stray so in relative terms the strangest productivity or an innovative qualities have declined dramatically and will and will continue to decline dramatically\n... the the country had five a functioning oil refineries it now has not and it has something like a Fifteen day a supply of petroleum on hand\nYes it has massive underground oil and gas resources but it hasn't actually done much with them most of the ah the gas is for exports strays now that the largest gas exporter in the world of it is a lot of it's not going into the domestic\nWhat what about the coral sea geography let's look at geography here is the coral sea threatened by China is Australia ready to just respond we've got about a minute\nYeah astray as building it's navy and air force dramatically and sit in the China would not be able to make an incredible the Carl sea area I bet it is but it is making political inroads into New Guinea Solomon Islands and other South Pacific states about a lot to particular\nUh so astray has to respond to that history is still a much bigger aid diner in those areas that China but China is buying off individual politicians which is the key to it\nSays Canberra perceive the threat to the public\nEducated about the threat we see it clearly here in the east coast to the United states do they see it in the south coast of Australia\nAt no stranger is not yet perceiving the threat as in as dire times as as they should\nUh it is getting much more traction than it was a year ago but still not enough and the change of government actually didn't help because there was a minister who is handling relations with the south Pacific States\nWho was dismissed from the new government because she had written a letter objecting to something the new prime minister was doing so a friend who was deprived of very a a good resource in in

republic of Azerbaijan and the Caspian Sea bass and is a region well worth exploring and\nI welcome my colleagues bill Whalen the Hoover Institution bill is the area forty five seed pod cast for the Hoover Institution but we're going to ... him momentarily because he also writes a column and for about these last weeks before the midterm election\nFollowing Kavanaugh bill a very good evening to you the anecdote being told in Washington is a cabinet makes a difference for the Republican Party however\nWait to see whether the facts support that especially in the polling\nThe one distinction that is made anecdotally is that the Republicans all of a sudden they're doing better in Senate races but there's no information that things have changed in the house how do you see the cabin all embroiled Leo now after the storm has passed\nAnd what should the Republicans watch for in these next week if there is indeed a change your momentum good evening to you about\nJohn simply this Republican submit overall Republicans what we're talking Senate races not house races but set rates we can get to ask you about it if you want to put on the Senate said the ... already works favorably for Republicans and Democrats to play defense or a lot of defense in states that voted heavily for Donald Trump so here the cabin up\nSome nation as a gift plain and simple why well first of all because since I went for president but secondly Germany look in the state\nCapital is enormously important to look at North Dakota for a second or the high camp\nDemocratic ... audio us into trouble before just about a poll I saw it in North Dakota the other day ... of their leaders are issues in this election Kevin what's number one issue a job more so than the economy foreign policy immigration health care unit\nWas cabinet plain and simple I kept voted against Kavanaugh probably because he's already got by ten point to see the water draining out of the bath tub with our race\nSo there's an example the effect next book example this tape is taught pro medics Republicans that's the great state of Tennessee open seat were Bob Corker is retiring job in the race between Marsha Blackburn and feel proudest and the former Democratic governor of the state uh she has struggled widely in this race\nBut suddenly coal sugar up about eight points there's only one explanation for the drawing and That's Kevin ... so then the next week or so let's watch are the plus a pulse dribble out in states like Nevada states like Arizona State like Wisconsin a state like Montana Jon Tester obedience Kevin ...\nGet a credit card but let's see what the cabin up ... and I think that's the phrase to watch the electric coach Kelly Bell\nJoe Manchin voted for cabinet all he had a lead beforehand people in West Virginia like him a lot so his voters may be hard to read but it sure looked like he was a joined the parade bill is that going to influence Republican voters that mentioned came over\nSo that probably saved him in West Virginia\nYou can listen to these a position that race to begin with John ... gave him beliefs are but just probably pretty much ... much match you did something very clever he didn't come out in favor of capital until way after Susan Collins right already made her pick\nThe question of the coal that voted no catalogs she said she was going to vote no what would that should have done because they would have been between a rocket to replace between having a police\nCars and how he just plays devoted West Virginia but look this is a state that Donald Trump carried by over forty coach John this is a state that Donald Trump has been too I think five or six times it has to be the state has visited the most John states which Trump does not have property such as Florida New Jersey New York so\nWe had no choice but to really vote for a so again\nWorks very well for the Democrats or Republicans on the side of things and just just underscores the voted this election job but I keep on talking about this how things change for a week to week we have this conversation a week ago about the United states at about looks very different than a week later after he kept a vote it looks\nAnd the Senate vote does that connect with the houseboat are they\nYou separate unit versus bill\nSeparate university here Republicans have a problem because Kevin I'll give it up and give and take it for Republicans he gave us for Republicans and the red states he take it away and the blue states where a Democrat where Republicans are scrambling a state of California particularly John where there are about seven or eight seats at the turn of\nEvents where Republicans are challenged\nAnd here we have a problem because that Kevin motivate the red state voters he also motivates women and especially in suburban districts and down in orange County California John these are states Republicans already have a problem with so Kevin off easy to say right now the capital insecure Republicans said it\nIt may have cost her baby costs Republican House\nYes the Democrats are doing well in the house before Kavanaugh's so the puzzle here bill before we move on to Florida did the Democrats calculate on Kavanaugh\nSo badly um in in some fashion so badly inhibiting their Senate vote did they count on that or were they just playing this as it lays in other words they they played the hand that they were ...\nShot I I I don't know what to Democrats with picky throughout this process if they were doing audits long term strategy they would have looked at this as real as my goodness we're probably about half a dozen of our senators who just untenable position so why fight this secondly John this little crafts really kind of lost her head admit\nYou know history will tell us when the weather the cabinet nominations really hurt a lot of hope they charge what he gave his own throw the defense before the panel I think it may have turned when Michael ... he got off the\nStormy Daniels' lawyer who tried it out the woman the college woman who has a ridiculous accusations about Cabot gauging a gang rapes school and so forth\nAnd the Democratic party didn't have the good sense of ... you know we've got to distance ourselves from Abbott daddy and instead they pile on a ... attack I'm just not sure how much long term strategic thinking that cock his head I think they were caught up in a moment so determined to bring the message out they didn't look at the bigger picture\nFlorida Rick Scott the very popular successful governor is running against the long standing Senator Bill Nelson this is a non Kavanaugh story you're reporting for\nIt is a Florida is interesting for a couple of reasons first of all the early turnout has worked a heavily for Democrats in Miami Dade\nAh what's that about ... is two things ... ...\nThing really John that's environment it's violent in terms of its catastrophe going on in the form of red algae and red ties with blue algae a\nGovernor blazes senator Senator Blanche the governor for this problem of Koreans are bad the question is who they take it out on and now we have something else coming into play and that's hurricane politics as we speak or a hurricane is barely out on the Florida Panhandle uh\nAn attitude and they'll shift at that as Larry Kudlow says the animal spirits of the economy that have been not least because businessmen and women that I talked to who who are now there's twenty seven million businesses in the United states though the backbone of our economy\nAnd when I talk to them about why do you think things are so good they say we know if we invest in either my workers and expand our business the government's not going to come after us with a Billy club and strike us down so it's it's more the ... they know there was a president who was on their side who is pro business and by the way John\nIs Donald Trump likes to say being pro business just being pro worker because you need employers to have employees and so it's a very positive picture it's in fact I defy or something my liberal friends to show me anything that's not going right with the cockpit right now\nI Am the storm clouds or announced in twenty Seventeen by all the magazines and newspapers I read you know me I've got the New York times or Washington Post the economists time magazine especially the national Review Online\nThe tariff war what to do was to destroy our economy and I think the market is now at sixteen thousand he didn't happen the why not\n[noise] well I think maybe it's because Trump's bark was worse than his bite you know I was there a on a week ago on Monday when Donald Trump pet is a Rose Garden ceremony announcing the candidate that was a big deal to have\nYou know six months ago I think people like myself and and you were worried that we might not get a new NAFTA we will colony ... NAFTA any longer but this was a new NAFTA it's a new\nA free trade agreement for all North America which is a very positive thing for the whole region\nSo uh I think that the significance of this is not just that we've got this deal done with Mexico and Canada but it sends a signal that Trump is like dominoes she's gonna bring\nDuties bilateral deals she's going to do and what the UK if they ever get out of the new he's going to do one with European she's talking about a trade deal now with Korea and then of course the big one John as you know is the is the big stand off a that is coming against China right and\nThat has not hurting Steve because China is adamant that it will not change its business plan it's business plan is to violate the all the rules of the WTO to be a pirate and to have American ... economy and it will not change\nWell you know that's what they're saying but you know the ... with not being report in the American media is how poorly the Chinese economy is doing I mean there's a there's a panic and Beijing right now they're the stock market is down twenty two percent this year there's a lot of disinvestment in China\nGot a lot of goods that China needs to sell goods to the United states right I mean they tell us a trillion dollars a year that's a big part of their economy and they are worried and I think at the end of the day\nYou know I don't know if it's going to be the end of the day is going to be you know a month from now six months ago two years from now but they are going to make some real concessions here because the truth is Trump is right about China China is you said there are pirates their steel they cheat\nThey don't live by any of the agreements they promise you any business that tries to do business over in China you know you'd be sacrificed oftentimes the ownership your trade secrets your patents it's just a system we can't live with it's going to change in this question of how long it takes Beijing the to come to the bargaining table I think it's going to be sooner rather than later\nThe supply chains team that's been the concern that if China and the U.S remain at loggerheads the supply chain is damaged do you see any evidence of that moving around the country\nSure I mean that'll happen I mean look this is going to inflict some pain on the United states but mighty pain on China you know China\nNeeds to be able to sell goods and services to the United states they sell us five hundred billion dollars a year you put a twenty five percent Europe on that that's a hundred and twenty five billion dollars\nThat they would have to pay and and terrorists and you know as as up someone in the White House told me recently wasn't Larry Kudlow but a high level officials said you know just chit chat you know we put tariffs on them they protests and that's\nPretty soon China runs out of ammunition they're going to run out of bullets 'cause you know they we only buy a hundred and ... we only saw a hundred and fifty billion to them they they sell a five hundred billion to us so I I look I Am optimistic that this is going to turn out but you never know I mean you know the ... the\nChinese better than I Do John and a lot of this\nSaving face for Beijing and president the but you take that out of the equation\nYou know if it's just a very positive picture lower lower\nTaxes lower regulations pro business pro America energy policies are the lowest unemployment rate you know since the Beatles were still playing together\nLowest black lowest Hispanic lowest Asian female unemployment rate you know that that's a pretty big deal when you get a better way did you see the story of my favorite story of all John in the wall Street Journal on Saturday they're buried on page aid for\nThe biggest wage gauge over the last year went to the lowest\nSkill the lowest income workers so this this really is a rising tide lifts all boats\nEnergy you've written books about energy right now the price of oil is going through eighty five dollars the trash talking to a hundred does that help the U.S because the energy sector has been our strength these last the last years of the Obama administration\nNow doesn't help it tell you I'm worried about it actually because you're right we do produce a lot of energy and and then within two or three years we're going to be an exporter of energy but we're not there yet John\nAnd so when the price of oil goes up its attacks on the American producers\nAmerican family is in American motorists so it you know this high price stays high by the way I think it's temporary the United States I've been to Texas had been North Dakota I've been to Oklahoma I've been to West Virginia well producing so much ... how China's unbelievable I I think this just further\nOr encourage our domestic producers to in Texas and Oklahoma\nAnd North Dakota and Alaska to produce even more energy which is which is going to be a good thing as we become more and more as Donald Trump would say he doesn't want to be energy and and any watch American to be energy dominant or not there yet but we're getting there\nThe election it's within four weeks you know it very well the message of prosperity is clear we've gone through the details is America listings team\nYou know that's a good question or do we just take this prosperity for granted um I don't know well but I Will say that you know the Democrats are running on repealing the tax cuts that you've got to the looney challenge to the tax cut is what has really provided the juice the economy\nAnd the for the Democrats to be running around the country saying we're going to raise your taxes John I don't think that's a winning message with the\nAmerican people the cabin or a ... do you watch it from across the country these last days the surprise to me this week this week\nRight now after the cabinet seconds cabinet swearing and at the White House is that it's given the Republicans momentum uh do you see that as you cross the country and does that does that compete with the prosperity message should we should we say that the Republicans have found a reason to vote\nYou know I think so well again you know you never know until you actually go out and vote but I'd throw the polls out the window John 'cause I Lived through the two thousand sixty intellectual I every always so uh you know show off target but I Do see that especially with Republican women who were kind of\nA show so about whether they wanted to vote in two thousand uh Eighteen and they saw the mistreatment of cabin on and they have sons and they have husbands and fathers and they think it's outrageous and you know I think it's been a net plus for the Republicans because the Democrats were already mad as hell or

said to me a missed the Trump is preparing for the big full Republican debate on national security and he's looking for some advice would I be willing to come and meet with him\nOf course so I fly to

sitting in a quarter\nAnd I'd never met the man before we had this incredible blue sky discussion for about forty minutes ranging from everything the civil war which he clearly has a passion for\nRight up to the middle east he asked questions Oh yes yeah hold on to ... my opinion you always want it in the White House is to say what do you think all these constantly wanting to have different opinions from the civil war to ISIS' to nuclear weapons you name it and then halfway through the conversation classic Trump ism he stops the discussion\nTurns to Korea and says I liked this

in a war in that part of the world\nI mean he has this reflects we don't do it if it's stupid if it's not if it's not vital if it's not instantaneous I'm not interested so the same questions but he also then are the ones who's offering today\nLet's talk about how it is that ... he joined the campaign and you witness this transformation of America and you have any thoughts about the politics but I Want to bring in a chapter of your book that seems important here a Ronald Reagan you quote Ronald Reagan um his his version of the Cold War\nI I wrote it down here and my theory of the Cold War as we win and they lose is that Donald Trump's opinion\nHe's a winner either were not you know X.\nThrough in All right uh that opinion was backed up by the efforts of the Reagan Administration to make the case why it is we're better than the Soviet right that is something that's been missing for since the attack on New York and I've actually been missing since the first attack on the world trade\nCenter it has it has and and that is why\nI I I said in the book I said in why we fight I truly believe whatever happens in the next six is the president's President Trump's wall so speech will be one of the most historic speeches he gives as the forty fifth president\nBecause it's the language that we recall from the Nineteen fifties\nIt's full of the transcendental it's full of the godly but it's also about Judeo Christian civilization and it it has a heart stopping moment in the ... paragraph\nIt's not a happy ... speech it is a serious way the speech and he says the only question before us today and I'm paraphrasing is whether we have the will to defend the upon which all civilization is built on the fact that he gave that speech\nWay he did we ... the British Government wanting to have him in some fancy location downtown we said no the president ... states will give this speech next to the statue of the Warsaw Uprising where those brave\nOr polls came up from the sewers to fight the fascist that had occupied their country and\nBank fully the ... government agreed and that speech will be a historic speech\nReagan said Mr Gorbachev tear down that well it didn't win the war but it has to be able to fly yeah and it signal to you all everyone who loved Eastern Europe that there was a new day coming\nOn Donald Trump we turn now to ISIS because when you were in the campaign ISIS was understood by the Obama administration as an extra ... existential threat that we have to live with a generational friend I I\nIt's flabbergasted to review the language it's time I guess I can argue that they were so burned by their collapse in Libya they didn't want to engage anything else that\nPredated that predated the collapse of Libya if you think about the fact\nSo I just won a illustration near the end of the administration there was a very as a speech the president gave a press conference with those uh\nOvertones of ... where he said what difference is it what I

the problem\n[noise] this is the ... this is the this is probably been the most systemic problem that has all this had since its launch after it was repaired um the driver scopes that they used to keep the telescope oriented precisely um they have six on the space craft\nThey have had three in reserve for the last few years to try to last they only need three to make sure it's pointing accurately um and so the three ... three others have been you just put in reserve they're not running them to try to preserve than to last as long as possible so the three that were running a one failed\nAnd so uh they said um actually I should correct myself for the six gyros they had for that worked and they had\nOne in reserve to no longer work so they had three good ones and water reserves so the three gyros that were working\nOne failed and so they decided will turn up the backup one and they turned it on and it wasn't running properly\nAnd so they turned it off again that leaves just stay with only two gyroscope\nIt it can do research with even one gyroscope but it cannot point precisely in the same manner and produce the same kind of sharp images can do science but can't do the sharp images that make it famous and so at the moment while they trouble shoot the gyroscope that\nThey hoped would work they put the space craft into safe mode to try to preserve all the drivers

part that failed with time and this has been that problem [noise]\n... they might be able to get the telescope functioning for a period of time with one or two gyroscope so this is kind of similar to what they did with\n... yeah it sounds like a Kepler a reply similar yes\nIt's very similar and so they can do some research\nBut with Hubble its capital capital was was a very small optical telescope

at the whole sky\nUp in space and if if they go to only one or two drivers they're gonna have to limit where it can look\nAnd it's going to limit it to its possibilities and it will I I I'm pretty sure the images will not be as sharp as they were before that once again they can do good science with such like the fuzzy images strong understood that up until Hubble was launched with fuzzy images

my nine and teach the art of escape that in World War to\nThe gym was shot down or actually Jim's engine or died while he was a an observer or tracking U boats over the north sea he came down on the water a U boat um came up from underneath literally underneath the plane they were captured ... went into the youth vote and then brought to the German mainland\nThat's accented enough for a lifetime\nNo that is a gym lived about for life\nAnd we are the the old man Charles raft born a completely fluent in ... in British how did the Germans capture him\nWell the Charles ... was a a noted flyer or he was responsible for several of a very successful bombing runs he was brought down and he was paraded by the Germans as a great prize or that they'd captured Charles rap born\nAnd he was subsequently sent to camps or an arrived at Holtzman than in a late Seventeen\nYes ... is the super cap that we're headed to a in a second war if you have a familiar with Steve McQueen criticism of his greatest game that was a camp that was built especially for the troublesome\nEscape artists of the second war these are their superiors and Jim bet it teaches escape tactics to the ... in a as a representative of M. I. nine I I did not know about him I Know I think too you wrote about it how does it work\nWell how it worked in this was one of the reasons I came to the story because I was reading about the history of that my nine which was founded roughly in Nineteen thirty nine to\nTeach the art of escape innovation or in the previous war a there was no such instruction there was no such a huge you weren't given supplies you were it given compasses in math in case you were shot down and so in World War two they started M. I. nine to help pilots who came down behind enemy lines and Jim Bennett\nWho learned the art of escape and World War one was one of the lead lecturers going from air base to air base throughout the war and it was only until I got to a gym Bennett and read his lectures about what he did and Holtzman and uh then I came to\nThe store it occurs to me Neal and I I only speculate here that the reason the uh the escape\nTechniques used in your book are so familiar and we see them in the great escape movie and I've read stories around the writing of that great escape movie is that Bennet is the link\nHe was teaching what you need the chemicals that camera or making friends with the camp up a camp super numerous numerous on keeping lookouts it's all recognizable and it would have been Bennett that carries that string of knowledge end of the second war\nYeah I mean it was not just been it it was a number of of of the world war one escape heroes a Bennett was probably one of a line of of of a dozen lectures but they were teaching\n'em the art of escape and they were teaching lessons that they learn and so they use the echoes in the stories of World War one and World War two\nUm and I will say that in my nine was remarkable organization in World War one roughly five hundred and Seventy a officers and enlisted ranks who found themselves behind enemy lines made it back to freedom in World War two those numbers amount to roughly thirty three\nThousand yes an important detail here at least in the first war what we're talking about it was incumbent upon the officers to attempt to escape at all times at that that was their orders when they were captured they were not passive\nThey were not passed of 'em I mean there were there were a bunch there was a subset who are inveterate escape escape is I mean you you just couldn't keep him down\nOr there were others who were told and knew that they should escape or to occupy the Germans are in preventing that up but the subset these escape artists were the ones who were were going after the walls a night and day for the moment they were captured\nAnd that's what we're addressing that subset who are supported by the whole camp all of the prisoners support them\nI've distracting keeping the guards away or supporting them with supplies everything but we're going to go to Holtzman didn't via some other camps where our heroes spend

only like\nOther empires in that the British maintain that they have levels of control\nThat it's a decentralized empire they also have levels of a of of ownership\nFor example there are the Sackler dominion though where the British travelers have gone and then there are the places where Britain dominates with trade and then there are areas where Britain goes and it maintains control because it feeds that is making itself and empire\nLet's speak first to confront the Sessler\nA parts of the British Empire that would be Canada Australia New Zealand and South Africa and if you take it to heart

feel still ate tied to the old country and we'll fight in from ... in the middle east where every teeth and\nSaid that that aspect of it in hot he's won that actually strengthens during\nThe British also treat other parts of their empire less well yeah let's speak of India because I Believe that there were a your numbers are there were a million men involved in the conquest of the Ottoman Empire the parts of the Ottoman Empire\nThat Britain or a dominated in Concord in Lawrence of Arabia is most famous of course but we also have other conquest\nAnd yet they were led by British officers and India did not get rewarded in fact it was punished or you'd have to say with some of the abuses of the thirties and forties how was India separate in the thinking after Nineteen Eighteen\nWell I'm ... Indians a political reform people like ... himself\nSupport the British war but rather like I monitored Irish nationally saying look if we help the British to win which\nIs supposedly for the liberty of small nations like Belgium Cynthia ... advice on our case\nFor great to liberties but\nI'm the Indian on me that you describe it as a volunteer home an even bigger volunteer army\nIn the second world of course volunteering habits a multitude of sins many of these people are actually doing it in order to ensure a reasonable fly with a steady income for their families and so and it's not exactly\nA willed or an enthusiast for the call but nevertheless the Indian armies hugely important um the problem\nIndia eats that this is a huge country that they had never intended to control they don't really control it the whole structure is based on a network of client teacher dealing with\nThe key people in the right places providing them with with the the the means they need to keep their rent and supported happy so it's a constant juggling act\nIf it ever comes to force the British never had hung up holding India down um and the creches um become more and more acute in the twenties and thirties but what's interesting is that um\nEven in the ... mid Nineteen sixties when there is a huge argument about whether to give to India the kind of devolved writes um those have been given to the secular call it is the whites that local news like Australia or Canada\nUm uh the British managed to do that they managed to keep the juggling act going to a reasonable degree\nSo that it's possible for serious and well informed British officials in India or in the Nineteen thirties to him busy the idea that the Britain may still be in overall control of India in the Nineteen eighties something that now seems to us absolutely incredible\nSo one of the point I'm trying to make in the book is that\nThe second ... he's\nPerhaps more important than the first Nineteen fourteen Eighteen in really destroying the foundations of an ... want the Japanese do in a way that doesn't happen in the ... what the Japanese do in Nineteen forty one forty two is exposed the limits of white rule\nIn Asia because of that dramatic comb quest all the Philippines Singapore laugh and so on which showed that the apparently so powerful omnipotent white men do not have in the end that kind of power but that isn't so clear even in the Nineteen sixties\nI'm Glad you mentioned Japan because that comes back to riverside ... large orange and Kleiman so\nAh and there's a scene a repeated often Everytime ... mentioned um you just Wilson coming in and seeing the three leaders of state on their hands and knees over large map drawing up the world and you just picture that now with all these contradictions Wilson gives them", "show_name": "The John Batchelor Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Newton", "day": "10"}
