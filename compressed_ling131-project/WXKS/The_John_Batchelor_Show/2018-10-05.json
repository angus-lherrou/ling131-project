with you thanks for having me I I Do jog and I I think as you said uh that there have been some remarkable\nThings happening and Saudi Arabia in terms\nOf the reform agenda of Mohammed bin Salman the crown prince uh the darker side of this of course a was evident a late last year in November at the Ritz Carlton hotel in Riyadh when you suddenly a in the middle of the night had several hundred\nPrinces and a business baseball and former government ministers being rounded up\nAnd detained um and that's actually a shaken down and and what was called an anti corruption campaign or to give up billions of dollars to uh to the government\nAnd in Riyadh um that was kind of a warning signal but people understood as anti corruption campaign since then we've seen several more ways of arrest this time against 'em\nA lot of activist at a dissident a human rights campaigners in Saudi Arabia\nEven some who are who are outright supportive of Mohammed bin saw men and yet all of them are arrested rounded up on spurious charges gave in Vietnam very level due process and uh all of these things I think um [noise]\nUh really are raising questions amongst precisely the people particularly in the international community but as well as Saudi domestic investors who mom had been Solomon is relying on the poor or billions of dollars and and investments to make\nAnd be as his vision twenty thirty of economic diversification moving away from oil building a vibrant private sector [noise] a reality\nAnd the fact is that over the course of the last year foreign investment into Saudi Arabia has collapsed and Saudis themselves are engaged in a massive capital flight\nOut of the country are so this is a serious problem and then a lot of it is I think self inflicted wounds that\nThat I think a more active and focused American diplomacy could help out\nSo the the changes you you you wrote that the Trump Administration needs to start worrying about these reform efforts\nAnd it's it's good because you're concerned about the stability of the regime but also about how foreign investors will ah will address it\nDo you think that there's a way right now given the reports of economic

or other steps he can take\nI certainly haven't given up Malcolm I I think there's still a norm is potential and as this young\nLeader and and doing things that I think are absolutely essential if

believe that they have a special rates because they're finding a whole series of\nOf the law suits at the international court of justice done by the way the Iranians that they were also against the United states\nAnd they claimed the big victory because the court said that the United states and sanctioned humanitarian aid which they don't\nUh there are exemptions for it but much of that what they describe it civilian things like airport played parts are really for aircraft that are used for military uh terrorists purposes as well but the the Palestinians\nAre have sued or a an a number of

are are are legitimate expression so that that the frustration\nIran sanctions Malcolm they're more coming but I Want you to talk about the Iranians winning overturning sanctions by from the U.S\nWell these are the sanctions image about humanitarian sanctions at the court of justice\nAnd the um the fact is you know the mullahs take the medicine that we're allowing and other things they sell the black market to make money they don't really have the concerns of the people are at their declaring this a victory which it is not at all\nAnd I think that the United states will continue to apply the sanctions and not to punish the people but to to um let the government know the government of Iran it as long as it continues its aggressive in a hostile policies at ... at your Monica designs\nThat these things are going to continue and we're going to see also showdowns coming at the ... and the pressure on Iran is going to build today both vote announced it they're pulling out\nWhich is a big

and the cold for cutting all the ties imposing sanctions supporting the U.S\nDespite the fact that the government in Germany and the others are are posing as so there's going to be increased pressure

secretary he's a graduate of the Naval Academy Nineteen eighty three\nHe flew the U H one in which Tom tells me is the Huey he flew it for the fleet and he's now a helping the fleet understand what it needs for the future especially the people in the fleet\nThere is a speech that Tom gave to the U.S Naval Academy graduating class this year and it's available on YouTube for all of you who understand the navy it's a pleasure to watch a speech to young people\nTrying restless in their seats in the hot sun trying to imagine what leadership is going to be like well gentleman leadership is what Tom looks like because he was once in those seats and now he's the under secretary\nOr Tom a very good evening to you thank you for this I Begin with the puzzlement what does it mean that you are now the chief management officer of the department of the navy good evening to top\n... thank you John and thank you so much for having me on your show I'm a great admirer of your of you and your format and so it's a it's an honor for me to be here\nUm but to explain the the my position as the chief management officer the navy this is something that the Congress are placed in the last several years ago and it actually had its genesis\nOr in the early to thousands when I was here before is the deputy undersecretary of defense for financial management and the Congress was looking at ways to to assert the management leadership of the department and the political or in the political appointees\nAnd they struggled with how they would do that um because there are so many ... their way to raise your responsibilities for folks\nIn these positions is pretty broad and they want it to ensure that somebody at the senior levels and each of the military departments or would have someone responsible for managing the business operations to include business transformation business systems modernization all\nThe things that many of the things that the private sector has gone through in the last ten or Twenty years with respect to modernizing how they do business\nImplementation of technologies a streamlined supply change or things like that if they want they want to try to elevate leadership for that or to the most senior level as possible and that apartment and so they they designated each of the service under secretary says achieve management officers for their service\nAnd they also created a new position in the department of defense call the uh chewed management author of the department of defense you also have that responsibility generally for the overall DOD enterprise\nSo what you're looking at it as a trading the challenges of the ... the way international companies do to assemble their products and sell it and watch it in and re interact with their customers in your case the customers of the people of the United states so in general are you taking on a task that is\nA that is ongoing or you inventing this for your first time I remember being told that the U.S department of defense has never been audited is that accurate\nThat is the entire department has not been audited as a department\nThat is happening right now that is one of my responsibilities as the chief management officer and one of the things that the Congress was looking at traditionally the audit function and the audit readiness function has been driven out of the chief financial officer position\nUm but one of the things that I've done in the navy is elevated to my position because it's more than just a financial management problem or challenge\nIt's an enterprise wide challenge particularly when you have business systems in IT that span across a variety of functions from Personnel Management\nA logistics supply chain they all have different environments and almost every decisions that may that is made and those environments has a financial application that needs to be traceable and accountable to the taxpayers so that's really what uh so the the audit right now that we're we're undergoing is for the first time\nThe department of defense or writ large is going through a\nDepartment wide financial management audit or each of the services ... has hired at different audit for him to do that um and we're on that path right now and those results should be out in the November timeframe\nYes you were in the navy and then you transition I think that's the polite word that the navy uses from wearing a uniform to not wearing uniforms being in the reserves and\nWere at an audit firm price Waterhouse I Believe so this is calling upon your skill set that you learned after navy [noise] um I Would I ... I\nIf that's true in some sense in another sense when I when I left the navy I actually worked in the private sector doing corporate mergers and acquisitions\nUm both in the aerospace industry as well as in in IT Services so I gained some experience there and then when I came back to the department after nine eleven for a short stand about five years I really got stepped into understanding what the ... the management and business challenges were and the D O D\nWhich I then when I went to price Waterhouse Coopers then was doing that with clients both here and internationally I was the global defense leader for the firm\nAnd so I Would travel around the world speaking to other militaries about some of the management challenges that they had and it's interesting that there really aren't very many militaries and defense establishment and the world that uh for which the United states has a good comparison because we're so much larger than everybody else\nBut it was a fascinating a time for me because what I think I learned is that a lot of these smaller countries who have for our very risque or resource constrained\nHave become a lot more creative than I think we have become in terms of how we manage business um and so there are a lot of those types of lessons that I'm trying to to bring here to the navy\nI Want to apply this to a real time concept which is a naval education and I talk all the time to the Naval War college I in fact in fact I spoke to professor Jim homes last night about the Decatur incident and I learned a deal talking the Naval War college\nIt's a it's a pleasure because that is that's the that's the ideas of the navy for the last hundred years there's also the Naval Academy where you spoke so how does on ability or\nA clean sheet review I think that's a technocrat technical term how does that apply to the institutions educational lead you to to ... the navy\nWell John I think that that at the end of the day or are competitive advantage I think in this country is always going to be um our ability to outflank our adversaries um whether that's in a business\nOr in war and so as we look at the future of the navy and where the navy should be headed in our whole defense a stylish and she'll be headed\nIt's really where if you look at success organizations a private sector or whatever the ones that are really a done well in this in this era of rapid change are the ones that are the most agile\n\nI'm John Donvan and this is the John ... Thomas mode leaves the under secretary\nOf the United States Navy and his task right now as chief management officer is to put all the death in a line however the the fleet is not so neat as a classroom and I reached a deal about the challenges that the fleet most recently\nWe had an incident in spradley islands where the ... class distorted USS Decatur was challenged recklessly bio warship are they near peer review of a fellow I think that's one way of putting it ... the fleet the president when he was a candidate and now during his first Eighteen months of his administration\nHas talked about a fleet of three hundred and fifty five ships I understand that that is a big number and inside that we're making decisions so I Want to concentrate on the surface warfare right now\nDo you right now I have a vision of where the Navy's going for dealing with for example the first island chain and the second island chain in the Pacific in the theoretical problem of\n... anti access area denial weapons in the Pacific does the navy have a vision of where it wants to go to your opinion\nYeah I think I think John that we do and we're constantly reassessing that and um [noise] what you mentioned the fleet a fleet structure announces that's that's being done right now for fleet structure assessment\nI'm looking to have some conclusions outta that later this fall um but yeah it's something that they are constantly were constantly looking at mostly this falls in the area of the chief of naval operations and his team to look at that and to understand what that means\nA in reference to your three fifty five number I think ah if you saw on when I had my swearing in speech where my job I talked about uh that I like to call three fifty five plus because I think\nWhen we think about what that structure is going to look like I don't think anyone really knows right now specifically a we have some goals in mind but my view is that the that eventually that the plus is going to be more than just traditionally what we think of ships but it will include it will also include a unmanned a\nLethality um and a lot of uh things that will keep our our our opponents guessing about what our capabilities might be\nWell I go right to UAB Z because my understanding is that the uh the aircraft carriers which are the centerpiece is the gems of the solar system right now they have their wings that are not capable by themselves to extending into the\nUh first island chain or because of the anti access area denial weaponry that the Chinese have developed for example and one answer to that area are you a these are you satisfied that the way the tanker tank or not the not a not a not a strike platform but the tanker is going to make the all\nThe air the air wings more effective in future\n[noise] well I think that uh I think the decision on the empty twenty five is the right is the right decision for us for now but I understand when you when you develop a technology like that at that level of sophistication there always opportunities to build off of that\nOr to develop other capabilities office off of that and so I obviously we're looking at all those types of things as part of this force structure assessment\nI'm clearly that the um our adversaries and that in that region or have developed capabilities that um put the carrier at risk and I as I mentioned I've heard you discuss this with Jerry and I I Know that are just published a paper as well\nBut I say Center for new American security about these very matters yes\nSo um I I mean you can't argue with the with the sort of the physics there um but we are looking at a alter types of opportunities to counter that strategy or to counter that ah that capability gap and that's what the force structure assessment will be looking at\nWhat we're what also Tom I'm learning is that the navy is a knowledge center not just sell hardware and software and the challenges now are to recruit and retain\nA the agile minds you talked about before are are do you have a plan for that to do in ... or two in some fashion ... hold on to the people you educate them to have people you've educated come back to you\nJohn it's very it's an interesting point and I always um I always tend to sort of push back on this concept of ... or retain um because my experience in the private sector particularly working for a large sort of consulting for\nIs that uh we found that it was more successful to think about people bringing people into a network um because you you basically we have a large egos\nPeople on the national security space a contributing variety of different areas from being on the contractor side the research side the academic side as well as operational forces\nAnd and my view is that a yes we want to recruit people we want to train them educate them\nBut um we want to be able to retain them in the ecosystem so we have actually passing laws that allow us to hire people directly from industry now more senior levels without having to bring the man that you know the old one and some level we can bring them in more laterally\nCommensurate to whatever experiences they have in the private sector and I think those are the types of things you have to think a lot more creatively about uh in order to build a sort of actual force as agile ecosystem of human capital or it's going to allow us to be able to compete\nFinal thoughts for the moment I'm you graduated in Nineteen eighty three the Reagan Administration into a six hundred\nFleet six hundred ship Navy I believe something in a big number that I think we're now about two eighty\nOr you say to the academy in your speech that you quote a Secretary Mattis or your job is to protect the nation your opinion Tom right now you're talking to the moms and dads here are we protecting now with ...\nWell I think the number is always a an interesting debate\nAt when we when we were driving toward the six hundred ship navy and when I was commissioned in eighty three ah John Lam and with the secretary and he was driving to a six hundred ship navy and it was you know the great things about the great one of the greatest elements of that particular arrow is that we\nHad a very very well articulated strategy and it was very little confusion about what direction we were had a I think that was just fantastic and we did reach six hundred at one point but it was probably about the time when I got out of the navy um what was more important about that I think with sort of the signal that it's sad\nThat we were serious um and uh to to our anniversary at that time the Soviet Union that we were serious um and it made them second gas and think hard about um whether or not they were going to be a viable force to compete against us and ultimately I think they determined that they could not be\nSo I'm a part of it part of it I think is a is is that there's a huge amount of symbolism and that but also even at the time when we had that in many number of ships out there we still only had about a hundred and fifty a hundred and sixty of them out they're standing at any one given time are we now have two hundred and eighty five ships\nBut we're still trying to steam and have that kind of presence of about a hundred and twenty a hundred and forty out standing at any one time [noise]\nSo what it's doing is putting a strain on that that on that top line number now or much better at maintenance were much better at sort of keeping availability or ships are are more reliable\nBut we definitely just need more in order to be able to cover the geography that the nation as requiring us to cover\nThomas ... is the under secretary of the United States Navy his task is chief management officer of the vast vast fleet and all of its attendant personnel moms and dads and the children of and also the serving officers and enlisted men it's a vast chat task\nOr however the twenty first century is going to

Fox News was that it will take its procedural vote this morning on the\nNomination of Supreme Court nominee judge Brett Kavanaugh the outcome of the vote to proceed will be a key indicator whether Senate Republicans have the votes they need for information if\nKirsten Gillibrand is dangerous for Israel and I go through I we had many reasons but we boiled down to five um those ... and to me they're starting\nYeah let's begin the first one because this is about the Democratic party Senator Ben Cardin is one of the con sponsors of the Israel anti boycott act\nIn the government and the Congress and this is to oppose the DDS movement the boycott investment in sanctions movement not a controversy old boy I'm not an opposition not at all and Jill a brand was for it before she was against it is that the fact\nOnly was before it actually she was a sponsor she was one of the sponsors originally I was on the Israel and I were caught act which could be more straightforward and then when she meets with the ACLU\nAnd then she had a bunch of town halls where you add a radical anti Israel groups showing up like Jewish Voice for peace like us campaign for a Palestinian rights on ... and they're questioning or about her support for the beauty as bill\nAnd then she withdrew so it's not just that she in general with support she actually withdrew legislative support from this\nClear bill a bill that that couldn't be any more clear\nOn it opposes the extremist illegitimate beat the yes campaign\nThat tries to boycott singled out Israel the only democracy in the middle east the only democracy by the way Kirsten Gillibrand mutual leader where women in the middle east have equal rights whereas the videos movement doesn't go after or even actually ignore as a Muslim\nAnd I am throughout the middle east who are being persecuted so she pulls away from that and then she tried to kind of have it both ways she said that she would support a future bill ... she says that she has some problems with\nUm whether there's a piece on free speech how well actually the Democrat members of a\nA Senate and her colleagues have explained to her this has nothing whatsoever to do with free speech and also I Know that there is a particular radical\nOf anti Israel radicalism as Raphael ... one of 'em who was associated with jello brands campaign he is one of the founders of if not now\nWhich is a radical anti Israel group and also\nAh the founders of Jews for Linda and Linda ... who is closely associated with children he takes responsibility for Julie Brown backing off the PBS bills so I don't think\nIt's about free speech clearly she goes to a bunch of town halls where anti Israel protesters could in front of her about this he says this anti Israel activist says he's behind flipping Gillibrand on the ...\nSo we have that then of course\nYou have um jeweler brand provided really critical support at a time\nOff for the Obamas disastrous nuclear deal I'm at a time where you had some key Democrats going both ways wavering\nUm and then junior Brandon supports it and then you have other Democrats um jump on the\nObama again a scandal is a very dangerous or a nuclear deal bandwagon so she also very much help\nThere with a deal that beeping town yo of course had to was so nervous about that you join a addresses a joint I'm a ... meeting of Congress to Warren and this is very rare for an Israeli prime minister due to do about this deal\nYou know so I'm looking at\nDealer brands praise open craze in time magazine for anti Israel radical Linda SARS for\nA little of course famously said nothing is creepy you're then as I Am as\nA and then she claimed that you can't be a feminist and it was ins which again I point to the fact that Israel is the only country I mean I'm tired of Middle East lend us our store where women are treated equally is actually a feminist by definition should and in fact must support the state of Israel\nUm she comes out and she has praised source or including and at time magazine piece where she wrote about SARS or um he's spoken at numerous events all with SARS or with other ... the U.S leaders and so yes I Am very concerned about\nThat and here's the puzzle Dustin ... Brent oh her success to Chuck Schumer he sponsored her originally when she was appointed to the Senate seat and he endorsed her all to my memory all through these last years what does he say about this\nControversy will conduct by her this transformation\nWell you know not much publicly and and I would like Chuck Schumer who um has on many occasions out evidence himself would say what you will about his domestic politics as a pretty stable supporter of the Jewish state\nWhere he opposed the Iran deal for example quite quite quite a quite a bit at odds with President Obama at the time\nSo where is he when his colleague in New York is clearly taking a calculated position against Israel all I I actually would love to see um major members of the Democratic party who support Israel and then by the way it by\nJust at the very definition of support a western civilization and democracy or do something about what seems to be a troubling\nI'm a problem with and the Democrat Party and this is part of the struggle and the fact that you have Joe ... who you know I don't know what she believes but she has in till recently been a pretty staunch supporter of Israel the fact that she with um eyes\nToward twenty twenty would take this sea change um is really telling 'em she's gone to town hall events where um she cited and I have um all of her quotes from the article or with an anti Israel activists\nWho claimed that ah Israel doesn't respect Palestinian rights and then also she uh she accused beeping Antonio who has been begging mock about ... to come to the bargaining table and\nWho by the way has offered in the past hour or an ... a state numerous times I'm and Israel has she accused him of\nNot having a plan for peace which is absurd outlawed and wearing of course the fact that the Palestinians have walked away from every\nPlan ever given to them and in fact instead have started into photos and rejected that she didn't criticize about 'em and I also know that\nTo look around and I think that New Yorkers\nPalm should pay careful attention she\nVoted against confirming David Freeman as right President Trump's and bachelor Israel and of course Friedman is a stone and in fact I I don't think Israel has ever had an American ambassador more pro Israel\nA than David Friedman as you are part of the backbone of support for the Jewish state and she voted\nAgainst him a very interesting\nAnd she's now reelection campaign for twenty Eighteen bought her eyes on twenty twenty so we have much to watch and Senator Joe brand presuming she's accessible they're inclined to Breitbart Jerusalem we're going to Florida next and the Florida gubernatorial race I'm John bachelor this is the best in show [noise]\nBalance of nature's fruits and veggies in\nA capsule I care for a while ago I was walking and\nFind her right\nRight right and I don't know what happened I've had the actor accept that and my aunt and my great and I ...

U.S Supreme court he's an associate justice of I Believe TR refers to him as the bearded iceberg that is right what do we know about you just you want to be president what are his\nWhat ... what is his thinking he seems pious and unavailable a hundred years later\nYeah I mean it's it's not unprecedented to jump off the bench and run for president goes out to be Parker did in Nineteen oh for for the Democrats success not successfully but who knows\nAnd so huge does not want it though he tells his wife his wife watch in the run he says if if I run that job will put me in the grave okay I don't want it\nBut he's he's willing to do it to save the party and to save the country from Wilson he and Theodore Roosevelt do not get along it is it is fire and now you wrote the G R I hate it you absolutely cutting it was a\nRival because he was a unavailable because he had no passion what was\nA lot of reasons I think because of the personality because he what could be a rival as a younger progressive because TR has tried to appoint a successor annoying somebody before would tap that didn't work out there were issues when a Hughes was governor of New York\nAnd when they argue over patronage matters and T R goes out of his way too big foot chooses unofficial announced that he's going to run for president in Nineteen away by having this in laboratory crazy anti business statement delivered to Congress\nAnd which just sucks all the air out of the huge announcement and when a journalist asked tiara why he did this and he says well you know if you use is going to play the game he's gonna have to know the rule\nWe come to the critical moment the ... of the progress of this meeting and simultaneously with the Republicans want to nominate\nRoosevelt and march into the Republican convention saying you need us back if you're going to be Wilson here's our mad and carry the day that water my reading of your a presentation is that would have work\nPR holds back why\nDoesn't seem to know what he's doing really it's he's he's ... every way around whether he knows that that that the Republicans would would reject him again and can't face that rejection\nCould could very well be but George Perkins and a guy name a a king\nJohn T king who's a boss from Bridgeport, Connecticut have devised a strategy where they're going to delay the nomination of TR by the progressive which essentially thinks his candidacy because they've got\nTo really threatened the Republicans into saying we're going to do a third party again and we're we don't care what ... what could a worked because the Republicans everybody says you know with you Ryan they weren't they weren't they were not excited one of the reasons why this\nPeriod gets glossed over in American history is because the Republican convention is\nSo list list so on the floors list list but the machinations going on behind the scenes with T are are fascinating\nTR sends a telegram or a letter communication to the progressive to nominate lodge Henry Cabot Lodge that was the moment I dropped the book that is right just the way that the the progressive thought what you see crazy yes just about\nEveryone does and and the when he does this as a dodge to get out of the of running as the progressive candidate\nA people like William Alan White the progressive journalist are disgusted everyone or in the ... either ... talks about how Tiahrt has used the progressive somehow sickening\nIt is a large is not a progressive she called it a cowardly staff yes and wish you could write you know so many people could write back then I just marvel at how good the writing of the language cowardly stabbed by ... you don't want\nThat on your grave okay so Roosevelt doesn't make the correct decision\nThe convention nominated Charles Evans Hughes is Roseanne was going to campaign for well at first\nHe went went when he gets to the news he is so confused this point even though everything is done has led up\nTo use his nomination when they give him the news at at a sack of more hilly looks like his dog died\nAnd it's like well you won't see me as almost like you won't have T.
