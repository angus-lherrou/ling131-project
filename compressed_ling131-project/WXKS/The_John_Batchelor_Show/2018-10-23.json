station [noise]\nShowdowns building at the border I'm Carmen Robert Fox news\nThese were bodyguards vetted bodyguards for the Afghan ... a police yes and they've been with that I had a long history or was the shooter somebody new do we know ...\nYou know we're going by what the Afghan officials are saying right now so it's a little spotty but it seems like he was relatively new um but he somebody who managed to work is way way\nInto the inner circles around ... it's it's surprising because we're Zeke um again this is a guy who who survived dozens of us at a fascination temps or the years if you had to put together a kill list for the Taliban and al ... in southern Afghanistan John he be number one on that list this nobody nobody\nWould have been surprised by the fact they wanted to kill them desperately for years so this is it surprising about this is the fact that they were successful in getting somebody into his inner coterie they're sort of in the security situation for this meeting to it and have this attack be successful\nThese attacks starting with the attack in Kandahar and now the most recent the attack on Iran leading to the death of a check soldier these are taking place inside the larger story of the Afghanistan parliamentary elections underway\nWe've talked about that on and off over these last Eighteen years the democracy comes to Afghanistan a Tom you report that the Taliban has declared these elections I guess the word because it's\nDevil certainly the work of the u._s. and are they killing people who vote Tom what do we know\nWell John I think it's very important here to walk through with the Taliban is said about these elections for this purpose\nI'm the U.S policy to state policy is to try and get the Afghan tall blond to reconcile with the government\nLaid out its arms or share power and some sort of political ... power sharing system now for those of us have watched the tall bond for years and track everything they say\nWe realized that that sort of absurd goal on the face of it that basically the tall bunny said over and over again we're resurrecting or Islamic EMR of Afghanistan were the only legitimate party in town well these are collections approach the Taliban ratcheted up its rhetoric of that statement after statement after steaming\nSaying that basically don't participate in these elections if you have them or if you if you open up your homes or your facility that as voting places you can be come under attack and in fact the Taliban has um attack claimed hundreds of tax\nAs the elections were underway it seems like it had some effect on the elections it's very difficult to say how much but it the bottom line is that the Taliban rule that this was a religious imperative to go and disrupt these elections\nThat's not the rhetoric or this this this um sort of a statement that you would expect from a group that was looking to politically reconcile and when you track through the statements John what we noticed was that they were actually being issued by different commissions within the Islamic EMR of Afghanistan or is it being attributed to different\nShadow government bodies within the tall blond and why that's significant is that there's there telegraphing that these are the conditions that are going to rule Afghanistan once the Americans get out and we have our way once again\nIt strikes me because I've been reading a Churchill biography job brand new one from ... Roberts it strikes me that the Taliban is beginning to look organized and the way that the IRA looked organized\nTo the British authorities right after World War one as they took on the black in town where the British authorities and as they took on the IRA it was part of terrorist organization but also part a shadow government\nThat was in place for the settlement with the with the Brits that produce modern Ireland\nYeah and the ... the difference here is that this there's I don't see any prospect for real settlement um if you go through the sort of Islamic jurisprudence that this ... organization\nRelies upon they're saying that it's the only an Islamic system the way we define it can rule over Afghanistan so even though sharia and different Islamic sort of um\nLanguages pepper throughout the Afghan constitution and of course they call themselves\nAnd Islamic entity with the Taliban is set right all along is that only our version of Islam and our ... ways can rule over Afghanistan and they're they've been very clear they reject the the Afghan government as illegitimate they reject of course the U.S presidents as illegitimate\nAnd they reject the elections and they say that it violates their version of Islam They said these elections and the whole parliamentary process\nIs on Islamic is what they've its way of describing this whole election process is on Islamic that is not an organization that's looking to settle and come to terms and sort of sort of give us the sort of face saving deal on our way out\nDoes disconnect in any fashion to the report we had a Taliban and U.S officials meeting in Doha, Qatar earlier in the month well\nYou know John this is why I brought up the American reaction to this attack and the fact that they're still reticent to say that it was the Columbine and plant the obvious and say the Taliban killed our number one ally in southern Afghanistan and wounded Americans in this attack\nMy point is is that basically the Americans are so desperate to reach a deal with the Taliban they'd even when the Taliban has this major infiltrate or attack they create them a a a sniffing power back and forth in Kandahar and the top American military command and all that Afghanistan is president when this attack takes place\nAnd we don't come out and mealy condemned the Taliban and point a finger at them that tells you were not committed to identify any enemy let alone to feeding them\nAnd therefore the negotiations are a false false ... of a false signal were not sincere and our negotiations they're not sincere and there's and subsequent headlines can be ignored is that is that a conclusion we can draw here to\nOh I I think were sincere and our negotiations were sincerely week the point is that were just desperate to get any sort of face saving deal we can get they know that and they're looking to do what they've done in the past which has extract concessions string us out and basically humiliate our Afghan allies that's what they've done in the past ... years or ... and that's certainly the game bland that they're using this\nTime does the Taliban in any way indicate that they that the Taliban believes in all of a set of rations believes that ice is leaving in the new year do they indicate that did they tell their people that does does al ... tell the Taliban that\nWell kite as predicted a since the election of President Trump\nThat this is what kind of said directly they said that the America First policy meant that America was going to retreat from Afghanistan and this is the beginning of the end for their superpower status just as it was for the Soviets that's what they've said all along and the Taliban has somewhat more mixed rhetoric on that they want to highlight for example with these past elections\nThey tried to say that this is trying to justify prolong the presence of the foreigners here in Afghanistan we just sort of the rhetoric they're using but I think there are other indications they know that we are certainly looking to head for the doors\nTom Johnson of the foundation for the defense of democracy reporting on the news the fresh news\nOf more killings of ice ...

J. are the great the great lakes my colleague in cost and we're joined by Gordon Chang our colleague to comment on incident in the Taiwan Strait\nWithin these last days US Navy sail to guided missile warships through the Strait of Taiwan Taipei ministry of defense describe this as a routine passage to international waters\nNothing routine when you add the U.S navy warships in presents us has Curtis Wilbur D. D. J. fifty four and USS\nAnd teach them see gene fifty four conducted according to the U.S military website military times a routine Taiwan Strait transit October twenty second in accordance with international law that yesterday their time 'cause it's tomorrow now is twenty third\nShift transits where the Taiwan straits demonstrates the U.S commitment to a free and open Indo Pacific\nUs naval continue to fly sale at operate anywhere in international law allows this is the U.S Pacific Fleet commenting Gordon this follows a report last week that B. fifty twos I Believe to be fifty to slow over the south China Sea which is open water\nAnd this follows repeated reports of the Chinese a PR the People's Republic of China China flying a nuclear capable bombers clockwise and counterclockwise around Taiwan\nHow do you measure is there a change in tempo your Gordon we moved from the Decatur in the south China Sea to the Curtis Wilbur and the ... and the ... Taiwan straits is there an escalation cycle going on between the U.S navy and the P L A navy good evening to you garden\nOr good evening John it that is ... and yes I Do think that there's been an increase in the temple\nAnd of course this comes at a time where they're all sorts of questions about the U.S China relationship in general\nWe're seeing a deterioration in a number of different areas which is a good thing John because the United states now is not socialist at a survey Chang and it was actually telling them we're not afraid of them any more that we're just going to do what we want to do\nAnd we're not going to take into account their concerns and that is a change of four decades of policy which unfortunately\nFor decades hasn't worked\nThe Decatur incident that was the near collisions the challenge by the Chinese commander which you have described as directed by Xi Jinping himself\nIn this incident with the Curtis Wilbur and the ... we're told the Chinese shadow them and the Taiwan Strait does that mean that the Chinese backed off or is the Taiwan Strait significantly different in their minds from the desperately islands\nWell I think that it's certainly an ... in China is buying the Taiwan Strait is different because they really to view it as close to home because they believe that Taiwan is part of the People's Republic they don't really view the Taiwan Strait as international water\n... they don't even think that stop trying to see if international water but the south China Sea and the ... are a lot farther from homeland China than a Taiwan and Taiwan Strait so what is different\nUm you know they were just shadowing the two warships um they they don't I think we're going to really I don't think they were going to really try anything so they normally shadow freedom of navigation operations when they did so this time\nThat is a garden what has been the response of other nations in the area to this type of escalation\nStudy is this is a really important question you ask because it's not just the United states you know we're seeing Britain and France and we're seeing Australia also chip in\nThat these operations in coastal waters\nAnd that's important so that China understands that it is irritating not just Washington but everybody so they can understand that a coalition is forming against them but certainly they can't stand up to the coalition that's a really good story that is being given to the Chinese not just by us but by a lot of other countries as well\nPuzzle then guard a watching this escalation if we if it is or is this a tit for tat was going on where's it going what what's the endgame here are clearly both navies are have lots of resources\nYou know there's a lot of resources here and and we can see more freedom of navigation operations more transits through the international straits I think the endgame is essentially we are going to see either a formal or a de facto agreement to protect Taiwan against Chinese attack\nYou know we have 'em all sorts of things we've got three communiques which are we we got six assurances from the Reagan Administration which were better at the Taiwan Relations Act of Nineteen Seventy nine um but this is actually moving to a point where there's going to essentially being an alliance between Taipei in Washington that's\nThat's important for us to do to tell the Chinese look you know you can say whatever whatever you want but you cannot cross the line because the U.S navy air force\nUm the army we're all going to be there and we are going to defend Taiwan\nThan it sends a very important message again to the other nations in the area doesn't among us resolve and our willingness to help an ally of oh for\nSure for sure you know we've allowed the military balance of power across the straight to actually a road in China's favor and that's something that we said that we wouldn't do but over the course of decades we've allowed that\nMuch more robust response that we're seeing in the Trump Administration is important because it I think it helps keep the peace\nWe have been far too ambiguous about our commitments Taiwan I'd like to see the Trump Administration make it very clear I'd like to see the president actually go to Taiwan and send that symbolic message to Beijing that we are friends and allies with Taiwan and we will never let it go\nThe Russian and Chinese and us defense ministers have all been wandering around negotiating with each other talking with each other inviting each other back and forth is that going to continue regardless of this these incidents in the Taiwan Strait or the south China Sea I'm I'm puzzling about\nHow these defense ministers and our secretary of defense thing called these demonstrations by the navy card\nI think that there'll be some huffing and puffing on the part of ... at first because they won't let this go\nBut uh you know within a month or two maybe several months things will be back to normal the reason is when the United states shows strain the Chinese back off um and so there's going to be a little bit less huffing and puffing than you'd think\nObject lump founding board member

H. A. R. recording chai like cause the Daily Beast and we're joined by ... set riding most recently at\nThe Dallas News about the peninsula Korea Korea Twenty one months ago President Obama handed a failure to President Trump how how do you measure Twenty one months later President Trump's handling of the failure good evening to you\nGood evening John Twenty one months later it is at least we're we've shifted a few of the horrendous constraints that applied a are we out of the mud out of the swan is an insult safe\nUm no we don't know where it's going but some things are being re aligned and given that it was a complete disaster Twenty one months ago or there's some chance of seeing perhaps a way to maneuver out of this garden\nQuota I think that you're right that we're there is a possibility of a good solution but there's also the possibility of one of the greatest tobacco's on American foreign policy because you have President Trump allowing much in the south Korean president who's very pro North Korea\nTo do a number of things which are undermining not only American efforts to do a nuclear armed North Korea but also used to he's undermining democracy and and actually paving the way for North Korea to take over the south I'm not saying that's going to happen but there's a real possibility of that occurring\nHow do you measure it you're Korean diplomacy right now in an age of Trump\nIt's a disaster on the other hand I don't know that I'd chalk that up to Trump I'm at the problem is that Moon Jae in with democratically elected by South Korea which has raised a generation that really doesn't pay a lot of attention to the serious problems\nUh from the north to the real real threat I mean look the south Korea has set up amusement parks years ago along the demilitarized zone not really a wise idea\nOkay and how you're absolutely right that inter Korean diplomacy is incredibly worrying South Korea has a president who seems to be trying to hand over the Democratic thriving south to the north\nThe problem being apart from the humanitarian disaster that that would be a it would be a very bad thing for Kim Jong noon to get his hands on the enormous treasure trove that South Korea all that technology and loot and\nPeople are but as far as how the U.S is able to maneuver given that we can't really ... they're probably limits to what we can dictate to the south Korean president um I think\nI there's been says a lot going on that very hard to read you know what does it mean when president can meet\nA president camera when President Trump meets Kim Jong noon and they they're back so backslapping glad handing in Singapore and then President Trump comes out and says I you know we fell in love he wrote me beautiful letters I take that actually is a form of presidents\nPresident Trump's humor which the presses inclined to take a little bit to literally but uh there are a lot of things going on that are alarming and some of them are pretty strange but if you look at the bigger picture\nAh the things that America is able to do something about beyond the peninsula\nA there is motion and that includes a lot more pressure on China that includes pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal which means Iran is no longer a swimming and the ready cash that it\nAlmost certainly was going to be spending on North Korean military where's um there's greater pressure as far as stronger sanctions I've never thought that sanctions could actually and the north Korean nuclear program but\nThey at least they're cutting off some of Kim's resources\nAnd over and over the question and I don't think we really have the answer but the question is what's the endgame here and that what I was writing the argument that I've been putting forward for a long time is\nThere's no solution to the threat from North Korea that does not that unless there is an end to the regime we're not going to negotiate something so the question is\nWith all these chess pieces moving where is this going\nAnd at least we're sort of we pulled out of the the death trajectory that was going on under President Obama the strategic patience that was a blitz of North Korean missile and nuclear tests and threats\nUm and that might the question I was trying to raise is simply is there anything here that might be leading toward the end of the collapse of the north Korean regime an end to that regime without the U.S having to actually go to war\nThaddeus [laughter] just recorded as you as you mentioned in your piece\nRemained may know the regime in Pyongyang understands what happened to get off you don't play that on their media to remind you sure do yeah they they know that the endgame his for them to go on the skin a history bears aware of that as we are correct correct\nAbsolutely and I you know Kim wants to stay in power he's part of a regime that has been remarkably adept at this North Korea has been officially in existence for Seventy years now three generations of a total of ... state than most repressive on the planet and\nUh but once again the question is where does this go and a ... we do about it the problem is they becoming ever more dangerous\nAnd a ... decades at this point of diplomatic deals have failed I Would put no trust at all in the idea that Kim as simply going to say Oh yes I've been offered a wonderful bright future by the Trump Administration if I just completely denuclearize\nI don't think that might punt secretary of state pump payout believes that's where it's going to go I don't think that's where John Bolton believes that's going to go if you look\nThis period of Trump's sort of over the top diplomacy began just about the time that he brought in a tune into the current positions secretary of state Pompeo and secure national security adviser John Bolton to men who were specifically are on record\nSaying you're not going to get a successful deal with this regime the ... the problem is the regime you know you can't cut a deal that you can verify that the basic\nProblem Gordon we have less than a minute you have another question\nIn your piece you talk about the video that President Trump gave to him at the June twelfth from it about the creator future and I thought your comments about the video were important in terms of where this was all going and I agree with your regime change is the answer thirty seconds\nYeah and the question is is that the goal it's what it needs to be and what gardens referring to is in the happy video about the bright future and the middle of that\nCame a scene of the three aircraft carriers that President Trump said last November\nTo exercise jointly off North Korea that his massive firepower three aircraft carriers almost never exercise together you don't need that much and that's what was in the middle of the happy video given to him I think that was a direct message to make sure that he knows\nThe threat is not remotely gone and while all this jockeying is going on it's like

making expect with themselves and their right he often make suspect himself Trump for several weeks had little to say on Twitter\nOnly last week that he's sort of get back to dean himself which was the biggest break the Democrats have caught in a while so it'll be interesting to see where Trump's approval or falling a later this week and next week or what they that's why they get themselves no favor because all of a sudden they became that\nWhich they said they were running to stop\nThaddeus gentle and one of the messaging messages as the Democrats are running on collectively I think is about health care especially preexisting conditions abs did you have to chew peas crop of candidates come up with any counter messaging on that a president\nJohn a milk out David you go first go ahead\nI'm Sorry about that look I Will just say this is really interesting to me because we saw Democrats lose a thousand seats it um basically over to mid term elections because in part because of the unpopularity of Obamacare and all of a sudden with President Obama out of office and Republicans in a position to actually do something about health care\nThere now on the defensive and Democrats have done a really good job of putting them on the defensive\nOn these two tenets of Obamacare which are pre existing condition the lifetime caps\nAnd some Republicans that I interviewed on the trail uh really straight about it close federal mandates to protect preexisting conditions lifetime cats they they do this through other means but they don't want the government\nTo protect it in other is just kinda bumble over their word and finally got around telling me well yeah I I Believe in these two parts of Obamacare\nSo I think you you you ... your hand of the Democrats here and that they got the better part of this issue\nJohn I was kind of meeting today we're Nancy Pelosi was speaking and she said this election is about health care\nAnd they ... that's the strongest suit fill the last thing they want it to be about the economy which is doing well\nThat is the last thing they want it to be is about a national security and the last thing they want it to be is about the tax cuts although they still make arguments about benefiting the rich the Democrats are running the micro decentralized campaign around the country largely successful in many districts but\nIn the districts where the Republicans are most in trouble\nI see Republican after Republican incumbent doing what David says but just roll over and agree with a Democrat so while the Democrats have a good issue where they need to gain seats the Republicans are agreeing with them\nWe have a GDP number estimates for the third quarter coming next week David I start with you that that promises to be in the neighborhood and I'm quoting Stephen Moore here in the ... which is that the Laffer curve Steve more in the neighborhood of ... percent is that already built in to the argument or is that going to boost things to have it\nI think it's built into the argument in fact I think it's really a better argument for President Trump is twenty twenty than it is for Republican wanting Eighteen ... and look by All right with an economy like this Republican should be in a much better position and the only reason they're looking slightly better than the war and it's only slightly\nBecause the Democrats formal the ball with Brett Kavanaugh I think that that the problem for Republicans with a tax overhaul\nIs that you look at the polling are on it and on balance people disapprove of it it may not make any sense but they did a horrible job selling it and you have some key districts where the elimination of the state and local tax deduction solved\nIs still a problem and so I just think\nThat is good is this you know might have been for the economy and and I'm not arguing that in fact voters have not connected the dots I think that it's the kind of ... that that they can connect in a twenty twenty reelection for Trump but it's not happening in this election John GDP\n[noise] I I think that's sort of amorphous number that people don't really follow what they follow is it's my job secure my worried about losing it and that's my take home pay going up in the last year\nUm there's a mixed bag out there because we've been stagnant wages for over a decade but I think in some key districts especially where I'm you know the companies are hiring again and and the wage and they're increasing wages because of tight labor market conditions\nIn a few key districts the Republicans are being helped by the economy of those are precisely the districts suburban districts in the Midwest and in the south that they have to hold to keep the house\nDavid and John both national national security so when we come back we'll go to national security and that means the care of that\nWhich at this point is the most prominent video I get on the Twitter feed the the five thousand seven thousand

Thaddeus McCotter my colleague can cause W. J. R. and we welcome alcohol lot\nConference presidents major American Jewish organizations there was an overwhelming amount of news from\nThe middle east we begin with a report\nThat Jordan plans to revoke parts of the peace treaty with Israel Malcolm I don't know how to interpret this what is driving us spoken most warmly of King Abdullah the second these many years more than a decade now what is this\n[noise] this is very disturbing and a good evening to both of you it is a it's a story still in the making and it caught or people in Israel I think in Jordan as well as in the United states by surprise\nIn Nineteen Ninety five when they signed the peace treaty between Jordan and to Israel and I was privileged to go there with President Clinton at the time to the Arab up to the desert to to witness to signing was very emotional very celebratory\nHim one of the clauses in this ... dealt with two pieces of property one in the north called cholera or in Hebrew not Ryan and won it in the south about a hundred thirty kilometers north of the um\n[noise] a lot and you're\nA ... a that was called so far in Hebrew a Hummer in in Jordan and this was these were Lance uh they have somewhat of a different status ... each from the other one the one in the south was um it rather than the north\nWas an area that had a had a a hydroelectric plant built in the Nineteen twenties by Jewish farmer Jewish businessman who bought much of the land\nAnd when the agreement was signed um Israel and Jordan in the spirit of friendship agreed that farmers from Israel could continue to plow the land and produced on it but the sovereignty would return to\nJordan and in the middle of it is this island the peace where the hydroelectric plant and ah which had been dedicated by the king\nAnd there's also a memorial nearby to seven young girls from an Israeli school who were mowed down by Jordanian soldier that six more were wounded and if you remember the lake king was saying paid a visit to the families\nIn a very moving a and a sign of humility asking them for forgiveness\nThe second place in the southern place so far uh is is a bit larger and there again the farmers who are dependent upon this for their income or about fifty farming families ah would lose editor of two hundred and fifty acres or so\nUh but it will be very important to them and the dream it that was signed said that it was to last for twenty five years but\nOne year before and that one year anniversary is this week either side could get noticed that they want to re examine or\nTalk about ... or the agreement Jordan exercise that and notified Israel it seems\nWith the public announcement made in Jordan or that they did not\nIntend to renew the agreement when it ends in a year from now or and the agreement says that either side making that announcement would then engage in negotiations in Jordan as saying now they won't engage in\nAny kind of negotiations and it's not clear whether king of the other was upset because he was left out of the ... the Jerusalem negotiations that other recent events\nAnd may prompted it but most of all the domestic demand and this is being celebrated in Jordan and he had received a a petition on many issues but the only one affecting Israel related to this agreement asking that it not be renewed\nSo I guess we'll learn more but the uh you know this is a very valuable to terms of the Israeli farmers and family it's been very peaceful they've cooperated a manager then he has worked there and I think it's a very regretful that has moved in this direction\nThat is what next Malcolm out and how does this parent breach become a healed [noise]\nThat's a very good question and I don't have a good answer because if the if you're a dancer simply saying we're not going to negotiate\nA it could be grandstanding could be you know a a chance for the king to show its constituency that it's being tough\nAnd then during the course of the year they work out some sort of an understanding or right now I don't know what the shape of that could be there are a lot of possibilities because there's heavy investment by the Israeli farmers there there's a lot of money that they put into this over the last Twenty years\nAnd at the um important ... the symbolic importance as well as the economic importance are not gonna sit well with the Israeli people it's certainly not going to help the atmosphere and this you know Israel is very critical to the security of Jordan and Jordan's security is critical to Israel they've said so many times and they have\nExercise that in many more ways than that has made public so\nThe stakes are high but I think that the two sides can find some sort of a compromise\nThat would enable the the agreement somehow stay in force\nAnd maybe Jordan have some face saving additional rural or sovereignty expression\nAs we approach the November for severe sanctions on Iran puzzle we mentioned that he has now confirmed by intelligence sources there and here\nThat Iran is upgrading the rockets with Hezbollah are we looking at a cataclysm hear Malcolm Jordan his ally everything on November for\nThis could be very serious ah in terms of regional development and the message that Iran is taking advantage of the installation of the history hundreds or air defense system by Russia\nTo a risk bringing in these weapons and to to get much

everybody at National Review online\nThat there was a Bloomberg report last week\nThat motors getting to wrap it up does that mean Rosen's gene can direct Muller finished this get it done report to me what does it mean wrap it up good evening to Andy\nGood evening John well it's always been true that Rosenstein could\nExercise authority over\nMahler because he uh in the pecking order he is not only the the official who named\nMueller as special counsel the is the uh he's the deputy attorney general he's also the official in the chain of command that Mahler answers to the reason we thought of him John as a wallflower\nIs really more out of Mr Rosenstein his own mouth than anything else as soon as he appointed\nMueller that very day\nHe had a meeting with top Democrats on Capitol Hill in which he promised them that there would be no interference in bowlers investigation that he would be permitted or basically to do\nWhatever he shows in terms of uh uh you know chasing facts down to wherever they lead and he was given this wide mandate to investigate without\nThe predicate of a a a normal criminal investigation so he has given mall are a very wide berth\nOr the latest reports indicate that uh he being under pressure I Believe from\nUh the White House that is a Rosenstein being under pressure from the White House or because of a number\nOf things not least of the fact the revelations that Rosen steam a ... ... at one point or talked about invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment against President Trump talked about secretly recording President Trump and the White House clearly as\nA a a ... as kind of a a ballast for twenty Fifth Amendment claim that the that the president might not be\nA mentally up to the job um that obviously is a non ... looked upon a with great fondness by the White House so I think they have leaned on Rosenstein is starting to get this over with and Rosenstein the reporting it Blumberg indicates\nA has in turn leaned on smaller\nMeanwhile it has looked like mall are\nHas been has been at least ostensibly doing things that would be consistent with winding down an investigation ... such as staffing down or transferring some of the investigations the indictments that he's brought to other components of the Justice Department so it looks like we could be winding to an end but I'm not holding my breath quite yet\nThat is what are the possibility or very may have for further shall we say ... or a sure ...\n[noise] well I think a Thaddeus that while Mahler has staff down as I have often pointed out uh I did a big terrorism case in the Nineteen nineties with a grand total of three lawyers me and a\nTwo other guys Mahler still even with the down staffing\nA I I think fourteen Thirteen or fourteen lawyers on staff which is a very large staff and they're obviously continuing to work different investigative the angles they are still negotiating as we understand it\nOver the terms of a President Trump's sit down interview by the special counsel including whether that interview\nWil happen at all and if it doesn't happen whether a mall or would take the step of are issuing a subpoena which would be a very controversial and would lead to a lot of litigation we hear that there were also pursuing a some other\nAngles involving potentially contacts between a wiki leaks\nRoger Stone who was a a a friend and associate of the president's but not somebody who formerly had a role in the president's campaign so there were still odds and ends there that are clearly being looked at\nYou told rich Lowry that Muller is not Bob Woodward thank heaven however when I take from that remark is that we're not going to get a narrative that satisfies a TV what we're going to get is either\nNo indictment or indictments we've had some indictments of Russians cheaply and also Manafort for actions that took place before the campaign\nYou believe it's significant however\nThat the sentencing for Michael Flynn has to come on December Eighteenth explain why that tells us that Mueller is going to be disappointing\nYeah let's let's I guess we should sort out two separate things John I think with respect to General Flynn\nWhen he pled guilty it was with the understanding that he was going to cooperate with the investigation and so far as we know he has made himself available for interviews questioning and all like um [noise] generally speaking\nProsecutors\nWhen they have an ability to influence when a sentencing is scheduled do not allow cooperate or to be sentenced by the court until after their cooperation has concluded which usually means any testimony that they're\nRosenstein the deputy attorney general testimony to Congress under oath\nAnd it's a select group of Congress has not a huge committee I think it's too from each side from each side [noise]\nWhy he will say about events of these last weeks\nHe also has a for the first time to my knowledge going on a PR campaign to puff up the department of justice is works for Russia gate these last\nEighteen months by calling it and this is a quote from the wall Street Journal\nThe ... the Russia investigation appropriate and independent and he went to a department of justice figure comes out and talk to the press it tells me they want something what's he want with is is this is this promoting himself as a politician is is to make Hollywood interest how how does this work for it\n[noise] well I think John ... and what I'm fearful of is that what we're seeing is the outlines of how this whole episode is going to be brought\nTo an end and I think that what you what you're starting to see\nOur the outlines of a a kind of a comet data deal in which there were probably no charges or impeachable offenses sided against a President Trump in the mall or investigation and at the same time\nOr what ends up getting soft pedaled is the Justice Department and FBI's investigative tactics in connection with the Trump campaign in the run up to the twenty sixteen election and the first months of the Trump Administration\nUh I I think that this is the way that this is teeing up and it's interesting that Rosenstein would be\nA guy who is going to have this conversation with a very select group as you say are not the full committee but very select a group of a of a high ranking members of Congress who've been looking at this uh I I think that's where we're headed and Rosenstein is the guy who can\nYou speak to both ends of the investigation both the investigation of the Trump campaign and the more investigation Saturdays\n[noise] well that would be unfortunate end it because we've seen evidence on the side of people using their power are investigating the Trump campaign\nAnd trying to sabotage the trucks transition but we've not seen any evidence or Russian collusion by the Trump campaign or by the president himself a Rosenstein does he not\nHave a rare for large stake in that outcome because of some of the things he did switch assigning the eyes of war\nYeah I ... I think so yeah and I think what they'll end up saying that he is is that while the president\nA himself did not take any a suspicious actions and a ... you know while he hasn't done anything a\nCriminal or actionable or he did bring into his campaign these people who had significant connections to Kremlin tied\nPeople and I think that's the way they'll uh pictured which gave the Justice Department the FBI or a good rationale to be\nSuspicious and to take investigative action I'm not saying I agree with this I just I've been I've been thinking for a long while a that this is the way that we are headed and I just think it's very very curious to me\nIt was things number one that President Trump first announced and then did a one eighty on whether he was going to\nAuthorize the public disclosure of the documents that these congressional committees have been\nPressing for so he was going to give them you're going to give us we were going to be able to see what was in those documents Congress was going to be able to see it and then suddenly he changed his mind about that a ... ... ... and you combine that\nWith his John pointed out the sudden appearance of um\nOf of Rosenstein publicly uh the justifications he's a now publicly offering\nUp for the investigation and I see maybe this is just my ah being a cynic maybe this is my old prosecutor antennae paying paying 'em could be any number of things I suppose but I see the outlines of a potential deal here\nTo deal with Rosenstein Andy Rosenstein ... author the Mueller investigation he's written those two letters first letter in the second letter August he has a lot of explaining\nTo do if he's to stay on and the Trump Administration after the elections a lot of explaining because the party the Republican Party sees this as a politicized gambit the whole thing as electioneering\nThe whole thing is a narrative to satisfy the Clintons in December of twenty sixteen and then to drive fund raising and programming for MSNBC and CNN for Eighteen months now Rosen scenes responsible for all that he signed the forest fire someone\nHe has no future and the Trump Administration\nSo with Rosie out of there do we get the ... when we get to see all those documents because he ... to my reading he's the only thing blocking us right now but when we get to see all those documents were going to have a lot more to say than she fell as we were wrong\n\nI don't know John I wished that I thought that was necessarily true but you know I don't see Rosenstein is the only\nStumbling block here there's never been a moment than we observe this several times in the last couple of years or ... discussing this and analyzing it there's never been a moment when president President Trump hasn't had the authority to disclose all of this information and yet he hasn't\nUm I'm not sure\nThat Rosenstein doesn't have a future in the administration it you wouldn't think so but uh you know the president speaks well of him he speaks well of the president when he so when he's speaking publicly the Republicans even if things go well on election night are going to have a very thin margin at best\nIn the Senate so it won't be the easiest thing to replace Rosenstein\nOr if he's fired and I just don't think I'm correct that the Republicans are unified\nIn in believing that the investigation of the Trump campaign\nWas politicized I think that there's a lot of feeling particularly in the Senate we heard a lot of it in the Senate intelligence committee or that there were very good reasons to proceed with this investigation and there have been a number of prominent Republicans including Marco Rubio\nI'm ... and and uh Trey Gowdy two to name to a who seemed to be very sympathetic to the FBI surveillance a quarter page so I'm not sure it's a it's a unified Republican front on this\nAnd that's another reason why I think we could be just seeing the beginning of the end where it turns out that there is no charges fraud or any actionable information brought against uh against President Trump that they decide that the um even if there were some excessive\nUh tactics used in the investigation that it that all when all was on the up and up and everybody um walks away a kind of reminds me if I May of the of the nine eleven commission which you know started out as a a a kind of a partisan ball and then at a certain point\nUm when everybody kind of realized that both the Clinton in the Bush administration could be harmed by this are suddenly there was a\nA piece in our time there was a report that was issued that didn't blame either the Clinton Administration or the Bush administration for nine eleven they hung the uh you know the FBI the CIA out to dry but the you know the politicians pretty much emerged unscathed than everybody loved to fight another day\nAndrew McCarthy National Review online Thaddeus McCotter W.

I'm Nineteen Thirteen for him and he had just established his business and it was a time of great optimism for him I'm In the years before that when he started to business and he was with transporting his good then\nBusiness was a success than he was climbing kind of out of poverty with his family and I'm very proud and excited about his future in fact someone had told him you are going to become a great man\nAnd I'm at this time he had trans supported he was\nComing back from a trip to then known as ... and um he was transporting a bunch of goods you know clothes or you know all different types of things\nAnd he um is stopped at one of the train stations because he was transporting hunting rifles at the time\nAnd at the time um you know they weren't illegal the hunting rifles but um but he was stopped and by the time he got to his home town of all of us are\nThe police said surrounded the station and um and arrested him\nAnd um and so from then it really sets the tone and right before that had happened there was a um uh this\nKind of a procession to celebrate the arm the anniversary of the Armenian alphabet had just happened and it was a big moment for the Armenians and and at church or soldier was killed during the demonstration and it's a\nLong story of what happened but tensions are really um rife in this town between the maintenance and the Turks and um my grandfather was you know eventually he was he was convicted served for about two months\nWhen he went into the central prison and he's in with a Armenians or they're Christians are there but dominant Muslims the ... the supervisor of the central prison is as say just name it brought home the bay and they're all frightened of him for torture\nBy your grandfather has a what I call a sunny disposition I'll get out of this things are well and with other Armenians the priest comes on Sunday I look forward to it nearly Easter I'll get out of this that along comes history it happens often at all the time dawn and your story that's why your grandfather\nHe's such a time machine for me it's a journey through the twentieth century and this is a fresh take the first war\nBecause in the summer of Nineteen fourteen we know there's going to be a catastrophe called the first war however the Turks anticipating this interest that bedding everything\nObliged your grandfather and others to be in a position to be ... scripted did he want to be a Turkish soldier Nineteen fourteen\nI don't think that he necessarily looked forward to you know serve in the military but actually for our meaning to serve in the military was was a recent right for them um they weren't able to do that in the years um up until um right before the war and so\nUm he so he joined um you know the Turkish Army and he ... he ended up being in a I'm a labor battalion right and drink road construction and so he was separated from his family\nAnd um that's how much of it went as you know the war um\nYou know more people show more countries joined the war and grew larger and larger\nAnd uh my and then in Nineteen Fifteen um the Ottoman government deported a majority of the two million Armenians from their homes\nAnd um that included his family and his community and his town and so he was separated\nFrom them yeah let's go to that decision because it's important we're talking about the Armenian Genocide but what generates the conditions that ... the depravity is the general deterioration of civilization in Europe and Asia Minor\nBecause you will recall that turkey at this time didn't exist it was the Ottoman Empire the German government the Kaiser's government had made inroads for the previous decades\nWith the Ottoman Empire and we're building railroads and there were lots of drumming engineers all overcome send an awful so when the war came along it looks like the Ottoman Empire was allied with Germany nothing much what's happening until of course the Russians attack from the north\nThe Russians were in league with the French and the and the British or not we're not making this up this is genuine World War one history\nThe British would eventually attack by coming around at the ... campaign would attack Ottoman Empire so in the sublime port which is the government in Constantinople they've felt attacked from both sides and it's that dawn\nOf the way I read it it that that generates the conditions that I'll leave the decision makers in Istanbul\nCrazy enough to believe that by punishing the Armenian somehow there were leaving or blames or shifting the blame on to the real falls of the army faltering and the north and the British attacking from the south\nDid the Armenian talk about the war did they talk about the conditions that left a of the Armenians exposed did they talk about how this could not have happened without thought the first World War\nI I mean I I don't I think that you know you look at different genocides over his history a lot of times it takes place during upheaval in a country ... for you know you look at the Holocaust and what happened you know it happened Kansas backdrop of World War two\nI think the same thing with the I mean there was so much happening in the world and there was so much strife like it's so many countries are involved and losing some him losing so many men and um that it was easy for the Armenians to disappear\nIt was easy I mean of course we remember but it was easy\nUnder the cover of war to deport the Armenians and and and drive them to their death\nLet's go to the moment that you know she was a is looked upon every year is important to remember all April twenty fourth Nineteen fifty\nThat is the date that is remembered because the arrest of the Armenian dignitaries the leading scholars and brains and\nA diplomat of Armenia in is tumble and what followed from there was persecution waves harassed the usual\nUh depravity where what what did your grandfather and what most importantly what an odd about czar may when they heard about the arrest in east on bold or ... ... excuse me did they know\nThat this was the beginning of an end or did they think it was just going to pass over them because those were VIPs and they were hardworking village people\nWell they were there were rumors that um\nThere were rumors that things were going to happen I'm\nI'm I was actually I right after that um roundup of intellectuals but the same thing happened in my grandfather's town which is what I really tried to focus on my grandfather's story and his towns as just a lens into the larger story so soon after what happened in in constant noble with a roundup of intellectuals\nAnd politicians and and basically their leaders\nI'm the same thing happen in in their town where the wealthy and influential influential um individuals they were rounded up and deported and um and so that you you see it just throughout my grandfather story the story of his town with\nYour experience in their town it's just they you know something happens but they still can't\nImagine that it would get worse or you know just same with with the ... when the deportation order finally happened you know so many of them\nThought that they would be to return home they thought that they would they were just leaving breathe you know just for a period of time and and would comeback I'm never imagining the condition that so many of them would face or that many of them would never return\nThe book is the hundred year walk and Armenian odyssey dawn on a heat McCain is the author when we come back dawn in two thousand and seven ...
