no to the U.S government money for Falcon Heavy that's a good decision by\nWell this is a long time ago this was in ... there was a presentation given by one of the chief executive engineers and he and the presentation\nOn prompted pointed out he was talking about Falcon Heavy and some of the history and how we got there and he said Falcon Heavy we did not take any government money in fact we turned it down and they will government agencies Asian say watch who are willing to offer us money to help develop the Falcon Heavy\nAnd we basically said no we're gonna do it ourselves when it's done you can buy it when it's ready and will charge you for the service and he pointed out how that's important position to take because if you take the government like they're going to start telling you what to do and he they wanted\nTo be the free position to make it for themselves as they wish to do it and I think this is something that all private companies should take heart to space sections

in flights like this but they switched to the stress to the research component um well they the Tucson southern Arizona areas put together a business roundtable space business roundtable each monthly\nWhen I was invited to come and join it and so I went to the first one this week and they were talking about a recent a consulting report that the at the University of Arizona as well as local government and several venture capitals had paid for this consulting report on what are the communities Tucson to grow in the space industry\nAnd they talked about it so if there was a lot of opportunities for the southern Arizona area to grow what struck me most about this is reflects the world there which is of course the United states and the world that are doing exactly the same thing aggressively because they all she the space industry\nGrowing in leaps and bounds in the coming two decades and they're doing everyone wants to get in on it and I think everyone should\nWant to get in on it there's lot of money can be made here the next few decades China and this was a reflection of that and I was very impressed by it and I wrote it up from behind the black or give my impression is is\nA NASA has some discouraging news about deep space travel do you follow it Bob\nI this is a this is what I consider to be a garbage study to be very honest there's some truth to it but ... it's now a NASA study scientist paid for by NASA scientists say that traveling in the face will cause cancer and destroy your stomach your intestines and they did a study stimulating the radiation that would happen\nA over a short period of time making believe it was a long period of time and they did it on rats and they said oh the rats suffered greatly so therefore we if we have to do spend lots of money for space radiation up medicine\nAnd this junk that what they did include anything having to do with the actual shielding that's got to be put on these spacecraft and the simulation it doesn't really um doesn't really work Siamese face a dangerous but there's no reason to exaggerate the dangers widely which this dog does unless they want to generate fake reasons for

never know when you're going to run a matter when we're all going around what how can we can throw to vote for more than yours how can we don't attempt to try and there was one of those um those are questions that we have to figure out [noise]\nAnd now I was serious or energy is this what we bring rely on before the game [noise] all of the house\nNow I'm Patrick rumor the giants head coach now interesting there he talked about it not throwing the ball more than twenty yards and and uh and and all that stuff and you would think OK well this is a shot at Eli Manning well past Sherman who was also asked about it his head coach here was passed rumors response\nI don't know I guess you'd have to clarify that's probably a better question for him what he meant by it um but I Do know that is our team has a heck of a lot of heart our team plays with a lot of energy what we haven't done is we haven't really executed quite as well as we need to yet and that's really the\nOr instead of a energy it's more execution and I think that's what we're all striving for but ah now we've got a locker room of the these guys got a ton of heart including or do and a lot of want to and I\nI think that you know will break over here once we start executing better we as coach has got to continually fight to put them in the best position possible and then we got we got to execute\nRight to know back and forth there ah one one says why aren't we doing this the other said well you know we've got a lot of hard but it's about the execution which is code for you guys aren't doing what we're asking you to do good enough which is why we're one and three\nThat's why we're bad\nAll that back I was calling out the officer not throwing the ball down\nOh here's what I Do know right and I was making this point earlier if you live ... last name was knocks he's not still the starting quarterback for the giants\nBut just be honest man like the fact that he's demanding that goes a long way and if you don't think that organization thinks about that if you don't think that organization reacts to public perception\nIf you if you don't think that's the case I got two examples for you one they fired bend Mac do after he bench to Eli Manning and ruined his consecutive starts streak last season fired been Mac do\nBut then ... gave you like manning the option of starting that game against Oakland Eli Manning declined dust\nSmith got the start and they got so much heat and so much push push back for how dare they ruin Eli Manning's consecutive starts streak that the organization fired bend McAteer during the season\nWhich is not something the giants organization routinely does something and they do every day I I don't know that the giants organization aspire to coach\nSeason but because it was he like manning and because the public was so upset by it the giants overreacted\nThe giants ownership is also even talked about how a season ticket holders when the whole uh anthem protests going on that they spoke openly about how season ticket holders have threatened to ditch their season tickets\nUh if any players kneel during the national anthem and giants ownership was speaking about it is it they were concerned if I was giants ownership I'd say\nAnd and I did this goes above and beyond just the national\nAnthem if anybody's threatening to drop their season tickets if I'm giants ownership by go\nTake a walk we get a a three year waiting list we don't need you get outta here usually describe you'll go away\nBut you think anybody at McDonalds if your coffee comes out and it's cold and you say I'll never go here again do you think any of the employees are like\nOh we don't go you see the drive through line it's around the block\nLike nobody cares go way you'd like you don't have an impact on this so the ... they they have a clear clear we're we've proof pattern of behavior that they overreact to criticism publicly pattern of behavior\nWhat ... saying about why aren't we throwing the ball down field I got some numbers for you\nHe lie Manning's ... can you managed them better the last three weeks he's been better than week one but still like there's no real threat to go down field and it tastes NFL that's that's not a good thing you've seen these often says Eli Manning's longest pass completion of the season is thirty seven yards\nThat puts them at thirty six in the NFL behind every starting quarterback a couple a\nBackup quarterbacks and Albert Wilson a wide receiver from the dolphins and Kevin buyer to safety from the titans\nI mean\nAnybody noticing something a little off their pat Schroeder you remember the Vikings ... a year ago it wasn't like you know they were ... Duncan come on man case Kim was stretching the feel a little bit Adam feeling Stefan digs at monster years\nI mean come on like there is something to it either by many can't go down field with the football\nOr they just don't have faith in him doing it\nIt just it makes you wonder man in ... your last name with Eli Manning's last name tell me if you're still the quarterback in New York I don't think you would be eight seven\nSeven Ninety nine on Fox Jonas knocks Fox Sports radio\nOr you could also give me on Twitter at ... the Jonah stocks I Want to let you know we are brought to you by discover\nBecome a new card member and discover card will match all the cash back you burn dollar for dollar at the end of your first year learn more at discovered dot com slash match limitations apply coming up next year on Fox Sports radio this is one of the\nCruelest pieces of trash talk you've heard in quite some time and it's not who you think it is that's next officer\nIn the real [laughter]\nThey're making them play [laughter]\nWe're breaking it oh yeah there's really only one team in the NFL and its on watch of buffalo\n...

happened the Yankees\n... hold on for a five to four when in game one of that there is used in getting for home runs\nThey would be Couric we were in the Indian seven to two did they get one nothing

Percent or more I'm car insurance would guy go go to guy go to a comical eight hundred nine four seven auto the only hard parts figuring out which way is easier right now it's time for this\nShown as you more on how could you not get to the door to the artist grab\nThis or we find out what we have missed so far on the show and we go to the great and the powerful Kevin figures for that\nMade you join us of course we know does Brian still a free agent after being released by the cowboys earlier in the off season now we did tweet earlier this week\nThat he'd rather be with the Dallas Cowboys it a ... he ... he would be willing to apply elsewhere of course he did take a visit with the Cleveland Browns earlier in the off season\nNow hit go Jason guarantee that that is not a direction that organization was looking at going in but one of his biggest supporters has been Jerry Jones he actually went through a Jay Z beyond the concert with Jerry Jones\nNot too long ago but Gerry doing one of the weekly hits on a radio station said quote to see that we used we're friends I have a lot of pride in where Brian is relative to our relationship as it pertains to him as an individual\nBut we've got to look at what we're all having to deal with and that's in the best interest of the team that's a different story there so it looks like a possible or being reunited with the Dallas Cowboys between himself and\nAnd Jason Garrett is not going to happen and what does Bryant\nWell I mean I guess Bryan does he not remember when he ripped the coaching staff and the players during the off season or does he just not remember that giant ... yeah I don't like literally ripped coaching staff\nRipped players ripped Sean leave 'em I mean yeah like what what do they I meet people that people actually thought that there there there was a possibility of desert Brian going back to the cowboy\nThere you go insane I keep with the with everybody in the organization afterwards all of a sudden he's going to be back on the cowboys roster this team's season just doesn't make any sense\nOf how can you get back into the locker room and most of the people you talked about are still in there\nYeah and that's the biggest issue it's like the Jimmy butler thing in Minnesota like I'm seems like some reports were yeah timber wolves players would welcome Jimmy Butler back hold on a second so you've got Andrew Wiggins in a fight with Jimmy Butler which turned into a fight with Stephen Jackson which turned into\nSteven Jackson saying don't ever run into me out in public and now everything's fine I'll be back stories everyone just welcome that it just doesn't work that way I don't know like I to me like it's done man if you like if you speak out and you make some statements and you burn bridges that's what happens\nNo doubt and I can understand we're Jerry's coming from San I can have an excellent relationship with there's Brian but from a business standpoint and even person when it comes to players still on my team and that locker room it was just not fit man\nIt's just not going to work I also think if you were to ask Jerry 'cause I was at one of this one five three the fan in Dallas yeah one of three five whatever it is um if you were to ask the same question an hour later he'd give the exact opposite response solve problems I just I think mad\nHe just loves doing interviews and whatever comes out comes out very well yeah well because it's all so much effort that's what he said yeah just the\nIdea of like Europe like buddies who do tell you one story and then they'll add in a little ... an extra layer to the next time they tell the story and you're not sure whether or not they just forgot it or they're just lying yeah how'd you go from knocking out five to six fifty yeah I mean what do you mean you're a woman\n[laughter] All right so speaking of women [noise] uh Charlotte Hornets for ... you might find themselves with some hot water with is a MBA brother and he joined us\nNow he posted a questionnaire from the Charlotte Hornets team word asked players to list their wives and girlfriends name's not a category for their wives or their girlfriends\nBut there was a category for their wives and their girlfriends now an anonymous NBA GM actually said\nThat it is not unusual for players details seems that there are a wife and they're a girlfriend will both be attending basketball games and that that seems neat that information to make sure that the women are seated as far apart as possible\nOkay um first of all I'm not surprised that\nMBA players have wives and girlfriends or professional athletes have wives and girlfriends that I'm not surprised be surprised if they didn't know yes I mean everybody knows that",
