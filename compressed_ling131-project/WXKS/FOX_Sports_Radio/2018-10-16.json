to hunt for three and a half million dollars Eddie is not a natural educated businessmen\nAnd bus she has a driving need to succeed he has a vision for aircraft\nHe fights the ... the new deal why\nWell after you got to remember right now so we're looking at a time when the civilian airline system\nIs just being invented there aren't airfields that will support that the American public has a little questionable about whether they want to get in and pay for a seat because it's still kind of dangerous so Addy at a bunch of these one trip and a bunch of others or creating\nThe infrastructure and the whole idea of civilian airlines that we live with now\nAn FDR and wanted to kind of get a little bit according to Eddie a little bit more federal\nRegulation in that Eddie felt was warrant you know and and even had FDR said well you know I'm going to have these uh\nYou know army or air Arnie flyers fly you know these planes and maybe not civilians and they started dying and Eddie was a little outspoken about that so he and FDR\n... tonight she's thirty said he got through that I'd change what is the flapper era that they're the great depression hits America the Nineteen thirties the recovery is very slow at takes can Eddie takes control of eastern airlines\nAnd through the Nineteen thirties the operates it effectively become save money Baker once it was free of the

was\nA raft and these rafts or about the size of the bath tub three guys in each line on top\nOf the out he didn't take the foodstuffs or the water out of the aircraft they forgot yeah\nThat this was before an eddy would see that this would change later but they also weren't\nGiven they weren't you know a life raft didn't have water and food and it only a couple ... a couple of things that made some Thurman says because they knew they were going to go down of coffee and sandwiches and I forgot those I think the pilot talked to a few oranges in his vast and there they were with no food and water\nAnd nobody knew where they were in the middle of the war\nFloating and sharks we're on the bottom of bumping up at but I like to see what making all this out so there's the the immediate problem is who commit\n... absolutely so you've got the captain right it was kind of one of the natural but then another guy is a colonel so we are ranks Eddie\nDuring the war is decided they said you can be a brigadier general and he said no the um I just want to be a civilian they paid him a dollar a year to go around talking to various groups and to you know the war effort he was a hero and he went and talked to people\nSo it wasn't clear he was the only civilian that ... who was the leader and as things got worse and worse they shed John that as you know they had shed a lot of them and\nShed their way from like a hundred and Ninety pass a hundred and twenty yes yes it was their living on the few\nThings that can catch yeah and I think there was a birthday for a while that's an incredible story a you know it was the eighth\nDay and they were sitting in a stupor because the sun has burned them and then the open source and then burn them again the salt water comes they're kept talk 'cause they're so dry and they're at their website the eight days of just no food or water and Eddie has just ... has a door that had to lay the given them any\nFeel something on his head a

fail and he they push him off and he and the fight\nFor survival doesn't [noise]\nHang on hay although he has the survival skills out there now writing to the rescue was Adelaide House oh\nWhat a wonderful story so after two weeks Adelaide they've they nobody has heard of that I write so after two weeks secretary maybe says okay writes a letter to add a light saying you know nice nice and they had a nice way she's saying well we're calling up the search\nAdelaide doesn't want anything to do with that so she goes out of Washington DC barges right into the office and says you cannot\nStop looking\nFor this like on this American icon right and the guy says well to the middle of the war in middle of a sudden she says I don't care you do something about it and she probably was salty where

the past their Youtube videos of guys walking off the field\nBeing covered with multiple beers as they walk off the field raining down alcohol from the heavens the greatest rainstorm of all time\nNow that has been criminalize it's not just this is just the latest example this has been going on in recent years this is Lewis example but this the same the same thing that several years ago people celebrated as wait for it home field advantage is now seen as a hostile act\nYou need to be banned from the state of metal last point in\nThe general term lifetime ban from the stadium\nA waste of time it's comical right\n... it's also something that is done because it sounds good sounds if you violate the rules you will never come back to the stadium again and the Yankees Red Sox and the Mets have done this kind of thing\nIt doesn't work it's a waste of time another reason it's a waste of time all it really is is an inconvenience because that is what it is just an inconvenience instead of buying the ticket the regular way\nHere's what you do you go to the stadium if you're banned for life you find some ... and you pay the scalp for fifty bucks or whatever you have to do you get the ticket you're in the stadium\nAnd you get in the stadium and I'm pretty confident that they're not scanning the stadium with facial recognition looking for people who are on the band list so they can't\nAnd being the stadium so you watch the game\nAnd that's it you leave the stadium a problem so hey it's been out of the show on Fox we say hello to Edmund that Dallas\nMays\nWho's right over there and ... even though he's checked out because he's ready to start vacation want to point out that\nHe showed more effort than the Dodgers did at the plate in their game and it's all the Dodger fans fault we heard that TK Hernandez the Dodgers blaming the Dodger fan for their shutout against the Milwaukee Brewers says what do ... what is the capital douche right there king of the\n... now you were there I was waiting at Dodger Stadium I showed more effort to getting their driving to the stadium and you know it has no validity and his criticism of them Dodger fans not being into the game out they were\nFired up ready to go and they're stupid cows out that they passed out to go crazy you know what are they supposed to do\nThere was not a single\nMoment while on a second you say what are they supposed to explain to me was he wasn't doing our baseball game you've played on they were allowed to get this point yeah it'd be going crazy that's what you should do now I wasn't there you were I was if they were doing that that he I don't know what he's talking about\nHis easing idiot on this one is ... is it completely so the crowd is going crazy a lot of people there is an early start in LA people take off from work to get there and the whole thing but that happens on the west coast that happened on the east coast usually you wait till like you know you're you want to fall asleep and they play the games but on the west coast you got to get there early\nAnd so people showed up crowds going crazy\nGoing nuts and the top of the first ending the brewers scored run ... right down one nothing\nTo say good segue goose ...\nEgg egg egg egg it it was their eggs everywhere and he he was an egg fight\nFor the Dodgers like his chest seen them all people yo ... scene\nBut a number for starting pitcher for most teams in baseball a nine year journeyman pitcher you'll leash just seen\nThe Dodgers that first run an hour and we got they got they got to go against Jesse and so we can get re runs up this guy in the first thing I Know problem down and after that and you name all the teams\nYou'll be ... played for her to go ahead\nA Rockies thing All right correct brewers correct that's too that's all I got a he's also played for Arizona the angels I bet ... does he remember him when he angel the Atlanta Braves and the Padres [noise]\nAnd that's the top picture the brewers have that's the guy that shut down the Dodgers bears\nWhat it is it's an embarrassed or an eighty miles per hour by the way they're slider and the average major league fast balls but he had and he was mesmerizing Dodger hitters you would have thought this was teddy hit Guerra in his prime on the mound for the Milwaukee Brewers it was unbelievable student loans lately embarrassing\nIt throws his heart of the guys doing my father in law's directly over here in ...\nIs that right yeah how hard is your ... your father or your father in law yeah how hard to see through on throw harder though just like testing that are still going to hit him a set it was pretty bad\nThere but they will come back and win the next you know I Know considered all also about not at all not can say well because when you get shut out you come back for a rose they'll score eight runs in that game a run or they're going to score right am I going law on that maybe they'll school more than ... twelve runs well could happen it\nCould bring to mind that\nMight have been ... I was going to happen that's going to help create is\nGreatest Milwaukee Brewers picture I go to ... other people say bed sheets who you're going to go it with a wink and a nod to Chris Bazile remember Kris\nBazile back in the ... now now pitching coach or no I got fired yeah yeah a guy for the tigers fired over there yeah\nThere was White Sox he said I said something to say a at a time he wasn't supposed to say a curse and he wasn't supposed to say who\nAnd he's gone was he going to sue what happened with that then he turned heard anything about it and nothing happened there no other Alex ... greatest brewer rotation of all time he'd garish number one bench sheets your number two or Bazile your number two\n... ago sheets I guess she's number two yeah sheets number two so Garrett one sheets to Bazile is my three or bend McDonald's how 'bout that member bend McDonald\nBig Bend McDonald big bang Oreo LSU Jagger\nBowl here's another one cow al ... remember ...

Jeffery\nGet their hands on receivers all every play like if you go back and look every play now maybe they had told Richard Sherman before and you never know what kind of conversations are going on hey\nYou are closed that last time I let you get away with it but you can't put your hands on him like that maybe there's some sort of talk going on between official employer or the coaches they've been on it they've noticed that a bunch of times and the last the last couple where he's gotten away with it\nBut it still seems like I mean that call is a pretty massive on because otherwise you gotta ... going on there and the forty niners are coming back the opposite direction with another chance to try to get a field goal\nYeah and I know that there's conspiracy theories that can be out there but is there any question in your mind if it was reversed in was CJ ... not Aaron Rodgers on that play they're probably not throw in that play\nWell being greatness gets the benefit of the doubt right and uh and we and then a lot of people are going to miss a missed that call and not focus on it because the Aaron Rodgers praised the ability that he had to come back from that seven point deficit\nAnd get ten points in the final two minutes of the game is going to be much discussed\nBut ah but in general I just uh when I saw that play I was just like I I don't know I mean I don't know that the flag needs to come out there and in in that situation in particular I may\nSwallowed the whistle unless it's such an egregious wrong that you have to make the call and I don't know that in that situation like you said away from the play\nThat it really impacted the outcome of the game of the outcome of that play\nBut the extent that you need to impact the outback outcome of the game as much as you did by throwing the flag there\nYeah uh when it comes to Rogers I was saying this off the top of the show I think the end of Aaron Rodgers career\nWe're likely going to have a discussion of how many Super Bowls were left on the table by having a bad coach in Green Bay that he's had to overcome it bad personnel decisions that he that he had to overcome I mean last night he's out there without Randall Cobb\nIs out there without drawing I'm Allison and he still throws over four hundred yards and gets three guys a chance to go over a hundred\nAs receivers I mean the guy's ridiculous the game against the bears to open this season he had no business winning last night he really has no business winning either he\nHas overcome quite a bit just in his own locker room in his own front office to be as good as he is the fact that the Packers are even relevant they're not a good football team if you watch last night in general they're not very good but Aaron Rodgers is that great\nNot to mention the five miss feel goals by makes him Crosby on the road or against the uh the alliance that they found a way to lose even though you took them up and down the field over and over and over again you're right you're right in general that I mean that's what great quarterbacks are there are racers they eliminate mistakes I Would also say I mean it's hard to win two Super Bowls\nNo matter how good you are I mean there's lots of ... Brett Farr and remember he won one Super Bowl\nA there is a a you know the the guys like al way and manning who go out at the very end of their career and managed to win that multiple Super Bowl title are are really few and far between so uh and honestly\nThat that's one of the things I think it will be an interesting interesting story line from this generation of football and people look back and they hear how good Aaron Rodgers is they're going to look at the super bowl totals and they're going to say unless he's able to win one in the next four or five years to finish his career\nMan you'll manning won two Super Bowls and Aaron Rodgers one on one sometimes it's not fair and the way that you win championships yeah\nThat's absolutely right because I think there's going to be a discussion as well about whether or not he lived ... in the hall of famer and the guy that he was traded for when they made that move Philip Rivers I think is a better player and is that a better career but obviously has no Super Bowls and that usually becomes the narrative\nAh in our sports driven society the other narratives that we do every day every Tuesday here on out kick the coverage is we do top

you know that three years ago\nHe vanished and all of a sudden\nTo be ... of even getting a field goal range and the entire game\nYou know the forty seven actually you did the titans ten yards extra while it was the Baltimore forty seven your line they didn't get within Fifteen yards of Brian suck ups range that's not bad that football game was I've got the charges of five because there are only two losses or to the rams into the chiefs yeah that to go and\nThat therefore into right now you've got Philip Rivers playing out of his mind Fifteen touchdowns to three interceptions gonna pass or reading one Fifteen forward in the league in Cuba your sixty nine percent completion percentage of thirty six years old over Seventeen hundred yards only got with a higher pass rating in the league right now is Drew Brees\nSo I'll give them that and I haven't even talked about Melvin Gordon how good he's been so I've got them at five and four I've got New Orleans and it's kind of splitting hairs but that's because I've got the patriots and the top five in the saints against the bucks and the fact that I don't necessarily buy into their defense their office this explosive\nI think actually you can look at most of the top five and most of the league and said do you buy into their defense I don't buy into New Orleans but I think that they're probably either them and the Panthers are going to win the division and the other one's going to get a wild card I Would say number three I've got Kansas City\nI almost put them in number two but they lost the game to the patriots and the patriots of foreign to now maybe they end up with home field advantage as a result if they do I don't know how that plays out because of patriotism only lost two games since two thousand six with Tom Brady is quarterback at home\nSo that's just incredible what they've been able to do so I've got the chiefs of three absolutely believe they're legit and to read one of the great play colors in history the NFL patriots to their foreign to what a great game that was and then the rams and you're right twenty three to twenty not that impressive the week before\nNot particularly impressive compared to what they had done the Vikings games most impressed I've been in one football team all season long with the rams did there but I still got them and number one I really hope we see them and the super bowl for the NFC\nBecause I Want to see Sean McVeigh and whatever it is he's going to do from a play calling standpoint against probably Kansas City or New England if you had to bet right now which means probably another high scoring exciting Superbowl so that's where I Am in my top five before we get to Eddie Garcia let's go ahead and do the bottom five\nYeah and I would say a as well what I think is important\nThere you just mentioned I Do think it's not even too early if you are chief's fan to start aggressively monitoring who's going to have home field advantage because as good as the patriots\nHave been in the postseason and you hit on it how dominant they are if they make you run through Fox borough it's hard to believe even though I Know they went on the road and the jak gave him a game and the AFC Championship game\nIt's hard to believe that if they get by and they played two games to get to the super bowl that the patriots are going to lose at home with Tom Brady I I just in in in in January and Fox for where the elements are going to be difficult if I'm Kansas City\nGiven how awful their posts fees and has been I think it's been like since the Nineteen Ninety that the chiefs have won a single playoff game\nAnd they've been in position to win a bunch of them including being up\nTwenty one to three I think it was on the titans in that are in that postseason games uh where you would think you know what they are going to be in a position to finally break that postseason for out even as recently as last year and I know Patrick mom's is twenty three years old he hasn't been a part of that utility before\nBut I Do think that you want to have won by\nSo you at least advance to the divisional route and to the difference between having to go on the road in New England versus getting to play at home in Kansas City having that one game lead right now I think that's worth paying a lot of attention to even though we're only six weeks than if you are chief's fan that it's something that you should have circle then that's something you should be monitoring\nAt a high level particularly because now you know like you said the patriots have that tie breaking the event they end up with similar records but\nTop five are basically at the same teams except I can see a strong argument like you did for a white a charger should be included I just thought the ravens are so dominant and that points differential got got to admit it number five for me as opposed to the chargers although I'm watching the chargers play in person this weekend here in London and\nI think there is a very good chance they are going to blow out the titans and it'll be hard to leave them out of the top five if they get up to five and two let's uh let's roll into the bottom five now\nOr I Will I Will start and I will count down\nIn descending order in the twenty eight spot I felt bad for this guy I feel bad in all respects every time he comes into the game it's like there's a dark cloud just waiting above him\nIt's Nathan Federman Josh Allan gets knocked out with some sort of elbow can to gender or other Nathan Federman comes in and immediately throws a touchdown pass and you think wow\nMaybe this guy's going to come on the road and he's going to beat the Houston Texans Texans kick a field goal minute forty five left bills take possession start to drive the other direction an incomplete pass on first down and\nThen on second down it's an eighth and Peter and special a pick six to win the game for the Texans Texans or give the ball back after kickoff and I believe on the third play right after that he throws Nathan Peter and does another interception nearly returned for another pick six\nThat would have been one of the all time remarkable cover jobs if if the taxes they manage to cover that spread because of those double pick six is but as a result the bills I've got into twenty eight spot\nNathan Peter Van continues to be cursed in the twenty ninth spot I feel like this is tough\nAnd maybe a little bit unfair given the fact that they arguably could have endorsed should have won that game last night against the Packers but you are what your record says you are at at this point in time the forty niners are one in five and they're sitting there with the J ... and I don't feel like\nThey are likely to be able to make any kind of improvement on a substantial level\nOr over the course of this season I haven't got them and the twenty ninth spot a city again at one in five and in the thirtieth spot I feel bad for the Colts too because early in season they lost every close game you can possibly imagine their point differential\nIsn't even that bad but when you get with like they did by Sam Darnell and by the jets to fall to one in five and effectively have your season over\nAndrew Luck has come back they still can't really press the ball down the field maybe by next season he'll be better but the only team that's been a lemonade it from the nation's worst division in football so far this year the AFC South is the is the Indianapolis Colts so I've got them into thirtieth spot\nIn the thirty one spot I've got the giants I think at this point the question is\nWhy is he like going to continue to play what are you trying to prove what is oh del back and junior doing on a week to week basis on the sideline what in the world is up with the giants and\nTheir team chemistry I think all those questions are fair and and play as the giants have fall into one in five and then it at thirty second spot\nI don't know what's going on here maybe John Gordon is just trying to take at this point to get rid of their car he's already traded ... I think it's fair to say\nThat John grew to return to the raiders so far has been an abject failure slashed disaster flash snuff film of a a of an unbelievable level I have got the raiders as the thirty second best team bay area sports fan in general if you are a forty niners and a raiders fan\nThere is a lot of bad football to go around your teams in the bay area a combined math is right here to intent on the season that is tough to pull off that would be my bottom five years Jason ... [noise]\nUh yeah we we have a little bit of difference here I've got the forty niners at twenty eight [noise]\nBecause Kyle Shanahan such a gifted play color and you saw it last night and you're seeing what his absence says men with our keys in in that same role in Atlanta\nI think that they had so much invested ... below\nThat it's just really tough for them at this standpoint but that they're played well last night they probably should have won that football game they looked good in the last so I'm going to bump them up just a little bit I've got the cold to twenty nine and it's sort of splitting hairs between them and the giants they're both terrible\nAndrew Luck is a much better quarterback they lie manning is at this point I think that in Indianapolis is a more cohesive football team\nThan what we're seeing in New York that's why I've got them ahead of the giants I've got the raiders at thirty one not thirty two but they're bad their core probably going to be traded at least what you're hearing they've got Maury Cooper on the block\nThey've got Carl josephs there fielding offers for\nJohn Bruton a terrible liar I said it beforehand I'll say it again most overrated guy and all of sports the NFL has changed four times that guy last coached\nAnd you're seeing him now coaching Twenty years you might as well be coaching and black and white at this point on a UA Jeff television and the number thirty he didn't mention it all\nThe Arizona Cardinals I've got that I forget the Largo\nThat our irrelevant cardinals are\nYeah they're they're not good they are dead last in our fence Josh Rose in I think is going to be really good but he's got no help they have no idea what they're doing with David Johnson\nThe coach Steve ... comes out yesterday and says all our jobs are in jeopardy including mine do six six games into his career and he's already thinking maybe I Need to cancel this lease and get out of this like it is an absolute that it all down there in Arizona\nThe college football weekend has its share of interesting games but maybe no situation right now is more interesting than what Alabama should do with their husband from running quarterback to its ongoing by lower who got injured against Arkansas didn't slid against Missouri statement says he could have come back into the game\nBut didn't end up doing so I guess the big question is do you play to its own go buy low against the balls when I think most everyone understands you probably beat Tennessee which when arts\nWell we know they can be Tennessee what channel and hurt because they have beaten Tennessee with Jay on hurts the past two seasons and they've done it really without being challenged at all\nUh this is not a particularly good Tennessee team even with the wind coming off against Auburn, Alabama around at twenty nine point favorite\nI Would say the difference between a J on hurts held to Alabama team at eight to uh held the Alabama team is like the difference between H. D. and standard TV\nToo it just makes everything CRISPR it's a different universe when he's in a quarterback and we've seen that happen a lot going back and forth are so far this season\nHaving said that the Alabama season effectively\nIs probably going to come down to that game against LSU now LSU could lose to somebody else and spilled out when the SEC west\nBut if I'm Nick Saban and I am trying to make sure that I go into al issue as healthy as I possibly can and what you know is going to be an incredibly physical and violent game in Baton Rouge I Want to or as healthy as he can possibly be and we don't have access to the medical report\nBut he's been wearing it breaks the past couple of weeks he came out and he went into the chat for them to work at his knee\nYou have the ability now with the by week coming up if you sit him for the Tennessee\nGame you effectively have three weeks for him without contact to get ready and be basically a hundred percent for the LSU game I think it makes a lot of sense for Alabama given what their goals are and given how inferior in theory\nTennessee is is that an opponent to go ahead and give the reigns to jail and hurts and what to uh sit out and come back as healthy as he possibly can be when you're really going to need him on the road against LSU Europe and a guy J are what you think does that make sense for you\nYeah it does I the only question that I haven't I don't think Nick's saving would care about the answer to this question at all this isn't something that he can factor in because it's not part of his job description\nIs to ah misses that game does that open the door for somebody else to snatch the highs and from them I'm not like I said it's not going to care about that but I'm just curious what your thoughts are there\nWell first of all there is only a couple of guys I think and legitimate contention or will be in the month of November now I think it's Haskins obviously up at Ohio State was posting good numbers and I think it's too and what we have seen it happen over and over again is Heisman voters reward signature moments in ... big games\nAnd to me the biggest game that Alabama is going to have on their schedule by far is going to be this game against LSU so as to what goes out and performs well and throws four touchdown passes in Alabama is dominant against LSU or\nIf LSU gives them a real challenge it to a makes plays a light that are incredible to win that game\nNobody is going to remember what happened in the twenty eight point win over Tennessee now if you're saving and you're looking at Tennessee and you think oh you know what maybe this team is a little bit better maybe I'm nervous because Jeremy Pruitt\nKnows all the skill position people\nAnd I think we need to uh to win this game comfortably maybe that's a different feeling but I'm just looking at the past two years Alabama has won with ease against Tennessee with Jay on her tech quarterback I don't know why that would suddenly change in year three\nUh I don't think Tennessee is particularly a better team than they have been in the past couple of years necessarily even coming off the ... I think of water tend to find it's a level and I think Alabama winning by around twenty points\nIt's probably going to happen even if Jay on earth as the quarterback as opposed to\nI'm not even going to be able to say goodbye to claim 'cause we're down to our lives since I get to this hour we'll have clay back in our one tomorrow as well as Thursday live from London will replay the top I bought him five coming up in the third our jet shorts joins reacts\nOut kick their coverage with clay traffic\nHere is a game you can't win credit card debt with whipping caught you can consolidate your high interest debt or pay off credit cards into one fix monthly payment just go to the club dot com answer up\nYour simple questions and if you're proved up to forty thousand dollars is automatically deposited into your bank account in his little is a few days ... dot com slash I hard today to check your rate and minutes that's when they called ... dot com slash I heart all loans made by ... bank member FDIC equal housing litter [noise]\nThere were less veterans are proven tough to perform and temperatures of a hundred and forty degrees and forty below zero because when you\nCan start an extreme conditions you can start an everyday conditions like running late for work\nBroken alarm creepy Perkins runs\nAnd only about a visit any of our fifty five hundred locations nationwide and let us do more for you [noise]\n[noise]\n... you're very busy from ... to one twenty eight and then you're crawling from participated Winchester right down in the summer of ... here slot one twenty three an adult borrowed a one fifty to an end crawling from one to one twenty eight\nYear next reported minutes I'm Jackie Murphy\nThis report is brought to you by compassion international for just five quarters of the day you can sponsor a child through compassion international it's pocket change do you get a life changing for a child in may be part of the change become a sponsor now with compassion dot com slash radio that's compassion dot com slash radio\n[noise] on money managers may seem pretty much the same well some money managers may recommend high commission investment products [noise] Fisher Investments avoids the [noise] some money managers may have hidden and layered fees [noise]\nFisher Investments never does [noise] and while some money managers are happy to earn commissions from you whether you do well or not [noise] Fisher Investments fees are structured so we do better when you do better than in other words were structured to be on your side [noise]\nMaybe that's why most of our clients come to us from other money managers and talk with us and find out why so many experienced investors are switching to an staying with Fisher Investments [noise] Fisher Investments are clearly better money management [noise]\nInvestments insecurities involved the risk of laws visited us at Fisher Investments dot com to find out what we can do for you [noise]\nIs Boston you home for conservative talk to your family you can [noise] Ninety four or five people in jail managed to keep on talking\nFifty nine SARS now\nHead of a possible twenty twenty presidential run Senator Elizabeth Warren is releasing DNA results proving she as Native American heritage that analysis comes in response to President Trump calling her Pocahontas of course\nMajor highway repair projects being announced been twenty Nineteen twenty twenty north of Boston the for projects totaling four hundred million in Chelsea vida October bridge Alford Street Bridge decks\nThe replacement of the north Washington Street Bridge a massive Tuesday in Boston sports the ALCOA shifts to Houston for game three between the Sox an Astros tonight tired of the game apiece\nThe Celtics open the regular season this evening at home against the Seventy Sixers Berlin center Patrice burgers rod you they ... at age ... first started the week a Twenty one year old Mansfield man is facing criminal charges\nFor throwing a beer retiree killed the chiefs during Sunday nights patriots game and Fox borough sunny and dry today breezy but not as strong as we felt this morning highs near sixty degrees this afternoon lows dip into the forties tonight with Boston's first news drink or wouldn't talk twelve hundred\nAlright Dan Patrick show oh man it's a fun day\nNot am eastern six specific sports radio golf ...\nSee the Buffalo Bills are still employing Nathan ...

I'd say kind of not choked in a way but just didn't perform quite corners they had the whole game and the fourth quarter\nYeah you're speaking about the overs any primetime games I don't think Denver at Arizona is going to be a a a barn burner on Thursday night from a primary from a point standpoint\nIt's like it's Thursday night games you know you have less time to prepare guys or beat up\nI think it's going to be a while but it's for our nose or forty I don't know how you been under forty in in the NFL nowadays like that to me seems to me seems in and look I bet some under this year I had I had a couple of of this week when\nHe took that off and so why is it getting your bet against them um but man forty points there isn't a football yeah the the the next couple night games aren't the best right we have\nBroncos and and um the cardinals Thursday night I Know you're a Broncos fan and a judge that during the last show were suddenly yards rushing the last two weeks I think and\nI'm the host about they're allowing five point seven yards of chairing the worse than the chiefs we are not in that category\nUm and then um you have a lot of cheese in bangles on Sunday\nNight ... should be it should be another high scoring game\nMonday Night the giants scholars ...

I mean Rick Denison would be an example of that now the offensive line coach of the New York jets after getting bounced in Buffalo so maybe Marcus Mario to simply isn't able to operate\nThis type of often maybe he's a good quarterback a game you know a place hold please hold her but\nYou know gay manager type quarterback right who doesn't make mistakes and the red zone generally but also has its limitations throwing the football and maybe just maybe Mike malarkey and his staff realize that and decided we're going to run the football will play really good defense and this is how we're going to get to where we want to be pivotal season for Marcus because\nTitans have to have an idea after this year he'll be entering the finer your work a deal and twenty Nineteen do you want to pay him or not and right now you're just sitting there like is this I mean there are we going to get our Ryan Tammy held you know if we thought into an extension stay five hundred caliber team it's a pivotal time for the titans to continue to get this investment market or evaluation rather I'm Marcus\nWe're starting to see the cream rise to the top at least a little bit we know the rams are good we know Kansas city's good we know New England is New England\nAnd then maybe you like the saints maybe you start to light the chargers but it seems like everything is wide open in the middle of the league there are a couple of really good teams and then everybody else\nHas holes that you can point to and say that's going to cost them you can even look at the chiefs and say yeah that deep and it's probably not going to be able to get a Fox borough and when in the postseason the patriots deepen can make enough plays but they're not star studded either\nDo you feel like there is just it's just kind of wide open when it comes to the wild cards and then a lot of these divisions outside of maybe two or three teams that are at the top of the heat\nOr why the NFL loving it right I mean they called competitive balanced they don't want to call parity so you know that's when you have these teams that have this early surge and then you know fade back into the pack a little bit as the good teams get going I\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers right I mean there there are team that's getting hot now at the right time we'll see what ends up happening with this lady on bell situation and you know if those who's returned potentially disrupt the flow of that Pittsburgh off it sounds\nLike a weird things for me to mention here but trust me when you tried to start feeding the football somebody with a unit that's running so smoothly as it is you run the risk of perhaps ... tracking the way that the off into developing right now but that's a great part for the NFL look seeing in the two teams like are seeing teams rather like the jets\nFloors once again get a little bit of excitement at three in three so you know you keep that market people in Chicago despite the loss of the Miami Dolphins they're excited about the bears I have a chance for a big rebound game on Sunday against the New England patriots you know then again there's some teams you know traditional teams to that we're watching that\nYou're saying what's going on with the New York giants right and this is just bad football but at least take one Barclay\nMakes it entertaining right and of course we got to watch the Denver Arizona too interesting times here for Vance Joseph should the Broncos lose on Thursday\nIs a it's going to get bounced out the door I mean he ... and Gary Cooper react or an accurate who got to tell you why you're correct in the second John Elway would I met with him in August that Broncos training camp he admitted I Want to Garry I still want to carry crew react as my head coach he's simply can't do it physically\nTo me I don't know how less of an endorsement you can get to know if what you're saying right there I mean the handwriting was on the wall I just don't think John is very impressed\nWith the way the advances handled his business and now when he goes public this week on on\nDenver radio because the defense soft which is just obviously a terrible you know a terrible thing to be called as a defense because it keeps getting out in the running game a lot of pressure on advance as he enters his game but you know the fact that you have such competitive football and you got teams like the browns that are making a little bit of a push that have been bad for so long\nIt's made it a fund seasons of I mean I just ... and remember to the narrative so far has been football we're not dealing with other things the media seems to have tired on the anthem stuff we've moved on from that Roger Goodell is in hiding no one knows\nWhere he is so all he's he is a convenient punching bag for saying something\nEven the officiating as bad as head of controversies but not anything that has overshadowed the the game itself so I think that's another reason that the league is flourishing they've been able to stay out of their own way this time\nYou mentioned the browns the cardinals points Thursday night the jets three and three all surrounded by quarterbacks right now we know Josh ... buffalo he's out for at least a month or what have you made so far these are these ...\nYou know Bradford and you know he where his turnaround on sort of Bradford headsets and Arnold\nWho sounds are are\nYou going to be I Know how dare I write a poor poor guys losing out on four hundred thousand dollars each week that he sits there and number three quarter back good thing is going to be able to restaurant that's sixteen million dollars he was paid\nBy the Arizona Cardinals and I hope one Steve Wilkes\nTurtles general manager speaks with team ownership about that bad boy at the end of the year like what what were you thinking you know the great part is yeah Mike Lenin there is a reminder to about why overpaying\nOn this quarterback but but I digress but in the case of Darnell you know he's gotten confident\nIn this office he said it a couple of weeks ago I have to start trusting what I'm seeing pull the trigger don't be hesitant plus they feel really decent running getting behind them right now and again I mentioned Rick Denison earlier last thing I got to be representatives were Denison twice on the show but he's really good offensive line coach and the jets are flourishing in that zone blocking scheme that he's put in\nAnd I say ... playing is playing well and he's really helping the amount of right now the jets\nBut able to get some momentum on the offensive side of the football they scored\nThree straight games with thirty plus points I Believe that's ... I mean not jet football that we've been seeing for Josh how he's taken a beating because of the team around him it's so terrible and\nYou know now he's going to be out for a little bit or maybe we can get the main thing Peter and experience again maybe not I hope not [laughter] or Derrick Anderson so we've got that you know for ... for Baker Mayfield learning on the job and I think and again we talk about the browns and\nWhy was Jackson's initially has an end to name Baker is starter why I think he recognized that\nBaker need some work but for Brown's team there probably isn't a playoff team this year it's fine for him to take his lumps and then we're going to see the Hebrew hammer himself Josh rows and coming up\nThursday night so far each week he's putting up a little bit better numbers he really is Twenty one completion is two hundred forty passing yards last\nWeek against Minnesota on the road not the biggest of stats but they are showing some progress for him all those Arizona team truly dreadful it's what happens when you try to completely change or off into the defense of systems in the same year without a major roster overhaul\nA game on Sunday with the cowboys and and the jaguars produce results that people were surprised with especially since the child was also struggled so much and you figure Jacksonville come out that she scheme where which is a little bit of life especially on all sides in the opposite of a happened\nWhere do you make of the cowboys in and generous to me the cowboys are ...\nThe ... in Eighteen they're gonna finish runny Jacksonville though I I don't ... I haven't bought morals this whole time I think we're seeing why um why the skeptics ... must be proven right this year\n[laughter] yeah and you know they're just not making big plays in the past and game and Jacksonville and when you're not doing that\nYou got a real problem because wanted for nets not there and it's just a pedestrian running game after that and were given the drags fits right now and you know we we didn't talk about it in the off season or the ... to the Houston Texans they're they're nickel corner with significant DJ have and it's been injured this year the guy that was signed to replace him the former first round pick of the Oakland Raiders and\nThey're there when they get when the jak get into those situations where they're trying to cover a slot right now they're getting absolutely blown up and you look at the monster game called ... had\nA you know for them for that team I mean that's you know that ... can for them you know as look as for the jak themselves I don't know where this team is headed you could sort of tell that this ... you know a lot of confidence I don't know if a hangover from last year but you experience that success and suddenly everyone's telling you how great you are and you know things like that and and I just don't know if if they really\nYou know after they beat the patriots I think this team really lost its focus and that falls on Doug corona falls on Tom Coughlin it just seemed to me what they thought at that point that they had won the super bowl and they had events two thousand Seventeen and that was it and we haven't gotten good football from the track team since and I'm just wondering what direction they're headed because the Philadelphia Eagles a shorter and play some good football\nAt the right time and that game was coming up\nIn another week in London so we'll see if the track team was able to rebound big game against Houston on Sunday by the way\nThe Indianapolis Colts better get that fruit basket from the Houston Texans for the holiday season they could've killed the titans they could have put them at oh three in one hand they decided to play for the tide and overtime and at that point the Texans seasons probably lost instead they're storming back at three and three and they got to get a chance as anyone that went in this division\nLess than a minute here Alex but I Want to ask about the raiders how bad is this just I I I'm just going to ask it that broadly how bad is this\nIs horrendous and and I don't know how much worse it can get\nYou know obviously if you lose their car its worst political ... walk in the way he's block and right now I Know he was banged up but that's a mess up left tackle now you've got a rookie right tackle and random Parker came to the office of a you know the passing him it's hit and miss but if the defense of can't stop anybody they were just dominated from the get go against Seattle not gonna change they just can't come up with anything\nNot good and the secondary not good in the past Russia not good at linebacker\nBut but other than that or the play was fine Mrs Lincoln raiders\nGoing to have a probably a top five pick in two thousand and eight and nine team for John Gurdon and tried to find this past Russia\nAlex thank you my friend have a good week we'll hear next week you're on the show\nThanks again for your as smart as he's at al it's more of as on Twitter let's bring another good friend Andy Garcia out in Los Angeles find out what happened last night for teddy taken away\nFrom this report is brought to you by Granger America's trusted source word does drilling safety supplies was Granger dot com in postseason baseball game three National League championship series\nAnd the brewers shut off the Dodgers in a way forward to nothing great pitching from Milwaukee job we've just seen gets the when he went five and a third endings no runs three ... combined to go three two thirds endings I'm sure not baseball I'm going to hit\nAnd as far as the audience goes Orlando Garcia where they chew on home or in the seventh inning plenty of options\nNine o nine or thereabouts on up as one will be the first pitch geo Gonzalez enrich hill\nSo Jeff the Dodgers were shut out four to nothing by the brewers and the brewers are doing it was starting pitching which no one really expected right going into the series\nAnd the Dodgers are in a bit of trouble and I know that that makes you extremely happy both as a giants fan and somebody that can now smack talk to an e G and fills out in Los Angeles\nThe best part is all my friends are like well the giants are sitting at home right now I mean yeah sure I guess we are but you know Doug Jones is eighty eight so I'm not really sure how much they can talk about it you turn the game on a knife in the last night I was kind of back and forth and I realized oh wow the Dodgers had the bases loaded I Believe it was difficult was nowhere else for went out with the bases loaded\nI Want to say one out one out a Nobel yeah ... was the second out right and then\nIt was the third and uh the brewers closer than struck out both guys a nasty curve ball and bell injure a any a than a caught um car does you're looking at the end\nYeah you're right about the the bullpen right I mean I think the the the brewers or would like to win again without throwing hater and they threw him again last night I thought smallest brought up a good point they didn't need to throw him last night um but once he's up in an independent you got to use them at some point in and you're right the brewers want to win\nThe series with the bullpen and when they don't have to do that\nWe don't say heroin we through last night way through two batters last night so that saves him for tonight obviously um which is a big plus for them it's amazing how the how\nWe've gone to a point where baseball is get your start or to maybe five innings amateur ballpark take over I mean we saw David Price of the night for two thirds get your ... we saw last night\nOr in a regular season game you or what you want to start or go past six not miss game get it right get right to ... and um and that's the way the postseason is built now your book with a lead and and and let it roll and it was interesting last night Kiki Hernandez and the Dodgers after the game\nKind of went off on the fans for\nFor not having energy in the ballpark are not being there to chew their team on and you always talked about his team as well not not having the energy I Know Danny I'm ...\nI I Know the time doesn't help the the the started again but he didn't tonight it's a it's a ... pm Pacific start do you think you people will be there on time [noise] I it's it's hard to say\nYou know when your team wins regularly and I know you don't know about this since Tony fourteen Jeff ... when you have all these division titles and you've gone to the world series the problem is a lot of Dodger fans are day dreaming about having a World Series ticket\nAnd you know what those were average Thirteen hundred dollars last year yeah and\nSo who wants to\nYou know blow your stash of money on one of these games when you want to go to a World Series game so that's what the challenges I'm actually going to go Wednesday it was a couple of hundred dollars just for my ticket or a grip for the parking you know the food's going to be even more so everything gets jacked up\nSo that is the challenges that the fans expected seemed to go to the world series and so they don't want to spend their budget on a regular playoff game when they want to use that money for a World Series ticket\nSomehow one of my buddies last year got World Series tickets for three hundred dollars\nHave been I Want his phone number 'cause I have no idea\nHow to every World Series game him his wife and their young son like I don't know how a Texan white dude you don't know how much you make like you're not making enough to go to buy three three thousand dollars worth of tickets to every game or yours too 'cause the baby was still alive maybe um so I yeah you were in his hook up\nKnow ... he throws heat 'em in yeah who was\nRyan Braun was interviewed on F is one after the game he said the dealer throws the best pure stuff in baseball and if anyone knows about the best pure stuff it's Ryan Braun but rich shows a veteran he's he's a veteran rich chill will pull the Dodgers even tonight\nYeah you sound very very confident about that we didn't even get to talk about Mr ground all he's having a a tough stretch right now and I know that they had to go after the fans are just going him vociferous Lee and constantly\nLast night they didn't have anything else to get excited about so they just want to boot that guy when we come back

a mechanic so bad and then after\nThe game yeah what do you say right PC what beat him and he beat him and tried to use the the Bible has a defense and that's a good job I Am citizen you go to the

you would think you know what they are going to be in a position to finally break that postseason drought even as recently as last year and I know what Patrick bombs twenty three years old he hasn't been a part of that utility before\nBut I Do think that you want to have won by so are you at least advance to the division around and to the difference between having to go on the road in New England versus getting to play at home in Kansas City having that one game lead right now\nI think that's worth paying a lot of attention to even though we're only six week than if you are chief's fan that it's something that you should have circled and that's something you should be monitoring at a high level particularly because now you know like you said the patriots have that tie breaking the event they end up with similar records but top five uh basically we have the same teams except I can see is wrong\nYou know I think that there's something to that I think you you saw that with the cubs for for decades you know and\nPeople that go to Wrigley Field and therefore they won their title of course said the places quiet it's like they're always waiting for something bad to happen and I think that does happen to a certain degree what Dodger fans but but not at this point\nTo me I think the fans are a little bit and the ... just the team as a baby and all year as sort of been complacent in some areas which is not a bad thing they've been very calm and climbed themselves out of a pretty big batch\nThat they died for themselves earlier in the year but there there is something to that I'm not sure if it's happening right now but there's something to it\nLet's switch over to football now the rams she went into a ball games is there a new one there to ruin games in another room again this weekend in San Francisco how do you solve this team is it just the rams might get bored a couple of games and just not giving all I don't know how anyone can stop this often\nYeah and we we've all seen you know we're saying the same thing about the chiefs and and they finally got beat it took the patriots to do it but\nWe we say these things about teams earlier in the year and you're right I mean just football logistics if you talk about it really simply makes it hard they they have a great back\nAnd they can block so they push people off the line of scrimmage and can run with him so if you commit your safety a little closer you don't get a lot of help down the field and\nGolf can make the throws and they have a guy that can go deep really fast they had one last year and walking this year it's cooks who's having a better year and they have a lot of really good underneath guys and everybody knows their role\nIn this guy's a really good play color and they structure to the ... as well and they spend money on ... they're not stopping a lot of people [laughter] it's hard to stop people when you're off into so prolific that's kind of\nIt's kind of weird and football you if you're off at scores a lot of points your your defense gives it up a little bad it's just\nIt's part of a deal for a lot of teams so that's probably going to happen but yeah they look great it's still October but they look really special\nCare that guy make plays\nIn games and the playoffs Jared golf is that going to happen or it looks like it might but how do you stop 'em I I'd stopped early you know I put\nI put seven eight guys ... consistently end of the box and and get after girlie fast\nAnd then see what happens with cough but you know that you're putting people at a bad position one on one\nThey made a lot of plays so I mean I'm not accord nobody pays me to be a coordinator I'm just a fat idiot on TV\n[laughter] is ... is our guest here on out kicked the coverage from five Seventy LA sports\nKnow that you're on the pulse of the things in one thing I've always appreciated about the ... show is just how long the boxer wound again but you also have a good and what's happening in LA and I think the question that at least me being here in Nashville across the country from you has about this this\nIs LA starting to ton of embrace the rams I mean LeBron starts playing basketball on Thursday\nOr people going to care about the rams despite the fact that they're probably the best overall team in the league right now\nYeah people it's gaining some traction and the tail will really be told when they're ready to opens\nBecause we love something new in Los Angeles where the biggest front running city in the world and most of the people in Los Angeles like punk cast clay what he's out here are not\nFrom here so [laughter] you know they they'll embrace anything that they think as cool as far as the the real city and that the the people in the city I think that's gaining some traction to ... and people are kind of end of the chargers if they get a caller offensively they look good\nLA loves the winter that does that mean it's going to be long consistent\nLove perhaps I mean but that's not what happened in St Louis I mean the rams went out there and and and one that won the super bowl and we're very good and went to another Super Bowl and you know it fizzled out about a decade later so ah I'm not sure about the long term appeal\nOf anything here anymore it's it's such a an interesting thing if it's not the Dodgers are the Lakers\nSometimes people don't show up while USC football you know they consistently do great attendance UCLA is a little bit more complicated because the ... far from campus but I think\nThey've made significant strides just this year\nBut when the arena opens and they have to really fell very expensive personal seat licenses and you guys know all about that\nPro football stuff a lot better than me uh that's when we'll really find out and you know the other part of it that people don't understand is the rams didn't leave LA and the nineties they left LA in Nineteen eighty and went down to Orange County\nAnd you all know about the angels and\nTrying to find my trout and all that that in Anaheim is not really a a nationally recognized place and by nationally recognized I mean LA doesn't recognize\nThe Anaheim [laughter] you know my truck gets lost nationally yeah and like try to\nGet lost in LA yeah we don't get my traffic news so uh the rams hadn't been around for a really long time but LA loves the winter so I guess that doesn't answer the question\n... yeah it's sort of it's sort of [laughter] we'll still will stay in LA and then when we were to tell us football a little bit but\nLeBron starts playing on Thursday as we said\nThe expectations I don't know if they are through the roof out there or not certainly the coverage through the roof everywhere you can't turn on the television without hearing about the Lakers\nWhat do you actually think the Lakers are going to look like on the floor like is this a fifty when team I I kind of tend to think they're probably a little shy of that but I honestly I don't know what ... means with this crew because we just haven't seen him\nYeah I could see them going on incredible when streets and also some bad spots and I don't know if he's going to give Luke Walton the shoulder like he gave to ... [laughter]\nBut I I'm sure there'll be some serious growing pains\nAnd I I'm Still under the ... uh he's one of the great players and he can carry a team almost anywhere but I'm under the impression that this was not a move\nFor ... to to win championships this was a move for exactly what you mentioned twenty four hour media coverage in one of the media capitals of the world\nAnd he wants to eat with Al Pacino and Leonardo DiCaprio he wants to do is show with Drake\nAnd he's got to play basketball too and I'm sure he's going to be great and they're going to go to the playoffs but this is not a championship basketball\nTeam and that's frankly what you'd expect having the best player in the world on the team but I I don't think that's what this is a place for this is a place for clicks and views and sell tickets and make it an event\nAnd it's a hell of an event it's going to be to me the coverage is a little forced\nBut [laughter] but I understand and that's what that's what people are into that\nHappening here or whether you like it or not but I don't think it's I don't think it's about really competing gone to court for a championship\nWas talking about college football on me and you can talk about the ... conference forever but we'll save the listeners out for right now a note on the air you\nSeems well I mean we could spend like a big win against Colorado Oregon obviously be Washington but uh\nJust a big picture college football look right now um it seems to me that the playoffs feels sort of set outside of Notre Dame I we've actually seen probably the ACC team a big ... big twelve team the patch almost out the door to him seem like the one big wildcard right now\n[noise] yeah they are if Notre Dame is any good it's always the wild card because you can't leave about if they're\nIf they're winning games and obviously that's what they're doing and I saw somebody's headlined the other day I Wish I remembered who it was but it said to to make it through a championship in college football you have to be really really good and really really lucky\nAnd you know that's going to happen you know it it might even happen to Alabama although it's hard to fathom that they're going to show up flat and the game and somebody's going to take it to him and and you've got to find a way and sometimes it's that way\nInvolves a little bit of luck so\nI think this is a much better Notre Dame team much more physically solid than\nThe one that got beat by Alabama that had ... tail or on the team I forget what year that was but I think Dr Kelly started a hell of a job maintaining tradition and Notre Dame as far as\nBeing really physical and having that identity because that was their identity before I played when I played\nA they lost it under Charlie wise and and he he kind of had to dig it out and it's it's pretty impressive because they do push people right off the ball a that being said I mean\nAlabama ... to ... to me and Michigan I think is is a really good team with a great just an elite the fat that can't be overlooked you know as the season goes on but", "show_name": "FOX Sports Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Newton", "day": "16"}
