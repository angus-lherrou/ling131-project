Grady for the wall Street Journal editorial board she's the America's columnist and editor watching the story from Puerto Rico these last month since September hurricane of last year\nThe debate has been about excess deaths following the hurricane to Puerto Rico I followed the story was married to her columns because Puerto Rico was what was a mess afterwards with tangled and failed electricity generation\nAnd the inability of the Puerto Rican FEMA a executives to respond in a in a credible fashion uh also Puerto Rico has longstanding problems with debt electrification it didn't occur to me but that was going to wind up into a political toy\nTo use against the Trump Administration in these last week's marry your reporting about excess more excess of mortality yeah after the hurricane struck Puerto Rico I think the salient fact here is that you've got nothing to compare this to because that's not how the national weather service things\n[noise] yeah well the the uh the headline of course was that three thousand people died in a hurricane and of course the implication is this happened under Donald Trump there for Donald Trump has not enough money in Puerto Rico and doesn't care about Puerto Rican people and by the way you know let's extend that to all Hispanics you know it was very much politicized\nAnd I'm so that kind of got my attention for two reasons first of all um there's a very prominent meteorologist who wrote a wonderful essay about this particular study it's a study done by George wash at George Washington university's milk and Institute\nAnd what they tried to do was measure how many people died between September of two thousand Seventeen and the following I Believe was the end of February so basically six months um and the hurricane was of course that toward the end of September\nAnd what they tried to do is look at what would be the normal mortality rate over that period of time and then what was excessive over that and they attributed that to the aftermath of hurricane\nAnd this meteorologists by the name of John morale is who is actually born I think in New York but I spent quite a bit of this like in Puerto Rico is Puerto Rican mother on he made a very um a sensible statement that number one\nThis is not how anybody measures hurricane fatalities so to all of a sudden this extended the six months when hurricane fatalities are generally a measured in a shorter period of time it's kind of disingenuous on top of that you have\nThis study at the milk and Institute you have another study at Harvard and you have another study at I think it was Penn and these studies can have different\nIt's time frames and they they can they can use different methodology and his point was that for example if you look at the Harvard study that was at the Harvard study came out and said that somewhere between seven hundred and some people and eight thousand and some people were excess mortality\nAnd four months or three months after the hurricane\nThat's a huge window and so what the reporters do is they chose the midpoint of those two numbers and they said this is how many people died well that is far from an exact science I'm an ... something similar was done it wasn't such a broad window but it was something similar was done with the milk and Institute\nAnd so I just wanted to point out that you know you have the period of time\nDuring the hurricane that of course you you know off the obviously find bodies and people have died that you didn't count initially and I think the government's count is somewhere around sixty four so to expand that to three thousand you have to start a signing\nProblems of the hurricane to um problems in the aftermath in other words it wasn't really the storm it wasn't a high wind\nWhat was the infrastructure and the uh the emergency exactly and that's\nThat's not how hurricane death are counted that's point number one point number two is to blame this on the federal government I think is really disingenuous when you look at\nThe way that Puerto Rico has been manage I mean I Would say over the last Twenty years at least um you have a lot of you basically\nRun away populism I'm to the point where the electricity company was giving away electricity and when you don't collect a revenue for your electric company you can't reinvest you can strengthen the grid and you become extremely vulnerable to the storm\nThat's what happened and this is a government run electricity company this isn't a private company but\nMarried don't remember correctly that the executives in charge of FEMA's office in Puerto Rico were locked in politically to the governor of the island and that a lot of blame shifting has been going on because that's political advantage in Columbus in Puerto Rico nothing to do with Washington\nYeah I mean I was very critical at the time of the hurricane the week after of the way that FEMA behave but not I mean you know the implication is always that Washington doesn't care about Puerto Ricans but in fact the the guy the guy on the island was a Puerto Rican the guy who was running the operation\nAnd he basically in my mind you know messed up because he was saying in in the weeks after the crisis when they're still with no electricity for dialysis patients and all kinds of ... basically the hospital for and really bad shape and you add\nThe people who need it electricity and he said well I have the generators but how was I supposed to know that the companies were not going to be able to deliver the feel now I think that's\nPreposterous you're an emergency management planner and he was a Puerto Rican so this wasn't a you know the idea that that bunch of people over here on this on the mainland didn't care about Puerto Rico is she said that FEMA messed up and the and that included have\nMary we have thirty seconds is Puerto Rico learned a lesson is there any indication that they're going to be prepared for another storm thirty seconds\nNo I don't think so I mean they're still blaming a President Trump and not taking responsibility and until they when they're rewriting the narrative in this way it indicates to me that they just want to keep shoving off the responsibility for managing the island to the rest of us\nMary Anastasia Grady for the editorial board of the wall Street Journal she's the America's editor and columnist on John bachelor this is the John bachelor show\nHow can I ask my daughter was reading\nSearching for help with Dr reading\nHow can I hold my daughter was reading

conservative saw some of them you will find that when he managed to keep on talking twelve hundred and I hardly radio station [noise]\nThat universities where the beneficiary of what free labor they didn't have to pay the players are doing is paid the player and Adidas also paid the university that's a win win\nMost trades most transactions are quid pro quo which means you got to give something to get something the universities they just gave the directive like a third base coach this guy is dean is and then they like the guy who wrote a check how much how much is this guy going to cost how much do we have to pay his parents how much what is his uncle whoever\nI now second when Jim ghetto knowing me the actually Adidas executive knowing that he would not be working with college basketball players are working in the the shoe business likely ever again what he has done based on day one is decided I'm going scorched earth ah every bridge I cross I'm going to blow up\nEvery bridge I'm going to destroy that's what I'm going to do and and what he has done is he is tossed out shout out Nike\nShut out on her arm and he has implied and use them as collateral damage essentially saying that everyone's doing that yes Adidas didn't do it\nAnd so did Nike and so none of them are in fact there was like an arms race between the shoe companies to try to get the players to go to universities so they were feeding on players it was like a meat market for the top high school players the AAU players in America which is not that outrageous\nConsidering that this has been the belief that many people have had for a long time\nAnd now keep in mind that this is not an effective defense in itself right the ... everyone's doing it the fans does not usually weren't\nYou get pulled over for speeding and everyone's driving eighty five miles an hour you just happened to be cherry pick you still get the ticket even though you say everyone was speeding what the hell\nBut it is intriguing is that there were full scale beating wars for the top players and you know there were being auctioned off and for top level bothers you know the the whole student athlete term which is a pet peeve of mine a clearly an oxymoron and so the dirty laundry\nIs being aired in a Manhattan courtroom\nAnd you've got to think that this is just the tip of the spirits day one it's not just\nCollege basketball that's the reason this is the tip of the spear that this goes on there's a ripple effect and it got to think that there's some college football coaches that\nThat are kind of look into the other side a little bit looking at the store and they're like they they might be having panic attacks themselves thinking about am I going to get dragged into this ... is is going to spill over into football\nNow the the final final point the United states prosecutor is arguing that the\nPerson named here Jim ghetto he said when you lie cheat and deceived that is a crime that's where the U.S prosecutor said unfortunately that is not accurate lying and cheating and deceiving or not by themselves crime there not a either was wrong to do that is immoral to do that\nBut in business people lie all the time right and you know the cheat this even if that was the case you know say Ninety seven percent of the business world would be locked up right if those three things were a crime they'd all be locked up and maybe they should all be locked\nBut this is an N. C. H. A. rules violation there are not laws\nImply because again I I Believe that if there is no victim\nThere is no crime and therein lies the rub in reality that that is where the the FBI is trying to say here that there's a victim who is the victim right they're charging these people with the advantages a victimless crime and then we can all agree the shoe company is the beneficiary because they get the young player to wear their brand\nIn college the school benefits because they get top shelf college basketball players they don't have to pay 'em the shoe company pays him the family benefits because they get paid as well so who are the bad people in this who are the people that are being wrong in this who are they\nCan you tell me\nMaybe I'm not that bright 'cause I'm doing the overnight show so tell me who the real victim in in this because again you're talking about wire ... where's the odd I the family who takes the money knows they're taking the money\nAnd according to the documentation the coaches are in their orchestrating these payments so they know what's going on in the shoe companies like they know they're part of this is what so where's the crime in\nA in this\nThis is a really good defense I don't know how much he paid his lawyers and I'm assuming is a lot of money some high price law firm but I gave them credit and you know it's it's usually a losing battle when you fight the federal government in court\nBut if if you want to say hey this is some kind of tax violation that they didn't pay taxes on this that's a different conversation a ... and you can go down that road but on the wire fraud charge alone which is what this trial is about from what I understand\nI have going to win I spend on a show on Fox we see all over the age men Dallas\nMays Garcia [noise]\nThat was a crispy curve ball you just through the like a ten to six I Love that dropped I always thinks that story was all swelled with on\nAny you know I'm I'm always been in St by these legal stores but this one in particular because I didn't see this one come\nLike that to me that's a wonderful defense it's a really huge ... it's it's it makes all the sense in the world [noise]\nYeah it does like I Can't I Can't deny that it's I mean when when are we supposed to find out when this is going to be ...\nI saw the lower Manhattan federal court I don't know\nI'm assuming that this is going to take a little while and it's just the first trial but if it works wouldn't you think everyone all the other people involved in this would use the same basic defense you of course I why not you know it's like this is like a weather balloon to see a see what's going on\nBut yeah I Am that that is a story man I I saw it as a ... I kept I was trying to find out more I was like I was trying to read some more stuff on it and\nIt is intriguing and it's not getting a lot of play I can see that store and get a lot of play it 'cause it's not as a nobody people in the shoe business know who this guy is but he's not an athlete or a coach\nSo I yeah I haven't seen it uh yeah it's just a it's a while to start we'll take\nYour phone

mention that someone named Liam Hendricks\nIs going to be technically the starter but the A's are going to have eleven pictures and fourteen position players\nOn the roster and the anticipation is

against\nFast ball pitchers like they were the worst team in baseball it's slugging against pictures that through Ninety five or faster so it does set up well for the Yankees but the reason you want the Yankees were not that you want the Yankees doing 'cause at New York and all that and it would be a better series with the red Sox and more more juice\nIn a series the reason you want the Yankees doing is because if the age when\nYou're going to get a bunch of copy cats in the future teams are 'cause he's won a wild card game and they use eight pitchers so I Want to use eight pictures I used to joke about this\nWe used to do a bit on the show I said well you know you want to have a a dominant picture I used to make fun of the pictures that were always hurt and my argument was what they should do is every team should have nine pitchers and every picture pitches want any and that way none of them will have Tommy John injuries and there'll be\nThe play and they'll never get hurt and all that stuff just like have Eighteen pictures and just rotate them in you'd have to expand the rosters but you have nine pitchers one day and night which is the next\nDay and I was totally I had my

came up with a flush uh\nIt is a interesting to think about all three of those things coming together at the same time the nation's second largest market and you compare it said to New York you know which will be the only city I think you could compare it to get the um do Arnold I guess the Eli collapse you get double NFL teams in New York City\nYou got the Yankees which is always good um but uh the poor will we go on a New York Knicks I mean\nIt it is I Would argue if you had to pick a city right now to be the center of America's sports landscape\nLA would probably have to be that city right now\nI mean I don't even know what that he would be number two on the list of\nCities that are the focal point of the sports a universe maybe you could go with Boston is the only other comparison because obviously the Celtics assuming Gordon Hayward and Kyrie Irving and everybody else is coming back healthier very good\nUh the Boston Red Sox are obviously in the postseason and had the best record in the American league and you had a twenty year run effectively for the patriots with Brady and ... maybe that's the battle\nMaybe it's a battle right now between LA and between uh in Boston and now that I think about it maybe Boston is more of the focal point but it's clear that that would be a one two punch with Boston in LA and given the history of Celtics and the Lakers it would be a it would be intriguing if that could end up being a battle or if you end up with\nPatriots in the in the super bowl which would uh certainly unite the two coasts and ah and have him going head to head

Texas has covered five straight in this Red River rivalry here so I Do think we will see some practice money\nThis Oklahoma oftentimes it's just it's just way too good I don't think Texas is going to be able to keep up Oklahoma\nHas the best yards per playoff and in college football taxes the Seventy four scoring team in in football I I'm not a big fan of Santa mowing gr I I just don't think he'll be able to score enough and I ... just doing some really special thing so\nI'm On the sooner is despite this line creeping passes touchdown I think they're going to win but by double digits\nLSU Florida LSU as a to point favorite right now going on the road against Florida\nOr the gators have went back to back big road games over Tennessee in Mississippi State and LSU if they win would play a massive either way it's going to be a big game but if they're both on defeated it would be a top five matchup Georgia going to LSU how do you break down LSU Florida\nWell Florida is much improved from from last year and I thought this line would be lower I didn't think it would be this low and and I still think LA you is is a little bit underestimated I\nLike them to win the school and I love ... I think Joe ... is wearing absolutely\nAmazing I think he's not getting the credit he deserves he's just making really smart decisions with the football not turning it over I just think over sixty minutes Alex you is is is a step above where Florida is right now they'll continue to improve by I I like to LSU and this one I don't see the spread is high enough\nOr a glass top twenty five match up to talk twenty five teams playing Notre Dame and this might be the most difficult game remaining on their schedule if you are a golden dome or fan and you want Notre Dame to make the college football playoff you want them advancing to compete for a championship\nThis is probably your biggest obstacle remaining not to say that Notre Dame is going to win every game beyond a shadow of a doubt just that\nThis is a little bit of a challenge Notre Dame on the road against Virginia attack what would you say about this one\nWell their interests here with Notre Dame are starting in sports book I'm calling him now because he's covered to spread since he started in and took over for for Notre Dame 'em and you know ten touched down three of them rushing you can do everything really well there's all kinds of flying\nBy Virginia Tech or a little underestimated in this war environmentalists would require the week like last week and get an incredible job going on for for an injured Josh jak some\nGreat hunter for Virginia Tech I just feel like this is true many points and maybe even though it was too good to go I feel like the Old Dominion factor is maybe go to this one a little too much so\nI think we're going to be decided by he'll go either way so it's too many points or I'm going with the host each\n[noise] any other college football games on the horizon they are coming up this weekend that you look at and you say man I've got a bet on this one I Love this one\nYeah I got my Anna nice Thirteen and a half against for if they are\nFor state owned nine and two of them spread and they're locked eleven conference rooms I just think that the way better team right now for the state will continue to struggle another one that jumped out at in Kentucky plus five and a half I'd I think we all kinda flew to underestimate the ceiling and refused to believe they can be good\nIn the FCC by giving them a real tough game here and I think worth some money line\nAnd let's go into a let's dive into the NFL a Thursday Night Football the patriots or a double digit favorite against the cold the cold coming off a a disastrous decision to go forward on Fort down the result maybe not the decision itself but the result anyway\nLeading to a law there one in three but all three of their losses were very competitive double digit favorites\nColds I mean sorry patriots how do you play this\nYeah real tough loss for the call therapy hide them last week and I did um so\nBut the ... the decline the big at first but the path or twelve and three against the spread in their last ... ... when they're favored by double digits and that's just crazy for any NFL at me like with talk a lot about crazy pots are numbers that they cover all the time\nCalled for the number one third down conversion team in the NFL about another one that does kind of make me feel like this line is a little bit too big\nI don't have the best the line either I think this is going to be a little bit closer than the spread suggest I Do like the way the culture are improving sheer\nWhat about the battle of Texas you've got the cowboys going up against the Texans the Texans have three and a half point is favored in this game there's a lot of storyline surrounding it to the Texans pretty much have to win the cowboys are in the NFC store doesn't look like anybody is necessarily going to pull away how would you assess this one\n... ... it's a little bit weird that the taxes are our favorite by more than a field goal considering that just last night in a row and just slapped that it's not that that losing streak\nThey also have only covers one of their lack nine meetings share so\nLittle bit interesting but I think odds makers had it right here I I like the Texans and what I don't like about the cowboys is is this up and and and\nGot Prescott just point terribly it to me making bad decisions confident back there in the pocket the thirtieth ranked scoring who have the thirtieth rank passing team and and that Texans are good at stopping Iran so I think they're going to stop the run and just scare them to beat them with a path and I don't think the cowboys are good enough to do that so I'm On the taxes\nI think the biggest game of Sunday by far than personally any way is jags going on the road against the undefeated chiefs the Kansas City chiefs around at three point favorite over Jacksonville how will Patrick ... do against that Jacksonville defense particularly their secondary how do you play this one\nYeah this is classic off on sources defense match up I tend to lose when my handicapping just in general I tend to be friends when I'm looking at these\nAre the chief finally went under last week for the first time the season and we've seen a lot of over as overall in the NFL\nSo far this year fifty four percent actually so ah but I think the jagged are going to keep this one cause I think they're the gloom achieve a final and lose here by the jak have lost three straight against chiefs\nSo what should we know are in general that maybe I haven't asked you about betting on the NFL this weekend are there any games you're in love with it I haven't mentioned to you\n[laughter] well I Want to I Love the Redskins watch that can happen at a New Orleans and wit Lou Orleans I like to take them at home with her fifth move five and won against the spread on the last Twenty one or two are on the road I like to take a mirror that cover the spread much more on the road\nThey're eaten alive and against the spread over the last couple of seasons at home so Lyme tend to be inflated when they're at home and that's what we're seeing here I think that's a very very good Redskin great the fans really a fishing off and that just feels like way too many points\nAbout ... that I'm ... we're looking at my ... and yeah as I mentioned we were tons of scoring I think the new the new rocket ... rules are helping Mac\nAnd we want to read more ... than we flew through when for our ... ever than ever before do\nA much higher score and overheard comment at fifty four percent from year war yet downward trend I think we're told all come down a little bit I think we'll be able to come from a value in under ethics dot com quite as much by a battery early trends\nAll right you are a huge hockey fan we're talking to John Campbell because you are from can add a cat in Canada where everybody loves and is obsessed with hockey hockey officially starts tonight\nUh with Ovechkin and the capitals I Believe hosting the Bruins if I'm not mistaken for the uh the opening game\nOr hockey season to already back which is crazy 'cause it feels like it just ended a comparison data college football or the NFL where it seems like the season is never going on and it seems like hockey season is always going ah how do you play that one or the kind of ... seats at odds as we come in for the start of a new hockey season\n[noise] yeah well there there is a ... at the top of the odds board for the first time in a while the Toronto maple leafs are the Stanley Cup favorite seven to one\nAnd I think that's really the market that say they're not I don't think it's quite be the favorite they should probably be near and the cop there but\nAlso a really interesting because the Vegas Golden knights or leader the are warming story last year their favorite some books in Las Vegas and we're seeing some real regional biased there because they're more like the one uh when you look at other sports book so I think\nThere'll be getting out of fuel Claire children there as well\nBut that type of bay lightning or the ... I'm right now when family up there are eight fifty around nine or ... what really strong and I think the best human ...\nOutstanding as always appreciate the time by man we will ah will talk to you next week than collect like\nThat John Campbell at Johnny odd shark on Twitter a couple of things I Want to hit you with as we go to break and come back for a for the start of our for our segment of the final segment of our one we only have three hours every day or we're gonna hit you with some animal thunder dome I Believe we haven't done that yet this week so give that to us we come back here are also\nTo file a way I Am doing a book signing if you are in Nashville or I Am doing a book signing tonight at seven o'clock\nVanderbilt University west and Barnes and noble\nOr I Will be there at seven o'clock in Nashville if you're a fan of my book Republicans buy sneakers to or if you want to get an autographed copy for somebody\nAnd the one Seventy five interchange in Cobb County some of the animals were trapped in the truck well dozens more build out on the interstate and several were hit by drivers coming around the curve of the exit ramp\nI Can't even imagine what that did to morning rush hour traffic in Atlanta which has already awful\nLow is actually the it was afternoon Dr says eleven cows were killed 'em they finally captured the final cow or just after four Fifteen PM but police were still searching into the late night reportedly the cow jumped over the side of the road and into the woods\nSo wait eleven of them were killed by cars yeah oh wow that's a slaughter\nThe ... massacre\nBan chick fillet ah ... their their base down in Atlanta I knew more chicken that's I've talked to a massacre for the cows that's a tough one for the new ... eat more chicken camp I knew you were going to go there oh man that's a tough break All right what else we got\nThose are those are the two that jumped out to me [noise] got to have more [noise] got to have a huge\nList I saw a couple here that I thought or a war intriguing one in Southern California Thirteen year old kid got attacked by a shark and they had to shut down the entire beach did you guys do that out there you know\nI'm a a kid I I think he was like a ... watt I loved diving for something um and ah this was a this was kind of crazy they shut down the beach for several miles around Emily pull it up a a the a\nCalifornia Boy attacked by a shark is recovering wants to go back in the water Thirteen year old boy in a in California and I think he was like a lobster diving and I didn't even know there were lobsters in California do you guys know that a Thirteen year old boy expected to recover from San Diego area after a shark attack them while he died for lobsters\nAre the teenager was a he's going to be fine but he was a bitten off the coast of ... uh or in in a city north of San Diego\nAnd uh they said he was in ah he he was a pretty crazy like I mean he was a four miles of beach has been closed they're trying to figure out exactly what happened the teen was ah was was a early Saturday during the opening our of California's popular\nSpine eat lobster seat and I'm going to be honest with you I had no idea there was a there were lobsters that people do foreign California\nOr the boy was diving in about nine feet of water a hundred and fifty yards offshore when he was attacked the witnesses said the shark was about eleven feet law\nUm and uh that was a that was pretty crazy it's been a decade sent somebody was a officially attack and of course this comes on the on the heels\nOf a man we talked about this on the show being bitten by a shark off Cape Cod in Massachusetts so both sides of the coast\nUh you never know what you're going to get into their so ... lobsters that's weird did you do that no big like a well I mean when you're\nPissed my ma ma she told us to go play in the middle of the freeway but I I don't think she would ever let us die in the ocean for lobster\nI didn't know that California had a lobster season but evidently especially like Southern California I Would think of that more is like a colder water thing but ah\nEvidently people go die for lobsters in ah in Southern California and unfortunately the shark or was not happy about that All right\nUh as we finish off our one reminder in Nashville book signing tonight for me seven PM at the Nashville Barnes and noble that's at Vanderbilt University campus effectively right there on the corner of West end avenue hope to see a lot of people\nFrom the Nashville area there we come back I Want to talk more about Patrick my home's not just that audio with him mixed with LSU cat ...

LeBron James and what's up\nThat threat what uh what's up clay and January my twelve year old daughter my called me and my wife was having an affair\nI'm brought up to my wife she did not at all and eventually I found out about everything found out the guy had been going on for about two years um I have an app and hug and a great father terrible has been drank five six\nIt's a week that income to bed probably five days a week or wouldn't shower and I but I didn't come to that smell like beer cigarettes a slap in the basement\nSo I wasn't the greater than I'm past six months of in the head start you know kept having sex or tell each other we love each other there's always like that that a truck issue [noise] ah I took a majority responsibility for her straying away\nUm but there's still always thought my mind anytime she'd on her context it on her phone doing whatever email um I just don't know like\nHow many kids do you have the one with my wife and two stepdaughters\nAll right so the twelve year old who told you about the affair is your biological child with your wife\nYeah\nUm how much do you like the twelve year old daughter\nA love her to death\nShe matters you already you than any many thing in the world right probably yeah I guess All right so uh and this has been six months since you've found out about your wife cheating on you are you guys don't allow in eight or nine yeah yeah you live still the same house have you\nChanged your drinking habits have you changed some of the behavior that you think might have been a precipitating factor for what happened\n... hill difficult Sunday you know like that out and drink beer and it's like\n... straight away from you know you\nHave you always knew I won't tell yeah no I Know that feeling trust me a lot of people out there listening due to right now has had to have you been faithful to your wife\nYeah since day one we've been married Fifteen Years\nOr you've been married Fifteen Years you have a twelve year old you have to step children you'll live in a house together what's your financial situation\nOr could be better like I don't know that I'd make it on my own\nYeah All right uh actually call a best of luck so this is a it's a complicated situation my position I understand some people disagree with this my position is once you get married and you have kids\nIf you can stay together and you don't hate each other to the end of the earth you should stay together\nNow this is a little bit of a complicating factor because your twelve year old daughter\nIs also aware of what was going on in your private life in your personal relationships and she's the one who had to be the one to tell you about how awkward this situation was\nUm but my position I've said this for a while I Can't imagine not waking up in the same house as my three boys right I've got a ten year old an eight year old and a four year old\nAnd so every morning I wake up in the house I Do my radio show a and then I usually walk my kids to school\nI think if you are not hating your wife and convinced that there is no way that you could ever stay together\nI Would probably try to make it work for the twelve year old at least until she gets to be Eighteen because I Do think the financial constraints the difficulties living in two different households I Do think that is challenging\nSo if you can stay together for the kids until the kids get to be college age kids graduate from high school and go off on their own in some way I always think that's preferable\nSo it sounds to me like this guy who just called in has the ability to stay in that relationship is just not sure how much faith has and his wife I understand that\nTrust is one of the most valuable things that exist in any relationship when you break that trust like you said she's texting she's on the phone you don't believe necessarily that that's a work related call or that it's an entirely innocent related issue a two year a fair is a long affair\nHaving said all that I think my advice is always going to be do whatever you think is better for the kid and if you believe the kid is better off with both of you in the same house which is usually the case that's what I Would uh that's what I Would advise alright what's who's up next\nUp we're going to LA on next LA rolling in what you got for ...\n[noise] hey how you doing morning um okay so my the runaround came back a lot fabulous two years ago my nephew is playing pro football he ended up getting picked up and signed by the Carolina pander he's starting from the ... now\nSo I have the round at my home team and the Carolina Panthers does my family came so we're both here to work and and my co workers I met her at the last couple of years but I think family comes first ... what do I do\nI there's this zero percent chance to me family comes first your team is the Panthers now I also think this is a little bit of an interesting question your co workers or just being losers they're jealous because you have a family member who plays on the Carolina Panthers\nThat's the story here that's pretty awesome now there's no reason why you can't cheer for the Carolina Panthers to first of all these uh sorry the Carolina Panthers and the rams they're not in the same division\nThey are in the same conference but they're not in the same division so if the rams to make the playoffs the Carolina Panthers could make the play offs to now what's inevitably going to happen is that you're going to play against each other\nAnd in that scenario you root for family over team\nI don't think that's a tough call at all if I had a nephew right now who grew up and played for the Alabama Crimson Tide\nI Would root for him to beat Tennessee because my family would matter more to me than the team that I grew up rooting for and I think that should be the general rule now\nWhat kind of family member if it's like a cousin Bryce removed or something like that that's different but a nephew is a really close family member\nThat's your sister or your brother's kid\nThat's really close family member\nWhen it gets into the cousin angle I think it becomes a little bit more difficult but that is I think the play All right uh what you got for me ... all I think by the way calls unimpressed solid range of calls here\nOr we're doing this every Wednesday when everybody to get used to it if the anonymous mailbag live on the air I Will solve all of your problems if you disagree\nWith my decisions or my advice you can weigh in on Twitter at\n... I think I'm the king Solomon I think I'm going to give you the right answer but doesn't mean everybody always agrees or who got the\nDayton, Ohio next Dayton, Ohio what you got for me dating\n[laughter] more than ... thanks morning to you\nI'm ... upcoming quicker than I had been to a game [noise] my wife is a diehard Hillary fan I'm a diehard giant fan my giants play on Thursday night should I wear my colors Sunday when I go to the game [noise]\nShould you wear giants geared to the Cincinnati Bengals game\nFor feelers\nNo you've looked like a loser when you wear gear for a team that's not even playing a game I got to tell you this there's always some guy\nWho shows up in gear for a team that's not involved at all just so everybody knows oh hey I met this game but I actually like another team that is a total loser move All right I cannot impress upon you enough doesn't matter what sporting event you go to\nI guarantee you there was somebody at the cubs game against the ... the Iraqis last night in St Louis cardinals hat 'cause he's buddies with somebody who was a cubs fan\nThat as a loser loser move nobody cares about you rooting for a team of a team that you're not watching play now if you don't care at all if you are what are the guys say was a giants fan and you got the Steelers going up against the bangles that's fine\nYou don't have to be like wearing gear of either of the two teams playing you can just go as a neutral observer and watch a game and enjoy it I Do that all the time\nYou could be a gambler and not care at all about anything what you cannot do is where random team gear from somebody else when you're going to that game now that happens by accident that's different right like if you are\nAre going to a let's say like the Lakers are playing against the warriors big west coast rival\nResults [noise] ah yeah and I've got your guy grew scoreboard which of course starts with Richard baseball's playoffs and our

the sea and the guy go out trick to govern studios\nAre indeed we are hearing the guy go al ... coverage\nStudios and I want to say good calls good calls by you guys none of us mailbag I thought that went pretty well I'm as we move closer to the uh the uh NFL week five\nI Am intrigued by this game Thursday night and we're going to talk about this some or a similar tomorrow certainly because Thursday Night Football be kicking off\nWhat the Colts the Colts are one of the most fascinating teams right now in the NFL if you actually go behind the record\nRight it's easy to look they're thirty two NFL teams I Know a lot of times we get seduced by what the overall record is and we don't really focus on the storyline that surrounds the record\nAnd the colds right now are one and three and a lot of people are talking about the Frank right decision on Sunday to go for it in overtime but to me what's fascinating about the colds is how easily they could be for no\nIf you have paid attention and again I Know a lot of people out there pay attention to their favorite team and then they just kind of look at the overall standings to keep tabs on what's going on elsewhere and sometimes that can lead you astray\nBecause it takes looking behind the numbers a little bit to understand what's actually going on with the team\nThe Colts were driving against the bangles in week one going for the when when they had a touchdown I mean at first down catch that was fumbled\nIf I'm not mistaken I'm going into the uh those uh those plays like the last minutes of that game and as a result there was somebody who actually ended up\nPicking up the bumbling scoring that was a win that could very easily have been a last does that make sense like it's always important to look at it with twenty four seconds left\nThe Colts are down twenty seven to twenty three and there's an eighty three yards bubble return for a touchdown by the bangles right so the culture driving right there and have a pretty good shot just scored a touchdown to beat the bangles All right that's a week one week to\nThe Colts go on the road and beat the Redskins that's the only lost that the Redskins have had so far on their schedule and the Redskins or in first place right now in the NFC so that's a pretty solid win by the colds they held the Redskins to nine points week three\nThe Colts are driving and they are trying to score against the eagles to end the game when ah they are not able to score to win that game and the eagles in fact\nScored a touchdown with three minutes left to take control of that game so that colds could very easily going on the road and beating the eagles to\nAnd then finally and again that a lot of people got attention and paid attention to\nThe Texans when thirty seven thirty four in overtime after the Colts decided to go for it on for down and aren't successful\nSo why do I bring all that up\nWhen you actually look behind the record\nEither cold or really good back tomorrow and I am going to be betting on the colds is a double digit favorite to cover now some of you out there right now are rolling your eyes you're\nSaying clay that culture one and three are you in saying this is Brady and ballot jak this is a short week dissident Fox borough I understand all of those arguments that you can make I think when you look behind the numbers the culture actually a really good team you could change the replays and the cold toward before now\nThink about that for a minute you changed three total plays\nAnd the colds are foreign oh going on the road and Fox borough would aid for into cold seem to be a double digit underdog against the patriots and the answer is no\nThis is an example I think of where you can get an advantage against the number by just diving into the data\nThe Colts have probably played what four hundred place so far this year roughly\nOn average if you changed three of them three percent of the overall outcome\nEverything changes in the culture for no and I bet the patriots who would be around five and a half or six point favorite against the for no Indianapolis Colts team\nThis line is inflated I Hope it keeps going higher because people want to bet on Brady and ballot jak I'm taking the Colts in this game and one of the fun things in the NFL is when you think you have a ... ed noticed one of these matchups that is artificially inflated when it comes to the number\nI don't know that there's anybody else in football right now that you could change a play from every game and they would be undefeated as opposed to sitting with one of the worst records in the NFL\nMost teams are not being having games that are decided that closely and in fact when you look at the colds it's a little bit of an intriguing you know the point differential when you look at the colds that is a a that's a storyline that certainly weren't paying attention to the colds are one in three\nAnd they have only scored sticks less points then their opponents\nGive you an example the titans in that same division are three and one and they have only scored two more points than their opponents\nThe best team in the NFL and the AFC and in the NFL overall if you just go by point differential well it's also a for no team it's the rams the second best team if you just go by point differential and this is going to surprise some people I think\nBaltimore Ravens there plus fifty eight\nSignificantly that better than just about everybody else sometimes you need to go look at point differential to get a sense for how it team is actually performing\nAnd with that in mind the two worst teams in the NFL for may point differential perspective one of them is not going to surprise you I don't think maybe neither one of them will the Arizona Cardinals have scored fifty seven less points than their opponents have so far this year\nAnd the second worst team and they were close to being the worst overall is the Buffalo Bills they have scored fifty six less than their opponents I dive into that\nBecause I Do think that sometimes you can get a little bit of a statistical advantage while it's really easy to pile on the colds and talk about how awful that Frank right decision was\nYou changed three plays and this team is sitting\nAt four no going on the road on a Thursday night game and we're all talking about how big it is not for the Indianapolis Colts were talking about how it's a must win game for the New England patriots in bed\nAnd look at the white football is play right the margin between success and failure especially in the NFL is often very tiny\nBut when you actually dive into these numbers I Love the cold ... giving you an early preview I Love the Colts tomorrow as a double digit underdog I think it is a no brainer play to be had alright or we're going to cut back final segment if you have it hurt our mix up\nThat Danny gee did which wing coach Joe and new NFL\nSuperstar Patrick my home's\nYou're
