have to do\nSo a while back the idea of sports gaming in America was talked about by a number of people in professional sports but the N. H. L. in particular took a strong moral stand against sports gambling at one point\nAnd pretty much pooh pooh the idea that they'd ever be involved in such tawdry operation\nAnd then\nGM resorts said how much do you want and la la\nVie NHL announcing Monday that they have a sports betting partnership with MGM resorts the official betting partner of the national hockey league they have the second professional sports league in line\nFollowing the Ayn BA now the NHL zeal is different from what we're being told me that in GM is not exclusive they're allowing the NHL distill sponsorships to other gambling operates\nPatients but there is a deal in place between the NHL and the gambling world and I promise you that major league baseball is next\nThe NFL after that they will all be ... there is money to be made it is free money it is found money\nRight ... they're talking about law suits and then there is no lawsuits there had been lawsuits already that have determine the names of the players the names of the teams can be used\nYou can't charge for that it's public information newspapers are all the newspapers got suit a while back I think it was major league baseball\nUh that tried to exclusively run fantasy sports and charge money for others to use their names of the players there was a lawsuit and they ruled in favor of the public domain\nAnd I'm paraphrasing some of this I'm giving my version of the truth but it is the gist of it is accurate and and so what I mean ... the the the meaning of is the result of this rather is that\nThe league does not have a right to sue they can't sue these gambling outfits and say hey you owe us money because you're using the names of players and the names of the teams they can't do that but if they can sue if they use the ... so if you go into a sports book\nIn any state where it's legal now you'll see the names of the teams but you're not going to see the logos unless you go to MGM they're allowed to use look\nThe point that out let's go now to Dick in Dayton, Ohio and boy this is big we're going to have also in a couple of minutes site to bite but Dick in Dayton is nice nice sliding scale morality by by hockey's

advance in the playoffs let's go ahead and get some value let's be sellers then there's a lot of other teams that could be buyers so my\nBottom a bottom five the bills\nThe giants the chewing worst teams in the NFL\nAnd we go out to the bay area I Would like to apologize to San Francisco and to Oakland and do all the fabulous residents of the bay area [noise] guys the raiders and the forty niners for that too\nFirst teams in the NFL right now now you may notice that the cardinals are not on this list that is intentional this week because the cardinals found a way to win a football game with their rookie quarterback Josh Rosen and I elevated them intentionally\nOut of my list of the bottom five teams in the NFL so I'm going bills Brown's giants raiders and forty niners as the five worst teams in the NFL Danny gee your thoughts [noise]\nWell the bay area it is a battle for the top draft pick this game coming up on Thursday night is going to be a barn burner\nIs that one of the worst Thursday Night Football games of all time\nNo it's not because you gotta wonder who's going to get the number one draft pick I'm being serious\nYeah but I don't care who get the number one draft pick in this respect we know the forty niners are not drafting a quarterback\nAnd so I genuinely care when a quarterback is being drafted 'cause things change with the selection of number one draft pick quarterbacks with the forty niners looked to me to be a team that probably wants to trade out of the number one pick if they end up in that in that position\nBecause they're going to be a decent number quarterbacks Justin Herbert ah drew lock not withstanding how bad they were in the second half against Kentucky [noise] there are a lot of guys out there that could be in the running to be the first quarter back taking this is a bad year I think to be the number one pick if you're the forty niners that is my bottom five\nBills brown giants raiders and the forty niners All right my top five\nThat was the list of sadness here is the list of excellence said I'll count 'em down in reverse order chargers and the fifth spot\nChargers obviously had to buy week coming off their win by a point over the Tennessee Titans in London I told you beforehand the chargers are my pick to make the super bowl out of the AFC before the season started the chargers probably [noise]\nHave a very good chance to win their next four games it'd be sitting at nine and two I told you that when they were sitting at three and two that I thought they can win their next six well they went out\nDominated the browns now they have one another game against the titans got to buy we they have to feel pretty good Melvin Gordon you figure is going to come back the chargers at number five overall in my list of the top five in the NFL in the force spot\nI've got the New England patriots again I Would call it a workman like when not a lot of excitement or ... over there um in terms of their performance over the pay over the bills but they're now what fixing too and I think all of the issues that you might have\nBeen concerned about when the patriots came out and lost to the Detroit Lions the fall the one and two and look so bad and be honest with you\nI didn't think they when they're next five the schedule gets appreciably easier now for the New England patriots and uh I think they have by week now and then I Believe they returned if I'm not mistaken I Need to look at their schedule danger you will get their schedule to confirm this I Know they play the titans in Nashville here\nOn November the eleventh and I think they're coming out of a by we just probably going to be ugly provide Tennessee Titans I think they come out of ... you don't want to play Bill Belichick anytime but she's definitely don't want to play Bill Belichick coming out of a Bible yet\nPackers patriots November fourth ... patriots that titans November eleventh All right\nSo they don't have a by week then I feel better about that\nSo they have to play against the Packer so they got a tough game that's right that's the game if they were advertising with Michael Jordan that's a hell of a game on Sunday Night Football uh with the Packers going on the road or get the patriots or in the three spot I've got the New Orleans saints the saints in the three spot I thought a really good when\nFor the saints over the uh over the Vikings this past weekend now\nWe've got an ethics game with uh the rams going on the road against the saints but first in my to spot\nI've got the Kansas City chiefs and the best team in the NFL like I just said they go on the road against the saints the battle for NFC superiority [noise] he took me instead of scoring 'cause he's such a smart football player\nTodd girly and the used to be St Louis now sorry St Louis now LA ram so my top five in order rams chiefs say patriots chargers\nI felt pretty good about that top five any disagreements the energy\nI feel like a broken record because every week I say where are the Panthers that they're one of my picks up the start of the season McCaffrey having a great season and of course Cam Newton you love 'em on lock it in when you're on TV but for some reason on the radio you ignore them\nWell I I'm not convinced that the Panthers or top five team yet [noise]\nWe'll see they have the time to earn their way and you could argue they would be and maybe in the five spot\nI think the top four set I mean I think if you're paying any attention at all to the NFL even if you're a casual fan\nYou're aware rams chief saints and

I tried to be as honest as I tried to put it out there because because you know they're always stations\nYeah it always boomerang back around any way if you don't say something people come out well you know I Know you do okay here it is a like a personal level spin a little bit of time with them I'm not gonna sit here and tell people something is false it's not like we talk every day we do a bunch of things but we have communicated okay so that's expressed yeah\nBut I knew after what had happened and I knew immediately when I saw fitzpatrick lead the comeback to get them to to uh tie did you see how the office of lime and jumped off its Patrick\n... when they tie game I knew right yeah and they're they're\nOkay right then and there I said okay they can't start Jamison the next ball game\nBecause the old adage comes into play play the team picks the quarterback and they picked fitzpatrick right there because of what had happened plus ... and ... it throughout his career whenever there's been an error right whenever he has been in in in deep trouble\nWhat what is the common denominator of his press conferences\nI Know I've got to do better I Know I made a mistake I Know I Can't turn the ball over I Know I get right how many times have you seen it\nAnd I think that this was kind of one of those were everyone's hands when I'm there like I Can't I Can't do that I watched his press conference and it was the same thing and I'm not saying that as a criticism\nIt's just that you can't say the same thing over and over and not change the change the outcome before people eventually say hold up as we got to do something else so that's where they are and here's the bottom line if I'm not mistaken and help me with this\nHe and markets Mario to write the number one and to pick that draft\nThat fits your options still looms for both of them correct\nI Believe that both teams have pick them up if they're all like ... ... yeah the only guaranteed\nThe fifth year yeah after that who knows and don't forget with Tampa depending on how the season\nComes out will they still have the same coaching staff in place will they still have the same administrative should in place that has to be determined Tennessee will because it'll be my variable second year in terms of coaching staff and I don't see John Robertson and crew going anywhere\nBut they will have a tough decision to make you know the organization with Amy Adams strong what are we going to do with our quarterbacks because as of right now\nThe two of them have not lived up to number one number two status overall they've shown flashes but they haven't been consistently which you would expect out of one and two and James might not be the number one quarter back when the season is\nThat's a big decision to be made I Know there there's no other big decision to be made is now with the Cleveland Browns fires you Jack then\nYeah you may go run at Lincoln Riley if you were Jimmy has on and you were trying to figure out who is going to be the coach in theory to mold your number one overall drafted picking Baker Mayfield or are there other guys out there that you think man this guy could make a lot of sense\n[noise] I think that on the surface it makes a ton of sense because of who Baker played for and and and worked\nUnder Riley but if I follow that line of reasoning strictly for that that case I got a call cliff kings Barry even though they didn't get along with him at the end you know I got lost the guys who who who helped him become what he is\nThe Lincoln Riley is doing a terrific job at Oklahoma and I think he's already expressed that he has no interest in this time of scratching that each of the NFL I don't know that the NFL\nWhere Lincoln rally needs to be at this stage of his career down the ...\nMaybe I think college is perfect for him and some guys are college guys some guys are NFL guys some guys are both it's there'll be determined with Lincoln but that was not my first thought but I just knew everyone was going to hop on it because it's very easy deal to great piece\nAnd I understand why but I Would not have been in favor of it but I Would think that whoever the next head coaches at the formula clay and it's very simple you better take care of Mayfield\nAnd what's around him because that's where your franchises going\nSo what's the formula Sean McVeigh did that in in Los Angeles with golf in that office and they kept working on the other stuff you have a juggernaut now\nHow Chicago sitting right there leading the NFC North they get they went out hard Madden Aggie brought him mark help bridge that we've got to get mental trip is going and build around him\nAnd of course that includes Mac has not hurt obviously but again what was your first priority taking care of that young cue for that's what they have to do your drafted Mayfield one\nYou've got to take care of the young quarterback who are the coaches that you can bring in that can adapt to this kid have this kid adapt to the NFL the best way they know how continue to build around and go so there's your formula\nGo ahead and make you lift clay ever probably make their lives who who are those people that are going to come in and do that because we've got two great examples for you that we're going to need a third one yeah for may feel\nWe're talking to Charles Davis argue us at the F the twenty two are you a horror movie than on the ... of Halloween\nNot a super horror movie fan I Will tell you that friday the thirteenth the original came out of course on friday the thirteenth I remember being in the theater Newport's New York and his memory serves I was one of about ten people still in my seat when the thing in\nThe [laughter] the only reason I was in my seat clay was because my legs just couldn't work it wasn't because I could handle it everyone else's\nRunning out of there my legs just couldn't physically get up and move and so I looked like I was courageous and I went with it I was terrified though that that's all I I was in high school at the uh [noise]\nYeah we uh I I've obviously got the three boys so are we are in the in the final stages of preparation for Halloween which becomes a a a major event here uh Charles appreciate the time who you've got this weekend\nI've got a the Atlanta Falcons at Washington and that ought to be a heck of a deal and as I said before\nIf it land is often says perking and turn this into a shootout game that to be an interesting look for Washington because that's not really how they wanted to play but Washington snuff film early and just go ahead and just you know just pretty much puts back overhead and take their out of the whole thing\nThat they're on their way again and right now that their formula but again they really want to find a way to throw the ball and get it down field they just haven't figured it out yeah\nThat is an intriguing game because if the foul kids could get back I think there are three and four rights or radical you get back to for for a year that wild card race again despite the fact that they started one in four right so that would be a heck of a response to win three in a row\nGo smiles on has made a ton of money\nBut I think when you look at the overall results\nWhat we've seen is great quarterbacks don't grow on trees\nSo is it possible that Lincoln Riley had a great quarterback and Baker Mayfield\nAnd had a great quarterback in Tyler Murray and there's not going to be that next the guy\nWho is on their level if that is true and if he knows it then it could make some sense to consider the browns if he really believes that Baker Mayfield as being as good as Baker Mayfield was with him and that was as good of a college quarterback as there has ever bit\nStatistically Baker Mayfield posted one of the greatest seasons in the history of college football at the quarterback position a Zak Taylor John ... foot boat a Bly and Brian floor is I'm going to be honest with you guys\nI Would not know Zak Taylor John ... and the ... and Brian floor as if they were all sitting right now in the studio with me\nDoes anybody out there and do the three guys would you do Zak Taylor John ... ... ... they only do I know he's an assistant coach in the NFL yeah\nBrian floor as I'm guessing all three of those guys are assistant coaches in the NFL\nYou know when we know Jack Taylor here in Los Angeles because she's the quarterbacks coach for the rams\nYeah which means he is said he is ... and boy I'm always a little bit nervous getting the guy who works for the genius alright so uh so Zak Taylor a and and the ... somebody look these guys up and floor as I'm guessing they're all assistant coaches in the NFL\nDan Campbell I Know 'cause he over as the Miami Dolphins coach Dave tube no idea who do have to\nBe fully ... offensive coordinator for the Vikings I Know John\nJohn ... yes John yeah All right so I didn't I mean I I Would not know that guy if he were sitting in the studio with me right now they have to I mean that can be a made up name as far as I could sort of no idea that guy is by no Sean McVeigh there's no way that I don't even know why showing me based on this list\nI feel like I think to be as an assistant coach for the cheap I'll look down to\nA gym a horrible I Know the ... bill bell jak know that guy Gregg Williams I Know I Know Gregg Williams also urban Meyer on this list\nBut this is a list I mean there are a lot of guys that I'm not very familiar with on this list so uh that is the list of potential uh coaches for the Cleveland Browns to to hire\nAnd uh hey look you hire an assistant coach in the NFL there are a lot of guys I feel like in the NFL in particular who get had coaching jobs that you're not really aware up to the NFL had coaching is a lot different than college football had coaching college football there is no restraint\nThere is no non compete ... next year if you wanted to\nTape and could go coach Auburn all these NFL coaches have contracts that are actually held too so they're not allowed to leave and go coach another program just because they decide to do it in the NFL so\nAs you work through the availability they're oftentimes guys you get it F. L. gigs that you're never really that familiar with and you have no idea how successful they are going to be so\nAnyway that is the list of potential replacements I think it's going to be ugly right now for bigger Mayfield the rest of the way you fired off into coordinator you fire the or the head coach I think the new off into coordinator is Freddie Kitchens\nWho is a former Alabama football player that has never worked as an off into coordinator before in the NFL that doesn't bode well\nLook I it's just a difficult job just suddenly say hey you're in\nAre just calling plays and oh by the way or the guys are going up against have been doing it for years I feel like bigger Mayfield it ain't going to be a pretty picture for the browns\nFor the next day games not like it's been a pretty picture for the browns for the last forty either with your Jackson when they went three thirty six in ... but it's still going to be ugly object NFL trade deadline is today who might be moving we're going to break it down for you next on al ... thanks for hanging with is\nHow kick their coverage with clay private [laughter]\nOkay this is a thirty second commercial I'm going to throw a lot of

I mean as soon as you on the bench and then you have many Machado who doesn't run hard\nThat's just because they that's not his style [noise] hey hit one eighty two in the world series but you know I think there's a bigger issue here with many Machado phenomena lock him up for three hundred million dollars [noise] I think I might move on\nTo Dan Patrick show oh man it's a fun we have not I am eastern six specific ...\n\nFox Sports trending\nOh yeah that was awesome he could barely bend is nice [laughter] the ... if you remember avoid\nA robocall yeah ... that's what Tom Brady look like is he was scrambling for that first down\nTo John Adams slash the graphic of how he almost had one and yards for his career\nYeah that's a great like nine nine and seven or what I read that yeah that was a great moment of last night's Monday Night football game when Tom Brady scrambled for that first down and I mean literally\nHe looked like robocop he looked like a guy who had written like on the Pony Express he could barely like\nHe looked like he was riding sad I mean the guy can't run the guy can barely run a but he still could was able to scramble for a yard and I love how excited he was when he got up after that a yard scramble probably felt like he'd run eighty a Tom Brady I don't remember the last time I saw that\nSo I I liked that movie I liked that moved to Mary's Thomas by the way there's lots of talk that Josh Gordon was going to be suspended\nAnd then he wasn't suspended at all so who knows what stories are actually coming out of New England right now right I liked that trade ah what about your job if you could make any move right now in the NFL trade deadline is four o'clock eastern today what movie would you make an for who\nI just want to be learned from drilling a contender and I think a perfect landing spot for him if he were to get training would be the Carolina Panthers receiving corps not really that strong and that would give him a guy who was thrown to the slug guys like growing old and a weapon for Carolina\nAnd really reliable guide good great locker room guy is not a bad deal either\nSo the Panthers who right now have to be sitting around saying hey you know what Cam Newton you do this job I I've been making this argument I'm not sure there is a quarterback in the NFL who is a better front runner than Cam Newton and what I mean by that is when things start rolling in a good way\nFor a for Cam Newton it's like he just turns into a completely different player now the converse is also true when things go bad and the best example of this is both Cam Newton winning the uh\nThe the going fourteen to know with Auburn and when he met championship if you watch that team with ... on his officer coordinator\nThey were very mediocre early in the season\nAnd then as the season progressed and they got more confident Cam Newton grew into what he became the Heisman Trophy winner\nAnd the number one overall draft pick in the NFL but at the first week of that season when you were watching camp even the first month even the first six weeks there was not a lot of reason to believe that that was going to be an incredible off ants or an incredible quarterback with Cam Newton so and then his MVP season\nWhere he went all the way to to the super bowl I feel like in the wake of that Super Bowl last the last couple of years have been almost ... um you know limitations over the way that season ended but that NFL season where he was the MVP this is the second best of all of Cam Newton seasons\nThis is the second best season that I have seen him for forming and would you agree with that the that this like in general cameras that guy who can get on the tide of emotion and ride it to great success or if things are going bad he can get on the tide of depression and right it's a great failure\nYeah I totally agree and then the Iraq or they went to the super bowl it was kinda the opposite side of that going we're going well and things really didn't go well so that\nI Would say the last couple of years ever since they didn't play very well and the super bowl it's just been kind of in the in the doldrums for Cam Newton now he's got better offensive weapons and everything else and this is an exciting uh Carolina Panthers thing to watch but I liked that move I think it's a good one is Ralph urban how betrayed forces you've been paying attention\nYeah I think the term the possibility of Tyrone Taylor getting dumped in Jacksonville makes a lot of sense he hasn't requested a trade but now they got rid of all the guys that he wanted to play for why not try to deal in Cleveland doesn't care at this point and they get something before they get nothing for\nYeah you know it's an interesting question I heard a lot of people talk about whether Jacksonville will make a move and certainly we have talked about it on this show as well here's my issue with Jacksonville making a move off of ...\nI think everybody they could make a move for is a little bit worse or just almost the exact same as what Blake portals was if you watched that playoff game\nOne of the worst quarterback playoff games I've ever seen the bills got breast their souls finally made the playoffs and they went to Jacksonville and they played Tyra Taylor against ... and it was one of the worst football games I've ever watched especially when you consider that took place in the playoffs and as I watched it I thought\nBoy ... anti ride Taylor are mirror images of each other now here's where you could say Thai ride tailored to to follow Ralph ... threat here's where you could say ... Taylor makes more sense the worst thing about Blake bottles as a quarterback is what his accuracy\nYou don't know what you're going to get from one throw to the next from Blake ... oftentimes Mrs wide open receivers he's not consistently accurate\nTie ride Taylor is pretty accurate\nSo you could at least feel better about the accuracy he's as good of a scramble or it's sad when you have to say this the best thing that boy ... I Would say almost bears that brings to bear right now is the fact that he's a really good runner\nAnd he had a lot of success if you remember that playoff game he basically won the playoff game against the bills by being a decent running quarterback he's an athlete who plays quarterback um and so uh I think that ah that maybe maybe there's this until a better of ... Taylor it's also possible that you just\nNeed a change but there are some times you fire a coach not because you think that there's somebody who is a lot better than that coach that's available\nI think this is what the browns did I think they finally just said you know what this is not working even if this guy is not better at least these that change we've lost the locker room I think there's an element when you're getting four guys arrested or detained or what ever happened in London overnight\nClub bottles of a of of alcohol\nThere uh and uh when you've got fights going on in the locker room when the defense of speaking out of turn but can't stop anybody there is an argument to be made that change\nEven if it's not necessarily change for the better is appropriate there's people out there who are like gurus who advised CEOs all the time and people have to make high end decisions\nAnd one of their uh one of their cardinal rules is don't be afraid of making a change\nAnd the answers why would you not be afraid of making a change if you know that something is not working then maintaining the status quo is only going to guarantee that something is not working if you make it change things might get worse but you can tell if they're worse and change again\nAnd things might get better if you make that change in other words the worst risk of being someone who has to make high pressure decisions according to a lot of what you read is not making a change its failure to adjust\nBecause if you make it change it I think there are a lot of NFL teams trying to make this decision right now you can make the wrong decision\nBut at least then you're aware and able to adjust for making the wrong decision\nSo I Do think that's an intriguing way to think about decision making so many people are paralyzed by the fear of failure that they don't do anything and it goes across the board right it's like if you're taking a test or back in the day you're sitting there taking one of those ... test\nAnd you don't know the answer to a question\nAnd it's not one of those questions that you could store and you could be like oh man I should know that that's the worst feeling when you take a test right\nThe worst feeling is not knowing that you have no clue what the answer is it's where you're like in the back of your head like man I remember reading this I should know the answer and you start and you're like All right I'm going to come back to this 'cause I Can't spend too much time\nIf you've ever taken test that matter of time test the L SAT SAT ACT\nGRE em cats the worst thing you can do is spend too much time trying to make a decision and then not even making a decision right you got for options their fill in the blank for a B. C. or D. and move on if you don't have a good sense for what the answer to a question is a\nLotta people freeze they pause they aren't willing to actually make a move because they're so paralyzed by the fear of failure\nI think there's going to be a lot of NFL teams today that when they get right down to it that feeling in the pit of the stomach so many people coach NFL teams and so many people gene\nIm NFL teams fearing that they're going to mess up fearing that they are going to fail\nA little bit of advice for you out there don't fear of failure because if you screw up guess what you get to do try and fix it\nThe lesson of life so\nBuffalo in Cleveland fired head coach Hugh Jackson conference report neater ton elite Jackson three thirty six and one during his time with the brown\n... Williams gets the interim head coaching spot now let's go back to the guy go object studios and talks a matter of film with clay Travis\nWhy from the guy go out kick studios where it's easy to say Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance would guy go get a guy go dot com or call eight hundred nine four seven auto you only hard part figuring out which way is easier we got march layer it they'll end up now you use that march layer us on Twitter\nAnd I'm gonna start mark 'cause I Know you know uh the Broncos about as well as anybody in the entire country or the Broncos going to do anything with them areas Thomas or Sanders or any of their play makers before the trade deadline and your mind\nYeah I think they'd like to get rid of a dumb areas Thomas in a Courtland ... has been so good they shot him but although or a that kid is one of the best route runners they have a really excited about him\nUm this kid Jim Patrick has come on throughout the pre season he was great ... see that um some wrong last week as well so you have to dump them areas I mean you know one of those things yeah we're all football players every guys and\nYou know on other guys like I Can't be good as long as the woman I Can't be good unless we're good quarterback happy good unless we're good receivers of the most dependent position you know football me the other ten guys have to be doing their job for them to even snip of football\nAnd to make these guys the highest paid guys on your team for some reason in my mind that doesn't make a whole lot of sense I mean the fact that every rule is bent towards throwing the football\nBut they're so dependent and dumb areas each you know ...\nOr he's one of the greatest Broncos ever played but on this roster right now he's been you served by these young kids\nWhen they start to ... love to dump that salary they'd love to get rid of him I'm\nJust from my salary dumped staff when they only got a fifth round or in return back to them I think would be worth this one so I'm Still looking for that to happen I think the Marius feels like that's going to happen um what happened by the deadline when ... got in and I'm not sure but it it certainly feels about what\nDoes he have a lot of juice left in the tank and your mind if the right team in the right quarterback was throwing to him or is he passed his prime\nAnd why they like anything I mean as you as you age your best friend but he can still play 'em and I think it would be you know I think a fresh\nStart would probably be a good thing for him I mean think about this I'm In Houston you lost or join ACL if you go to Houston where to marry as Thomas\nI'm is you know a number two guy behind the Andre Hopkins and you don't have to be that juice guy you don't have to provide the big play you know you can just be that you could be the guy that secondary guy is going against the second best corners of the first Bush corner I mean I think that will provide a spark your career\nAnd really help you along the way\nAnd that might be an exciting that that would make a lot of sense to me and that kind of thing he needs he needs to go somewhere that like Dallas we're all sitting there going Oh thank goodness you know although they traded for mark Cooper but you know a situation where they're looking for a number one where she ... I don't think that is that I think the number two guy find\nSomebody who's really good would be great for the merits\nOr talking to mark ... you had San Francisco Arizona this past weekend so condolences first of all secondly thank you how good did Josh Rosen look in your mind getting that went\nWell he look good I mean I'm thirty three quarters you really didn't do a whole lot me miss a lot of wide open target she just missed\nA lot of throws but under duress the whole time you know I was really impressed with Byron love which\nWe've got to call his village game who you know Mike McGuire was fired he goes through the quarterbacks coach the office or Nader did really good job in the screen game really good job getting David Johnson involved in the running game um you know with a little bit more of a outside president to a few different play closest skiing runs but most importantly\nThe David Johnson is really to me that it inside runner guy you know he's ... hey let's pounded in between twenty five times\nOr the way that McCoy used him he's more of a pass receiver he's more of a wide receiver and so that to me you know that subtle change and you can't change and all that in ten days you know people about what's going to be new you're going to completely change the gang\nUp Byron did a really good job or his first time calling a game especially as the game more on the fourth quarter to get his quarterback involved\nAnd then of course get a Josh ratings gotta arm uh he's got a big arm he makes pretty good students for the most part\nAnd I'm ... and yet I think they've got themselves the guy that that everybody's really excited about in my organization\nBut he missed I mean he missed the graves that were really rushed that were really all soccer throws\n'em and that's more I think that's more of a a timing issue and more of a I don't trust the guys in the enemy as you so I got to speed up my mechanic from prose because I Know I'm On to the rest of the whole time and that was really apparent early in the first book in a workshop and general\nDid we learn and they were talking to ... him on Twitter at ... we learned anything at all that we didn't already know from last night's patriots bills game\nWell no but I think it and it gets more stating you know a quarter of ... ... that's how I say his name at that one day that for me a ... ...\n... or adult quarter el Patterson ya ya okay quarter up so I'm\nGoing to Ireland actually yeah when I played for the University of Tennessee I've been saying that they might wherever but so right yeah that really made much of a difference oh all\nRight so that's just that's just call them eighty four eighty four is going to be the league for quite some time and he's been relegated to a special teams return got\nUm he just never was really fit and I mean he's a wide receiver you is your number three guys with the top coverage got you throw him a couple of ... a year and if he catches one ... the I the I you're like oh great that was awesome you know he's really he's really you know fill that role or so to speak right\nAnd then you get to get the New England\nAnd leave them with Russia chain carry last night yeah clientele that you don't\nAnd he's contributing ... teams\nClientele that you know I don't even know I'm like I don't even know where he was I don't even know if he was targeted I don't think he had a target in the receiving game last night so it just is again it's one of those situations where they are\nBy far the best coach team and it's not about and it never has been there and this would set them apart and you think it was easy but it just isn't easy for coaches it's about what you can't do so many and this is a great life lessons so many people focused on the things that they can't do or that you know people will read you can't do\nIn New England just goes I I don't want to hear what you can't do what can you do\nAnd whatever it is you can do let's see if we can find a role for you to help us productive in that\nNot going to ask you I'm going to put you in a situation and say and this guy you know do whatever it is as y or Z but let's put it in multiple times in a situation of the game where he has to reform X Y or Z and then they're pissed off that you can't do it that you know\nIn New England goes he can't do X Y or Z but he can do a B C and let's just keep those\nPositions so here's a guy that all of a sudden it's become a valuable asset you're doing but I I ...\nIt always fascinates me and you would think there would be easy and it just isn't most coaches you can't get over what the what a guy you know they show focused on what he isn't that they can't appreciate what is\nThat is really well said and not just in coaching in life as well a last question for you who would you hire if you were the Cleveland Browns let's assume you can go out and now obviously let's take the ridiculous suggestions off the table like I don't think Bill Belichick\nIs going to leave the area around but who would you hire that you think you could get to be the next go to the Cleveland Browns\nYeah you know I mean I've never really been go get a college guy Lincoln rally in Oklahoma seems to be you know that the everybody wants um\nYou gotta find obviously it it makes sense because you know ... Baker may feel um Baker would go on that at all but I think that would make a lot of friends I don't know why\nYou order your college go to the premier program you know you're going to make you think about it you make five\nYou know five to ten million dollars a year and the next what Fifteen Years Twenty years or you do want to stay there will all I'm like why would you ever go to the ... and get into that meat grinder when you're at one of the ... of the nation\nI I have no idea but that obviously\nIf you get that um and you could mix in that off because think about this ... matinee is doing kind of mixed in into pro style with a with the collegiate style of all that's what he's doing for his young quarterback look at what Andy Reid is doing\nWith that Kansas City and his young quarterback\n... Peterson has been with the ... it got to college grads style in Philadelphia for his young quarterbacks I mean this certainly seems to be the trend especially since most all kinds of why can't block\nAny more so I you know that would make the most that's the main glass that's probably the right than they would at least pursue initially\nCan you imagine being a parent and you go on vacation and you're stupid idiot kid birds down your house and tried to kill spiders or\nI mean I and also how far was the vacation where they like a long way away is can you imagine getting that phone call from your idiots son who's like hey\nPositive killed some spiders and you're out negative I've burned down the second floor to do it\nIn by the way this has happened before Arizona Tucson fire department responded to a similar incident back in twenty Seventeen they say men had been attempting to use a propane torch\nTo kill some spiders and his family's mobile home when that structure\nCaught on ... by the way to be one of the dumbest thing that you could possibly decide to do right like I don't know about you what's the number one way that I kill a spider ... yes you are right\nThat jump between shoe to it ... seems to me to be pretty substantial job like you don't even go with like a roll the newspaper or a magazine\nYou go from issue to blow torch I'm just saying that seems a little excessive to me in the in the spider destruction realm unless there is like and it's like a wrecking a phobia and the you know entire floor is moving with ah with spiders or they could probably use issue\n[noise] All right into our one of our favorite countries for the ... India on a ledge smuggler was found with three venomous cobra is hidden under the seat of his motor scooter last week\nOf video recorded by wildlife officials in bend to poor show that authority stop this guy and they searched his scooter\nDemand of all although they say okay this sooner that one makes you decide to search a scooter I wouldn't think there was very much on it sooner eight explains\nIt here they are suspected him of poaching because of his trips from a forest area back and forth\nSo they had their eye on him so that's why they stopped him the footage shows the snakes were alive and obviously showed aggression toward the police a cobra are protected species in India because they're prized by poachers for their skin and there have been um [noise]\nI just I I I don't know why would it kill these and then tried to smuggle why is this guy smuggling lived cobra is\nMy guest is probably the venom is valuable okay and that once you die it's hard to get the venom would be my guess but I I I just I Can't think of anything that would scare me more\nLike I get and I'm a snake is I Would be in favor of wiping out all snakes from the planet I think we'd be a better place like everybody's always afraid of like endangered species everything else you know we could never kill off snakes\nI've never heard of a snake that just cease to exist have you plug it seems like they always find a way to survive I have an hour there are any snakes on the endangered species list\nThat's a good question and we'll look that up I don't think we've ever eradicated a snake species like why are we kill off all the things that are kind of cute like koala bears and like a locomotive dragons but snakes we can never kill off it seems to me that we're not endangering the right species\nBy the way there is video of these three cobra is under his seat of his scooter so Google that it's pretty crazy tough way to make a living yeah and they pop up and they like you know who they launch forward to the person who's shooting the video\n... it just how much would that scare you to open up that scooter seat have those ... jump at you like\nThat I mean I that died the whole way that the cobra works the fact that it right raises itself up and the fact\nThey get spread its head and everything else the cobra there's a strong argument for of all the animals that like like just think about an animal that you could see that you're not expecting to see\nMaybe a shark in the ocean like a great white in the ocean\nOn land I'm not sure there's a scarier animal to suddenly be confronted by than a cobra standing up spreading its head like looking right at you I mean there's people all over the country right now with chill bumps I just got to thinking about that\nHalloween tomorrow the

sure that you do it or to download the podcast and uh hopefully by Halloween will have a lot of fun by the way tomorrow show that the show hasn't been fun in fact it has an hour one Charles Davis our to march ... make sure you go back and listen to those were about ... tomorrow's Halloween\nAnd obviously a lot of parents out there a lot of kids who are dressing up for Halloween will be listening to the show we will have a Halloween spook tack your show for you tomorrow or so that will be a lot of fun to make sure you don't miss it the final show of the month of October\nUh tomorrow Halloween edition and then Thursday show which will be November first\nI was almost ... billion per cent guarantee you I Will be hung over\nAnd may there'll be drunk may still be drunk on Thursday and I thought you were going to use a vacation day I was thinking about taking a vacation day that I tell you that I was going to take a vacation day on Thursday you set it on the air a couple of days ago yeah you know what I Would say that I was going to take a vacation day and you know\nI was I was in London and now they got on the phone with me and they want me to come out to LA and do some more of the TV stuff\nSo I don't I don't think I'm going to take a vacation day and said I'm going to do the show drunk so if you are a a if you are now ... fan I think I Will still be drunk on Thursday morning in our neighborhood everybody that parents take the kids all walking around and go trick or treating\nAnd a lot of the houses have drink a drinks for the for the parents like for instance in my neighborhood we are and they put the list out of all the houses that have alcohol\nSo ah they call them side or houses so they actually are labeled in our neighborhood which houses you can go up to if you're a parent and get alcohol at those houses we will have a massive fireball machine\nCause fireball sent me a big ... remember when I when Jack Daniels got mad at me\nUh and they cancelled that were were you doing the show yet then yeah\nYeah so Jack Daniels got mad at me um and so they cancelled and appearance and wouldn't allow me to come back they were going to pay me to come to like one of their events and then they got mad at me because of a tweet I sent\nAnd they're like oh we can't allow you to show up at our at our Jack Daniels and I'm like are you crazy\nYou know that everybody who listens to the show drinks whiskey like it's a water you guys are idiots and so fireball was like hey we love you and they sent me a huge fireball shot machine I mean I have this ... fireball shock machine that will hold like fireball and give out shot so last year\nA on Halloween we went through just gallons I'm not even getting about this gallons a fireball for all the parents that were showing up at our house to take fireball shots\nAnd so we're doing that again and I guarantee you that I Will be drunk tomorrow night on Halloween\nAnd it's possible can't guarantee this but it's possible that I Will still be drunk when the show starts on Thursday the first in the morning a lot to be a lot of parents and a lot of teenagers\nOr maybe that teenagers shouldn't drink kids a lot of college kids that will still be drunk when they are listening to the show on Thursday morning too so I figure I should just fit in with everybody else not to mention\nThat when we start on the west coast it will be three am people will be coming home for Halloween parties and whatnot job and so on so that should be a fun show for the next couple of days\nWell I think it's only fair that us here in the LA studios get to drink some fireball that morning\nWell I don't doubt that at all the differences you guys have to drive to work I just have to sit down house no I mean we arrive here like maybe our management can have some fireball ready for us yeah I think the odds of that are going to be alone [laughter] see I think the odds that they're going to be like hey\nHere's a bunch of liquor go drink while you're on the air I think that's going to be alone I think that would make for great radio though it ... yeah we've heard some shows even in LA do that\nOn AOL like five Seventy Petro says done that before has he drank on the air\nI always have said I'm the only time I've ever been told to drink on the air we did a show um a couple of years ago from a Vegas casino was the first show to ever be inside of a Vegas casino during March Madness\nAnd as we were like we put in our ear pieces and like we were getting ready like we were doing a dry run like we're going to talk about one of the producer said hey I've never said this before but you guys are in Vegas casino go ahead and drink some I think it'll make the show better [laughter]\nSo I I have a scotch Shapiro tells me hey just go ahead and drink some I think the show will be better it's hard to drink\nThis early in the car just start off\nDuring this early in the morning although I got to be honest when we go to calls we somehow always get drunk callers on the show it doesn't matter what time of the day it is so maybe there's already people who are tipping one back but tomorrow on Halloween edition Thursday probably I'm Still drunk version of the show because it'll be an early morning after Halloween so we'll see how that goes\nNow and I'm Lesley I'm Sorry to interrupt I was just going to ask about the show on Halloween 'cause the last two years in a row we did out kicked the candy and it made for some great debates on the radio\nYeah I think that we will so here's what I Want for people to prepare in advance for tomorrow's show to Halloween spectacular we're doing three hours of Halloween flavored falling right several different points of debate and discussion\nWhat is the best candy how rich do you have to be to give out full size\nCandy bar right like ball or status hall or status what how rich do you have should I be obligated to give out full sized candy now I'll be honest with you one of my friends in the neighborhood they give out full size candies and I was like when I saw their buckets I was like damn\nThey must be doing really well that's not a small size ... that's a full size you know what I mean they're they're just given away like it's nothing\nNothing full size cat that any one of those small ... cat that's a real kick cat like you go into a gas station\nAnd right but the window there all the candy is laid out that's the full sized candy I'm so we'll get into all sorts of questions the best Halloween movies like the scariest movies I haven't been out to see the new Halloween movie yet have you guys anybody on the show seen the new Jamie Lee Curtis ah the the fortieth anniversary of Halloween\nNo I don't think anybody on the staff has seen it yet not yet nobody\nNobody you see I Want to see it I I Love scary movie so we'll be talking about that a who is our guest do we have guests on Wednesday I Can't even remember um will have a couple of guessed I Would imagine I Can't even remember who our guests are on Wednesday anyway Halloween spook\nTack your version of out into Wednesdays and open day because that's when we normally do the mailbox mailbag posted I I'll do Halloween version of the anonymous mail back yeah yeah that actually\nCould go well it could be a disaster or it could do really well I Will answer every Halloween related question than anyone could have\nSpecial anonymous mailbag Halloween edition of the anonymous email back and deal with your costumes\nCan deal with a everything everything you can possibly imagine it's going to be fun tomorrow so make sure that you spend not just a segment make sure you download the podcast if you get all three hours also let me tell you right now ... is going to join us next but only tell you it's never a good book\nWhen you on TALK along bulky dress shirt you may think it makes you a casual but more than likely it just ends up looking sloppy that's why on tuck it makes church specifically designed to be worn on tucked casual shirt not too long not to shortage just right\nAnd I almost fell out of my chair laughing because you can fancy yourself to be an expert on like two things re gay and like Japan animation from the Nineteen eighties or something like that\nAnd when a your\nCo host their uh demarco Murray question to your knowledge of dreads then had to be like an all time worst moment for you in the broadcast booth [noise]\nYou know it would be but he was shocked to know that my name was actually Petro ... and not pay trials\nLike four games and he also\nLearned that I was the captain of a U.S the football team on air\nA phenomenal was absolutely shocked at that yes so him questioning me in any of my credentials is not new [laughter] that is an ... he's a wonderful person into what a great job either way but he did\nSay that they were they were dreads not parades and that the truth as they were braided trends\nSo here is that it was phenomenal here is the question that I have I've never called it a game like or like you do on a regular basis when the game is just an absolute\nI Can't even say like an absolute like just wipe out rate like you're sitting there and you're going to have time and you're like boy there is like this is just a total debacle like my dad all the\nTime yeah is that like is that ...\nInfinitely more challenging in your mind or is it does even matter\nOh well first of all it matters because when you're not calling a competitive game you don't do what the guy at home does which is disparaged the\nTeam that's being destroyed yes you have to remain professional and not say oh my God what an ... and over and over again and my daughter they even trying\nYou know all the stuff that the people a fire this coach yeah yeah but\nWe are professionals and we do this for a living and not just the broadcasters but everybody in the truck is ready for that kind of thing no matter what game it is and you use what is called blowout material have you ever heard that line\nI never I mean I Know that it happens but I've never heard somebody just expressly say yeah we have blowout material prepared\nWell you you know you start going through the standings you you roll and all the relevance stuff that you had that you know every time you do a football game on TV there's a ton of stuff that a whole bunch of people have spent the whole week\nPutting together you know it's a little bit different than a radio show where if you have your guys caught something or some kind of open or some kind of\nFunny thing like the animal thunder dome that kind of thing you know you're going to run it you're going to run it a thousand times so everybody hears it but when you do a football game these guys build all kinds of fancy\nStuff that a lot of the time no one ever gets too because the game as competitive so that's an opportunity to get all that stuff in and just kind of turn it into more of a radio show while being respectful to the guys that are playing was that two serious ...\nYou know no it's not what game do you have this weekend [noise]\nAh I have us see who is in some turmoil and I haven't done to us the game until the gate and since the game right after ... got fired on the tarmac that was at ... first game as you as the head coach way back in the first year of fs one I Know you remember that year\nOh yeah so that's the last us CJ my did this this week on Saturday Night in Corvallis we have us each a ... Oregon State who just had a miracle twenty eight point come back at Colorado\nSo how much trouble is clay health in in because that's going to be the overwhelming number one story of the rest of us sees this season he now taking overplay calling they fired the off into the wind chill that's set\nFuses me because I was always under the impression that he was calling plays it already was yeah but uh\nHe did fire the offensive line coach which is really significant and whenever somebody is forced to fire people within their staff it's a big deal whenever that happens bad season\nIt's an even bigger deal and we all know what direction that is a step in without saying but this guy it's even more significant because the guy that quite often fired has struggled\nFor years with this often of line so four games left in this season and this is done it's a it's an interesting thing to think about the timing but also this guy's clay on his dad's best friend so you know this guy goes deep with with the\nHelp families so for ... to do this it's a pretty desperate\nAre eight so USC is in turmoil um UCLA is rebuilding that the college football landscape the Dodgers what is the depression level right now in the city of Los Angeles over a second straight World Series all on and the way it happened with David Roberts pulling ... game for\nYou had the great Eighteen any game all of that what is the de ... set of Dodger fans as we move into the off season now\nVery high level of depression yeah you know to lose back to back World Series and not be as competitive and the second one people are upset and of course people appreciate you know being able to watch the the team and and be able to route\nAll the way through October and having that excitement that your teams in the world series but\nIt's been Thirty years since the Dodgers won a championship and they spend a lot of money and they are the biggest fan base the most visited team every year\nOn earth so the fact that it's been Thirty years I think there's a great deal of a mixed and restlessness but I also think there is the overwhelming fact that people appreciate how competitive they've been they didn't stiffed the world series for Thirty years and they've been in back to back years but\nThis is a big city and losing is not losing a championship is not something that people celebrate\nAlright the rams are eight no they were playing in that they were playing on that field or they couldn't even remove all the usa insignia I think for weather related reason\nThey win a close game against the Packers the chargers are coming back now from London they will reemerge and play and there are a game they're five and two I have both of them\nAs two of the top five teams in the NFL right now how to use the NFL or interest in both the chargers and the rams and I know the rams are a lot more\nCompared to all abroad mania in the city of Los Angeles right now\n[noise] [noise] oh I I don't think it compares much people are pretty darn excited about the oil abroad thing they lost again yeah I was five\nYeah that's a huge story too and it just goes to show I I'm not saying that this tells the whole story of their season I'm sure they'll go to the play offs but I don't think this is a move or a pivot by liberal on toward winning championships or even competing for them ever again\nVicious about his brand and clicks or whatever he is going to do in life\nIn Hollywood so wins and losses are not as relevant what the Lakers\nShe asked me in a couple of weeks or as as everybody has to readjust and people are going to talk about this us the situation and the negativity of it if it becomes more negative that's going to be the number one story\nAnd I think people are still figuring out how to relate to the pro football teams but they will figure\nIt out when they're both on the play offs\nAnd competing and it looks like we're headed in that direction you know the ram conversations going to be like who should they asked you know should they play all the way up until the player should they give ... Jared golf and keep them healthy you know all that little stuff is going to start emerging 'cause they're they're undefeated\nYou have two young children will you dress up personally for Halloween\nAnd during the trick or treat process\nYou know when's the last time you dressed up\nI was humiliated into wearing a some semblance of a couple's crossed her about Saturday Night at a neighborhood party what were you I just wore a rainbow headband to match wife who was a rainbow pony up some card [laughter]\nSo\nI uh I was macho man my wife was miss Elizabeth where I Would I hold school wrestling\nI there is nobody who inspires me more than a cocaine riddled Randy\nSavage [laughter] I Love the macho\nMan I Am not a modern wrestling fan I Know we just added them to Fox yeah I understand that people like it I guess but when I was a kid to watch the likes of cocoa be aware though yeah\nSpan the ultimate warrior Canadian earthquake of course the macho man we have Rick model bar child Jimi super fly ... these people were in an inspiration to me\nThere's no doubt at all or are you a scary movie fan at all\nNo what's the last what's the last movie you went to go see in the movie theater\nBat the lego Batman oh that was pretty good at my kids here yeah\nYeah no I went to the lego and when we were at lego land so they were playing like they just play I'm not kidding they play like Batman on blue but don't go away and hotel movie\nI went to see as the other day later that that would like just my wife and I yeah well I don't like", "show_name": "FOX Sports Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Newton", "day": "30"}
