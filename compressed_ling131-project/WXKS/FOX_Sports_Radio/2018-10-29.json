college kids\nTheir lifespan the Boston Red Sox are the most dominant major league baseball franchise of all time I think John ... said to us which was pretty funny\nThat he was talking to a buddy in that buddy said or who you rooting for and asked his kid who were you rooting for the red Sox Yankees series\nAnd he said the Yankees because they never win\nWhich is just so amazing to think about as the world of sports changing it an utterly different direction\nThe Boston Red Sox were the ultimate losing franchise in all of American pro sports and the last Fifteen Years they have turned into one of the greatest championship franchises of all time and even wild or if you go all the way back to two thousand now\nSo you just think about twenty first century baseball\nThe red Sox have got more titles I Believe I'm correct on this now since two thousand than the Yankees looked at up to make sure I think if you go back to the year two thousand so you just say okay let's all we talk about twenty first century baseball\nThe red Sox are the eight hundred pound gorilla and the Yankees are the franchise but is hoping to one day catch up to the standards of Boston Red Sox excellent so that is an unbelievable alteration\nIn the space time continuum of the world of sports it's it's just for somebody like me who's thirty nine\nIt's amazing to think about the Boston Red Sox as the most successful franchise in major league baseball now with its fourth title the red Sox are since two thousand and four and for a lot of you out there who are older than me\nYou grew up with this oh the red Sox will never win a championship this sort of a New England fatal ism oh we're always going to find a way to lose\nAnd man just another championship\nFor the city of Boston but another one significantly for the Boston Red Sox and we will discuss that obviously as the show continues when we come back I Will die deeply into the NFL and college football tell you all of my biggest takeaways\nFrom all over the weekend that was in the world of football we appreciate you starting off your week with us spending your Monday I Hope all you had fantastic weekends I Hope whatever

on car insurance would guy go\nGo to guy go dot com or call eight hundred nine four seven auto the only hard part figuring out which way is easier uh if you are cardinals fan the cardinals got their first and when and Josh Rosen looked pretty good\nI I watched a a decent amount embarrassingly of this game Josh Rosen late touchdown pass to Christian Kirk the former star tech CNN Maggie\nAnd the cardinals found a way to get past the forty niners Josh Rosen looked like I said very good I Would be optimistic if I wore a cardinal fan based on how he looked at this ad season of the forty niners continues\nEssentially the moment the Jimmy ... chores ACL or this season was over for forty niner fans\nReally it's just a question of what do they want to do in the draft or as you come into the second half of the season because you are going to have a really really high draft pick the colds and the raiders this is an interesting story line here if you look at what the culture doing\nAndrew Luck is quietly putting together a pretty good season and come back after missing an entire season last year\nAnd the Colts have come back from dead a little bit they scored Twenty one at a answered against the raiders this John Gurdon experiment so far for the raiders have has been an abject disaster\nBut the colds are a little bit of an intriguing team right now I don't know what's going to happen in the AFC South but the Colts have risen back up to three and five they ever got the jaguars coming into Indianapolis this weekend\nIn what affective Lee if you are a ... fan is now an opportunity for you to a I think a women ate the jags from serious competition you can drop the jags\nTill last place in the division\nIf you are the colds and you can get a winning that game\nThen you've got the titans coming to\nIndianapolis after you sorry you got to buy week by week but you're going to have the jags then come in to play the colds so the jak coming back from London we're going to get to their game here in a minute\nBut you do have a chance if you're the colds to get a get a big win there then you've got the titans coming to town then you've got the dolphins coming to town back to back to back\nIf they win all three of those games and I don't think that's a crazy idea to think about if you Ari Colts fan than the Colts could suddenly find themselves\nAt six and five and feel like they're squarely back in the middle of the AFC South playoff picture so the colds are having one now two straight games they beat the bills they go on the road and get a big win against the raiders\nThe colds now can think about getting back to even if you're a a a if you're a fan of Andrew Luck if you're a fan of the colds could be a really good run that they are poised to get on a getting back to three and five the big story I Would say for the Colts has been\nThere protecting Andrew Luck now this off into line is starting to gel and if you protect Andrew Luck\nIs a pretty damn good quarterback what has happened in the past is he has gotten a droid trying to throw the football they are now protecting him big time a performance by the colds to come back raider fans bay area football fans just turn to page start thinking about next season or the Panthers\nI Believe they can do and I said on lock it in the TV show that I Do that I Love Cam Newton this week at twenty eight to one to win the MVP\nAnd then came Newton went out and played an absolutely phenomenal game for the Panthers\nI mean he was extraordinary and what I said on the show I stand by by the way Cam Newton [noise] Twenty one at twenty nine two touchdowns he also had a rushing touchdown and fifty ours I said going back to his time at Auburn\nI have rarely seen a quarterback\nThat is more of a momentum player than Cam Newton when things start to go well for Cam Newton and I think the Graham ghetto sixty three yard field goal I think to come back\nFrom Seventeen down to score Twenty one points in the fourth quarter and now this beat down of the ravens which drop the ravens to foreign for at the halfway point\nI think this performance\nWas the kind of thing that I've come to expect from Cam Newton which is he gets on a roll and he keeps that role going\nIf you're a fan I don't know what you take away from this performance you stack the titans eleven times you can't do anything against Cam Newton to fall to foreign for the bears get a win over the jets still not sold on the bears still not sold on ... book\nTo what they have been bears fans have to be pretty excited the ongoing or you know difficulties of rolling with a a rookie quarterback continue same Darnell was just okay this was the best game of the early slate it was the bangles against the buccaneers\nThe bangles go out and it looks like they are going to completely blow out the Tampa Bay buccaneers were going to talk about this and on pack this game a little bit more as the show continues\nBut I Believe Jamieson Wednesday and who drew for interceptions has now thrown ten interceptions on the year to lead the NFL is dog\nI think that he is finished in Tampa Bay I think there's no way the bucks can give him twenty million plus a year I think if you combine that with his behavior off the field\nI didn't get Tampa Bay buccaneers are probably going to move on from Jamison ... now maybe\nMaybe maybe they are crazy and they decided to give him twenty million dollars per year five but based on what we have seen so far I don't think there's any way the Tampa Bay buccaneers can stick with Seamus Winston particularly because\nFits magic is back fitzpatrick came in and he was extraordinary he rallied the uh the buccaneers all the way back\nOr the easy way to break this down is he was eleven for Fifteen for a hundred and Ninety four yards two touchdowns and the two point conversion he had a perfect QB are effectively when he came in and relief of Jamieson Winston Seamus twins then posted a forty seven cube ER\nRyan Fitzpatrick posted a hundred and fifty four QB are\nIt's a done deal maybe I'll take your calls on some of these but I Am convinced there the Seahawks\nMaybe give it up for dead too soon they went on the road and whip the Detroit Lions that game surprise me the Redskins ended\nIf there was any whimpering hope in the ... season they put it to a close the giants fall to one in seven the Steelers beat down the brown Baker Mayfield mania effectively over he was exposed in that game the chiefs get to seven in ...\nHang on against the Broncos and\nThe eagles in the early game we got to unpack what happened with the ... as well the eagles gets afford for the jags fall to three and five\nAnd they get for employers detained slash arrested for a late night issue with paying for bottle service\nIn a London Club unbelievable story there we will continue to unpack all of these stories as well as dive into the weekend that was in college football that is the weekend that was in the NFL when it come back and talk to you about fits magic versus Seamus am I wrong or am I right\nThat in my mind you have to let go of Jay miss Winston\nInterceptions are not all on the quarterback I went back and watched all four of the James Winston interceptions I think they were all for on the quarterback\nI don't think somebody ran the wrong route and left them out to dry I don't think you got a tip ball that went up into the air and you know it just had a bad break and somebody else caught it\nThese were for bad throws\nAnd he's now had ten bad throws and I come back again and again to James ... and say well I'll get it fixed what part of that are you going to get fixed you've played in forty eight games is starting quarterback in the NFL James Joyce than\nYou would have turned up all over fifty times by interception and Twenty one times via ...\nThis is what Jay miss Winston is forty eight games Seventy one turnovers\nNobody else has even close to those numbers at the quarterback position\nAnd it's not as if you can say well yes he's a gunslinger he throws a lot of interception but the results have been positive he's throwing a lotta touchdown passes and leaving his teams the victory to know\nThe books have been awful with Seamus twins that quarterback that's not all his fault the reason partly that they were down so much against the bangles ... states\nIs not a good team that he's a part of from a defensive perspective but every time Brian Fitzpatrick comes in there is a really good offensive talent in the passing gang OJ Howard's a really good NFL tied in fitzpatrick kid him for the ... touched down\nTo Sean Jackson is a really good number two NFL wide receiver Mike Evans if he had a great quarterback is\nAs good of a wide receiver as there is in the NFL zeroed out by Kevin is one of the ten best wide receivers in the NFL especially when you consider the quarterback play that he's had to deal with\nThe guy just gets open\nAnd if he's not open you could throw in the open 'cause he's such a ridiculous happily as we've seen all the way back to when he was making plays with Johnny Manziel\nAt Texas a and M.\nI don't think that you can continue with James with it I think this is the first big decision\nThat team is going to have to make if you are dirt cutter are you willing to give Jay miss Winston the reigns to your team for the rest of the year in a really difficult NFC South river you got to play came in the Panthers\nYou got to play you already have played at least watch\nThe Atlanta Falcons in that often with Matt Ryan and you have to play Drew Brees again fits was amazing he went on the road and beat the saints that's how good the ceiling can be for the Tampa Bay buccaneers team if everything is cooking and you also come back\nFitzpatrick guide bench for one bad half in a game that the books were awful in against the Chicago Bears one bad half\nSeamus twins than through for interceptions in less than three quarters and finally got ... I don't know how you handle rained back to her I really don't\nCome back at the top of our two I'm gonna die back into the NFL but I'll also open up the ...\nOur to your opportunity to react to

continue to roll eight seven seven nine nine six six three six nine what a bringing the crew I haven't given you guys much time to talk\nUh Danny gee what stood out to you from the weekend that was in college football in the NFL your biggest takeaway\nWell the my gun the rent was gold and I I didn't get to watch many games on Saturday because I was so busy with the Dodgers but\nWhen I got home and I went to Twitter to see what was going on with college football it was Mike ... everybody responding and commenting on him because I like you said over the years what ten Fifteen Years now we've had such great rants from Gandhi yes that one is right up there at the top\nSo that was priceless as far as the NFL I watched the red zone all day yesterday how 'bout that hurdle\nFrom Kareem Hunt amazing and then he pulled his way into the end zone we saw that same hurdle a couple of weeks ago on a non touchdown run he did it again it was even a better hurdle and then in to the end zone it's crazy that you can say hunt is what maybe the fourth best player on the chief's\nI watched a lot I I watch the red zone as well we should also mention and I got a lot of this on social media evidently directv had a major outage for NFL Sunday ticket subscribers across the nation and I know just by looking at my Twitter feed that there were a lot of furious people out there and I got to say this\nThe NFL has got to end the NFL Sunday ticket exclusivity you with direct TV man I think this is the worst decision that the NFL makes well there are a lot of things you can go after the NFL for but to me allowing people to watch whatever one of your games they want to watch\nShould be your number one goal as a sports network\nAnd a as a sports provider in the twenty first century and restricted gets her direct TV and then having I mean I Can't tell you the number of people who were tweeting me about that and I know there's a ton of you listening out there across the country you had this issue arises well\nThere's few things more frustrating as a sports fan and you can say we're all spoiled and certainly we are but the idea that you could be paying to watch your favorite teams game\nAnd when you sit down in front of your television on Sunday you're paying hundreds of dollars a year for a direct TV Sunday ticket and you're paying thousands of dollars a year probably to direct TV for a full subscription and I'm a direct TV subscriber\nWe've got direct TV\nOr in my house or actually down in our uh Florida place a I've got Comcast here in Nashville and Comcast has been fine with me\nBut it is incredibly frustrating\nI Know that feeling to have bought a game and not be able to watch it directv should be ashamed I mean that was a complete failure on their part and I think it's a complete failure frankly on the NFL's part to continue to allow directv to have exclusivity I think the NFL leads to severely reexamine\nEvery decision that it makes in a way that a distributed television product in this new TV deal they ... they're bringing out but I've been making the argument and I'll get on my soapbox again with this every NFL game needs to be on television for people with cable and satellite subscriptions\nYou should be able to sit down at one o'clock eastern known central eleven am mountain and ten am on the west coast and pick whatever game you want to watch not just your local team\nThey need to put every NFL game on for every body fs one needs to have games ESPN needs to have games TNT TBS whatever is necessary in addition to CBS and Fox\nThey need to put every NFL game on TV Now\nThey can do it in a way where uh hey you can block it out if you're like I live in Nashville and usually tightened games are on CBS sometimes they're on Fox\nIf you need to block out on cable those games so you can only watch 'em on CBS or Fox I think that makes sense I think the overall viewership for it I felt product would go up if every single NFL game kicked off and you could watch it anywhere on cable or satellite at\nOne o'clock eastern ten o'clock Pacific\nI think fans want the ability to pick whatever game they want to see and be able to watch it or do what you just said you did did he gee you watch the red zone like I Do a lot and you flip around and will also maybe go back some times a year CBS and Fox games too with those games are close\nBut I tend to watch the red zone most often\nBut I Would watch the NFL every Sunday like I watch college football which is I watch a lot of college football right I sit down and watch games all day but I'll jump around based on what the score is aimed games as to what my primary viewer viewership option is\nAnd that's the way I Would watch the NFL\nI think the overall brand of the NFL would be an increase in value substantially if they yanked away red zone and sold those rights to everybody else led fs one lead ESPN let Turner CBS Sports network NBC Sports network if they want\nDavid let all of them get NFL games on cable and put every single game that kicks off on simultaneously\nAnd in this stupid regional sports coverage where you have to watch over your local team by the way eight seven seven nine Ninety six six three six now what about you or do anything that stood out to you from the NFL college football weekend that was\nBut you know set up to me ... I went to the zoo on on Saturday and a bad move yeah I'm going to lay out a little dad moved right which is where cargo short and no our shores but I didn't work harbor shores well but it was that my wife was like oh we're going to go feed the giraffe in\nThe ... the ... all I can think about was animal ... leading in that line [laughter] that's all I could think about and I almost\nWish we had perfect weather in Nashville and I was thinking you know what I should go to the zoo yesterday the titans didn't play\nAnd so uh I watched a lot of it I felt but I also it was like I Want to get outside it's over Seventy degrees go through a football with my kid a and we ran around 'em but said dad move on Saturday as the ultimate zoo move uh what about you do what you got for me\nI mean because magic is back in the ... they look like a totally different team when he's under center\nI I don't see it any way to me that's all that's one of the biggest takeaway of the NFL action is I don't see how anybody who watched substantial portions of that game against the bangles could make an argument that anybody other than Ryan Fitzpatrick should be quarterback for the rest of the year and you know what I haven't even seen\nA single person it used to be like the Jamieson Winston stands would come out whenever I pointed out all the disaster that is Davis Winston and has been his performance in the NFL so far\nAnd they would all you know like rally do the feds and they'd be like oh you know what he's incredible you can't you can't do this ... this is is that they just can't respond to write that first of all James wasted is tied for the lead and NFL interceptions with ten even though he's only started three game so far this year but he's also a turnover machine\nHe's played forty eight games it as an F. L. career so far and during that time he's thrown fifty interceptions and he's ... Twenty one times\nThat's forty eight games he's\nPlayed Seventy one turnovers nobody else is even remotely close to those numbers\nThat's unbelievable from Jamison Winston she would have thrown fifty interceptions and fumble Twenty one times forty eight games Seventy one turnovers and you just hit it up I mean the difference in that team you were like me right you saw the way the team was responding it was like they were like thank God bits\nPatrick his back and remember the pitching never made sense to me he played one bad\nIn which the whole box were awful\nOn the road against the bears and they pitched it and then he came in and the down Eighteen and let them back immediately from an Eighteen point deficit tied the game had a perfect passer rating I don't see any way shape is with that takes us that for the rest of the year and less Ryan Fitzpatrick his major\nNominee you I mean is there anything better than seeing it's Patrick is fired up as he gets I mean it's awesome\n[noise] then you saved twenty million dollars could you let James Winston go I don't think there's going to be a big market for James Winston I think a lot of teams may consider him to be a backup I think that's about it I could be wrong but I don't think anybody out there is going to give Jay miss Winston anywhere near ... twenty million dollars\nAnd so somebody will take a chance on him because he's still young and they'll say hey we can fix all these turnovers so I I think what you do as you saw in writing fitzpatrick for a limited amount and then you go into the draft and get somebody new\nAnd menu let that Ryan Fitzpatrick mentor that new quarterback and that's the way that I Would roll with on the box the titans I think I've seen enough to need to pick up to twenty million dollars on markets Mario to he won a playoff game last year he hasn't been healthy that's been the biggest issue for markets Mario to when he's been healthy\nHe's got like eleven and come from behind when they want a lot of football games because of Marcus Mario to with the titans what does this feeling I don't know what I think certainly you need to pick up his option and pay him twenty million dollars next year by by North Carolina what's up\n[laughter] going like um I just wanted to call inadequate him\nDo you think there's a more incompetent manager of the day Robert today [laughter]\n[noise] uh ... like the decision to pull ritual I said earlier when Donald Trump tweets about it\nAnd everybody in LA agrees with that Danny gee you were there is there a more incompetent manager of the day Roberts with that decision\nNo and the front office has a lot to do with this too\nSo the ones who the only ones I've heard defend Dave Roberts even slightly\nSay well he's just doing what the front office once and that's where I say well then the Dodgers need a manager that has bigger balls and can tell the front office to kick rocks and use your guts in situations where you can see it clearly with your eyes stop looking at computers to his ...\nAnd the stupid analytics yes we talked about it last week those come in handy for the long run in in a in a big chunk of a season but not in one game the most important game of the season\nClay this city is on fire against Abe Robert you were the booze before last night's game\nBefore yesterday's game and it's gonna it's gonna be a long offseason with the Dodgers what are they going to do with Dave Roberts\nFrazier in Roanoke, Virginia what you got for me\nI was going on [noise] I'm doing a heck of me\nOn today I feel a couple of things is that first of all you know ... you can hear him to the other quarterbacks in the league [noise] got a really good role model [laughter] you know secondly I Wonder if it's like a logical when it comes to Ryan is\nAt the same as when they're like wow that that's one of them struggling you bring the other one and then they excel and they just kick butt on the field I mean just\nKeep on the ... the other one trouble read other went in and they won more games\nThat dog got to say thanks for oh you do appreciate ...\nYeah the problem is James hasn't been any good and fits Patrick's been pretty consistently excellent this year I I mean that's the challenge me pitch Patrick garbage for one bad half\nAfter playing three really good games James when since been buried mediocre since he came back and he was flat out awful oh gee in Florida what you got for me\nTo do it I just want to know on a one on this day and became a printout quarterback that he could pick up and leave the team ... never\nDon't think he's a franchise quarterback I think he's not awful and if you have the choice between a nod awful guy or an awful\nI I'm going to take an awful guy\nWe are not in this entire season\nIn your career\nWhat what about leaving the entire career are you arguing James what's that should be the starter this James ...\nWoke up back to a biology stay auto Jay you make the case oh gee oh gee is going to make the case for why\nJames what's that needs twenty million dollars and should remain the starting quarterback for the Tampa Bay buccaneers when we come back we'll read with him at the top of our three somebody make the case for Jamieson whites that will do it I appreciate all of you first two hours into books our three up next this is out get coverage on

turnovers and forty eight games he an outright announced it and then leaving the NFL and interceptions\nHad more what'd you say\nI bet you that it had more no way Ryan fits that just based on what you've seen on the field so far this year\nRyan Fitzpatrick has come out and he has won you to football games he went on the road and he was good enough to beat the New Orleans saints who have only lost one game so far this year\nHe was good enough to beat the Philadelphia Eagles who are pretty good team they had the ball with a chance to beat the Steelers pretty good football team there he played one bad\nAgainst the bears the entire team was awful in fact the defense was by far they gave up six touchdown passes to ... the defense was the reason why they lost not Ryan Fitzpatrick they benched him\nJames wins then came back through a couple of interceptions lost against the falcons they were incredibly fortunate to beat the browns in overtime in Tampa Bay\nAnd went through another couple of interceptions was a very good and then they were getting blown out when ... when Seamus twins then came in and through for interception I mean that is evidence on the field three seven games that Seamus is not the answer so you would stick with it\n[laughter] oh of course that were because we really didn't give them the ... year you\nKnow in the combat she was injured battled on Jay but it was an injured he was suspended for sexual assault\nGet a chance to get back into your rhythm at the same time to now\nHis rhythm has been thrown intercept thanks for the call is a disastrous argument for oh gee in Florida\nThere's no reasonable football fan who can't have watched Ryan's fitzpatrick play this year and can have watched Seamus Winston play this year and say James Winston should be starting quarterback for the NFL for an NFL franchise\nCompared to what these two guys have done I'm not even getting into the fact that I think if the Sean Jackson and Mike Evans and O. J. Howard were asked to who do you want is your quarterback I think they would all say Ryan Fitzpatrick\nYou watch the body of language on that theme I think if you asked that often civil and who do you want is you're starting quarterback I think they would all say riot fitzpatrick now I don't disagree Brian Fitzpatrick has proven that he is not an elite level quarterback in the NFL\nYou're gonna give twenty million dollars to James ...\nThat is crazy to me I think the bucks right now they give the reigns to riot fitzpatrick\nIf it's Patrick goes off the rails truly plays a couple of bad games in a row maybe a hand the reigns back over to James if the bucks get eliminated from any kind of playoff contention maybe you say okay James wince than you can finish the season\nThe problem is if James Winston gets injured that twenty million dollars is guaranteed to him\nDo you really want to stay I mean I'll I'll pull the pulled the audience here we pull my crew Danny gee yes or no do you stick with or who you go with fits fitzpatrick or Jamie ...\nI don't think fitzpatrick is the long term solution but I Would go with him right now\nAll right what about you are to agree with any they're All right what about you Ralph urban you there\nYeah you gotta you gotta get rid of Winston right now it's kind of like what they did in Buffalo with Tyrone Taylor a couple of years ago Kim alright what about you do what do you think I'm In agreement\nSo we have ... how it's relatively rare that all five people myself dub\nRalph urban who's sitting in for Edie Garcia Roberto and daddy gee that we all agree uniformly on any answer\nWe all agree that Seamus wince that has to go does\nAlex more of as agree with us he knows all about the NFL he's got inside sources all over Tampa Bay buccaneers we'll talk about that we'll talk about the big win for the rams what did the same big wins say about their status in the NFC all of that and more and more dive into every major story\nIn the NFL with Alex more of as he is going to join us next but before that we know you're a big sports fan football season here\nAnd a lot of people are excited to wager on games you can get it on the action with my book he dot net my book you that that is the industry leading sports action website that offers real Vegas odds on football baseball all your favorite sporting events\nYou can take a side the toad or you can even bat the over under on how many fantasies point points a player will score\nMy book he dot net let you play on line and win big used promote code clay that the L.

eight\nAnd what a tub draining game that is and then you go back out on the road to play the Minnesota Vikings although I Do think injuries played a pretty big part in why Minnesota didn't do as well last night they've got some issues with her cousins as well listen the off at the office is limited here\nThey have to throw the football so quickly that teams are figuring out\nThat they combat down her cousins passes he's actually on a record setting pace for the most passes deflected at the Y. scrimmage in NFL history so they need to figure out something else they gotta hope to delve and cooks answering comes around and he's able to play sometime soon maybe be able to open up some things a little bit more for them deep but\nFor the St Louis and mark is Davenport coming to life last night with two sacks that's big for this team you lie apple he's going to go through his learning curve trying to get down to the defense but he does upgrade a secondary that needed a little bit more help and of course we know the saints are going to score points I think the second best team in the NFC but next Monday when we talk they may very well be the first\nOr the jags\nYeah oh yeah big time done but should have at least that if a sixty four thousand dollar party and the way out\nRight can you believe that story I mean we'll play you know I heard about the thirty two thousand dollars have you and your family ran up for a lot of chocolate milk shakes and things like that and I\nGet if you got kids and they're growing so I understand that but I mean you think about that you know your team you you've lost three straight you've been out scored Ninety to twenty eight in these games you have a huge contest coming up and what do you do and you're going to a burlesque show\nYou know before the game to have a curfew I don't think anyone's figured this out here and I'm Still trying to get to the bottom of it because guys were out you know what passed for in the morning I mean is when they were being detained early Saturday morning they did have a walk through practice\nThe next day I'm not saying that's why the jacks lost the giants are losing because they're often says so beat up\nAnd ... to simply isn't a difference making quarterback in the passing game that's it there without their top running back to the top wide receiver they're onto their third string left tackle and they've lost their starting tight end but other than that Mrs Lincoln the play was absolutely fabulous you know in the defense isn't stepping up either they're not playing difference making football\nOutside of class Campbell jailing Ramsey at us verse interception of the season but let's be honest this isn't the same group that type of impact that they were making when they were talking so much trash and twenty Seventeen during a lot of trouble and listen teams are heating up the Houston Texans\nFive straight wins for the first time since two thousand and twelve\nThe cult of not one to straight games for the first time since November of twenty sixteen yes I Know making small steps but nonetheless a dangerous team down the stretch and by the way Indianapolis doesn't really face anybody all that much down the road here when it comes to contending for the postseason Indianapolis the only remaining team with a winning record on their schedule is Houston\nSo keep an eye on the coasts making a move in Tennessee is going to put her along and you know we talk about a quarter back decision at the end of the season markets Mario to set to make the same type of base salary as James Winston has hit twenty million dollar quarter back\nYou know in twenty Nineteen and they're going into the familiar with his deal but they're still going to be pesky along the way uh Jacksonville just doesn't have at this year I think the team really over calculated I'm Blake portals obviously in that regard and thinking that he was going to be good enough to get them there but again\nHow do you judge Blake with all the injuries well great quarterbacks lift their teams to these types of circumstances he is not\nTomorrow is the trade deadline I Believe four o'clock eastern if I'm not mistaken a day before Halloween the giants go out and get wall up again there one in seven there are a lot of teams right now turning the page all I think all ready\nAnd saying let's get ready for next season we're halfway through were out of the running\nOne guy do you think potentially could be moving who's looking to make moves as we come up on ... or they basically what thirty six hours left\nIn the NFL trade deadline\nThe funny part is who do you want right who do you want on the other giants defense that Adrian Peterson is still gaining yards on okay apparently this run that Adrian Peterson had yesterday his sixty or touchdown run is the longest by someone age thirty three are older since Jim Thorpe\nWhy Janice amazing Thorpe it was the third hundred forty\nNine yards the third most productive rushing game\nFor a back in NFL history over the age thirty three are over since John ... and John Henry Johnson a pro Football Hall of famer from yesteryear are okay that's where we're at with Adrian Peterson going for you it's Owen no sex along the way\nAs well by the New York giants their lousy look I don't know if ... Vernon has some some ... you know some value to a team because he is a very good pass Roger just isn't really making an impact in this type of system generous Jenkins even though it gets spun around like a top sometime\nYou know if you like apple has trade value that maybe ... to a team land in ... name has now surface he's in the final year of his contract although a potential franchise tag designate for him we know two guys who aren't going to be on the move Eli Manning he's not going anywhere he has no trade claws and I'll be honest with you play this may be the swan song of Eli Manning light\nYou know we just in it for whatever you can enjoy of twenty Eighteen of Eli Manning I think that might be it I just get the feeling that that this might be at at the end of the year\nAnd he might just call it a career because their skills are just declined to a pretty severe point and we know the giants are going to be moving on a quarterback and where does he want to go to try reinvent himself not sure that that's really going to be happening we know auto back and junior isn't on the move but isn't it amazing play the narrative about is owed back I'm happy in New York\nHe signed a contract paying him an average of sixteen point four million dollars a year making in the highest paid wide receiver in NFL history and we've got to do back from junior is allowing people to go down the road to this narrative about him not being happy are you kidding the giants are a mess to play the giants have become the jets by the way\nAnd the jets while they're not the giants quite yet they're they're far closer in that direction and the giants becoming the giants because the giants are being run and competently starting with ownership on down\nIt is pretty wild or to think about now there are a lot of quarterbacks out there Sam Bradford you mentioned him earlier heady Bridgewater Hi rod Taylor do you see any quarterback moving between now and tomorrow\nI don't see it because I don't know which acts and those who do you get Toronto Taylor might be the best guy 'cause he can run for his life and he doesn't commit turnovers but does he make any impact place in the passing game I mean aren't you just\nAren't you just doing the same thing with like ... and at least you know ... the strengths and weaknesses and can cover a mob\nIs that really an upgrade I mean could you imagine Eli Manning or San Bradford and I know we like and the new trade laws is not going to have it but it's Tom coughing and wanted to try to go get this guy could you imagine him standing back there in the pocket of having a collapse on them and going down again I mean when Booker McFarland called him a lawn ornament on Monday Night football I mean what a damning indictment of Eli Manning because you can't move\nSpeaking of can't move sand Bradford can't move he's someone that that's a mobile himself teddy Bridgewater I talked to Mickey Loomis a thanks GM about this look he actually wants to keep him\nBeyond twenty eight team that made that that trade for a third round pick for him but really he may just end up being in an expense expensive insurance policy because taste some hill\nIt's such an intriguing guy they actually do refer to him as Jim Thorpe\nOn the same that's his nickname there 'cause he's such a throwback guy but he lives in either development of developing them has to be he's got Armstrong Khamenei can run the football he's obviously out of an interesting element when they do their wild cat stuff so I I find him a fascinating guy but I don't see anyone on the move or and I just really don't play and part of that is because of the NFL itself\nThey changed the rules quarterbacks are getting injured at a much much lower rate\nThan they had been in recent seasons I mean who's out Josh Allen Buffalo's not going to make a move you know who's out there from Miami ... Wilder you're going to stick with him but they're hoping that they get ... he'll back sooner than later they're really just hasn't been in San Francisco they are going well CJ bath or I mean they could have made a move earlier on but instead they're not and I don't envision them because\nYou know really they are going nowhere fast why give up tropics if you're not winning so\nAt this point I think the quarterback marketed is pretty set I mean I just don't see anyone making that type of MOOCs I don't see a system put out there for a team with these ... that are available\nYou mentioned that the saints may be the best team in the NFL what did you think about a game that a lot of people were watching between the Packers and the rams what stood out to you\nThe the rams listen they figured the second half such a different half right and they figured out some of the things that the Packers were doing on the defensive side of the football Todd girlie right now is absolutely ridiculous claim he's the only running back in the NFL who was averaging one hundred rushing yards game eight hundred on the ... how about this\nPriest homes and jump around those are the only other players in NFL history that have been touched down to Fifteen through the first eight games of the season oh and by the way I think about this topic early don't care about the numbers he cares about winning\nThis is a guy who goes ahead and take and it doesn't go in the end zone late in the fourth quarter because he didn't want Green Bay to have another chance to touch the football speaking of the Packers real interesting story up I might just over at NFL dot com about this about how the Packers are absolutely furious at time Montgomery\nHow tight went into business for himself apparently he was upset\nAt being punched in the fourth quarter of the game and and other running backs getting spots in the rotation so even though he was told taken me in the end zone he didn't he ran out with a football he fumbled Aaron Rodgers doesn't get to touch the football again that's it if Mike mccarthy\nAnd you know a good inclusive GM if they don't cut time Montgomery today I just wonder where's this Packers team had it I wasn't all that Bush on them\nEntering the season I just think it's Aaron Rodgers and a bunch of other guys and it looks and they're going to be on under five hundred after Sunday night when they play the patriots and actually\nChiefs what an unbelievable performance by the chiefs again or they win by seven\nOr the Broncos basically done do you think they could look to unload anybody to Mary's Thomas's name a has certainly been out there along with I think a manual Sanders like there's been a lot of talk about them potentially trading a wide receiver what do you think the Broncos are going to do what do you think of the chief says we move forward are they the unquestioned best team in the AFC\nI mean even to marry the Thomas the saying is like fifty fifty if he stays part of the problem with the Marriott says if you acquire him it's not like you're requiring them for the long term because next research make fourteen million dollars\nAnd base salary and we all know dumb areas Thomas at this point of his career is not a fourteen million dollar a year type of player I mean so he's still good but not fourteen million dollars a year clay Travis tied\nMoney you understand what you're saying so I mean but there's a\nChance of a team thinks he's a short term fix for them he'll make that type of move a Sanders is going to stay he still has some truth by the way Cortland and lets them it's a testament all sort of Courtland Sutton their second round pick out of SMU this guy's been fantastic and he is ready to take to Maria's Thomas a spot", "show_name": "FOX Sports Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Newton", "day": "29"}
