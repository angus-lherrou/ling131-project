I mean this was the ... the Russians were in no doubt that they were being used as cannon fodder\nAnd ah yeah there's there's that example where are you know units marshal on the road arrive at their destination and you know battalions had been produced a strength by half by desertion and then Trump trends will arrive at the term in is in the in the open the box cars and they'll be empty all the troops will jumped out in the middle of the first on the way\nThe the Russians were it was it was just a a Harley tragic worked for them they they had so much man power they had a ... a army of Seventeen million at Seventeen million military aged men in this empire of a hundred and fifty million\nUh but the problem was is that they they couldn't arm them because of the of the because of their\nBackward industry to begin with but also because of the of the astro Turkish German blockade of all the Russian porch so everything had to come in through our angel ... the goal of mine who was the quarter master general the Russian Army said\nSupplying this empire during the war was like trying to supply a house where all the windows and doors are nailed shut and you have to bring everything and down the chimney that's that was the what the situation was like inside Russia\nSo they were really hamstrung throughout the war and so all these all these troops that were going to the front I mean imagine a fewer than a third of the men and you don't have a rifle they know they're just going to be sent on armed against enemy fire and a and a devastated\nThe Russians are pulled out of the war by lemon after November Seventeen and the war ends in Eighteen on the western front there's a separate piece the ... and ... and I hope I say that correctly Jeff\nAnd why this book sets up the catastrophe of the twentieth century is that in those treaties they create the various states Poland Czechoslovakia hungry even focus lobby\nAnd Austria that we will see pulled apart by the second war and here in the twenty first century are still sources of tension turmoil in the world\nWhat Ukraine is is made up of pieces of the old hops Berg empire so Jeffrey you've written a book about what I read now or the fundamentals for the conflict that we still live without solution\nYeah uh you know I think it's a it's a little known fact that a despite the you know the despite the the punishment inflicted on Germany at the treaty of Versailles you know reducing the army two hundred thousand troops\nThe or the billions of dollars in reparations the loss of of of German territory in Europe but also Germany's overseas comedies that reduction of\nThe German navy to twelve lightweight ships it it seemed like the Germans took her real pounding the treaty of Versailles but what ... but they were paradoxically strengthened by the uh the by the Paris Peace conference because\nThe the dissolution of the Oscar Hungarian empire and they're written and the pulling back of the Russian Empire or Soviet Union\nMeant that there was no this vacuum and east central Europe\nA that was really up for grabs the the ... part broken up the Soviet Union had been pushed far to far to the east by the creation of new states like like Poland and so uh and Romania and so what this meant was that you know the power on the scene\nThat was a rich history and uh [noise] uh most opportunistic the Germans were going to be able to push into that space colonized and ignite the second world\nWar and September first Nineteen thirty nine the next day of the catastrophe a mad catastrophe the outbreak of World War one and the collapse of the hops for ...

it's a miserable lot\nMiserable you see because we got game seven coming up in the end all cs see the Dodgers they had they had this bad boy wrapped up three to back Milwaukee won two straight feeling good about themselves extra innings a walk up by Cody Ballenger man\nWe're on a roll and they won the very next game because em obey thought it was a great idea to start a game after a Thirteen inning extravaganza a you know what we're going to do we're going to go ahead and start to this next bad boys two PM ... that makes a lotta sense\nJust like a you know setting up a certain feeling\nIt's in stadiums where fans can reach over into play and not take a ball out of the air that makes a lot of sense to but major league baseball there they're brilliant or they figured this whole thing out so they're scheduling makes a ton of sense it's kind of like one major league baseball said uh\nYou don't even do the cubs and the brewers and the Dodgers and Rocky's they finished tied for first in their divisions\nBut you know the cubs one of their head to head match up and the Dodgers one there had dead matchup against Milwaukee in Colorado so so clearly the solution is\nI'm a one hundred and sixty third game to decide the division which makes sense so major league baseball decided is scheduled this two PM game and so the Milwaukee Brewers came out and they were flat and the Dodgers pulled away late and so the Dodgers Rob three two and then they got to Milwaukee and the Dodgers got smoked\nOn friday and so now we've got a game seven and the game seven\nIs awesome for all of us who aren't Dodger fans or who aren't brewer fans I Can't wait for it I don't have a dog in the fight what do I care whatever happens happens I mean personally I Would like to see good things happen to the Dodgers organization\nBecause our flagship here at Fox Sports radio am five Seventy LA sports the home of the Dodgers a lot of good people a lot of cool people that I Know and I like over there\nSo I like it when good things happen but from a fan perspective there's nothing like stress free big time sporting events there's really something to it but if you're a fan of the Dodgers are the brewers your ... right now\nAnd the you know which you can try and avoid it you could try and not think about it you could try and get your mind off it you can do whatever you want to spend time with the family go get a couple of drinks watch a comedy special you cannot escape the idea that there is a game\nThat is going to determine your mood for the next several days and you've got nothing to say about it nothing to say\nIt's miserable anybody who's been a fan of a team was ever gone to a game seven especially if you're a fan of a team who had somebody on the brink and then yeah last game six\nAnd then you went to a game seven you know exactly what I'm Talking about it is a miserable feeling\nBut on the outside we get to sit back stress free\nWe just we just get to enjoy baseball game it's one of those things in sports that isn't it's not like anything else else in life because if you walked by somebody and you knew they were struggling or they were having a hard time with something you stop and you try and alleviate the pain\nLike you do whatever it is to try and help them maze or anything I can do can get you anything is there anything you do for you here we are to fan base is the Dodgers and the brewers who are miserable in anguish anticipating\nThe potential doom that's going to be presented to one of those two franchises coming up here in less than twenty four hours and you know we're all doing counting down the hours waiting to watch I it's it's crazy bad but that's just part of a game sevens\nIt's all on the line you get to sit back and try to tell people there's something about stress free there's something about going to do an exhibition game where it doesn't matter you really want to want to care enough\nPlay some money on it but there's something about just being able to enjoy game without having to be so stressed out about it right now up until first pitch it will consume\nAt Dodger fans in brewer fans of the entire day Jonah socks

head to head with a game seven of the national league championship series and Mike actually suggested\nThat a lot of LA fans will be conflicted as to what they will be paying attention to us tonight will be paying attention to one of eighty two game number two of ... of a potential eighty two regular season games for LeBron James was the Lakers or the potential last game of the season for the ...\nThey'll say was Dodgers will have a chance to make it to the world series or will be going home should they lose to the Milwaukee Brewers so the question is what should or what do we think LA fans we pay more attention to game seven of you know yes or game two of the NBA season with the brawn James making his debut at staples\nWell I mean clearly it would be a sea and I'll see us with the

to pat ourselves on the back and try and do hype our own here\nAh from Fox Sports radio over to Fox Sports one but I Would ... I don't know if it were regular season debut and there were no LeBron and balled I Would say majority would go to the Dodgers and\nUm [noise] but I\nI think that this is going to be a real split look here's here's what I've noticed okay and my brother uh owns a bar and so it's they show a lot of sports they're a bunch of TVs\nIn the you know gays will be kind of crowds I guess depending on who's playing\nOut and they do all the U. S. T. fights there and all the big games next Sunday ticket and all that stuff so it it's it's a sports bar it's also a restaurant but as a sports bar and a club and October is a huge month ... because there's so much going on that majority of people don't have\nMultiple TVs in one room in their house\nSo it's almost like October is a sports bar a month to wear with everything going on college football the NFL NBA major league baseball playoffs the NHL if you're into it you you almost need to go to a place it's got a bunch of T. v.'s\nSo I Wonder how many of them are just going to cram into a bar somewhere\nAnd that way they'll get side by side coverage of not only the Dodgers but his that's finishing up then you've got the Lakers I I just God Forbid the Dodgers and brewers are tied late when the Lakers too off against that and then you're screwed then I have no idea what's going to happen\nWhile I Would think I mean look this is a chance to the doctors to go back to back World Series they have not won a World Series championship since Nineteen eighty eight I mean it's pretty easy for me if it were me I Would be trained and again it's not that bad ourselves on the back your Fox Sports radio enough as one\nOf the game seven of it you know so yes for the Dodgers I Would imagine that would have a little bit more important\nThan the game number two of which will be many of the brawn James playing in the Los Angeles Lakers uniform I understand the significance of it as a star player in the city of LA but it's the second game of the regular season versus the opportunity to go to the fall classic I don't see how there's much of a comparison so if it were me and say I couldn't go to a sports bar", "show_name": "FOX Sports Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Newton", "day": "20"}
