the game when it gets\nI disagree needed to be said and it's nice that somebody had the ... who said who's with the giants I was just going to say this is what people think people watch the team believe this is clearly people in the locker room believer so just to say\nWhat's the problem now secondly patch or can we all agree\nI think we all can agree the ... is in over his head\nA this was a bizarre higher to start with\nSherman who does not strike you as the kind of a coach who can deal with the ... and the odd mannerisms of auto back them\nAnd sure enough this season has played out as anticipated the giants are one and for their circling the drain we bend Mac do you got sacrifice last season he was the scapegoat the players are not great patch termer\nIs not doing a wonderful job of coaching these players up getting the most out of these players were thirty percent in\nTo the regular season the giants have played five games and they're not going anywhere different from last year they were bad last year they're bad this year insure them or ... you look at what he did in Cleveland he was nine and twenty three\nWith the browns many years ago in his first opportunity was supposed to be different I was going to be different now Sherman had success in Philadelphia as a coordinator had success in Minnesota it was going to be ...\nReally I don't think it's any different I I don't use any different at all watching Sherman melt down here at the news conference you could literally see him come apart at the teams and and he is\nHe's thinking is what he's doing a and I don't know that he's going to be able to tread water the giants are pretty buttoned up\nConservative organization and they don't typically just run through coaches a conga line of coaches and so that's in the positive for passion rumor is that he'll get the hang around a little bit longer\nBut he's been unable to mask the shortcomings on the Giants' roster and coach 'em up you know he's he hasn't coached them up the giants are one and four I could have coached the judge you could have coach the giants they'd be one and for uh I I really believe that only the patch has made any difference in a positive way with this Giants' team\nNow the final word of the giants are on pace to win three or four games and if that happens I if that happens then the giants even though they're conservative and they're buttoned up and all that they have to look at the coach and they have to say what are we to keep this guy we're going to watch this guy\nBarring some kind of radical transformation that is where this has had high it's like well they just don't want to just fire Sherman after one year but\nIf they end up going three and Thirteen or foreign twelve\nWhat are you doing I use you figure that you buy manning will be gone after this year you could fire sure were and then get a quarterback and the coach can then pick the quarterback the new coach\nAs far as the short you may have that's that's a long game right the short game is well what happened oh no back I'm\nClearly has more influence he's got more power\nIn the locker room then pat Schroeder does right this is is a tinderbox and and for now these guys will say well it's it's on the back burner we're not going to focus on this we're moving on we got games to play they're going to try to downplay\nThis particular story I that's that's how the giants are going to handle this\nIn a season will continue to circle the drain if you're looking at where where are the wind is going to be where are the wind is going to be for the giants\nWell there are can be many of them right they they don't win four games of the giants go foreign twelve or\nIf everything goes right and the giants can win five games wow five wins that's an amazing year for the giants they've lost four out of five they've got Philadelphia\nThe eagles that's a winnable game right after when I'm getting because Philadelphia's on on her five hundred team they're not the same magical feel it was Super Bowl team of last year the losing team the eagles after five games there are a winnable games the problem is the giants are\nBad the there are terrible team and at least I'll give them credit as we said here because of the drama their interest you can't be bad and boy and you can be bad you can be boring if you're good you can be bad if you're interesting and that's where the giants are there are bad but they're not born\nAre usually bend Mather show on Fox will talk about that if you would like the

Sunday night game last night the Dallas Cowboys lost in overtime fight the game went to overtime was there were\nDocuments considering that looked like Houston was driving down and they were going to go to win the game and all that stuff but the the Sean Watson ends up throwing in an assumption and the game goes over time and then in overtime the cowboys matriculate the ball down the field and they get to a fourth\nDown in one and Jason Garrett decides to point he was asked about that after the game and his response was it is a quote he wasn't he says it was rather he was a long one yard\nWas his response yeah\nTell us we're ten yards away from field goal position they need one more yard and they would have gone ahead and they ended up a well so that one forty to your life force in one at the Texans forty two yard line and you send the punt unit on\nAnd then the you watch the Texans go down the field and kick the game winning for your call that's cowboys football on your

I. and also in our three so that you know Dan Wetzel who was there in person Yahoo Sports national columnist he wrote about it\nHe will take us into Vegas and tell us what the scene inside was like now and uh also we'll talk as we always do with our three to Alex ... so our gas went on aghast at all and our one or an hour or two but we'll have a couple of guests for you and our three including some on\nSeparate down inside or what exactly happened there in the U. S. C. fight between Connor McGrath and could be\nThat was so good that the haters instantly when says social media and said that was scripted that was planned no was that was that was the best moment of the weekend biggest stories in the NFL all the walk off when you started with all those calls those four games prove how important it is to have a really good field goal kicker\n... sixty three are there was amazing obviously only two dominant teams in the NFL I watched that rams game\nA ... and you got to give the Seahawks a lot of credit they showed more heart than what I think people thought was possible from them this season with a mediocre team but the rams were able to kill the clock at the very end of that game\nAnd talk about how important field goal kicker is are you mentioned Mason Crosby really really quickly five ... oh my goodness I feel bad for Pakistan's waking up this morning nice winter the Vikings Texans and cardinals and as far as our raiders here there's a couple of greater fans on your staff\nThey cannot stop anybody consistently on defense the one bright spot so far the season had been marsh on Lynch running the ball he only got the ball nine times yesterday for thirty one yard some of that being because the raiders best alignment ... out her she got multiple rookies on the line made\nFor a long day you got to give a lot of credit to the chargers defense I think\nThat the chargers could possibly give the chiefs are a little bit of a run for the money as we get into the season here\nBecause of their defense and raiders fans just cringe whenever we see during when James on the screen because the raiders should have drafted him and then for baseball I don't know how much of this you got to see yesterday but the tuna juniors grand slam when Mueller was struggling any walk the pitcher\nTo get the first running for the Braves but the Dodgers showed heart would that come back months the tide things up with his home run and then Freddie Freeman without winner for the Braves so brave stay alive but it's still looks like the Dodgers are in control of that series [noise]\nWe uh by the way eight seven seven nine nine six six thirty six now and we will be all and for everybody out there who will be watching the Dodgers and the Braves game today\nWe will be all and lock it in special time about Fifteen minutes after that game tonight on Tuesday Thursday and friday last week and we're going to have another massive audience on Monday coming out of that Dodgers and Braves game so uh so if you haven't gotten a chance to check it out\nWill be on and prime time again Eddie Garcia what were your big takeaways from the weekend what stood out to you [noise]\nWell it's hard not to figure out the two teams that are still undefeated and I thought the rams were ... I don't know if clearly is a good word about the rams are the better team because of their defense but after seeing what Seattle did them\nA while I don't know maybe the deepest isn't as good as I thought it was a show that they love the for the call to go for it and and get the win and not put the ball away a fruit chiefs obviously great went over the over the jaguars or even though Patrick ... did not have a touchdown pass they still were able to get the pretty convincing victory\nBecause they were able to pick up ... many times college football I don't care if they don't want to call it the red river shootout anymore it's still a shoot out it's still a great game and how about the freshman kicker protects us coming up yeah average\nWhat a clutch kick in college kicker is just like it they'll kick or as you never know what you're going to get but that was awesome and uh you know a lot of people talked about Scott Ross the browns good should kill at UCLA and I get that but as you said then moan at Florida\nOr that has been just as big of a higher and obviously a lot better results quicker ah for the gators with what he's been able to do great whatever else you\nYeah Florida I mean you just gotta give 'em credit I mean five and a one for Dan mall in a incredible turnaround given what they looked like last year with Jim ...\nAnd a gambling you know we knew if you looked at what he did at Mississippi State how good of a coach he was put to immediately come in with Florida and be five in war and like they are the defense legitimately good uh Roberta what you got for me\nWas that the writer game uh yesterday and\nIt's safe to say she's and I think we might have a million little guys talking about the raiders they are so bad yeah she's ... and almost as\nBad as the titans yeah\nThe titans are not good yesterday but the titans are three and two and would be in the playoffs last thinking holy off game\nThey played off all three turnovers and uh and I I I hate when if you were watching the game at all or even saw the highlights\nMarcus Mario to has such unbelievable a poor roster of wide receivers but to drop the touchdown pass that they dropped that would have won the game and buffalo that's a drop that if it happens in a high school game you want to strangle the wide receiver that's a drop that if it happens in a car\nWhich again Nick Williams the guy who dropped that you want to strangle the receiver sometimes I see things that happen in in NFL games that I just I mean it was as easy of a touchdown catch as will exist in the NFL this year I mean if I were on I'm not even kidding about this if it was ... me the Vikings play on a on the secondary\nIf I were on the field and I dropped that patch I Would be furious at myself in it like that to catch that I think Ninety\nPercent of the people listening to the show right now would make so it's one thing when professionals make mistakes or somebody who's also a professional stops you from being successful but when you were running wide open\nAnd you've got a sure fire touchdown catch and you're not even gonna get touched right it's not as if you're going to get whip up when you get into the end zone or you're trying to protect the ball\nAnd make sure that you don't drop it or all all those things I mean there's no one near him it's as easy of a catch for a touchdown as will exist in the NFL this year\nAnd a drop that I I almost if I were a head coach would want to just cut a guy on the spot like I I understand like the ... purpose of empathy and sympathy and everything else but when you make something that his dad agree just to have an air\nAnd it's so indefensible relative to again if you were a high school or I'll be honest with you I I my little my seven year old just turned eight is playing flag football right now\nLike he would be you wouldn't be able to sleep if he dropped that patch for a touchdown and flag football and he's eight years old\nIf you drop that I don't know what you do if you're pro like I mean that is to me so awful thing they were like ... and Crosby when you missed by bill goals like I think you should get fired immediately if you are so bad at your job and\nMake a play like that so that to me I I if you watched that play it's as bad as the players you'll see all year and it would cost the team a game when you only play sixteen games and they would make some Crosby\nI at least making Crosby has a history of being pretty good Nick Williams I Would cut up I mean it's that bad I think he was atrocious and he also caused an interception because he didn't complete his route like it was an awful game for it I I don't understand it\nAnyway the raiders or bad sorry for cutting you off Roberto but you've got to be fired up on that is alright we think about that one yeah and I think the raiders of gave the wrong guy\nOr an extension of being a Mac should have got the money first in the car because cars yeah ... ... ... car collapse\nIs really one of the most unexpected outcome that we have seen in ... in the NFL in some time because he looked like an MVP and then it just vanished and now he looks like a guy who is the U.S like his brother he looks like David Carr\nAuburn was trying to score touched down as well and went to reach out a the ball to score\nAnd it's unclear really honestly whether or not the ball broke the plane in possession of the ... running back because we never had in either of those situations a great down the goal line view\nAnd if you're going to rely on instant replay shouldn't you have to always have a reliable down the goal line view especially when you consider how much money\nIs at stake and also how much money is being paid to air these games I don't understand why that wouldn't happen let me get some of your calls Jose in Fremont what'd you got for me\nWith a brother or a couple of things and I'm asking a question um man I Wish I Wish my radar Chad Hart like obese corner dude I'm so sick and tired of it if we're going to wrap\nThis stopping lame duck season and then grew in saying oh we're trying to win come on man just just call you wrap season's over and also what do you think there's a flight rumor out there that are out here in the bay at least at the raiders\nAre willing to listen to Jacksonville the car and what would you change and other writers are such a math but we got me fat lighting the orange on the ground game that broken damn man I Would you like poor people\nUh I don't think that the the raiders trading Derek car would be unbelievable I don't think we've ever had a twenty million plus dollar quarterback it trade it I don't know the ... car changes anything for the jags personally\nI don't know that I look at him and think oh my God he's a solution to everything that's going wrong with the ... better than ... maybe he's not as mobile honestly ... as a quarterback has become the best running quarterback in the NFL that's the best asset he bears to bring here oh let's go to ah let's see who is it ten in North Carolina\n\n... pulling the raiders fans I'm adult fan man and treading years we've been waiting on the hill to come around\nThat will brutal yesterday that it is a raiders\nWe beat them with your family all the fan base were like on a Super Bowl and we play one came in and we got a book Seventeen point late\n[noise] yeah I should have mentioned that the bangles came back from a Seventeen nothing definite there's nothing worse than sitting around thinking that you might have a good quarterback and then finding out that he sucks and that's a large percentage of the NFL fan bases out there you wait around forever or is this guy good as you get to be good maybe is good and then you blow Seventeen point lead against the bangles and you're like this guy socks Lucas in Bakersfield what's up\nYour morning what so\nWhy ah Michigan they weren't forty two to Twenty one Maryland by going next week it gets hard wondering what your thoughts were you in trouble 'cause it's a second straight week that Michigan will start going\nThere on it I think it'll be at war for so we've got tons of time talking about the game still to come up I think it'd be a low scoring game I think either Michigan or Wisconsin a win by three or four points but I Will have plenty of time to talk about that Michael in Texas what's up\nMan I was going to talk about your ... or ... or\nYeah hold on ... ... let's let's go back to Michael in fact the people on line I'm going to open up the phone lines to take all the USC questions as we started our to Lance in Indiana what's up with\n... mile as you what you got a chance to guard the point\nI think LSU I Apologize to all the LSU fans out there for getting it wrong with your win over Miami and also your win over all her\nAt this point I think L. S. using eight in fourteen\nI think they're going to lose this weekend to Georgia be a great environment great game Georgia going on the road against LSU down in Baton Rouge I think they will lose the Alabama and I think there is a good chance jumbo Fisher is going to beat LSU I Know they haven't done it yet if they got into the SEC\nBut that game is in College Station I think there's a good chance the jumbo Fischer will win that game so if I were predicting right now I think LSU will go eight and four I said before the season they would go six and six I was wrong I thought they would also lose the Miami and I thought they would also loose Auburn it looks like they want\nThose games I still think they're going to lose the remainder I think they're going to get waiting for the than the than

was trying to hide what actually happened afterwards match I think that was wrong of the U.S see\nNow is this going to be such a black guy for the U.S see that it has significant long term impacts\nDon't know I don't know what the impact is I don't know what you should do I think that could be has to get a substantial suspension\nEven though I think this overall is probably a good thing for the U. S. C. because you're saying to yourself well play Dr as you're talking about the U. S. C. on a Monday after we just had college football in the NFL take place you're opening your our to true\nI did our one all on the NFL and all on college football but you're right I think this is such a compelling story and I don't know how many of you out there are like me and paid sixty five dollars to watch this thing\nBut I think it's a compelling story and a lot of you are reacting I put up a was that could be McGregor post match may lay good or bad for the U. S. C. and about sixty percent of you are saying that it was good for the U.S the fifty seven percent of you\nIt was good forty three percent of you saying it was bad what should happen when I open up the phone lines eight seven seven nine nine six six three six nine my inclination is first of all Conor McGregor is not going to be can be\nI don't think you can beat him get maybe get lucky catch him with a punch early but watching that fight as soon as can be gets Conor McGregor down onto the Matt I\nThink that the ... the sort of the boxing rounds into matches and everything else the fight becomes really boring\nAnd the only real round worry it didn't happen that they spent the majority of the round on the ground was round three and Conor McGregor one that I think can be knows that if he stays on his feet he probably loses as soon as he gets Conor McGregor underground he has no chance of losing\nAnd we saw him get Conor McGregor into submission hold in the fourth around before the may happen before it could be went outside of the ring the other thing I Would say here is to me this is an intriguing story because it balances out what's real and what's not real\nA lot of times you can't tell whether to combat and in a combat sport like this boxing or eh may actually dislike each other or or they ratcheting up all of the uh this uh like in order to make as much money as they possibly can\nFor instance I think may weather and McGregor\nActually probably like each other and I think they each made a hundred million dollars because they are really good at stoking the idea that they don't like each other\nBut in reality I think those do have a good time having a beer with each other we just saw videos go viral I think many pack yell and Floyd Mayweather actually like each other\nBut when they get ready for the fight they will put on a show and make it seem like they genuinely dislike each other because people me you everybody else out there is more likely to buy a fight if we believe the two people who are fighting\nGenuinely detest each other right I I think that's the number one rule of defy game is sell the idea that you hate each other even if you really don't hate each other because it means you you each make more money\nThat the general rule I think can be genuinely hates Conor McGregor\nAnd I don't think he was satisfied with the way that fight ended with choking out Conor McGregor I don't think he felt like he significantly hurt Conor McGregor I\nThink he wanted not just to win\nI think he wanted to really hurt Conor McGregor and I think that's what happened at the end of the fight when he jumped out of the arena out of the octagon and went into the crowd I think he was so mad and so are his corner people that they legitimately wanted to do harm to Conor McGregor\nAnd so I think when you ratchet up that anger\nAnd I don't know whether Conor McGregor legitimately dislike can be or not I know he got charged for throwing the the thing into the bus and and all of those associated decisions I don't know whether he legitimately dislikes him or if he's so good on the show that he thought oh this is going to take it to the next level\nWill make it seem that way I don't know it could be that both these guys genuinely detest each other McGregor I think it's such a good performer and he's so charismatic and he's so good at making you feel that he feels genuine distaste for his competitor\nThat I'm not sure whether he really feels that or whether how much of it as a show I think could be this for real\nSo I Want to open up the phone line the question here is two fold is it good for the U. S. C. and what should the punishment for could be be when you go into the crowd ring side\nThat something that has to make the U. S. C. incredibly nervous\nWhen that happened in the NBA when Iran are test when the Pacers and the pistons got into a brawl the NBA went back and basically changed everything about the way they deal with potential fights\nAnd as a result it may have changed who won the championship because you'll remember the Phoenix Suns the last ... after Steve Nash got hip checks by Robert ory I Believe it was the end of the scores table years ago\nThe NBA said if you come off the bench onto the court you have an automatic suspension and the result has been we've never really seen any violence in the NBA sense but it wasn't about the on cord violence that the NBA seem troubled by it was the fight going into the crowd\nAll of this celebrity's all of the rich people who sit right on the court in the NBA the idea was oh my God if we've got players fighting with fans the NBA brand came collapse in a hurry\nWell the expectation\nMaybe a little bit different in the U. S. C. much like it is and the WWE or guys go outside the ring and get hit with chairs and get thrown right into the end of the you know the chain link fence area there the barriers the barricades\nAll the time and the WWE so it might not have the same impact in the U. S. C. 'cause people might be like oh in combat sports\nBecause of what the WWE has taught us over the years we know that the fight can go outside the ring and I know the USC is real and the WWE a stage but I think the expectations for what happens in combat sports are often times set by the WWE\nAnd so when you got guys regularly getting thrown in into tables and thrown into chain link fences and everything else outside of the ring\nDoes that factor in when it comes to how the U. S. C. has to respond to your 'cause heres what here's what I think about there were tons of famous people immediately around that ring\nWhat happens if ... is taking a huge swing at some guy outside the ring and instead of hitting the guy he's intending to hit he hits Robert Craft or Rory McIlroy or Tom Brady\nOr one of these huge celebrities that is sitting ring side\nAnd they get severely injured like think about it Robert Craft is right there right outside the U. S. C. rain what is the owner of the New England patriots took it could be punch full on in the face it might kill him I mean this dude as like Seventy four Seventy five years old\nWhat if that punch which is completely realistic to believe doesn't land on the person it's entitled to land on and instead catches one of the fans and they're severely injured and on top of that what if it's a famous fan\nWhat if Rory McIlroy and the reason why I'm pointing these guys out is because they were shown in the crowd or the dude from Breaking Bad Aaron Judge I Believe Aaron Paul\nThey were showing all these famous guys in the crowd before the or the match was happening what Rory McIlroy take say flying to be punch\nAnd he's out for two years from playing golf because his face is just wrecked\nOr out for a year or Mrs distorted the season\nWhat the NBA decided after the mouse and the palace was we can't have this happen because we have the most lucrative possible seats being paid for by the most wealthy consumers and if one of these people gets her first of all the lawsuit is never ending thing about that for a minute\nIt could be next and injure somebody sitting ringside\nDid his he's bankrupt because there's no way that you assume if you're sitting ringside that you're going to get hit by a beep when he storms out side of the ring and attacks people\nAnd some of these older people or maybe even for the younger people if you get hit the wrong way and you're not a professional you can either be severely injured or you could die way people get hit and fall and hit their head\nOn concrete like I'm sure exist ringside there at the MGM\nIs totally different than your average to do do you see brawling in a bar ... most people are not professionally trained in how to injure someone\nSo when he is throwing a punch it's not like it's even an MBA fight where you've got a bunch of do kind of throw in windmills like by and large we had the Rudy ... John image thing that happened years ago but most to NBA fights most sports fights in general those guys are not trained fighters\nAnd so the odds of a serious injury happening are relatively low even those those guys are big and strong in tough\nWhen you look at the U.S the Kobe could kill someone like I think a lot of the punches that keep evil lands would severely injured your average person right who was not spent a lifetime training in how to take a punch and everything else\nI just think when you get somebody outside the ring now I Do think the WWE experiment helps\nBecause people are used to seeing it in WWE so when they think of combat sports that doesn't seem as shocking as it did the ballots in the palace because of over the years but the WWE staged so the idea of somebody severely injuring somebody who's watching the WWE is low\nWhereas I think in the U. S. C. anything could have happened so they I I don't think anybody has been reported to be severely injured but I think it's crazy did you agree with me that the U.S the had an obligation to show us what was going on\nOh absolutely I mean look we're we're to to be entertained and if there is something that is going on a that is newsworthy or and we paid money to watch yet is then yes you absolutely have to show us what's going on it would be I mean people will be outraged if they you know went to a black or something like that while ms so they they\nDid that they pulled it all the way up to the ceiling so I mean they showed it but as soon as they recognize what was happening they didn't show us any replays they didn't show us anything we we went into the ring eventually\nAnd Dana why it was like hey I Can't give you the the bell to your people lose their minds\nThat was that was all that was said but ah All right\nWell we we are talking about it and we are giving them a lot of ... I don't think didn't happen you know that no one was hurt and not even not even a you know one of the fighters hurting someone but somebody just getting seriously injured in the mail and it's surrounded all that they get away with it but I I Am\nNow but I don't think we would have been talking about it on a Monday if a beep gets it gets his hand raised and I mean maybe we would talk about it for like one segment I certainly wouldn't spend an hour on and on Monday talking about can be McGregor aggravated areas in general\nWhat percentage of my audience bought despite I don't know um I mean you know again it was sixty five bucks by the time I ordered it I think I got my money's worth [laughter] uh I mean it wasn't like I was saying oh I Want to refund but I Do think the U. S. C. had an obligation to show us everything that happened in the post by ...\nAnd I I think they've got a challenging decision to make because this is not something that can become common place\nBut it's a one off situation I also think it's intriguing that people are like oh this is great for the U.S see\nBut I guarantee you that the majority of people fifty seven percent right now my poll saying it's good for the U. S. C. there's no way that same rate would have existed in the NBA and maybe again that's just because the WWE set the precedent of\nOh in combat sports fights go into the crowd and people are not necessarily surprised that happened uh but but it was messy situation what'd you got me on the update\nWell I got the guy who scoreboard and lots of stuff obviously going on on Sunday including a couple of postseason baseball games\nThe brewers are moving on to shut off the Rockies along the route six nothing\nDoing a series three games to nothing in advance to the national ... national gyms users they wait the winner of the Braves Dodgers series which continues\nBecause that land are pulled out of six five went over LA game was tied at five and six were pretty primitive so Homer so LA still has to win seriously but again the Braves are still alive we five in the NFL Sunday night Texas read the cowboys ...

I think\nI think that they should strip and limited though uh I I really do I think that that was uncalled for and he didn't need to do that\nSo you would strip of his belt would you give him a suspension\nOh yeah definitely it's dispensing as well if they can do that great a I don't think ... years especially if it's called ... maybe\nSix seven months wasn't they usually train her\nYeah that was my point thanks for the call it the reason why I Would say a year suspension is it like suspending starting pitcher for five games are four games I mean if you're if you're going to wait six months to fight again then suspending somebody for six months is not an actual punishment\nYou understand my argument there so if you say oh you're suspended from the U. S. C. for six months and you weren't going to fight for the entire six months then there is not actually any tangible impact of that suspension\nSo that's my argument for why he did it for a year you might actually cost him a fight if the U. S. C. actually wants to send a message does is unacceptable Mike at my desk do what's up\nYou're not going to like this far smaller I really do\nYou know the ... legit\nWill lose this what's happening I'm sure you're telling me two guys are going to jump in the Arctic gone as security is going to stand there and not run towards McGregor McGregor doesn't even attempt to defend themselves and hit somebody come on police in the cloud nobody's hurt no fan is touched\nThe managers were touched now supposedly these guys are arrested the trainers back in five minutes who gets arrested in her back in five minutes then it goes to get the care of you know what I tell him were blaming him\nSure people were blaming him against the interview white totally don't believe any of it but Gregory or an actor and you know it's hard to play it off\nThey know why you saw horrible actor looked shocked pissed off just looked like a guy trying to point I don't believe it or ... when the second fight I'm not an idiot you watch no one could be suspended\nNot going to be taken away and they're what they were in the back room after having a beer while in there and make money in the current\nTime playing [noise]\nBut it's an interesting argument I I don't think that's a ridiculous take to say hey this entire thing has been staged\nI I I don't know what to believe right I I\nDon't know if if it was staged I don't believe the actors that they announce or ringside war aware\nThat it had been staged and I I just I don't know I I mean ...\nJason ... I mean it's a it's an interesting theory the entire thing is stage to make more money nobody gets hurt nobody actually gets arrested a Jason in Charlotte is up next what's up\n[noise] [noise] yeah I don't necessarily believe that it was stage but I certainly think they need to come down hard on them suspend them for a minimum of\nA year\nYou know you can't have that are happening in the sport yeah I think it's it's bad\nPress for the U.S see it the bat look I mean it's good that you're speaking about it and the media is going to talk about it for a while but you just can't have that\nYeah it's interesting question Brian in Cincinnati with them next\nOh well yes\nOh it quite like for the the time um I couldn't disagree more with your first caller I'm a diehard you achieve fan catch every fight ... fight to Europe and Victor you name it I don't certainly don't think this was stage and I don't think\nYou you'd have someone more out of character than can be here I mean the guys all business love fighting it totally does he's not in the circus not in the big events I met this is Connor type of show obviously he creates this every event\nHe has um I mean really he's shown I pick overtime much respect for the game for his opponents with all of this you know shows up at every press calm complete disrespect for the comments constantly\nI Wonder in the modern era whether that fact that the U.S the hat restrictions limited it's ditch display now\nIt happens on social media everybody grabs eclipse in immediately shares them but a minority of people are on social media an active there if you get sucked into the social media universe\nYou can come to believe all by God it's such the real world everybody's on Twitter why is this thing that everybody's talking about on Twitter and out a bigger deal and then you get into the real world you know like people have kids they have jobs they're not sitting around all day long on social media\nWatching clips that go viral there it's about twenty percent of the population that spends a lot of time there the other eighty percent doesn't care and so I Wonder on some level whether the way this is going to be shared has an impact in terms of the expectation that and again and again I come back to\nI think the USC is getting a path to your to a large extent because people expect things do they like this to happen because it happens in the WWE all the time\nPeople don't expect for a basketball game to turn into a parole and for fans and employers to get into fights\nThey expect for the fight game to spiral outside of the octagon and go into the crowd area because they've seen it happen for a generation and the WWE now\nThe differences and the WWE it's all choreographed it's all planned injuring a spectator would be an awful thing for them to have happened\nIn the U.S see you can't it wasn't a point I really do the more I think about it there's no way this was planned that could be even his\nQuarterman may have planned hey we're going to jump Connor after this match we're going to go after their guy like that might be planned but\nI don't think that there was any way that the the rest of this was planned and that it could have been stage now to USC pulling away and not showing us everything that took place in the ring I think that was a failure of journalistic responsibility\nTo me when a crazy thing happens and there are cameras there you should show it that somebody can say oh what happens if somebody gets punch somebody gets hurt\nFirst of all you wouldn't have been able to tell a hundred percent because it was such a male a you wouldn't have been able to tell I think you had an obligation to go back and showed the video feed of what everything that was happening there\nI felt like I was being cheated when I paid sixty five dollars where I Know the number one story coming out of this match is not going to be can be joking out may weather and the way to fight ended\nBut the post fight may lay I wanted to see all of that\nAnd the fact that the U.S the never showed me any replace the fact that they pulled their camera all the way out to the ceilings one that shows me that it was a planned\nBecause if it had been planned I think they would have kept the cameras on could be I think they would have caught everything they would have had it set up so when he goes for his flying kick\nAfter one of ... corner man we would have had a perfect view of it they would have had security around such that it didn't spiral into the crowd at all and they would have broken it up even more quickly than they did\nI I just think this was a potential disaster for the U.S the that might have been averted because there weren't any a major injuries at least that I've heard about ringside because otherwise I think this is a massive lawsuit\nIf some if if a if a famous person gets punched and get severely injured by could be even that brawl if a woman gets hit\nCan you imagine how much money MGM and the USC and the individual fighters would be on the hook for how long that litigation would last I think you're probably going to get a lawsuit anyway\n'cause you always get lawsuits filed on behalf I'm sure there'll be a class action lawsuit filed on behalf of everybody who bought this fight\nFor some reason any time that that kind of situation happened so I think we had it when the Tyson fight happened but man what a messy situation Dan Wetzel was their Yahoo Sports national call\nIs he going to be with us to start off our three then we're going to go to Alex ... thought about the NFL and college football with him But Dan Wetzel was in the arena he will join us next to talk about that can be made by their flight McGregor fight whether it was good or not\nFor

of us the fat that always it's always tough for us the fans I better you'll sit there for a long time\nIt's always it's always tough when the sport spills into a a really broad mainstream 'cause people don't understand and kind of a culture of the whole thing I mean it was unusual I was like oh man I wasn't stunned that it was happening\nIt's just like holy cow out here we go and I know it's like hopefully doesn't come over here because again like you get you get guys squalid you\nYeah and these are not just a drunk bar fight like these are these guys are ... you know you don't you do not want to get hit by a spray punch with this crowd\nYes yes so that's exactly what I said this is different to tweet to guys or even any other athletes who haven't been trained as spiders oh like if if they if you were I took a punch from one of these guys we might not get back up great I mean like this is the law you know I didn't think of pulling trauma trained fighter\nNow I mean the ... the the straw way women a hundred and fifty pounds of the B B either one of us you know down to it [laughter] you don't get a chance to get yeah he's a he's a trained fighters so\nLet alone you know these guys are a hundred and fifty five hundred and sixty pounds but they are just you know forget it so anyway\nI mean yeah you're you're concerned because you're like I don't know what's going to happen here but\nUm it's not out of control the kind of watching it and and see it I mean it's while there was a while the I mean to be born crazy was really odd way you could do it but they have here is so significant so I don't think it has anything to do with the WWE I think people who see the WWE\nAnd USC is anything similar have no idea how to USC operates they are not USC fans and those people who cares a guy like people are saying after oh my God is a black guy from the sport people aren't gonna want to be fed like if this offended you this hurt your ... you are never going to be a USC than\nLike it's like getting a NASCAR fan of going that's not very bumped into the other guy like they crashed\nA gift that offends you that they're not driving safely you're not a NASCAR fan\nSo you know this is this is the sport it yeah it was totally out of control it was the big night but the reason you were watching these ... these two guys totally hated each other and you can't really expect with us see\nYou know is is a cold ... sport fighting is they completely global culture\nEverywhere on earth they fight we have a guy from the ... you know rural eastern Russia find that guy from the slums of Dublin okay\nYou can't sit there and go I Want you to apply the standards of suburban American uh sensibilities on sportsmanship here now that doesn't mean they should be doing this oh excusing it but this is who you're this is who you're dealing with no well you could get a laugh that guy from Russia or like that or actually I have a crap\n[laughter] looking sweeping the Clark County jail\nLike they don't care oh I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna find you a million dollars I don't give a crap\nI Want to kill him like there is a totally different mentality of all the different athletes it's the most culturally diverse for them in the in maybe on earth of something close I'm you know soccer and different ones but\nEverybody fights this is crime all it's not\nYou know so and you're not getting nobody sits there and goes like I was going to go to med school but I decided to become a U.S see fighter like you can only see fighter almost out a last resort everybody else was bad but you know what I'm good at kicking someone did ask someone to do this\nAnd I'm willing to do this you know I'm really good at mixed martial arts I'm a really good ... I Can't do anything else this is what I can do and now you end up with the two bad guys on the planet and they're just after that we know about the build up to the fight is so politically incorrect\nSo outrageous so offensive so vulgar at times but that's what the sport is like its cage fighting you you pay in a cage friday because you don't want\nTo have all these rules where they're going to be like you can say that's good now again I'm not excusing it and they they they should suspend them Kevin jumping out of the octagon he'll be jumping any doctor but I think\nYour seat bands aren't going to be upset about this not money some of the real hardcore ones that truly love the sport and there are many you know like I kind of a black guy but you know I mean this was what it is so I don't the WWE analogy works it's just\nThis is this is the sport it's it's it's total Louis is the reason you tune in every month you buy the paper view your watches cause you never know what's gonna happen so I've always been a fan you tune that you put your sixty nine dollars down and you're going to get two and a half hours and you're going to get\nSome good fights and it's a matter of fact I'm going to get some comedy let me get some outrageousness you're going to get something you never saw at the end of life here this is a great card cherry on top of the wild well\nAll right so I pay I'm watching it in my house when the brawl happens after the match the USC takes their cameras sky word they don't actually show us what's taking place in the ring and what's taking place courtside are ah you know outside of el Yon\nFair or foul for and I know the U.S sees putting it on\nBut to me that was assigned they obviously did not anticipate this happening it wasn't in any way staged but I think they a hundred percent have to show me the replay they a hundred percent have to show me what's going on instead we don't get any of that should the USCB criticized for not showing people who paid sixty five dollars\nThe full scope 'cause that's what I and when this was happening alive and I tweeted in in real time when I was thinking as this is a major news event now\nI Want to know what's happened after the match and instead they took this camera skyward it didn't show us those of us who are watching on pay per view\nRight yeah I didn't know that um\nYeah I mean they should but they're not you know this is it's like state run media you're not getting um\n[noise] you know they control everything so there's there's fan videos a\nCourtside you're allowed to ... or ah octagon side you're allowed to video but only after a fight southern media was able to do that but there's always solve us in there and you got a bad ankle so kinda got rely on that yeah they should but\nWhat I Would say is I mean I don't I anybody who's still thinks the sport is at all it ever has been fake it just isn't I mean I\nLike that that that ... set of sales Twenty years ago Fifteen Years ago I may just not fake I sat next to that octagon so many times I Know these fighters it's real it's always been real like a fake it it wouldn't be any good like I get people like the cartoon nature WWE and stop but like\nThis was so much better than WWE or is\nThis is the real deal that's why you watch\nAll right so here's the challenge that I Would say\nI watched this fight I don't mind could be to be an entertaining fighter to watch right like in the same way back in the day the great these choking somebody out and getting the the match onto the ground is not a fight that I'm interested in watching very much\nI also don't believe that Conor McGregor can be could be right I just don't believe it I Will probably by the second fight but I assuming they have a rematch of despite but I don't feel like it will end any differently than the first by did that to me is the biggest issue with could be versus McGregor and moreover\nThe bigger issue that the U. S. C. could have with could be going forward is just that his fights are not particularly exciting you've been covering the U. S. C. for a long time do you agree with that take\nAnd would you agree in general that could be has to be a massive favorite against McGregor I just don't see how McGregor winning the fight against him\nHe's almost two to one favor before um there was almost no I could be the only thing is the way he usually attack takes the takedown is not\nThe kind of goes up high and so maybe McGregor is going to able to catch 'em but very few people who knew the sport thought McGregor could win this fight which is really why it was impressive macgregor was world shaking I never thought he fight to be I thought he ... he does it one of the best things about McGregor but\nThat's why the sports real okay you wouldn't you wouldn't take the boring fighter but\nIt could be this is a dollar fighter but that's the sport so it's like you know\nHey man I Want to watch a lot of dunks while you're gonna get Tim Duncan in San Antonio spurs are you know it'd be um that's how the sport works shores steak

out at you the most from an entire day of NFL action Alex\nBlake portals ah I thought it was good and I still think he's good but I you know it just a terrible day and and credit to the chief defense blah blah blah I Know the jak seven issues on their office of line that we're down to their third string left tackle no Leonard for net that that's you know all of the things that contribute to this but\nWhen you were throwing for interceptions losing a form of the way that play portals did no\nWay no he has never had more than three turnovers in a game before this time he goes also down five times being fact and look at it I think now in the next week right New England Kansas City already looking ahead to week six a little bit here but\nThis'll be probably you know we were thinking maybe this'll be the true test of the snow the patriots will be the true test to how good the Kansas City chiefs are and who is the best team in the AFC\n... the second interception I think he threw a was off of his own line men's helmet I mean he threw it into the helmet ... shade into the end zone was picked off by the chiefs\nThat she's the fence that Ben much maligned they play very well ah the rams also got the when there's only two teams which ... which are undefeated there every team has at least one game now\nWhen I look at it how many teams do you actually believe in right now like I bullied beyond a shadow of a doubt that the chiefs and the rams are very good football teams\nI'm not sure how many teams outside of those two I really strongly believe in as hey you know what I think this team is going to be really good maybe you can say the patriots if you're saying that\nYou're saying it entirely based on their history before this season because they really other than the when they put forth against the against the dolphins have not been that great and so I'm curious what you\nHow many teams do you think are really really good before I ask you that get to five and oh teams obviously everybody knows at this point I Would think the rams and the chiefs are the AFC East is a mass everybody is either three and two or two and three the Bengals are foreign one\nI'm not sure that I buy into them at all and in fact bingo fans I Would say you know what\nThis is exactly what we expected when they came out and they got down Seventeen now than they came back and to their credit they won that game but they're four and one there aren't even very many for in one teams in fact they are the only other team with a one off the titans blue their chance to get to foreign one by losing the bill how many teams do you believe in\nI Believe in the rams because they're good at all three levels and you know obviously the defense though has some work to do it in a secondary Seattle dropping bombs left and right and I believe in New England and and I'll tell you why I mean I Know that the Colts game\nWasn't the best performance but you can just tell us and improving team and my my gosh Julian Edelman he comes back all of a sudden this off ants opens up and Josh Gordon makes one play every one is they intend to next Randy Moss was a nice player don't get me wrong but he should get better as a season goes on as long as you can keep his life together off the field but\nI think the patriots figured out some things in their defense as well some ways to minimize some things you got them according brothers were playing great football together Devon and Jason who've been really good in that secondary so I'm bullish on the patriots\nOr you know going into this game against Kansas City NAFTA treats wouldn't next week yeah I mean you know what the shame on me right but I ... I Believe in Kansas City has been five and before we were here last year\nAt the same time and what ended up happening\nYou know it went down the drain I mean ended up going ten and fix for the rest of the season I mean at five and it's something we've seen before in Kansas City and yet it as he goes on their fizzle now they're just going to be different I don't know I mean obviously the defense was encouraging yesterday but\nNot I don't think their world leaders by any means without Eric burying his he always use you know\nRelated to his Achilles tendon who knows when he's coming back to stow their down to their six safety\nThat that's going to come back and hurt this team I think especially gets a team that can pass the ball like New England but how do you believe in the bangles because of their history with the playoff games I think if if Washington wants tonight you feel a little better but that we to stink or against the coastal remains and the safe you know my pre season pick for a Super Bowl team\nThey should be able to get the job done against Washington tonight but do we really trust that defense and I think that's the thing to claim it's a flawed league and the NFL is loving this we have a record now five weeks in a row we've had an overtime game to open the season that's never happened before in lake history\nThey love the fact that everything is so scrunch together because it keeps an entire league watching games because we figure hey we've still got a shot even if we're one in three one and four we still may be there at the end\nYeah and uh and and that is certainly something that uh that they get a lot of attention all for rookie quarterback got to win yesterday uh every single rookie quarterback they gotta win what did you think of the rookie quarterback performances across the league\nWill Baker you know I mean ... to for over three hundred yards away that he did against the Baltimore Ravens defense\nThat had been so stingy and yeah I Know he didn't put a touchdown up on the board and the second half that ravens defense still hasn't given up on\nThe season but but I just I'm so impressed by the way that he has just handle things he just looks like a veteran player right I mean twenty five or forty three three hundred forty two yards one touched down in uh buffalo they they spotted around but Tennessee is just not a ... you know what the titans army look\nCriticism for winning games that they you know that they should have lost on paper but they've been getting by by the hair of their ... and the entire season and this was sort of one of those that I saw coming actually you know I actually have said that on Fox portrayed here so you know that when I it doesn't really shocked me Josh Rosen look he was confident but it wasn't like the the Arizona Cardinals are going\nAnywhere fast I mean look San Francisco had Ninety to please yesterday play Ninety two\nIt was about to get up out of ever of two thousand and Thirteen but they only put up a team point their defense allowed two hundred twenty yards Ted first down they still ended up losing a and Sam Donald you know the thing is that Ravi Anderson\nThis guy could just keep his life together off the field he could become a really a a consistently good difference making type\nWide receiver I mean the guy you know he is a great target for Sam Darnell I mean the fact that you know he caught three passes for a hundred twenty three yards think about this the first hundred yard receiving game for a jets player since December of twenty Fifteen\nYeah wow of course if you Russia three hundred twenty three yards that helps too and that's exactly what the judge said yesterday they there are some problems in Denver and I'm not saying Vance Joseph is going to be the first coach to get fired but if he doesn't fix things up awfully quick\nI think things are really trending in the wrong direction case keen them doesn't look any good I mean really that defense getting gas the way that it does this team doesn't win on the road they lose badly on the road I mean it's amazing to quite how you know we get into teams Denver starts off quick the dolphin start off quick and how quickly things can just fall apart on teams and it's happening really for both franchises right now\n[noise] All right we're talking to Alex ... what did you think of last night's game between the Texans and the and the cowboys I thought the decision not to go for overtime\nBy Jason Garrett I think he was that it is a at the Texans forty one issue if I'm not mistaken and they decide to point and or in overtime when you know you go down you get a field goal you feel like hey we're in a pretty good position here was that an inexcusable decision by Jason Garrett\nYet that was played let me let me ask you let me ask your guest you figure this out so before the last twenty fourth in ones for the Dallas Cowboys how many hid they converted\nI you know what I looked at this up this morning before the show started because I was curious on fourth and one in the NFL I don't know the cowboys in particular\nBut force than one is converted at eight sixty nine point eight percent rate for NFL teams given the cowboys in their strength that often civil on a over the years and the fact that they have is equal Eliot of all people to hand off two plus\nThey got jak Prescott who's a mobile quarterback so even if you decide to throw the ball you roll him out you have a double dynamic option there to run the ball or throw it I Would think it would be at least at the NFL average",
