Devi severe fire or is this like the rock and the ... the French just run away when the Americans forget to\nNo no it was it was a common complaint does bring into books in the first to that at the same complaint twist on that the French what do you come up couldn't come up claims they couldn't come up\nThey always claim they couldn't come up do we know whether they were prevented whether they had bad transportation whether it was colonial troops over the line which has it was\nIt was up in colonial jokes but I just think it could have been a matter of morale it could have been stiffer resistance to them but the Americans might have been more tenacious it's hard to say but it was a constant complaint even with the second division as well so I'm saying\nWell I wondered about the rock and the ... for example this took place in July the Americans just didn't run away and the French ran away the first the Germans ... at the moment Germans guns ... opened up they run away and the Americans were unfamiliar with the idea that you run away when the Germans started shooting\nWell like I say that might have been a morale issue um it's hard to say uh you know they were any way that the story as they were supposed to come up on the Marines left and there was a there was a reached out at the bottom of it\nThis is the editor and hook the essence of it was very well fortified\nMachine guns they the French could not take a Connecticut they finally said to fit a\nRegiment was trailing six regiment to the left and then they they took it than they left and they gave it to French and the Germans we took it so it's just yeah it was a it was a bad thing so basically\nGates and his men are uh it's about a mile at let's say about a mile up the hill and their towards the top of a sort of the top of their their\nPay anything Germans their trenches they're taking it but they're left his exposed and Kate's at one point looked over for about eight hundred German said they're just way he went back and even they they had tanks\nWill do for support with the salt and he called tang silver and basically in the Marines just started blasting away at him and he said that you know that\nThat broke up that politics really well um then they get to the top fifth regiment followed them up basically like you say the kind of like an on an island there left in the years that used to say about the ... and it's night falling and they're just wondering what's\nGonna happen or we're going to have some big German a counterattack is going to force down the hill or what but they survived the morning and then uh the fifth regiment was ordered to attack which they did and then they got caught by that afternoon in front of the village of sent a chant massive German force\nI'm just artillery machine guns could not advance any further and that base that basically became the battle for the next ten days was just ...\nInches of degrees until finally they were able to take to the village of Spanish Chen and then the thirty six division took over\nThere was a lot of action left between October and November eleventh however part of the discovery of cliff Kate is that we're going to leave Nineteen Eighteen\nAnd we're going to travel quickly to August and September Nineteen forty two where are we were on Guadalcanal cliff cage is now a marine\nVeteran he's a colonel commanding on Guadalcanal and the Japanese are sending wave after wave solved teams they're bringing them down the plot the U.S navy as bugged out is left the Marines all by themselves and it reminded me as I got some of those chapters gym\nJust like a ... a just like black mall that capes again and the Marines were left to fight it out of a and surrounded and they survived\nYeah exactly and there was one battle in particular\nI Believe it was about August twenty first battle at the ... river where the Marines had dug in there was a colonel a cheeky brought up a force of about a\nThousand men down the beach towards them and attack them in the middle of the night and actually they killed quite a few Marines but they never broke the line um and then in the morning gates came up to the front to as it was the first marine regiment that he was commanding\nAnd they sent takes in and basically uh pretty much kill that'd be less a Japan Japanese warrior a film that was broken up with us Joe vicious fighting then they moved on\nTo take the risk their portion of the island they're supposed to take an old ... feel he's got things\nOh it tastes week so their battle goes on until Nineteen forty three and chaos at this point is he and his diaries in his letters twenty four years later is he reflective on his ability to survive being surrounded and cut off does he talk about it to do was to Israel to his relatives or friends\nNo you know what he was a very matter of fact I uh yeah I think he would have made a good attorney you wonder blatant light he should've gone back to being an attorney instead of staying with the marine corps I think he was\nAs mine was just it was a guy who is best under action went away and pick up actions when he is the clearest and that's what makes them a great combat leader or a great leader in general um he didn't really reflect it was not a self reflect the person that is bad introspective that I kept I picked up a name was letters but he was happy\nI did up most given what happened in the first World War to keep it casually down at the second World War and of course they had better equipment by then too\nBut he was very mindful of the waste is going on in the first World War and what not to happen uh at Guadalcanal and later although it was more typical path to keep casualties down and he will Jima he did when he quit there too but that was just a bitter bitter fight a one\nDetail that are made me like him he had a friend who went back for supplies I think it was it ... I think it was very early and he never saw him again did they find his body and did they bury it\nOh yeah he was looking for the third battalion right before the assault on ... and a half of them was walking away with a cigarette in his mouth\nAnd they and then he went out looking for the body on the day that the disappears gas attack or they did find his body\nThey did that and that he's buried at at at the at the cemetery their\nFellow I Believe he is I Believe he is very there and where his case Barry\nWell that's a that's appropriate and ... and cases people remembered him until they all left and I wonder if it's not I guess the Marines from God will canal are going now to two wars of veterans remembering case the name as the book is I Will hold\nThe story of United States Marine Corps legend Clifton be came\nFrom ... to victory in the great more on to victory in Guadalcanal on to victory in postwar America James Carl Nelson is the author Jim Nelson I'm John bachelor this is John bachelor show\nThinking about life insurance what if you could make one free phone call and learn your best price for nearly a dozen highly rated price competitive companies well that's exactly what happens when you call select quote life\nFor example Georgia's forty he was getting sky high quotes from other companies because he takes Mets to control his blood pressure but when I shopped around I found him a ten year five hundred thousand dollar policy for under twenty five dollars a month I'm select ... dance to being out and believe me\nYou're select quotas and shopping for your life insurance you're probably paying too much\nFor your free quote called meet hundred five Seventy three Ninety five fifty two ... eight hundred five seven three Ninety five fifty to eight hundred five seven three Ninety five fifty two more going to select quote dot com since Nineteen eighty five we shop you save and\nGet full details on the example policy is liberal to accomplish commercial surprise could vary depending on your helmet human company ...

people the idea that many Machado is doing this to avoid injury is to quote al Michaels farcical\nOr is what it is it's it's comic book like it's\nReally something when you got to go back in an honest Dave Abraham Lincoln the great baseball punted Abraham Lincoln honest Abe the classic quote applies here you can fool\nSome of the people all the time and all the people some of the time but you cannot Manny Machado for all the people all the time\nAnd now I guess he's not trying to fool anybody but the the final word on this there is no way no way that a established team is trying to\nWin can give many Machado a four or five year contract\nAnd you can get\nAny more than ... a basic three or four year contract\nWould be baseball ... now that being said free agency in baseball\nI was I

and and advance so that that tag I I did not think it was that bad I mean I I tend to think that in baseball it's hard for me to even keep up with a written in the unwritten rules and it seems like baseball players are always getting worked up usually it tends to happen in the regular season\nOr more so than the postseason um so I didn't think it was like an egregious behavior by Machado where did you think\nI mean I guess I can see why angular got upset about it when I looked at it it seemed like maybe there was a little bit of baseball and going on there for Machado like I don't know that his foot needed to be where it was in that moment I don't think it was necessarily malicious but I don't think that he made much of an effort\nAt the same time I guess I get like I said I can see the argument on both sides but I tend to think that it was not\nI don't think that that's a dirty play they were ... you know yell at you came out and said he's a dirty player after the game I disagree they're\nCompletely watching it maybe he's a dirty player for other things that he's done but that just seemed rather innocuous to me compared to some of the things that I've seen that have clearly been dirty plays like sliding in\n... and things like that\nIt just it's always interesting to me with baseball how so much of baseball is about like playing the game the right way we don't hear this very much in basketball we don't hear it very much and and and football at all\nUm and uh like these controversies a lot of times I think they ... born out of there is a hundred and sixty two games as you play in the regular season guys are just trying to get themselves psyched up to care about another baseball game so if you can find some form of perceived slight or you can get some form\nOf a little bit of extra motivation in game one twenty two uh that helps you get through the season that makes a little bit more sense to me in the post season this doesn't seem like that big of a a of a story to me\nUm and uh and to me the Machado slide and uh and the fact that he actually had to hustle to win that game after he didn't call himself to audio so it was a was a pretty uh pretty entertaining it ironic in a given that he seems to be the center of a of a baseball storm on a regular basis right now\nYeah no doubt I agree we will ah will bring in the LA crew a little bit later on

talk about this decision by Nick votes or\nTo not go back to Ohio State and rehab his injury I think both are intriguing\nStories that are out there also be talking about and what Jason Martin\nWho's got you for our two and our three what's up for all\nWell and ... it was quite a night for the Boston Red Sox in Houston\nToo long to strike has once again luge orange Springer from any Rodrigues strength in the red Sox games don't want to lead and the American league championship series red\nSox radio with the caller's Boston now moves on the game for and what that two games to one lead meanwhile it was game for Tuesday night in Los Angeles and it went late into the night before ... villagers RBI single in the thirteenth\nGave the Dodgers eight to one wind and time series at two games apiece game number five is going to get started\nIn eleven and a half hours from right now is that ten and a half hours from right now\nAt Dodger Stadium so not much time for any of these players to rest before that when you get started on line car shopping can be confusing not any more would you ... you know the exact price you pay\nFor your next car so it was a true car to enjoy it more confident corner buying experience was also opening night Tuesday in the NBA Golden State when they want to wait one hundred winter over Oklahoma City Russell Westbrook did not suitable for the thunder in that game and Boston be Philadelphia in one of five eighty seven juice and taking them with twenty three point nine rebounds for the Celtics\nAnd as you were hinting at George ... says that he's not coming back to Ohio State\nHe's rehab and prepping for the NFL Draft I Know you've got more of it coming up\nYeah look I appreciate that Ralph I'm\nI think the boats are is making the right decision and I think it's one we're seeing more and more of in college football in general whether it's guys deciding not to play in a bowl game that doesn't really matter I think that's going to become the trend right I mean I understand if you're playing to win a championship you were playing in the playoff games\nBut if you know you're going pro\nI don't know why you would play and what is effectively a glorified exhibition I've been arguing for a while that you should let everybody who's red shirt and all the freshmen that a red shirt and let them come out and play and almost don't even play your average senior in a bowl game\nA because let those guys start to get ready I think they both say he's going to get a lot of criticism I'm sure there are a lot of Ohio State fans who were upset with him\nBut I don't know why you would try to come back at this point and get yourself back into playing shape for Ohio State when you may be the overall number one draft pick depending on who is drafting out there and it's really about making sure that you're in perfect shape in ... in in February\nWhen you go to the combined to kind of put up the numbers that you need to put up and to be fully healthy\nAny doubt from you or ... that Nick boats or is just following in this latest trend of guys who are going to be drafted deciding you know what I'm not going to finish out my college career I Need to get healthy I Need to get well and I appreciate everything that people have done for me at Ohio State he and his brother both had tremendous careers their\nIt certainly would be better for Ohio State if you were going to play but if he's got a serious injury that's going to keep him out for multiple weeks\nI don't know why he would have rushed to come back and try to play the final couple of games of the season if he's not going to be a hundred percent yeah\nHere we completely agree I think that Nichols is making the right decision I think that your point than I thought the same thing it is very similar to Christian McCaffrey or Leonard and for net or any number of these guys who decided look the NFL Draft as is coming up I'm going to be a high drastic\nI Can't risk injury in this situation and when you need both uh\nHe's number one on most experts boards he may not go overall number one just because of some value position or need position for some team but he might be the most talented player in the draft\nIs they use used situation here Ohio State is going to use ... as long as they can to try and win a championship and they both are is on the Ohio State football team in order to get to the NFL just like his father just like his brother for the Los Angeles chargers\nSo you look at it and you say okay well these two guys are these two entities have used each other pretty effectively unfortunately for Ohio State Nicholson doesn't really need this any more so Nick Boles is preparing for his future they're going to be the number one draft pick\nYou get yourself rehab you get yourself right you can't worry about the buckeyes I Know that college football fans live and die by week to week results and everything that's happening within the program but from a logic standpoint\nFrom what would you do standpoint you would do what Nick Boles is doing in his situation I ... I think he's making the perfect move\nWhat is going to be the next step and I don't know when it's going to happen but I bet it's going to happen is going to be when a guy is on a team that makes the college football playoff and he decides to sit out I don't know who's going to do it\nAt but I feel like at some point it's going to happen where the logic is going to be wait a minute\nYou know the regular season is over why would I go play now I don't know who's going to do it and maybe it's going to be a maybe it's going to be something that ah that is held against him and the draft and maybe it's not going to be that common but that's what you're going to see like it's going to be a slow creep towards\nThis idea of look why would I play longer than the regular season and uh and I look I I think in general this goes to my point on the age restrictions being to me a moral issue in the NFL\nIf you're Eighteen or Nineteen years old and you're ready to go pro I think you should be able to go pro making a guy wait around I don't know where Nick boso would have gone if you've been able to come out after last season but I think you would have gone pretty high\nAnd I there have been a lot of those guys in past years who have played even though they were already first round talent and I and you know I don't know if we're ever going to have a guy sit out a full season certainly that discussion came up with today beyond cloudy a but this is a little bit of a creep towards that direction All right here is\nAh another big or id I've got in the NFL I think that ... kill is absolutely insane for deciding that he wants the guy who threw a beer on him to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law\nAnd I think it's insane for this reason because type ... kill is not without saying himself this is crazy to me I don't know who's advising him\nBut here's what happened to ... and uh the end of two thousand and fourteen diary kill was arrested for assaulting his pregnant girlfriend\nThe police report states that his girlfriend said that the two got into an argument he threw her around like a rag doll punched or in the face set on her repeatedly punched her in the stomach where she was pregnant\nAnd choked her Oklahoma State dismissed them from the football team\nHe eventually pled guilty to domestic assault and battery by strangulation\nAnd was sentenced to three years of probation and anger management course a year long batters program and was required to undergo a domestic abuse evaluation or his girlfriend eventually gave birth to a boy\nOr end in September they got engaged All right so I don't know what's going on in his personal life now\nBut if you got off with probation\nFor beating and strangling your girlfriend\nWhat'd you really want to argue that the guy who threw a beer on EU deserves the punishment to the full extent of the law\nI mean this to me is just like major flashing light of hypocrisy and absurdity that nobody in your advisement camp would say diary kill you choked your girlfriend and you beat her while she was pregnant\nMaybe you don't argue that the guy who threw a beer on EU deserves punishment to the fullest extent of the law now I'm not saying the guy who threw the beer doesn't deserve some form of punishment or\nThat we shouldn't have guys like that who have consequences for their actions to I Am saying if you got three years of probation for beating strangling you're pregnant girlfriend\nMaybe saying that you want the guy who threw a beer on you to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law is not the best move\nOn ... behalf but I'm trying to figure out and maybe maybe I'm overreacting here but I'm trying to figure out what happened between Sunday and Monday that change time re kills mood and attitude about this\nUsually your agent says things that you can't say yourself\nSo it could be that ... kill is trying to avoid provoking Andy reads a higher but to me this is where the agent has to tell the player\nWon't do this is a bad look for you and look I'm not saying that there's anything that the guy who threw the beer did not behave in a A N and an inappropriate fashion and I am fine with I think that the patriots sent a letter saying those behavior was inappropriate and they were looking into it\nAnd then he was this invited from future games or something like that law that it's fine yeah I think they said just invited which is which is even funnier like they found out mistaken somebody can pull up that letter and you guys can talk\nAbout an hour I'm Down in a litter of this invite to all future of the Gillette Stadium\nA letter of this invite I loved that concept like you can just tell somebody hey you know what we did invite you from everything for the future [noise]\nUm so uh it's the exact opposite of like an invitation I I don't know what this invitation a but I I Love it sounds very British since I'm In London that sounds like something they would do in Britain there's just invite you from things\nUm but to me if you are ... kill and you have a sin till of self awareness or even better if you have anybody that surrounds you that has a sense of self awareness you cannot insist\nThat the guy who threw a beer it you be punished to the fullest extent of the law while you got three years of probation for beating and strangling you're pregnant girlfriend\nLike I'm not saying the guy who threw the beer is in the right I'm not saying that he didn't do anything wrong I'm saying that maybe if you're tired and kill\nYou don't want to be the guy who's saying you know what if somebody misbehaves they need to be punished to the fullest extent of the law when if what you did was on video you would never have been allowed to play in the NFL you there's this zero percent chance they tie re kill is enjoyable and fought as he has to watch on the football field\nWould have ever been allowed to play in the NFL if he were on video doing to his pregnant or pregnant girlfriend\nWhat ah what Ray Rice did to his fiance zero percent chance now we can even agree or disagree about whether that's appropriate I actually think and I've said this for a long time that Ray Rice deserved to be able to come back into the NFL\nNot because I think he's a sane but just because my standard for whether or not you should be able to play in the NFL\nIs do your problem the your talents exceed your problems and I guess the answer is for Ray Rice they did not but I tend to think that it for a Rice's video never goes public\nIf TMZ never gets it he plays in another couple of years in the NFL I don't think you would have had a pro bowl season I don't think he would have been the difference between the Baltimore Ravens being a being a a Superbowl caliber team or not but I Do think he would've been able to play for another couple of years\nIs there any doubt huge a mark that if ... kill pled guilty to and got probation for was on video that he never would have gotten drafted or played in the NFL\nYeah because no one would've known what he was gay but even that because we didn't know about him until he got to the chiefs I mean look at Joe mix and and what he's been able to do for Cincinnati and you just opposed that with Ray Rice and the very same division Ray Rice was on the decline so it was easy to keep them out a lowly\nJob mixing the young upstart Oklahoma looks the other way so does the Bengals and they draft him but yeah I think time regional nobody we didn't know about him in college at all so no I don't think you would ever gotten the shot\nA point here before we go to break the finish off our one and Jay more will have this going forward the guy who's now signed the biggest contract he's canal oh a and he signed

they want to ... but it man it's it's only like come on\nYeah I I first guest this one I mean I I ... I was done by the people said he wasn't done he appears to be done the problem for the giants is and this is what I said yesterday and this is what I said in the first hour\nThey took sake one steak once a heck of a player but the giants couldn't afford to take sick one no because they don't have their quarterback situation right and they could apps and Arnold right now they could have Josh Rosen right now they could have any number of guys with the exception I guess of Baker Mayfield says the browns took him at one\nThey could have gone ahead and gotten their quarterback for the future because they don't have a quarterback for the future in fact what we found out Jeff is they don't have a quarterback for the president which means one in five is going to get a lot worse to take it from Scott Frost\nBefore it can get any better it's just going to be a dreadful season for the giants were gonna see say corn show flashes of why you might be the most talented guy that came out of that draft\nBut unfortunately for sake one he's not going to be in a position to win you football games right even if you give them a lot of is the court if you don't have a quarterback in the NFL you you just can't win\n[noise] no you can't and it's interesting as it's sometimes it seems kind of luck into to getting guys right um you know the Packers are wanting to get it Rogers you should never fall on the twenty three\nUm you know the coals loose Peyton Manning for a year and they happen to be the worst team ever and they get in July ... teams just kind of like into this to join the not the niners you'll from Joe Montana Steve Young you'll you'll do go from hall of famer hall of famer the giants\nSome my lucky to Justin Herbert this year the quarterback from Oregon you think he's that good yes he's the until he ... he is a monster bow he is he's in this movie comes out he's six four to ... I saw him in packs old media day [noise]\nUm and he looked at me in the eye or he's six sects he's two forty he's got a cannon and here's the thing about him\nThat's what people are going to say is the old Oregon and\nIt's a it's a college but often it's not as a pro style office they run some college run games games but they punch you in the mouth and Herbert stands that pocket he stands tall he is he is the best quarterback by far um she might even be better\nSuited at least talent wise than all the quarterbacks were drafted this season or the maturity is going to be an issue of hinders people talking about you know ... very soft spoken um and ah\nThat's that's part of the issue maybe with him and he might stay year he might stay here for many reasons one is Oregon is horrible [laughter]\nI Know people don't want to admit this organ hum\nIs close to a playoff team I'm surprised I didn't think they were they were going to be ... this year um but they had been Stamford which they should've been staffer there in the play off if they went out obviously\nThey could they could even be an out twelve and one but next year they return almost everyone ... Jason from that team almost everyone I think an office they don't have one senior who starting right now [noise]\nUm they have the best off into line in the country right now probably top three off it's alive they're playing really well Herbert my comebacks he might not even come out his brother is is going to be organ next year as well and\nHe's from Oregon he's from Eugene from two miles away so he might not leave but if he does giants might might walk into a quarterback in mostly because\nThe teams that are worse than the giants raiders cardinals\nCoals culture when it farther off it worse but these teams that are that are quote worse my record\nQuarterbacks race which I can be four or five and nine or ... and not needed and those guys don't you know you you worry about someone jumping up and taking a quarterback right but there's not much teams right now if you look in the NFL these think to yourself are in desperate need of a quarterback most teams have a young quarterback\nThat the you know that that that that they're working through or they have their franchise quarterback I'm trying to think of the top of my head I mean how many teams would you say like man that team really needs a new quarterback Denver\nI look at Miami yeah the Broncos they called me a giants fan earlier I'm actually Broncos I Am but yes case keen them still has money that he has to be paid next year so that's going to be a bit of a problem I think\nThey should have gone and gotten somebody this past draft but I Would be fine if they leverage whatever they needed to leverage to go up and try to get adjusted Harvard because clearly they don't have a quarterback for the future they have a guy that can get your by for a little while it's not like case kingdoms of terrible football player\nBut you don't ever look at him and say well he's your franchise quarterback he's not he's got a two year contract right I don't know exactly what John I always thought process was\nOn what are you expecting case came to be but unfortunately that mistake might actually be the thing that they cost a guy goes for half a decade\nRight and they're able to do I think and John Elway was actually in Eugene a scout Herbert this week and he left early who's left the game or something for a minute I've seen I see I see what I had the ... will have to see 'em and he's out so yeah the Broncos could train up either way you know your your Broncos guy does it get to get the heat he should for building that roster the way no\nNo not at all I mean he does for me I've I've mentioned on my show here in Nashville I mean he he should get some for you to have a terrible he's done a terrible job\nHire the coach that's not that doesn't seem fit for the job um and that's on John Elway\nUm Peyton Manning kind of saved his bacon they'd never be able to draft and develop a quarterback and even a year the bigger the bigger the a Peyton Manning won a suitable for for the Broncos they weren't he wasn't very good book also either basically replaced and it was it was playing in a better I better than he was and they play one because of\nThe defense we we all know that they want ... the move that that guy was they I mean they got von Miller and they got a guy that was ... about it\nTo the draft von Miller though\nI don't think so I remember I was doing a stat actually on this show when you and I were filling in where John Elway had not drafted a single guy that became an old pro or no one that had reached approachable or become first or second team NFL since he got there\nWhich is pretty amazing and that was before obviously this past season so it's just not been a good thing and of course he hadn't been able to find a quarterback Paxton Lynch was a huge bust\nBut just not even that Garrett bowls address to Utah where I've tackled has not play I'm all he he he holds he tackles guys every game both holding penalties in the NFL last year and he's we'd be unpaid this year I'm In your life\nSo I I I don't know if all the way we'll ever get the blame he deserves\nFor the situation I think they go down by the way we can discuss tomorrow night tomorrow I didn't lose Arizona Morrow night so I think those are the\nAre they losing out I mean he's we I have a radio the other night a voting we talked to him he was on our show 'em on Monday afternoon he he understands words teams at right now and he's not he's not shying away from it but\nThey've allowed over two hundred yards rushing the last two weeks and um and the you're the one common denominator by the way it's really it's kind of an odd things between Denver defense pointing poorly in Jacksonville defense playing poorly last week\nThey both have played a really bad timing off games against the chiefs\nYeah that's right I mean what you heard um are you when you play against the chiefs and you're tired\nAs a result especially the defense hired chase around diary kill and cream pot and dealing with that in the homes and all those weapons and trying to tackle Kelsey like they were beat up and they had a short week and then they came back out\nWho to who was the second plane hit the second best player on the Broncos think about that as we take our break we'll come back and we will continue to discuss this and break it down we will talk about the diary kill situation\nAs well as other things happening Libby on bell and whatever the drama is continuing in Pittsburgh will discuss that as well but before we can get all that let me tell you if you've ever

I mean is that really what it is\nI mean I guess I mean I get like a it's an saying they ...\nThey like he basically said that we don't throw the ball down the road which we don't he said that he lives not very ... very plain where or now which is not what what's the sending that he went on ESPN with with little weight and said it\nI mean right I mean I guess I guess that's the problem is he is as you were having to that yeah I mean I I agree\nI don't think there's a situation necessarily either oh Dell is getting a lot of press because he's a Dell and because of the way that the comments went down there in the context in which they were made with with wavy and write on ESPN and\nJust so are you going on in life I call it easy like your boys fantastically our boys on order five million in ... it's\nA it's I Will tell you this though this is a positive for the NFL as a whole is the things we're talking about now are things that are happening on the field\nA little bit off the field that I think about things that happened on the field and that's partly why ratings are back everything's back up and everything kind of back on track now ... that we're we we don't talk about the rest very often anymore even though the rough in the past or penalties still getting called but it's not to be called as much as\nThe helmet rule they threw out um and it's been a couple of extra but those are like textbook projections right you like yeah that's not that's not allowed any more you ... you know you're you're not playing any more today um you know we saw it on Cam Newton I mean there's a textbook right\nUm and we're talking about things that are happening on the field early in the locker room not anything else I think it's fabulous for the league there's no more distractions nothing you know Russia Adele by the way has gone into hiding where where's ... even talking anymore to anyone um it's probably only going you heard him\nSay in weeks is what he said about Paul Allen when they put that stay\nOut at all I Want to ask ... radio for that uh he seems like a bull loved owner if you if you listen to everything that he that was said by anyone and he used to invite his employees out to to play basketball as a as a um [noise] there's little island a law I wouldn't get away house every Monday Night or Tuesday night all employ all his employees\nHe his company uh started ESPN dot com so way back\nBack when when the company was starting up ... points out to play basketball with him on every there was every Monday or Tuesday night and we had ... spelled with all my show my packed Walsh show and he was part of the early group but how can watch ESPN dot com and he said man it was it was awesome he's just treat us like you know why he was not\nThere was one of us when he's currently not obviously\nRight when you read about a number a lot of real positive things a couple a longer form articles that I read a bit of well we're going to check out a poll allowing a we've got Lorenzo in Atlanta will take his phone call but ah we've got to get to ... but before we get to Ralph and get an update on sports it's never a good look\nWhen you're on TALK of long bulky dress shirt that is why on TALK it makes church specifically designed to be worn on TALK good on talking dot com to see the new fall arrivals on TALK dot com your solution to perfecting casual use the promo code clay\nC.

seven auto you only hard part figuring out which way is easier\nDo you realize that lay down bell can get no more money right now like this little literally the Steelers cannot give more money like the the the legit like if they went to invest and we will give you one hundred billion dollars they could they could he could not accept that deal\nI Know that I'm so so\nSo there's no so he's holding out to get ready for next season which is fine that is right to do right he's not he's not he's not screwing the Steelers by holding out there give me the production from James Carter like there's nothing he's not oh yeah moving up he's up proving a point to the Steelers\nHe actually lost because production so my point is that he told the Steelers he'd be there they went out and look to see was off into line\nTold everyone he'd be their Wednesday or week one they went out of their way to tell everyone look guys he'll be here he told us he's going to be here and then he didn't show up he Nord all their phone calls in our own text messages and they're pissed about it\nOh well that that's why that's why this down this way\nRight but you didn't say anything to personally if that was not their business to share that with Libya milk and by these teams hey don't worry guys I got you I Love you I'm going to be there for you\nBut he wasn't doing Buddy Guy because they messed it up and they open their mouth ...\nOkay here in in regards to your first point that they can't give them any more money when they had the opportunity to pay him twice\nThey didn't he doesn't care about screen them this doesn't matter if they live don't matter to him at this point it cares about late you know what you because they screwed him twice then it's open for him and I would have done the exact same thing and I I have a whole ... co workers that work with me that we at the same with me on the same thing\nI I have a question ...\nWhat what is what do you mean by screwing liaison bell 'cause you know teams are allowed to offer what they feel your value is and we don't actually know what the deal was to actually offered maybe on bell I've heard reports of you've got thirty million guaranteed where he was going to get the same contractor basically almost like a little more than David Johnson got but what what what is\nThey just didn't offer him a contract right they were fourteen and a half million dollars is you're guaranteed um maybe once a long term contracts that they value them so I'm a player I'm a former player I I ... on the side of the players but I don't see where like you got screwed by the Steelers they just didn't want to give him a long term contract the franchise is terrible\nBut that's part of the CBS negotiate that out the CPA next to you know twenty twenty because it's not it's not fair to the players but that's that's what we're in right now I just don't feel he was screwed they're offering and he would have made thirty million guaranteed over two years for running back\nIn the case if you don't make thirty million ... million guaranteed over two years I feel better about it but the report that I said he was only going to make some ... million\nDollar no I'm Talking about oh I'm Talking about ah twenty Seventeen and twenty teens combined within thirty million over two years with a franchise tells\nMe that I\nSee the the money was already got we have to worry about for one right and that's all ... those feelings don't care about this last year he showed up and you have to have to carry into something you don't care about a year before and neither should he care about the year before it's this point going forward\n[noise] All right thanks Lorenzo fish that phone call not exactly sure the point he was trying to make\nThis is Aaron towards the end of the students often so I'm\nNot really on them I mean basically living on bill didn't live up to his word to them\nThey were expecting him to be there because he said just as in Lorenzo talk our phone caller there I got you I'm going to be there for you\nHe didn't have them and he was not there for them like everything that he told them turned out not to be true and regardless look he didn't just hold out from the Steelers guys in suits\nHe held out from talking to anybody on the football team\nAbout what was going on he was misrepresenting everything he said and then he just climbed up and said nothing yeah that's the problem I mean what do you expect the old line to do just sit there and grin and bear that and act like it's great I Know it's beyond bill's business I get that\nBut he sort of involved the rest of the team and then just cut them out of the loop completely\nSo I don't know what choice they are they honestly had\nTo be truthful about it so that was the windows

I Know is ... mental All right\nWell I think what happens is and I've talked to some Dodger friends of mine that that are more than ... is I think it's tough for him with his back because it's back is not very good it has you know issues it's just I think it gets tired in the in the way they are part of the\n... hurricane jerky delivery\nYeah and his and his ball comes if you watch it maybe tonight we can see if he makes it that long to seventh or eighth inning is his pitch has become a lot flatter especially has to slider and his car ball and ended up that ends up being a problem more than anything else I think is it just as back it's tiring his pitches just quite aren't the same\nIt's not only it's a mental thing I think it's a physical thing he just gets tired um\nBut each kid the past like I I don't\nI don't think it gets a pass because prices been worse than him and post season play and they don't really matter of yeah but people don't talk people seem to ignore that in ... well ... more more so than Clinton\nI just do that I saw a guy who writes who writes a blog for the San Francisco giants right opposed offending ... after a game too and I was like um are you sure you want to go that direction game too was kind of roughly the cancers interference which is\nVery odd right you don't catch interference rarely happens [noise] um and what not but I'm excited to watch tonight because it's going to be on late I might not what's terribly much of it but um I Want to see her saw\nWay down into the Dodgers game starts ... what's the early ... weird I was saying that declaring war now why are they going to shape you'd wants the required or to read or learned early game today\nBecause the ... the red Sox and uh as long as long time yeah yeah yeah they gave the Astros a primetime game today 'cause Bergman was crying [laughter]\nBergman it's like a heel now isn't it he's he's turned he'll\nYeah every day every day when I come in Roberto is mumbling under his breath in in telling me how much she hates pregnant fragments like his new enemy number one he was a\nMember of he's a member of the tribe to get him too much\n[laughter] that I Would try when you're talking about a Jewish okay alright gotcha oh ... that's\nWhere you're going I thought you might have been ... in Oregon or something like that I don't\nRemember the ... by ... you know I Gotcha I Gotcha he told me ...\nAll right let's take this phone call since he's\nBeen waiting and then we'll get to our break we'll come back and we will play clay and me talking about ... from the first hour then will bring in Jeff and have a\nHis thoughts on it let's go to James in Georgia because he wants to talk about ... knots or we're going to get back to it after this James\n[laughter] hey I got good\nOh a comment about the way [laughter] so it's not that I work during the day I Want to be a party for the long term in a while you have thoughts\nOn on the body in a way I Want him back when they land they drive down in their own you mean by them\nAnd the oil company any\nParamount all about the be all end up being like yo la is dying of big money what was the only thing that hey you can't involve um other than the ana\nAbout him not telling him make out I'm quite sure if they don't want to say hey he ... he was our organization but all they do that when they go for it that way God\nI mean there's what about Iraq and I'm not sure all of the new host of why he was cool with it was bad enough it this way it was called [laughter] go now to talk about you\nKnow not letting them know where you know already they almost going on with him I mean nobody like someone who is about what I was looking all what he was like\nReally really heal\nAnd created the phone call and whoever's in the background that turn your radio or whatever that was I don't even have a radio or what that well yeah it was even listening to our network I did not like our show\nRight if so then they were on a Seventeen minute delay\n[laughter] yeah\nYeah that was it was definitely strange I mean what he was saying I guess there's understand some of what he's\nSaying but not all of it again\nBecause what he was saying about the uh the teammates understanding his position and knowing what was going on is living on bell doesn't tell them I'm going to\nBe here you know that I'm going to be here before week one don't worry about it I got you didn't didn't they would have probably understood where he was coming from the problem was he came out and basically reassured them he was going to be there and\nThen he didn't show up and then he didn't talk to them about it after the fact that's where the issue comes in\nI said what I Want to say on this man I mean people are going to say with ... they're going to keep refusing what I said I mean he said the exact opposite everything I've said 'em and they couldn't believe what I Want to believe I I I Can't say enough um [noise]\nThe the players have supported maybe on bell they want him to get paid\nThe students don't have don't don't have to pay the on bell they don't have to do it we saw we see with James Connery they're getting the same production they'll probably drop the running back in two years at the same production again you don't have to pay levy on bell but not screwing him the franchise tack of screwing him but that's not really\nOn the Steve with us on our CPA it's on our union for allowing them to have 'em\nAnd of course they're going to give them your by the way I Love the guy's a thousand carries he touches the public for maybe four hundred times a year thousands have been much um [noise]\nBut ah yeah well he he does he says the wear and tear on his body I understand the purpose of him holding out um for him personally and I understand that side of it and I got one of the Steelers off its allies have said he's not there I can both things can be true it could be true that are living on bells doing what's right for him and it also piss off his teammates those can both be true\nYeah it's a business decision but it also sucks for us meaning if you're on the Steelers all kinds of line this is what we were hoping for so we're a little perturbed about it so yeah I I Know exactly what you're saying when we come back on or the other side of this break\nClay was with me in the first hour he's over in London He's going to see the titans chargers game on Sunday there we talked about salary kill saying that well drew Rosen out as his agent saying that he wants to prosecute the fan the tossed an alcoholic beverage on him late in the Sunday Night Football game and the loss\nAgainst New England patriots and Fox where we will play\nThat segment for you coming up then we'll bringing Jeff and get his take\nOn what's been going on as well but before we can get any of that or mind or the fall football tour brought to you by Granger count on Granger to draw up a winning play visit Granger dot com for industrial supplies and safety products to help your business cross the goal line Granger for those who get it done more optic next year on Fox Sports radio\nWhat'd you really want to argue that the guy who grew up here on EU deserves the punishment to the full extent of the law\nAll right let me back up from one one second because when I was looking into the story I saw something very odd about it and that was that after the game tirade kill was asked about it\nAnd he said hey I talked to and you read after the play here's the quote according to Boston dot com my coach told me don't get emotional don't get mad about it because it comes with the territory and then he said I'm not mad at all and then the next day\nOn ESPN drew Rosen house sells Adam shift or that type of behaviors unacceptable players have to be protected this was a safety issue quote we want that than to be prosecuted unquote\nSo there's a disconnect year something happen between Sunday and Monday to wear drew Rosen house came out and said basically the opposite because ... said tons of what I Would have said if I were diary kill which is yeah I'm not really mad\nLike okay go the territory we're in a hostile environment this was ... catching a pass getting to the end zone getting within an extra point of a tie score with three minutes left in the fourth quarter\nIn a gigantic football game in front of a national audience they took some middle fingers he took the double birds and he takes the flying beverage to the face\nAs he goes out the back of the end and he says I'm not mad at all Sunday night\nAnd then on Monday drew roads now still ESPN we want that to be prosecuted and if you read in the story he's pursuing legal options with the union and all of these things that ... can tell his agent to shut up so he may still be talking\nOn ... behalf but I'm trying to figure out maybe I'm overreacting here but I'm trying to figure out what happened between Sunday and Monday that change diary kills mood and attitude about this\nUsually your agent says things that you can't say yourself so it could be that ... kill is trying to avoid provoking Andy reads a higher\nBut to me this is where the agent has to tell the player\nWon't do this is a bad look for you and look I'm not saying that there's anything that the guy who threw the beer did not have in a A N and an inappropriate fashion and I am fine with I think that the patriots sent a letter saying those behavior was inappropriate and they were looking into it\nAnd then he was this invited from future games or something like that all that it's fine yeah I think they said just invited which is which is even funnier like they found out mistaken somebody can pull up that letter and you guys get time on our acted\nOn it and yeah litter of this invite to all future of the Gillette Stadium\nA letter of this invite I Love that concept like you can just tell somebody hey you know what we did invite you from everything for the future\nUm so uh it's the exact opposite of like an invitation I I don't know what this invitation a but I I Love it sounds very British since I'm In London that sounds like something they would do in Britain is different value from things\nBut to me if you are ... kill and you have a sense of self awareness or even better if you have anybody that surrounds you that has a sense of self awareness\nYou cannot insist that the guy who threw a beer it you be punished to the fullest extent of the law while you got three years of probation for beating and strangling you're pregnant girlfriend\nLike I'm not saying the guy who threw the beer is in the right I'm not saying that he didn't do anything wrong I'm saying that maybe if you're ... kill you don't want to be the guy who's saying\nYou know what if somebody misbehaves they need to be punished to the fullest extent of the law when it what you did was on video you would never have been allowed to play in the NFL\nThat was clay and me talking from the first hour about the diary kill situation I Want to get just thoughts on it but let's go ahead and bring in Ralph urban now and go and get these sports
