keeps his a job and he did actually address gene as Winston in the second half no one was watching the second half\nThe rating for the second half of that game was zero point zero point zero point zero point zero point zero but no one even the people soldier field that stayed were only there to drink beer they were not there to watch the game they had even turn their backs but here's Dirk cutter on gene is Winston come in and then the second half\nTowards the end of that if I told the coaches that that we're going to switch to switch to a gym as a I talked to Jamieson fits both are in the locker room and a half times you know a chance to a gym is some some real football and we put ... in a terrible situation today\nAnd I told him that I told him that right on the ban in\nAnd we put them in a bad situation and uh I mean I knew him as we'd go in and give us and we can get an Indian\nYes everything has Jamieson wants to put up a Seventy four quarterback reading in the second half of that game very impressive the two others are buttons on the touched down there for Mr Winston who's back as the starting quarterback in Tampa Bay are so we've established that cutters on the hot seat\nTamper was bad in every area and well he certainly is hanging on by a thread the more realistic move here for the buccaneers would be to dump their defensive coordinator Mike Smith\nThat that's the guy you you Mike Smith tossed him to the side you've got to buy a week do you\nSmith your fall guy human sacrifice for the third rate defensive performance by Tampa Bay the the Chicago Bears could have scores I said Seventy plus points if that had been their motivation if that had been their goal they would have scored Seventy plus points so you look at what ... ...\nIt's not in the offing solve those points that the officers put up but Tampa Bay here we are they paused they've got the by week coming up the Tampa Bay buccaneers defense has given up\nForty points Twenty one points thirty points in forty eight points in four weeks those are the point titles they've allied look good game was Twenty one but that was only against Philadelphia and that was Nick falls the backup quarterback\nIt was just horrific is what it is so if you wanna get rid of somebody if you're not going to get rid of cutter you get rid of Mike Smith\nMe defensive coordinator right now every team in the NFL is mopping the floor with the buccaneers defects is what they're doing now the ... the final word he's the buccaneers will now go back to the gym is one soon as I said\nAnd we await the other shoe to drop he can be bullied are rated\nAfter the by week against Atlanta that game is at a the falcons home stadium there\nThe Mercedes Benz with whatever's super then wherever they call that now the new stadium in Atlanta so Winston is back after the ...\nAnd he's going to be the quarterback outside of injured reserve it's famous genius Winston and his opportunity\nAnd it doesn't really matter at this point because you got this the schedule after the by we Atlantic Cleveland Cincinnati in Carolina so bunch of divisional games mixed in the buccaneers are going to be circling the drain those two wins at the start of the year we're nice\nBack to reality bill for Tampa Bay we are back to ... million dollars\nLead to this [noise] Garcia [noise]\nHow quickly the fits magic disappeared\nIt's tragic fits horrible\nYeah a up people are asking for more Steeler talk because they like they actually want me to talk more about the ravens because they like it's uncomfortable for you to talk about the Steelers eddy they want me to get back to that\nYou saw will give them what the people why it doesn't bother me one\nBit your opinion of the Pittsburgh Steelers performance city against the uh the the visual part of their the regional rivalry with Baltimore your thoughts as\nA first of all I Know this is happening every game so far this year the head off too horrific starts they can't start a game not the word damn not I don't know what they're going to come in\nThey actually offensively were much better in the first half as opposed to the\nSecond I but I still fell behind fourteen to nothing though I'm Talking about you know on the scoreboard getting harder to regroup head of the\nFifty yards they had passing the second half that was actually good\nWell that's not single hell of a lot I mean they they did come back to tie the game you thought at that point it's going to be a battlefield goals which isn't good because\nBaltimore's got the best kicker in the league but I was there was a obviously very disappointing uh you know I Know the difference is bad but you would hope that as they've done over the last few years most of the time out score of the teams\nClearly they misled the bell more than we all want to admit a Steeler fans but it's obviously to how many tackles would living on bill have none but then there is no doubt he would help to often they score no point to the second half that they they can't win scoring ... points and a half so that he is\nOkay but then the defense allowed and when we talk about the drives the the ravens had these long methodical drives of ten plus plays they three drives and the second half and the Steelers defense just allowed that to happen how's living on bill ... help that\nHe doesn't help that but he helps the audience obviously that like I said they haven't had a good defense for a while\nIt's been out scoring opponents and then getting teams it predictable passing situations and then having those villages and getting facts get to get to the court about ready to see a lot of listening to you see a lot of listening for the you know I sat down and the first hour they were doing the same thing every time and it wasn't working and they just kept doing the same ...\nThe word is underwhelming is that the proper word I think underwhelming would be the\n... would you like to change that I Know I like it was good at you I Can't push back against that much okay good yeah I mean if you're a ... he\nHe wants to buy I only have to know you want it to a major injury I don't want it back really but they could we miss him I mean so desperate times call for desperate measures that in your\nThis this is the ... if he does go back which isn't going to win so was that we can learn\nYeah he's got a deadline these days even going to really another month is even going to play hard it's going to James Harrison yeah so I Know you should just come back practice\nAnd and and after what happened a play yeah after what happened to our Thomas [laughter] I'm sure he's even more motivated not to come back or even play hard so I I mean look this ... the way things are going right now it's not going to matter if he comes back in place so is this\nNot non playoff team you read and I say they don't you think that's the obvious call I mean we only have to win these next two if they thought they they they won this game last night that they would be ... but it's the thing about it if they're one\nIn four one foreign one at the by doesn't someone get fired not maybe not Tom I don't think Tom and gets five but one of the coordinators gets whacked\nYou know they flip a coin on which one they both neither one of them look very good I guess you'd have to go with the with Bartlett offensive\nQuite yeah 'cause they just changed the often supported me I think that's going to help I don't know but it or you know the peace some people as oh try we're ... we're not happy were not happy well trust me they're not happy in Pittsburgh right now that's obvious but what about them read it on a staff\nAre given a gift [noise]\nIf John grew in the rain that if John group that any balls you say I don't want that when I Want to win straight up I don't want to be given a when he was buried square big Ben bears NFL Replay official gets a game ball from John ...\nHe does so I wouldn't be that would be a lot of room with ...\nWho said heard grants and every player gets a gay boy yes in one of New York whoever the replay official was where to go it's ridiculous you know deep down here this is what a deep dark place the raiders or in Roberta that you are enjoying a win on a gift on a gift from the replay\nI don't know what you're talking about men they overturned the call and it was the right call the greatness of the raiders\nOr it is the best show on Fox eight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox age seven seven nine nine six six three six nine so we mentioned earlier you you have a the coach in Indianapolis who's getting roasted rightfully so\nA coach Reich because they decided to go for it when they could have pointed in tied the game is that they gave the game\nTo

sideline\nSince the middle finger in their direction because they would not sign him to a long term extension you would expect that this is a at least ...\nA a injury that he can fully recover from and that are all Thomas will be an unrestricted free agent uh you don't think that they're going to ... franchise tag him\nAnd that he will be able to sign with someone else this is why he held out because he wanted a ... a a a substantial money a commitment there\nThose are what I think are the biggest stories from the NFL I Believe we should have that audio now of the ... and the falcons touchdown play if you didn't see this highlight this is how it ended in Atlanta [laughter]\n\n[laughter] that clock is winding down but if we stop what five seconds to go to\nMexico and jumped on top in celebration of Joe mixing\nThat is a big goes radio network those are all the reactions from the NFL a week for certainly we will continue to unpack all of the story lines I think it's interesting at this point in time to say okay where would we be and obviously we still have one game left with Kansas City going up against Denver\nBut where would we be right now a quarter of the way through the season who would be your playoff teams I Know it's early but twenty five percent of the NFL season has done here's what that would look like in terms of division leaders\nThe Miami Dolphins even though they got their ... by the New England patriots this weekend would be your number one a division winner\nIn the AFC East in the AFC North\nTo you'd have the Cincinnati Bengals winning the tie break over the Baltimore Ravens by virtue of their head to head when in the AFC South you'd have the Tennessee Titans as the AFC South division winners by virtue of their head to head when over the Jacksonville Jaguars who had the same record\nWe'll see what would happen tonight's game and the AFC West whoever wins tonight's game and the AFC West whether it's the chiefs or the Broncos will be in position to to have control of that division with four weeks in\nThe Washington Redskins are I Believe on by this week if I'm not mistaken or they are sitting at two in one and that would put them at the top of the NFC East\nSo even though there just to a new one you've got Dallas Cowboys and the Philadelphia Eagles both sitting at two in to the Giants' even though they're one and three not that far out that division probably going to be messy all year in the NFC North I should have mentioned this game as well sorry that I did not to Chicago Bears\nMixture ... touchdown passes\nAnd they dominated the Tampa Bay buccaneers leading dirt cut her to say that everybody on the team\nShould be fired fits magic goes up in flames they bring in James Winston he throws to touch that in it a touchdown pass but two interceptions as well\nIn a thorough beat down there ah and ah so that just cargo bears would win the NFC North of the season we're coming to a close right now in the NFC South Carolina Panthers or on a by so the NFC South would be the New Orleans saints would have that division at three in one\nAnd you're only remaining undefeated team that is currently for and oh\nThe rams

Massie a messy overtime for sure now I don't think it's game is gonna really matter that much in the grand scheme of things because I don't think either team\nIs really going to be very good or content for a playoff spot this year and it's more about trying to figure out canned their car get back to the uh the status that he was with\nBefore he broke his leg can Baker Mayfield prove that he is going to be the browns quarterback of the future\nI don't know they certainly will get an answer to either of those questions this\nYear but as a result of some interesting decision making a down the stretch by the officials the Oakland\nRaiders are now a left behind the Arizona Cardinals as the only one list team a left in the NFL uh you just heard Roberto or they're in the background was it the right call ... ... [noise]\nUh what else stood out you guys I mean the raiders and the browns game obviously was a was one that went into overtime didn't end until I think after like eight eastern or that game extended on and on and on one of their game stood out to you Justin Cooper other than that one which really doesn't matter that much\nWell I I thought that the dolphins were a lot better than they look on a on Sunday\nI I don't know if it's you know the patriots finally waking up or if you know they got up for a uh divisional game I did I just you know I thought it would be close because it's uh divisional rivalry but pictures just dumped on them and I\nI don't I'm not ready to reclaim old you know they're back Tom Brady is back patriots are back but I mean they ... they embarrassed them\nThe two worst performances I think it's fair to say in the NFL this weekend were\nUndoubtedly the Tampa Bay buccaneers because I think turkey cutter is now got a messy situation for himself I guess he's going to go back to James Winston now\nI I don't really know but it's amazing how quickly we can go from fits magic and even earlier this week on Monday the Tampa Bay buccaneers take control get the ball back with three and a half minutes to play if you remember a day or two into and they have a chance to drive down anti the game or potentially when it\nAnd they get a three it out they never get the ball back and as a result they fall to two and one and then we'll just completely came off against the bears\nAnd meanwhile the Miami Dolphins looks great through three weeks and they went on the road with a chance to submit that start to get to for no and send a message to everyone hey were legitimate contenders in the AFC East\nAnd they totally fell apart everything went wrong um Eddie Garcia what have you got for me what stood out to use the most for the weekend in the NFL and college football\nWell I think what's that out to me the most of the NFL were the two games I circled as my games to watch neither one of more very good and I was the patriots dolphins and the Steelers ravens a but there were a lot of interest\nDidn't finishes especially in those early games\nYou add obviously titans and eagles go overtime Bengals when on the last second touchdown cowboys went on a field goal as time expires and the texture the colds go over time with the interesting are caused by Frank right in that when\nBrown's readers go overtime Ziosk Italy will win so none of those matchups really blew me away but yet there were a lot of intriguing those games and a lot of very\nFundamental issues I think in college football obviously Ohio State Penn State was a great game I agree with you I pinch they gave that getting way but I think a Notre Dame winning in convincing bashing at home again Stanford or that they really are kind of established themselves\nAs a team I think that I mean there's still got a couple of you know decent games ahead but that was a huge win for Notre Dame I bought\nYet Notre Dame has to go on the road now against Virginia Tech and there around five point favorite\nIf they win that game than they should be substantial maybe even double digit favorites in almost every game that remains of the rest of their season I don't want fighting Irish fans to lose their minds and go insane here but I think it's a legitimately a valid thought at this point in time for Notre Dame to believe hey\nIf we go twelve and ... were a hundred percent in the college football playoff they don't have to worry about playing ... title game they basically are the equivalent of a team a you know a golfer who gets into the clubhouse in posts a score twelve a Notre Dame is going to be in the college football playoff I Believe\nAnd so you can look at the schedule now and say if you're a Notre Dame fan hey we get Virginia Tech this weekend world legitimate contender a at a you're a big uh I Believe Pittsburgh Steeler fan yeah how nervous are you now about what's going on the dynamic that exist with the with the Pittsburgh Steelers ... fell to want to and on\n... we all wanted to convince ourselves that we could get by without levy on bell but clearly\nAs bad as the defenses we thought the author which would be something that we could rely on as being more consistent and it certainly wasn't lashing it obviously know points and the second half\nAgainst Baltimore and and you know what I I I miss the cold on the division I really thought the AFC North was going to be a bad division again and that the Steelers would even if they got up to a bad start would be fine\nBut the ravens are playing ravens football good defense you know a deacon don't move the ball run the ball and have a great kicker and win games the Bengals about what a huge win for them in Atlanta\nOn that last second touchdown I Know the last time I worked for the year that's too bad for them and the browns are obviously even better so the divisions are tougher than I thought it would be in the Steelers are in some trouble right now for ...\nFiles segment of our one I Want to go back to the overtime decisions by Mike variable Frank right uh and obviously the way that the game play that we had three different overtime games or the way the game played out between the browns and the raiders what's the right way to coach overtime in the NFL\nBecause the game was already tied\nAnd when he went forward on Fort down what he was doing was giving the other team and opportunity if they didn't convert that four down\nTo come back to the other way the Texans and be able to make that field goals so I think those were two fundamentally different decisions obviously the game between the raiders and the browns went back and forth a couple of different time multiple possessions one missed overtime field goal by the raiders\nEverything else associated with it there wasn't as much drama in terms of those decisions\nTo me the decisions made by coach Reich and by ... were boats in theory the same which is you go for the win but the circumstances were substantially different\nI eat the Colts were actually risking a loss when they decided to go for it on their own side of the fifty\nDoes that make a little bit more sense in other words the decisions were fundamentally different let's go back to ... decision again because I Do think this is such an intriguing\nStrategic discussion that hasn't been really talked about that much first of all ... had a forty nine yard field goal or forty nine yard field goal in the NFL you probably make what\nSeventy five to eighty percent of the time I don't have the data in front of me right now but if you have a good field goal kicker and the titans do and Ryan suck up you probably make that field goal at least Seventy five or eighty percent of the time\nOf forty nine yard field goal is not a chip shot\nBut Seventy five percent or eight Seventy five or eighty percent of the time let's say you would end up with a tie there and so the titans would've left to one in one and the eagles were left you wanted one force it to you probably convert that in the NFL I Would guess\nOn a what do you think fifty five percent basis maybe maybe even closer ... something like that\nI Would think out in the NFL wanna force into you probably converted about fifty five percent of the time I Would rather be the ... going for a forced into then I Would the defense trying to stop it\n[noise] so that's a fundamentally different kind of situation and on that play by the way the titans gain Seventeen yards advanced all the way to the eagles Fifteen and set up ... would be a winning opportunity\nIn other words when we're able made the decision to go for it his team was in a much better position for potentially getting the win because they were already on the other side of the field driving to try to get to win and also his percentage chance on the field goal was not great it was an aggressive play\nBut it was one that potentially had a significant pay off in a positive direction\nThe decision Frank writes made I I Would upon it I'm going to be honest with you there because I think\nEven if you get the first down there you're not putting yourself in a position necessarily where you know you're going to have a chance to win I think if he had been on the other side of the field and a first down there gives you a chance to be really easily within a distance to go for the field goal then I think I Would have gone for it if I\nWere on the other side of the field I think that's kind of a no brainer at that point 'cause you're playing for the win if you get a first down there they're still not very much time left and you're still with a difficult situation not necessarily knowing whether or not you're going to have a chance for when he went for it\nDidn't get the result he wanted and the next play the Texans hit a twenty plus yard up or the past and now if you're the colds man you're sitting at one in three and you were headed back\nTo pets are headed to the plate the patriots to potentially fall the one in four years season is basically over\nAll right I tease it before I promise you were going to take

... overall\nNumber nine overall I've still got the Washington Huskies there they lost in week one to all burn a really tough loss I still believe Washington is the best team in the pack twelve\nParticularly now that Stanford has lost and dropped out of my top ten so I've got Penn State tend Washington nine in the eight spot\nStill not convinced how good they are\nBut the west Virginia mountain ears are really pretty outstanding so far they've won every game by eight or more they went on the road against Texas Tech they've got a couple of games they should win now in particular Kansas is coming to a West Virginia that game if you want to kind of put a circle around that for the big twelve\nIs Oklahoma finishes off the season in at West Virginia on the Friday after Thanksgiving this year here's the challenge with that game\nIt may well be immediately replicated\nIn the big twelve title game is a decent chance Oklahoma in West Virginia or the two best teams in the big twelve this year and that they will immediately replay each other now they're still a lot to go on maybe that won't happen but we'll see what ends up happening with ah with that game I got West Virginia at eight\nIn the seven spies Auburn was not that good this weekend there often has been just OK frankly caught the Auburn tie\nThey are they really haven't hit their stride yet with Jared stood up and go the defense has been pretty consistent I've got all Bernard number seven are still just basically one play away from being on defeated they lost to LSU gave up that late a lead in a in at home a jerk and hair in the six spot I've got Oklahoma\nThe Oklahoma sooner scholar Murray continue to roll they got past army last weekend got passed Iowa State the weekend before I've got Oklahoma at six overall in the five spot this is where I think you get kind of difficult\nI've got to Ohio State and then into four I've got Notre Dame people say well how do you end up with Ohio State of Notre Dame at four and five and how do you decide which one belongs which place I think Notre Dame with the book\nHas won over to better opponents in Michigan and in Stanford than Ohio State has in their wins over TCU and Penn State [noise]\nIn other words I think Notre Dame wins if you just look at him their best wins\nThe best winds of Notre Dame against Stanford and against Michigan are better than the best winds of Ohio State against TCU which now has two losses and against Penn State\nWhich a notary which Ohio State had to come storming back to the beach so I've got Ohio State it by this means my final four playoff right now would be Notre Dame and the four spot\nI've got LSU in the three I think LSU as the two best wind of any team so far they beat Miami who is when I was going on and won every games that and they beat offered who is going on and beat every game sense too so I've got to LSU at the three\nI've got Georgia number two and I've got the Alabama Crimson Tide

[noise]\nWell I finally did improve my credit score you're kidding right or know how are we supposed to be the bad boys of electricity and pop if you're out there being responsible the band is about to be discovered this year you've been saying that for a while now you think\nQuarterback so I think he laid it just fine a driver was going to be a guy from the outset uh and and he gave Kelly a chance to win the job and Kelly ... an ounce jelly has a chance to go you know play somewhere else and and still maintain a red shirt this year so I think he played it just fine\nJust unfortunately for him and unfortunately for Clemson you ... get hurt in\nFirst and already so I\nThink in terms of of what it means for cleansing chase Bryce can play it safe surprise you know you saw in that second half enough for them that that's what he can do and and I saw that give playing high school a few times in some camps to\nYou know he was as good as Jake from Trevor Lawrence is at a camp for us as good as strict Lawrence and the camp tank was was one of those kids a few years ago that\nWas sort of a diamond in the ... wanted to go to ... and to learn to red shirt so to become a a a college student before college football player and I think because he's been in the program for a while he was able to come in and and take that situation and run with it so\nThey can win ... right I don't have any doubt in my mind I'm not going to play off with them but they can win and get to lay off with them I think the beauty for ... and right now they've got way this week and they don't play a lick the defense and they have a ... so you know you you had a long time if you're a river warrants in need it to\nYou know sort of get right and get ready and in the meantime they're fully capable of handling business with chased priced out there so I don't think it really messes with them and their plans you know in the in the near term that long term\nYou know ... you can't win for Chase Brown it's I think is a good quarterback you can get you there but\nYou need Trevor Lawrence and so as long as he is ready by by late November which I assuming that he will be unless something else happens are going to be just one\nBy the way quote a firm dabble yesterday on Trevor warrants I'm here is a direct quote\nA that he was really good um and this is a demo talking about Trevor Lawrence he was trying to come back in the game yesterday this is a quote from Sunday night but any time you get something with the head and neck area there's no room for error he was really good after the game and really good this morning felt great\nI I think they were very encouraged of what they saw he'll work out and they'll continue to reevaluate and hopefully they put him back in practice this week so it doesn't sound like at least based on those quotes\nThat this Trevor Lawrence injury is going to be something that is a multi multi week or injury situation what would your college football playoff be right now if you were on the committee the reason why I asked that is I think we're setting up for potentially some messy situation to if you kind of schedule watch right\nI don't think anybody's going to beat Alabama I think Alabama is going to go Thirteen it out or maybe Georgia can give them a challenge and the SEC championship game or maybe LSU on the road can get a couple of turnovers from two but based on what I've seen so far Alabama is head and shoulders above everybody else I think Alabama is going to go Thirteen to know\nThis is a decent chance we'll see what happens at Ohio State could do the same now that I got past what I think they're most difficult challenge they survived Penn State claims and doesn't play a top twenty five team left\nReally Notre Dame doesn't I'm not really counting version the attack as a top twenty five team even though technically they're at the very bottom of the top twenty five\nAnd Oklahoma should be a substantial favorite over really everybody else they play now obviously you got the red river ah shoot out this weekend\nMaybe ... can make a statement game there something like that what happens if you end up with five undefeated teams and Notre Dame is one of them cause it to five undefeated teams at that point in time would all be big glowing brands right you'd have Alabama you'd have claims and you'd have Ohio State you would have Oklahoma and you would have Notre Dame\nIf I gave you those five instead all five of them are going to go undefeated now the odds of that happening are low but if it happened which guy gets left out\n[noise] which town man that well first of all you have plenty of radio content so that\nThat is I've already starting in early I'm starting in early with what if everybody goes undefeated but I the reason why I think it's particularly unique this year is Notre Dame is I think going to be in the mix now maybe an outlet I were talking about it right now they'll lose the Virginia tech this weekend and done on themselves out but if they beat Virginia Tech\nI think it's ... it's a lot of times talking about whether a team's going to go undefeated is crazy but when you have coins and who is going to be probably double digit favored over everybody else for the rest of their season if Notre Dame can win this game\nI think they are likely to be nearly a double digit favorite the rest of the way Oklahoma may be a you know I Know they finish the season off with a with West Virginia but I feel like they're seven and a half a point favorites over Texas this weekend Oklahoma and the big twelve is a pretty big favorite bam a\nIs just a juggernaut they answer maybe it doesn't matter 'cause ban is so much better than everybody else it doesn't even matter or who makes the college football playoff\nBut that's five big brands and I don't think it's crazy to look at those by big brands and say okay we could be trending towards a situation where all five of those are in the mix\nYeah I mean if that happens um you don't get an Eighteen playoff well maybe it is I Would think that that Notre Dame would have\nTo be out and the reason I say this is because everything's a big brand and and you said the threat of creation in the playoffs and I have as well it it's a it's a it's a Super Bowl type event that you need to have rain recognition from across the spectrum\nThat would be all you know all five major brand you actually have to look at merit and in that situation I think Notre Dame would be out and it's mostly due to the fact that in that situation\nOklahoma would have Texas this weekend and run the big twelve schedule and beating another really good team individual championship game no matter who is\nYou know ... and it was ... and you won't have to worry about them Oklahoma I might have been the force feed into battle would be between them and Notre Dame and the resume the hypothetical resume\nI think it would be in favor of the sooner is\nUm you know I think though if you look at resumes though um you know Clinton might get the benefit of the doubt because it comes in but they might have the worst resume five in that area yeah not on you know it it would be very messy and I would be here for all of them that that would be fantastic on that\nAll right we're talking to berets illegal read them at CBS Sports dot com you can follow him at Barrett two hours to ... to ... to ease up on Twitter at Barrett sully okay let's go right into a two ... this this fact which I Love\nTheir three teams right now in big five conferences so I'm leaving out central Florida so everybody who's a central more than I'm not talking about you although you guys have been fantastic five major conferences\nThere are three teams that have been that are undefeated and have won every game this year by double digits first to probably not going to surprise very many people Alabama and Georgia third\nTeam Kentucky Kentucky is five into and has won every game by double digits so far this year how good is Kentucky\n... but not great because I'd argue that the opener and central Michigan um the it was a miracle to that point yeah um you know so uh yeah they're they're very good you know I think ... we knew about him very well since\nNobody knew how good the quarterback because he was in a battle with ... and and and that do exactly what they want to do and credit Eddie grander off at the coordinator to you know\nSpending his system consistently to fit the strength of his quarterback and so um you know that once you punch is is is incredible and that just a surprise in terms of the quarterback I think the biggest thing that they've done\nIs on both sides of the line of scrimmage they have grown men in terms of of not just size and strength that age they've gotten mature guys who have\nBeen in the program for a very long time who are also\nNot only for talented but ultra developed like Josh Allen who I think he was a two star kid and now he's going to be a first round draft so\nThey've got they've got to do playing on the hook line discriminate now they don't have the debt that you have to make sure ... Kentucky that you you don't have some injuries but Darrell legit hopped in king ... they're ... they're a serious threat the most serious threat to Georgia in the SEC eat and it's because they can play\n'em you know a grown man football as one scrimmage on both sides\nAnd and I think once you get stuck in a program like because you get ... sometimes ... ... years where it just sort of comes together and you look at the Atlanta say wow you know these guys are red shirt junior these guys are red shirt seniors that there are adults who have done this for you know multiple seasons together\nAnd and a lot of times that is what makes some of those teams come out of nowhere and Kentucky is that team this year so I I think when they went to uh the Georgia game which I Believe this is November third\nThey might be undefeated still and and that might be the game that decided the FCC's\nAre eight a last question for you big game coming up this weekend for LSU which I think it's still a bit of an enigma how good at LSU ah what do you see happening between LSU going on the road against Florida and how good or the gators coming off a second big road when Mississippi State this week Tennessee last week\nI think it's going to look like a um much uglier that's possible version of the LSU Auburn game where you know ... a lot of the fence and and nearly found a way to win it and hold as often as a little bit of a step back\nAnd so I'm going to come down to defense it's going to come down to job or a making a player to 'em because Florida State what you will about their office and and there's a lot\nOf doubt out there even after the UN the quotas and it's still ... is even halfway decent but their defense has been lights out there on the road and stuff is arming overrode have done it before it seemed that out\nYou'd be Georgia State by thirty four got to postpone game against West Virginia that would have been intriguing to see what would have happened in that game beat Marshall and just beat Virginia so uh you've got Boston College this weekend in Raleigh\nYou win that game beat Boston College you'll be five in ... and you will be a have a week off and you'll get ready to go on the road against Clemson\nSo if you're in the state fan you could be excited about that or that as a possible game that would be massive\nYou can get past Boston College and be five in oh then cleansing is on the road and that would be a massive game four in the state to to set up that would also be a cleansing game against the top twenty five opponent which to be honest clubs that does not have right now when you look at what\nCleansing schedule is right now through five games they have managed to get past Syracuse they managed to get past Texas a and M. four point win over Syracuse to point when over ... but you look at the rest of their way got Wake Forest this weekend you just heard berets elite they Wake Forest got no defense\nThen you've got in the state which is actually a top twenty five opponent\nUh then you go to FSU which generally would be a massive game for Clinton but Florida State not a good this year you get movable which I mean a lotta years is a big game ... good this year you go to Boston College that could actually be a little bit of a dangerous game because BCS pretty decent\nYou do get home and then you get South Carolina at home honestly even if you are cleansing than this is probably the easiest scheduled ... and his hat in Fifteen or Twenty years not to mention they have a really good football team a talented football team but right now the only top twenty five team on\nTheir regular season radar\nIs in the state and we're not really sure how good of a team NC State is\nTherefore no but if they played West Virginia and beat in West Virginia\nWe'd have a better idea even if they played West Virginia and lost a West Virginia we would've seen him play against a good team and have a better sense of what that situation would be by the way West Virginia was around a four point favorite on the road in that game against NC State to give you a little bit of an idea\nOf what the odds makers think of the overall talent there at NC State\nUh incredible weekend of college football and NFL action we're going to die back in and break all that down for you at the top of our three I also encourage you to download the podcast first

Scott Frost got a messy situation in Nebraska eventually going to turn it around\nBut boy it is not going very well in year one so ah the college football other big story I Would say is Notre Dame and he and book\nGetting the massive a win over a over Stanford and now the pact wells really in a difficult spot when it comes to trying to get a team into the college football playoff again in book has made that Notre Dame often look a lot better than Brandon when Bush did and\nThe Irish now go on the road against Virginia Tech and have a decent chance I don't think it's crazy at all if you're a Notre Dame fan to look and say hey\nWe could potentially go twelve and oh this year I think there's some possibility of that happening\nUm meanwhile the other usual suspects continue to dominate Georgia dominates over Tennessee Alabama dominates over a Louisiana and or LSU actually rolled out and really whipped up on old miss so uh my top ten as a result\nMy top ten best teams in college football right now in the in the tent spot I have got a I have got Penn State a\nVery easily could have one would have been probably of Penn State of one they would have been my number five team in college football but they lose and so I've still got 'em at ten I've got Washington at number nine overall the huskies only loss\nNeutral site game although by frankly it was on the road against Auburn in the eight spot I've got West Virginia a big win\nOn the road against Texas Tech for a data holders and seeing they came out and they got a big early and they hung on Auburn I've got in the seven spot they weren't that impressive this weekend we'll see what happens with Auburn on the road against Mississippi State this weekend\nIn the six bought I have got Oklahoma I've got the suitors at six Ohio State at five in Ohio State buckeyes fans are mad look it's Ohio State or its Notre Dame and my four spot right now\nAnd I think Notre Dame wins given how sound and they have been\nOver both Michigan and in particular over Stanford\nWho I had rated higher than I did Penn State I had to win over Stanford being more impressive by Twenty one than Ohio state's comeback late to beat Ohio State but Notre Dame was more impressive I think their resume so far is better I've got Notre Dame of four\nI've got to LSU at three LSU goes on the road against Florida this weekend and then next weekend they get Georgia coming to Death Valley down in Baton Rouge so we'll see whether LSU plays well whether they can keep their season undefeated\nGet to a six to know crazy half their season will be done if they can beat the Florida Gators this coming weekend Florida Dan Mullen has to be really happy back tobacco road wins Mississippi State\nGets a gift for to get to win over Mississippi State

field goal is not necessarily a high level make\nAnd so the decision to go there was different than decision to go on the other side of the field and when you got zapped Alex right when I was asking you about that that is in with [laughter] with al\n... maybe it's a ghost already ... all over me but we all rams I don't know I'm ...\nI'm ... play their legit I mean look the rams are the best team\nIn the NFL I mean it's not even close and you know because if\nAt all three levels right I mean our fence of late I mean where do you stop you stop the passing game I mean that's so difficult right now with the wage Eric ... is playing and the fact that they have such great great trio with wide receiver personal started work Gerald Hebert into the mix and with Todd girlie until a lady on belt comes back if he ever does get all that water ski\nWell you know he is the best all around running back in the NFL defensively there are some flaws you know you worry a little bit about that in the secondary just because of you know cheap to lead being out now until at least December\nPlus lead lined backing crew leaves a little bit to be desired and they may be able to be attacked by teams with running backs\nAnd we'd get tight and but by and large usually they're going to affect a quarterback and great safety light and then special teams even with the injuries that have hit it they're gentle regard as the best special teams you call and\nYou know they they the nice thing too about this team is that there was so much hype surrounding it during the off season it would've been very easy for the team to maybe buy into that\nAnd get fat and happy before they you know ever did anything and instead they have it I mean they won their first rate games but double digits they took care of the Vikings at home and I would imagine now that rants probably gonna be David and just about every game but when you look at the rest of the places where the rams can really make some hay Seattle's a train wreck\nArizona's planning a rookie quarterback in charge frozen in San Francisco's got CJ bath or I mean this may be a ramps team I don't think they're going undefeated they have a string of three straight road games coming up in Plano team\nSince uh two thousand fourteen Bengals have won three straight on the road I mean it's just very rare even for a really good teams to do which is only happened once I think in the past decade or so so I think the rams ultimately a losing game the fourteen and two for the regular season very possible very possible home field advantage of being able to wrest players in the month of December\nAri what's up with the Steelers they ah they now are one it's odd record so and make sure I get it right one two in one may actually in last place in the AFC Norse\nEven beneath the browns who got there are laws against the raiders the raiders got off the oh and three ... but what's going on with the Steelers because last week the talk was what's going on with the patriots patriots come back with a big win\nThe Steelers got a big win on Monday but then they got wall it's pretty good at home now\nI hate to say it's crazy question but a quarter of the way through the season or they even a playoff team\nOh it was the way Cincinnati and and the Baltimore claimed and they may be on the outside looking in first let's talk about some of the things that Pittsburgh isn't doing well\nThey have forty two counties for four hundred one yards claim that leads the NFL that doesn't reflect well upon the coaching of this team third down
