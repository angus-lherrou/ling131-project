university system and how it can be reformed but he doesn't believe in abolishing tenure please explain to her\nWell Terry is a way of protecting professors that basically against miners graders\nBy how long\nWe have a University in which there are about as many administrators of our professors think about that\nIn the professors supposed to be doing the job of research and teaching and the administrators or do supposed to make it easier for them but they are they are the people who are running but yeah the allergies most controversies they love to be able to fire even more professors\nAnd as a matter of fact it is you can hear\nYou on tenured adjunct professors but majority of faculty are not tenured anyway I Know they fired me longer than if I did that pet\nI mean one of them they wouldn't have because you don't know I Know you're not ... the propaganda the line that they want they don't have as soon as you know too much [laughter]\nWell there's that too but anyway

and I go into this game and I'm looking at patriots bears and\nI hate the idea and this was in one of my knocks locks because I'm actually taking the bears who are getting two and a half points I hate doing that and the comparison I made was picking against the patriots is like when you walk into that dive bar in town the second you get in there you look at your buddy and you're like why are we here\nLike it's the same people the same place the same smell we continue to to think there's going to be a different outcome and they're never is why are we here that's the feeling when you pick against the patriots why are you doing it\nAnd then it partly the reason I'm doing it is because I think what we saw last week in Miami is a game that we rarely see not only in Miami but rarely see in the world of sports or anything that could happen did happen in one football game\nAnd there were a lot of circumstances in that game that led to what went down and why the bears fell apart down the stretch\nBecause they go to Miami dealing with that humidity dealing with that heat dealing with that exhaustion and when did the bears start to get burned in that game by a backup quarterback they started to get burned late in the game when they were aghast that they were a little bit fatigue\nAnd they were running out\nAnd still even in that game the bears had an opportunity to win it but it was again conservative play calling vitamin Maggie questionable decisions down the stretch and miss field goal in overtime still they could have won that game so I think it's going to be a\nGood one ah the bears are not fared well historically gets New England patriots but I also in something that was brought up and it was a brilliant point of this week on straight out of Vegas I heard on a Fox Sports radio three to four Pacific time six to seven eastern time somebody brought this up\nWho to build bell a check just play a week ago just play the Kansas City chiefs where did Matt nagging come from Kansas\nCity a lot of what the bears do is remnants of what they do in Kansas City and if there's anybody that could take advantage of something like that it's Bill Belichick and I thought it was a\nGreat point that was brought up this week on straight out of Vegas Joan is Dr Fox Sports radio eight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox the phone number or you can also get me on Twitter at ... the

I Want to pose to you if Kirk Cousins were on the jets are they any better than they are now\nI Would say no\nI Would say absolutely not they're not a better football team I think they're kind of write about where they are a five hundred football team so not only a few of the New York jets did you save huge money on the quarterback position\nAnd so far it's not hurt you on the field all that much at all\nBut you also have bought yourself some time to build the roster around it Sam ... Arnold because he's going to be on his rookie deal\nIf you just look at this match up on Sunday between the Vikings and the jets and you see how much differently things could have played out had Kirk Cousins gone for the money as opposed to going for the better team\nI think the jets would potentially being a worse spot than they are now a total win for the New York jets Jonah stocks Fox Sports

with our problems my comments [noise]\nJust do the big glowing swirling\nI needed my microphone up here at some otherwise do what you're talking to you that's what I mean I think out of there and uh [noise] see I've got you excited about his music joined us on a summer come I I Know you've got all excited about that if I don't count [laughter]\nUm [laughter] so so my comment we got a a London games come on now they're literally on do you can hear my car men are Fox Sports radio fantasy football insider with Dan ... every Sunday nine to eleven am eastern time [noise]\nYou guys are going to get a football game while you're on the air how fun is that none none of frequent occurrence normally if\nYou're on the other pitch so it's kind of exciting the chargers would some some opportunity here Tennessee like variable was one of those guys you put up as possible coach of the year ... lab we happen they are bad last week happening as anything you've done to get any good will for a hard fought wins went out the\nWindow look I Know he's a nice guy and all I Know a lot of nice guys ah Marcus Mario to stinks oh he was sorry and beer yeah whatever Laura a couple\nOf years ago uh we we all drink or some kind of tonic yeah our wake it up would be the walk of shame and in London right now\nIs there okay the ... in Tennessee has been bad for games is there anybody worth a play that that's going to be kicking off here in less than four hours\nI think I'd put Dionne Lewis in as a back and number two or watch Blake because they'll see the ball is a receiver out of the backfield beyond that I wouldn't judge with a ten foot pole no\nI'm chargers wise what do we got your dad often has been rolling but Melvin Ingram\nAre there are a Melvin Gordon sorry I get the mail but that's all right so they got a couple of Melvin damage works well it's because I'm not sure what I covered Melbourne grooming Melvin uh is it in ... college in South Carolina so I get that confused I I have a soft spot in my heart Melbourne Graham who was the best\nPlayer on that South Carolina defense but it was ... he got all the pub and it pissed me off but never mind the way it works yeah everybody finds the favor of Israel do a little bit deeper that very ... very frustrating Melvin Gordon\nYeah what's what's your status the plan is he not playing he was banged up uh it's questionable now what's going on\nRussia last report still going to give it a go obviously will be monitoring that and we'll have all your last second\nUh updates as Dan and I get things going a little bit later but right now uh if you haven't uh Austin ... color was available and an awful lot of leagues for a guy that touches the ball is frequently as he does and it's been so integral to what they do a you're looking at him as a back and number two if he gets a chance to play it as a fulltime role\nMaybe that's the guy with top ten potential if he's the man so Gordon expected to go but this could also get lopsided ... sit and and and chill and having a nice you know lukewarm a Guinness before it's all done\nNow are they going to I Would think that probably maybe a bonding tens or any gross he I I Do like a ... yeah that's a good one Eddie Garcia got beer shame so Andy Garcia is a Fox Sports radio um\nAnchor here at outfits are you here every single week or on the ... show Monday through friday Eddie is in London because him his wife is a diehard charger fan and so they decided to turn it into like a two week European Vacation I'm during football season you get\nYou get to a store and I don't I don't know how they pulled I'm usually I came to the yes I I Know that's that's the greatest accomplishment of all time I'm like literally my name on a on a chain because it's good for my ankle\nIt is a it it's amazing but um our times have changed but for him and oh so he's in England and he said the first night they went to a bar and you know you figure you want to try\nThe local stuff without even asking the bartender handed him a Budweiser how 'bout how 'bout you happier shamed yeah you got like you know they would have handed me like a Sima as a\nGuy that I don't see him a tourist maybe maybe as wise with them were in charge or ... a year just just take\nThe excuse me so you've got to see her and got some ring on here's a capri sun and that's what I Would have died but um so so they have gotten beer shame there but my comment Fox Sports radio fantasy football insiders with this year on efforts are reminder of less than ten minutes from now here on Fox Sports radio the return of the ...\nMonster the prop ... monster is here er and people need to pay up cars you deadbeat degenerates haven't paid up by for your losses so far this year\nBut that's okay ah ... getting called deadbeat okay that's good so so the I mean he's skipping town so what are you gonna do yeah Mike mayor has gone by the way as his final show get the hell outta here you trade or you work out a you know we can uh Rob ... because we care yeah but then I travel to Chicago for the New England patriots\nYet not ruled out which I don't know what the hell's happening there as well just\nLast year I think it was the percentage was ... percent played\nIf they had a doubtful tag if he doesn't play yeah who sees the uptick right if he doesn't doesn't play I think based on what you saw last week and and I heard your reference a little bit\nA Bill Belichick abusive with praise for everything the bears did last week which leads me a little nervous yeah and it's usually when he bus yeah a weapon stick yeah uh but I have to believe that you saw with Albert Wilson was doing down field uh and they should be an investigation as to what the dolphins did with the injury report but we'll get into that another time oh God\n[laughter] I mean that that was\nPatriots' Jew on steroids or wait I shouldn't say that\nAll I wanted to raise the rent is ... by the way if you want it my that was my Carmen ... viewer upset with what my comment just said you can get him on Twitter at off the Mike twenty eight that's where you can get a hold of my car and I just let him know how pissed off you are at some of his reckless accusations here on Fox Sports radio\nI just thought it was funny because you got to get her side of everything else why don't you throw it out on a lot of raw but yeah with him about I I got to go ... I Can't\nWait till about what checked to see that my ... my [laughter]\nYeah I got to go up top to Josh ... this is the game where he gets a little more activity down feel ... Kamara banged up\nUh you you got some other issues in that especially no clue Mac or a hundred percent or at least that's what we're told yeah again ... I got to think that guy's going to watch in that tape their pride got hurt a little bit so they rallied in front of the home crowd a but otherwise we're going to go into", "year": "2018", "show_name": "FOX Sports Radio", "city": "Newton", "day": "21"}
