will take that because it adds to the story line as if we needed anything other than undefeated Kansas City with a rock star quarterback and and a fantastic off and it's going to New England to take on the patriots like we needed anything else to sell us on the game\nBut people took that and they ran with it and assume that Tom Brady was taking a shot at the young quarterbacks in the NFL\nWhen he wasn't the patriots do college concepts I think teams around the NFL\nCoaches around the NFL have figured out why are we drafting a guy who's strength is this and trying to make him do this\nI mean it doesn't it doesn't make any sense\nIf your specialty is cooking a cure a chef your great chefs you're\nOne of the ... the best chefs in the area\nNobody's hiring you to to redo their bathroom doesn't make sense and I think coaches have figured out in the NFL look maybe we had to take some of these college concepts\nMaybe teams in the NFL are prepared for um yes it's a lower level of football but won't make the transition easier\nAndy Reid figured it out I think bill ballot check has figured it out\nWas doing it in a different form for years and years ... understood the idea of finding water

NFL quarterbacks at the bus straight like we've seen before because I just don't think it's going to happen I mean how many flat out bus\nEarly round quarterbacks are there in the NFL right now honestly like over the last couple of years find me a first round pick a quarterback was drafted in the first round that you look at and go oh for sure that guy's a bust\nI mean you you would immediately go to Chicago out with a mixture risky he just through six touchdowns in a game\nIt's not personal what James Winston isn't a bust\nJosh Rosen we don't know as of yet Jared golf definitely not a bust go around the NFL find me a bus that's been drafted the last couple of years in the first round shot Watson no Marcus Mario to I don't think he's great but he's not a bust Baker may feel looks pretty good\nJosh Allen is looked show or a hope give at least given up hope they're like you can't find that it just because I didn't coaches around the league has figured it out why for somebody to do something that I used to when they were really good at something else\nLike why ... why make them learn us when we can learn them and it's easier\nAdding to the guys who were the
