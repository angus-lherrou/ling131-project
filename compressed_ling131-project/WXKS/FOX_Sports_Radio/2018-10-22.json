bad game good game he had Ninety nine yards in this game which means he'll run for thirty yards in the next Redskins game but he was better\nJak ducked Prescott or you know he didn't get any help from from sea Kelly that is fair and Adrian Peterson did help out the Redskins and Alex Smith was mediocre as always\nHe was game manager didn't have an interception but he only had a hundred and Seventy eight yards and we gave the stat last\nWeek I'm Glad we did do you remember one of the questions we had an English during ... versus the penny the only quarterback in the NFL that had had just one of his passes drop\nWas Alex Smith now when I was watching the Redskins cowboys game it looked like at least three passes were dropped by Redskins receiver so that's that goes out the window but a very unremarkable performance by Alex Smith\nA ... there were several occasions where he missed open receivers in the end zone a and and it just twice the Washington office had to get short fewer goals in the second half despite having first and goal opportunity\nAnd is there anything that sucks more when you're watching a game if you're pulling for a team and they get down\nAnd you have to kick a cheap shot a chip shot cheap field goal at the end and that that happened several times for the Washington Redskins office if you look at you saw the game you know exactly what I'm Talking about but it was ... it was ridiculous\n... the Redskins had a Twenty one and twenty five yard field goal\nIn the in this game Twenty one and twenty five yard field goal then you realize the end zone ten yards you'd the balls pleased back seven yards so do the math on that that means the ball was it the four yard line when they kicked one of the field goals and at the age yard line on the other fuel go what do you do\nWhat what the hell that all about it's pathetic is what it is\nSo but they still won the game they still won the game but he has come back to the cowboys ... this NFC eve is a plotting\nUnremarkable division entire division\nWhich makes Jason Garrett the perfect coach because he seems to be the plotting coach that doesn't really know what he's doing just mediocre as what he is a ... and so let's hear from Jason Garret who is trying to celebrate the positive and nothing that\nBoth defenses play well battled back and forth low scoring game they always going to come down to order came down to be an official at the end of the ball game do you need to do to get yourself back in it and then you have the opportunity kick the game time feels almost my didn't work out for us\nI Wonder if he addressed that Prescott giving a touchdown away in the fourth quarter with five minutes to go to the address that I don't know here's another one from Jason Garrett on his idiot kick\nHe's done very well obviously chicken the ball we're going the right direction you know at the end I think it was fifty three is that correct [laughter] you know we've seen her make those kinds of kicks unfortunately to make this one\nYeah All right what's your age your last point you Jerry Jones or has the cowboys in a holding pattern you know when you you fly to a city and there's a lot of congestion and you're you're waiting for\nThe the chance to land you're circling the airport that's essentially what the cowboys are doing they're in a holding pattern there circling around waiting for a runway to land because the NFL has figured out that Prescott we said you know it was beating a dead horse week after week here but just to the labor appoint even more\nIf you go back to the point of demarcation week nine of last season the cowboys are seven and eight the last Fifteen games with that Prescott in in those Fifteen games that Prescott even with this game which by his standards was a positive performance for Prescott\nFourteen touchdowns Thirteen interceptions six point six yards per attempt and a quarterback rating overs last eighty games of\nEighty it's not only\nNothing memorable very vanilla all fenced by the cowboys and Prescott singlehandedly is holding back the Dallas often and it continues to be false advertising that Prescott was billed as a headliner by Jerry Jones and he's playing like a supporting act\nMe take away the cowboy logo and all the bluster of Jerry Jones and it's a very mediocre performer that Prescott and they figure them out teams of figure them out ideas the bend matters show on Fox as we press on and we'll take your calls eight\nSeven seven Ninety nine on Fox eight seven seven nine nine six six three six nine were

they did not do that was not an over the top great performance by Kurt cousins but the Viking defense twisting around Sam Donaldson three interceptions\nIn this game and was all around miserable and more importantly for the Vikings their defense which has had no real identity shut down and bottled up the jets running game that had been\nThe crammed dollar cram of the jets they're running game and they were unable to matriculate the ball\nAnywhere you know that it loses we can then who's that Roberta\nGreater than it loses will read the novel or I don't know I think John grew into might have

Rondo\nJust very upset and in blistering tearing apart\nBlood joining the dolphin coach he sent a statement now to reporter said quote I Am responding this is the agent for democracy Parker\nWho was inactive for the dolphin so I'm responding or I Am responding that he is not telling the truth the age instead of the dolphins coach and his decision was an example of poor management and cost the team the best opportunity to win\nSo in that opening salvo the agency said the coaches lying poor management he's guilty of that and not helping the dolphins when that's the trifecta in opening statement\nQuote continues the agent wrote that the dolphin coach continues attacking the health of my client and this is not accept\nParker is not only healthy but wants to help his team meaning the dolphins when and the only real question that should be asked is how does coach gays justify his own in chalk put its\n\nAging continued the dolphins average six point one yard for past catch in a game on Sunday against the lions they needed Parker who is completely healthy the agent said and was in full participation all week in warm up this morning something smells in Miami\nThe agent wrote but wait there's more\nA city sick to his stomach he's tired of watching coach gays make these decisions says the third game that the vaunted Parker should have played and didn't\nAnd he says that his client is being used as a scapegoat and he uh he went on and just slammed the dolphin go watch good\n[noise] I recall a story I mentioned this but you know while back new people listening when Adam gas was hired as the Gulf and coach there was a story in Miami media that compared him too darn sure the legendary NFL coach\nDon ... and the this is a lot of similarities between Adam gays in ...\n[laughter]\nWhich is in my top five most outrageous things ever written right up there with the Astros going eleven and all of this postseason which was a prediction by a member of the use the media that the Astros are going to win every game and the American league playoffs in the world series on their way to a perfect postseason\nHow's that going where's Jose all too big and watch game one of the world series do we know\nHis hospital bed what having surgery oh is that what about\n... what about our pregnant will you be posting any videos on social media\nWe yeah we don't know yeah we don't let's go to Dick in Dayton who's next on Fox Sports radio hello Dick\nWell good morning in the morning to you is huge actually going to be the brands coached by the end of the day\n\nI don't know but I tell you why why why the browns played pretty good they should have won that game\nYou know they didn't last last their last so who who's read about in here who should be around here or I don't\nKnow I've never in my wife said Ohio State go down like that and it's been Twenty years that was ridiculous\nBut that is one of the great shocking not only the U.S to lose ... on race and get blown out by on ranked opponent how does that I\nKnow I Know and then watching the eagles made me sick and the city just I don't think that they should show up there\nNow you you put more effort in law was every day than the bangles did in that game of getting Kansas City that was a checkout situation not check down the checkout situation so who should the brand new coach be let's go through you weren't taught Haley they'd be the browns coach\nYes you do I want ... you know bottle I yeah I like Bob why the optimism line coach\nI see yeah\nI think it would be fun to have ... the coach 'cause he he just seems like the perfect ... a lifetime NFL guy ... fatty I\nDo want walls yeah ...

didn't like it and I will give us that that actually will contradict my own point clay and that is that since Nineteen Ninety four NFL teams are five for Thirteen that's thirty eight point five percent on do or die to point conversions\nSo at the end of the game that's pretty good statistic but the reason I didn't like it and I certainly agree with you I did not like the cold if you weren't going to go for it I Would sneak did\nOr certainly would have tried to run it one way or the other but sneakers what I Would have done but\nI the reason I I don't go forward there is because you're pushing all your chips in to the table in a game where\nThey can't run it because they don't have Melvin Gordon your defenses be going to play a lot better in the second half in the passing game and you were moving the foot bowl against them both on the ground and through the year if it wasn't for receivers that couldn't catch\nMore cars more Yoda might have had another touchdown or two in that football game so to me I think that's what you do when I say\nWe can't beat the team in overtime situation and I just didn't feel that was the case\nThat's why I disagreed with it although I Know that certainly here in Nashville and probably across the country a lot of people disagree with me I just don't like you could have won that game in overtime\nEither with your defense first or bringing the often back yeah because you were doing work against them off ... especially in the second half of that football game\nYeah I'm going to put out a poll question and let people kind of way and do you like the decision to go for two there now there's a couple of other aspects I I I Love the strategy kind to break down on a game decision like this\nThirty one seconds I think left my ... said after the game that he had said if there was forty seconds left or less they were going to go for a they were going to go for two he made that decision\nWhen they began the drive and obviously the best case scenario for the titans would have been to run it all the way down even further thirty one seconds left the danger they're going for two you can say well\nThen ... going to get the ball he's going to get a chance to come down and kick a field goal that same play is going to be in in in play to me even if you kick the extra point Philip Rivers I think they still had three time outs left if I'm not mistaken they would have had time to come back down the field and try to take a field goal for the win even if you kick the extra point\nSo ah you know if you get the two point conversion I don't know that it changes anything that the chargers are going to do\nThey're going to still be aggressively I think trying to come back down and try to get the uh the the feel go now maybe not maybe they would have been like run the ball and first down to see what gain they would get at the college move a lot of times\nBut I think with Philip Rivers and how good of a season he said they would have put them in the shot down and they would have gone for a an attempt to drive down with three time out that's a lot of time left\nSo I actually was fine with it I just think when you got the ball at the one yard line again I go to stats at that point Seventy percent of the time\nThe fence converts a fourth one and the stat that we use I think this was a couple of weeks ago\nOr the wall Street Journal didn't examination I think the quarterback sneak and I made this argument on the show most underutilized play and all of football it had converted quarterback sneaks at forty four out of forty five times so far in the twenty eight teams season\nWith Mario to I think people don't necessarily recognize how big and strong and physical he is because you know I I I think if he runs the ball well we don't necessarily think of runners as being the most ... six for\nI mean he's big and also on a fork downplay\nWhen all you have to do is break the plane and there's no risk for a fumble I think it's even easier to go for it because you just hold the ball out like Mario did when he tried to score on third down and almost got in before they had to do the fourth down play to get a touchdown on it\nYou just go immediately and just throw the ball I mean you hold it out as far as you can it's probably going to get knocked out of your hands but if you break the plane for an instant the fumbled doesn't matter um you know it's not as if you're risking something on third down where you get another chance that's literally the game I just go with Mario to let him go up high and try to break it almost immediately\nTo me that's the play and that's what they should have done a in terms of London the experience nominal\nEighty four thousand people there are the chargers and the titans I don't think could draw eighty four thousand people anywhere in the United states to play a football game right now not in Nashville certainly not in LA I think the tightened stadium seats around sixty eight\nAre the chargers stadium seats around thirty or twenty five or whatever it is and the soccer stadium they play in the atmosphere was phenomenal and I don't know about you guys 'cause I was over here for the uh for the uh you know the afternoon kick here or six hours ahead\nBut I Love the idea of regular morning football in London remember they're playing three straight weeks here next week on the road you've got the uh I Believe it's the eagles going up against Jacksonville and like we said who ... who has any idea who's going to be playing quarterback for Jacksonville\nBut I think this is a window that makes a lot of sense for the NFL I think they're going to have a team in London and the next three years I think by the time they do the next TV contract\nBecause I I don't know about you guys but the response that I got from people who didn't even care about the titans chargers is man it's awesome to wake up on Sunday Morning to put on a football game even if you don't start watching it at nine thirty in the morning\nBy the time it's like noon on the east coast by the time it's nine am on the uh on the west coast\nYou got a pretty cool opportunity to watch if you've got a close game like we did here\nAnd it's just the ultimate brunch buffet to lead you into\nA into football and I think it's a great move for the NFL I Would imagine that the ratings are going to be pretty spectacular for CBS for that nationwide game and what I loved about being there in London\nIt was basically a celebration of the NFL people were all different sorts of jerseys\nI a friday or met a bunch of titans fans and ah and several of the titans fans that I met were military people serving overseas and I think that's an underrated aspect of the appeal that that having an NFL franchise in London would have if you're a guy who's overseas in Germany and you Miss America like crazy\nHow about a ... a couple of our flight coming over and watching an NFL game I met two different service people\nWho were serving in Europe that were just home sick and they wanted to come see a big NFL game and they were like it's unbelievable and awesome that I can hop on a plane or even a train and be over here in London so easily\nTo watch uh my favorite team play or even teams just that I'm somewhat interested in cars I miss American stateside football and this is an opportunity for me to go watch in person I think it's going to happen uh I I think London is going to have a team I think they'll have to figure out all the different of vagaries associated with it I'm hopping a flight here\nIn a couple of hours to come back stateside but my experience over here are convinced me that London is going to get a football team and that that that could be enthusiasm for London\nAnd for the NFL continues to grow over here I talk to every different cabdriver I had and they were all aware of these games they were all paying attention and that's without even a team to to root for consistently\nI think it's a no brainer I think it's going to happen All right we come back I Will tell you who would be in my college football playoff we will discuss\nThe impact of Ohio State Los lucky for urban Meyer he's already forgotten about it\nUm that of course is because urban Meyer cannot remember anything according to his comments we will discuss what's the impact of Ohio state's loss who's my playoff final four and we will continue to dive and Jason\nMoran is going to have the show final two hours I'm with you for the first hour here and we know you're a big

vineyards by I Ninety you probably wandered whose idea was to grow grapes there that man was eat from wells bowls\nAnd it took it more than twenty two thousand seedlings of grapes to invent the Concord grape eight top fruit that could thrive in cold winters it was either that or moving to Florida and you can burn by the twenty two thousand attempts that wasn't really an option for a man whose last name was bowl the world's top estate antioxidants well\nThey gave up forty nine points to Purdue\nAnd it was an auditor beat down so what do we think now that Ohio State has gotten that loss I was the biggest uh outcome of the weekend in college football by far\nBecause of its long range impact now uh let me say this okay so you start to look at the playoff picture I don't think that's crazy at all because we're at least two thirds of the way\nThrough the college football regular season might play off for right now my playoff or would be in this order Alabama who I think is right now trending not towards just being good but I think there is an argument to be made that with to his performance through eight games\nAnd everything else they got the by week now and then they go on the road against LSU\nThere's an argument to be made that Alabama could be the best college football team of our lifetimes because they're not just winning they're throwing people they're going to open as eight to touch down road favorite over LSU if they go in to Baton Rouge and win by ten points\nMississippi State Auburn and citadel ain't got a dream of beating this Alabama Crimson Tide team in Tuscaloosa\nAnd then you would go to the SEC title game maybe it's Georgia maybe it's Florida Kentucky fans are like hey how about us I think you're going to lose on the road in Missouri this weekend but you got three one last teams in the SEC east all battling it out we'll see what ends up transpiring there\nI don't see one of those teams being able to beat Alabama either and frankly I don't think anybody else in the playoff is going to be able to do it either as long as to\nStay healthy if he gets injured then I think the drop off from two to jail and hurt is great to good Alabama goes from a great team maybe an all time great team just a really good team\nWith jail and hurt still probably good enough to win the national championship they're the only question number one\nI got Notre Dame sliding up into my number to spot even though they were on the by this week they play against navy and I think with the Ohio State laws\nThere's an argument to be made that Notre Dame could still lose a game go a Lebanon one and make the college football playoff\nI've got to LSU in it my number three spot and I've got Michigan now advancing to my forte spot that's my college football playoff claims and fans all up in arms I Am more impressed by what LSU is done\nBeat Miami at a neutral site game\nBeat all burnt even though Auburn not as good as we thought they are they're still I think a legit top twenty five caliber team\nThen you got a a win against Georgia I think all three of those are very solid wins Michigan one loss on the road by seven against Notre Dame they are rounding into form other than the beginning of their game\nAgainst north western they'd been dominant I'm not a huge fan of horrible I think he's over hyped\nAnd he's a good coach not a great coach but the response by Notre Dame by Michigan since they lost a Notre Dame has been excellent here's the rest of my top ten I Am not a cleansing believer based on what we've seen so far doesn't mean I don't think ... and we'll end up\nIn there they get undefeated but my top ten remainder I got to give me a little bit of the music in the background if you want to boys the Fox college football music I think we got it there it is\nThe melodic tunes to accompany my out kick top ten bam all one Notre Dame to\nLSU three Michigan for I Would have all those teams in by a playoff then I've got Georgia cleanse in Florida Texas Oklahoma and I got to Ohio State attend but I think I got that wrong I think it should be central Florida\nSo I'm bumping Ohio State back out of the top ten more I think about that last having said that\nThe overall impact I think again here's my number one Alabama to Notre Dame three LSU for Michigan\nFive Georgia's six claims and seven four to eight Texas nine Oklahoma number ten central Florida so what's the overall impact of Ohio state's loss frankly if you're in Ohio State fan and ate that significant if you continue to win\nBecause if you went out than Ohio State will be in the college football playoff I don't think there's any doubt so while this loss was bad\nYou went out you beat Michigan at the end of the year you beat Michigan State you beat whoever advances from the Big Ten and west and what a mess that is north western Iowa Wisconsin Purdue\nWith one or fewer losses all competing to win the Big Ten west I'd love to know what odds you could have gotten on to do with the Big Ten champ when they started off over three\nI Would have been an unbelievable play how 'bout northwestern to win the Big Ten after they lost to Akron for the first time Akron beat a big tent team since Eighteen Ninety four that would have been a hell of a play so in the Big Ten Michigan wins out they are in the play off\nIf Ohio State wins out they are in the play off I don't think anybody else is going to be able to make the play off from the big ... conference\nAgain Michigan can win out gets a twelve and a one I think they will be in I think if Ohio State wins out gets to twelve and a wall and they will still be in if you are a big twelve fan if you're in Oklahoma fan if you are a a if you are a big fan of the Texas Longhorn\nI think this Ohio State law so it was great for you because right now if I were projecting who would play in the big twelve championship game I think it'll be Oklahoma and Texas\nAnd if Oklahoma got in and got revenge and beat Texas to come back after losing earlier than I think Oklahoma would have a good chance of getting in the play off on the flip side of Texas beat Oklahoma for a second time\nThat I think Texas that first a week last to Marilyn would be overlooked and I think either of those teams would have a really good shot at getting into the play off at twelve and a one I mentioned it earlier\nNotre Dame I think even with a loss now if Michigan wins the Big Ten I don't see how you'll leave Notre Dame out at eleven in one when they beat Michigan head to head would be twelve in one\nI think the possibility there as Michigan continues to play and right now I think Michigan is the best team in the Big Ten if Michigan continues to win out and play like they are right now than I think Notre Dame even at eleven and one would be and certainly cleansing at Thirteen it would get in I'm not sure that twelve and ... and ward and\nUh I I think that's kind of the picture in general the pack twelve is down to only Washington state\nAs they won last team as much as I Love Michael each we had one of the best interviews we've had on out kicked with my college I don't think Washington state will get to twelve and one to ... which would be necessary probably to put them in the mix\nOr the other aspect here I Would say is if the SEC east team\nTitle game and finds a way to beat Alabama I think the SEC would have a really good\nShot at getting too because based on how Alabama has played and based on how dominant they have banned I don't know how you would leave out a twelve and a one Alabama team that law stay close S. E. C. championship game Alabama's best team in college football they may not win it\nBut they are the unquestioned best team in college football thing that makes college football more entertaining than say the warriors who I Know we're sitting at two in one\nThe warriors have to lose the best of seven series ... could theoretically blues and a one game playoff too I got hurt if he threw three interceptions and suddenly through his first pick of the season and not only through one but through a couple all\nOf that could happen in a one game setting where you only play for sixty minutes of Alabama played a best of seven series against any team in college football I don't think any team in college football could take 'em seven I'm not sure anybody in college football could take um six I think some team in college football could take 'em\nFive All right that is my takeaway college football style Jason Martin what jumps out to you about about the college football weekend that just passed\nNot a ton I is gonna sound ridiculous but I'm not really pulling for Ohio State and it feels bad for their kids because I'd has nothing to do with their kids but I kind of like to watch and Jeff from get them on Saturday Night but I agree with you if they went out they'll still be in the play off\nI think everybody's playing per second you and I said that before the season started Alabama is just that good now because it's a you lose once and you could be out of this thing once we get to the playoffs situation anything could technically happened\nBut you're giving Nick Saban a Lamborghini and he's already got four ... he's never knew I needed the\nLamborghini before and now you've given them to a toggle by law who's just on some other level the combination of him and Judy\nIs ridiculous there's nothing that can be done about it Tennessee didn't even deserve to be on the field and they didn't even play that bad\nAlabama just makes you look at that that their defense is not as dominant as it has been and it doesn't even need to be like this this is the most dominant I have seen a football team in a long time to the extent that when I saw the line come out against LSU who was very good football team and I was totally wrong about\nGoing into this year I still think Alabama is going to cover that easily and maybe blow them out too I just think they're that good that that's going\nOn with you I mean I thought they would have to make that wine fourteen and a half to try to get any kind of LSU money they may have to make at Seventeen um because I think the other thing is you hit on it the defense has not been that dominant\nBought bought and I think this is key\nWhen Nick Saban is going to have a week's to prepare for teams which he is effectively going to have that defense is going to play better and better and they're able to take risks on defense because when you know you're going to when you can pencil and forty five\nAnd feel like hey we're going to score forty five every game and maybe forty five every half honestly if they needed to\nYou feel like almost you're playing tennis against somebody with an incredibly powerful serve\nI this is one of the most ludicrously indefensible sideline moved by a coach that I have seen it a long time did you see these pictures and did you see that video and what side of the of the curtain do you come down on this one\nWill you talk about ludicrous ... there was a great trash can on the field is yes and no go butch Jones has been known for ludicrous sideline moves and ludicrous sideline expressions and ludicrous coaching decisions so there's just kind of\nFalls in line with it yeah I saw it as it happened I saw the video come out and then I saw the video the photos being tweeted from every corner of the earth or we had our teens worth on the radio on Saturday\nPrior to the game and I kind of joked with them off the top and said you know what I went to your Twitter feed and looked at your Twitter bio and it just reached thank God we finally have an A. D. and a head coach\nAt U. T. that tell people feel about Bush Jones the fact that he would I mean all he's doing is opening himself up\nIn that moment he can be in defensively butch Jones because that's what Bush Jones does when I saw that I just rolled my eyes thinking\nDude you're literally smoking a cigar because you had nothing to do with the wind and everything to do with the last like you could actually pin a lot of that loss on butch Joan directly man down here I Am a man's out here with the cigar next to real football players that actually did something\nIt was pretty incredible I also saw the photo of him and Peyton Manning\nTogether before the game and Peyton was kind of laughing and I just wanted to throw a caption out there and I I restrain myself numerous times from it it's just amazing how bad butch Jones was for the University of Tennessee and how he's regarded right now in Knoxville and around the country\nAh here's what our age we're tweeted ... Albert hands or it's obviously a first round draft pick out of Tennessee you went on to a a very lucrative or NFL career he tagged butch Jones he said at coach butch Jones I mean Alabama football one against the team and you all caps put together\nBut you're smoking a cigar like you accomplish something\nYou act like you called the plays or had something to do with the game plan for them does the player next to you even know your name\n... I mean that a a\nFat fatality butch Jones is real first name as while I'm that is a bad is an amazing a wide and I guarantee you this\nPosing at Alabama gear smoking a victory cigar after you recruited the entire team that just got whipped and you got fired and you're making still millions of dollars from the university\nHis career in the south is over there is no one in the south that is remotely gonna touch porch Jones or after behavior like this maybe there's somebody in the Big Ten at a lower level school maybe there's somebody back in the ... which is where I think he probably belongs in ... for all intents and purposes\nNo one in the SEC is going to touch them I mean they have some self respect I mean you're basically talking on yourself when you're celebrating the team that you had nothing to do with destroying the team that you built\nI mean I I just the lack of self awareness blows my mind All right I'm going to hop on a flight I'm going to let you take it going forward or J. Mart you guys have been outstanding you inject shorts or going to be in\nFor our two and our three I Will be back tomorrow through the rest of the week or in a state side and uh I had an amazing time here I think one that is ready for an NFL franchise thats the bit of knowledge I come back from across the pond to where they are ready they want one and they need one over here and I think it would be good for the NFL\nYeah you know it was it was really good scene and be safe on your way back and of course we'll be right back here with you for three hours of out kicked tomorrow but the London

Doug Peterson say aggressive yeah you lost your state aggressive I'm sort of run the football culture war times but give the Panthers credit\nThey fought back their foreign to now are they still have by the way a tough row because they have the AFC North supplies that had the ravens and still are still there at the lives down the line um look out for the lawyers there they're not half bad mother not yeah\nThere are not I mean they're they're like a top seven defense I think right now and one\nPassing defense any of this week as far as ... which is pretty impressive considering that um that's a number I don't like yards per typical yards per like defense yours for gay but past defense I think we can use that number because if your head was lines have been and you still hold teams to you know\nDown all over the past the ball that's that's pretty impressive uh because of the Panthers mandate they they do what they had to do they won this game um little odd minutes before the game but they got over they won a and therefore to the right they're they're a team that\nIs definitely a playoff two hundred percent um are they going to make some damage to the playoffs I don't know we'll see but what can I tell you what you're always in the game um and they and the Panthers play really well November December so they're gonna be a hockey team in the playoffs\nWe will continue to talk about all of the games across the NFL landscape yesterday the good and bad and the bad can start with Jason Garrett\nDeciding what he decided with ... seconds to go in Washington in a big game that a national audience was watching Tony Romo on the call made it that much worse for Jason Garrett we'll talk about that tons more coming up including pat homes is twenty two touchdowns and the fact that said that he needs to turn down all Sunday Night Football games\nGoing forward will tell you why next but before we can get to all that if you've ever driven past the snowy vineyards by I Ninety you've probably wandered whose idea was to grow grapes there\nThat man was eat from Wales bullet took more than twenty two thousand seedlings of grapes to invent the Concord grape fruit ticket thriving cold winters there was either that or moving to Florida and you can ... twenty two thousand attempts that that really wasn't an option for men whose last name was bowl\nThe world's tough is it's accidents Welch as tough as grapes more than ... says day Martin Jeff ticket on clay on his way back from London what does family here on al ...

... ... if you want to win then if you want to you know you want to bring the cowboys back to the glory you got to get off it's a money coach in there and use your off into weapons um\nAnd I don't know if that's Lincoln Riley it could be you know it could be a multitude of of uh maybe guys but um I I think that the uh though see for the Vikings a de Philip votes will be had do growing day yeah he was on the eagles staff last year and a great job I think that people are not talking enough about how good a job\nCousins is doing right now he's doing a fantastic job\nIn Minnesota it's been

had bad home and wrote split support coaching plain and simple for coaching cannot be ready on the road\n[noise] yeah and it's a it's a doubly bad when you got Tony Romo under ... seconds left you got to throw here you can play definitely beforehand because you've got a time out there like it so easy\nHe was ripping the cowboys more often than usual last night and even the ... he was highlighting guys like you just throw the ball here man this guy's opens throw the ball here here's the read it in her throat throw the ball and um did yours that too he's kind of openly I'm\nTrying to be anti Troy Aikman that's nothing against ... Aikman does a lot of cowboys games and he has taken flack I'm not even necessarily suggesting deserves it but he's taken flack for being a little soft on the cowboys when it comes to being critical and Tony Romo was very much the opposite of that\nI feel like a window is pretty soft towards any quarterback I mean he he he ... he has his way to not call out you lie against the eagles or Mrs ... football like he tried his hardest\nHe's just a really nice guy I just don't think he I don't think he has that critic bone in heaven when it comes to that as an addiction because he respects so much the difficulty that goes into playing the quarterback spot right I think Roland us to enroll is a good guy too I just wrote those just to me is so good\nAt what he does human nature to have really kind of\nIt's happened faster than I expected in terms of their chemistry but Nance has figured out yet ... Tony talk\nOr whether it's over the play whether it's over the snap whatever it is I'm just going to like Tony Romo be Tony Romo and that's the very best thing that he could do a in those broadcast\nWell I think you made the point there man is on a chip dance gets enough credit so far because he changed his style of calling a game which he's done for what Thirty years well lately\nChanged it yeah I mean if you haven't ... nowhere near the same guy\nWhen when you call again typically are an analyst useful you shut up as soon as the planes nuts and led gymnasts talk and let him but robo talks over the over anymore right Jim let's talk now through the places he's got a good point he also involves gymnast in the conversation which is very odd like he'll say Jim\nDid you go forward here and that's not something that you really ever do is um\nIn gymnastics usa generally have genuinely have fun with 'cause I bet she learned something every now and in especially in in in in the pre production stuff in the meetings\nA robo just generally seems to love it I watched the the uh the NFL Network football life on Tony Romo I'm just seems like a really humble guy down to earth yes um and it really shows shows in the broadcasting the genuine excitement goes out to force it\nOne of the broadcast tonight or that doesn't quite feel the same way so um he really is a gym and and the you know the CBS struck gold hiring him and even the back story you know CBS\nThen they send the twenty fourteen Super Bowl there they were at a party together and and the CBS executives just met Tony Romo started talking to him and realize right away that\nHe had the courage to do this job and as soon as\nHe retired they they they went after him and they create higher I Love I Love us into him call games and I think you're right though the best part about it as\nHe doesn't he's not an object is to the cowboys right like he just says how it is what I think it's your job to do I suspect I respect you more I think people do respect\nYou as a broadcaster even the cowboys would respect robo for criticizing things if it's fair criticism he's not attacking character he's not attacking I'm the person who's attacking them perform the play which is which is fair and accurate\nYeah ... that's always paid to do any I just he's so spectacular at anytime I hear him start a game I Know he's calling the game I don't even care what the teams or I\nJust want to watch it ah will get throughout urban here on one second but one thing I wanted to point out is if you have not watched this detail series um\nThrough on through the four letter words Peyton Manning breaking down Josh Rosen for a half hour I Can't even describe how good this is I cannot put this silver highly enough listening to Peyton Manning and his cadence and just how conversational he is\nAs he explains the line as he explains\nA you know things that are that seem obvious but that no one does in the NFL basically chastising the Arizona Cardinals for throwing away from the blitz on screens instead of trying to throw it towards the bloody ... any bracelets on screen yeah exactly so he he throws all of this stuff out there\nI learned more and a half hour about the quarterback position\nAnd what Peyton Manning saw when he was playing that I have and probably ten years watching football it is absolutely incredible I mean the closest you get to it it's kind of what you get from Tony Romo but manning doing this is almost unfair\nUh your throat you throw into the screen about what he explained why you throw into the screen and he just kind of city so it's\nYeah because the entire players going in one direction so basically when you throw over their heads and the entire play meaning all of the pretty much everybody on the way it was going in one direction you're trying to throw away from all of that\nYou want to throw you want you want to centers to rush on the screen that's the point of it you want them to Russian you throw right you actually do upfront you don't blockbusters upfront you like even if he if he's your guy technically in the protection you don't walk them you just kind of like get in front of him for a second you just go Boop\n[laughter] just like put your hands up in front of him and he you know he he beat you inside and then you take off down the field or even throw behind your corner pressures you throw behind pressure that that that that's a big ... a big part officers\nYou I've watched the the the clip of the\nESPN posted on ESPN not to show her something posted or their children to watch the entire thing but yeah you do is a great this is a great insight\nInto when they say um you know the quarterback position is so mental and so tough to learn and then you know college people walk all the colleges are so this is it's not close man it's not this is a great example we keep seeing these examples you [laughter]\nThere's so much processing that happens in NFL game a that is way beyond what ever happened in college football and that's why people stress the mental makeup of quarterback so much\nBecause this is it is hard to do and it's hard to just be in an office to call it just does none of this and all of a sudden transitioned to an office in the NFL that puts so much on the quarterback and to have success\nWere brought

the league just passed him by years before he probably was out in LA but the but the lead past them by their these antiquated coaches that are going to continue to do it their way stubborn I think is a good word for it but the league is now showing McVeigh it's\nKyle Shanahan Doug Peterson it is these aggressive play collars and these guys that are incredibly flexible\nAnd adaptable to their schemes and Andy Reid has been around for a long time but he's been willing to adapt he's been willing to change as the times of change which is why I don't think Andy Reid gets enough credit any read takes a lot of flak for time management her you know I haven't struggled at times\nIn the postseason and look those criticisms are valid\nBut if you don't think Andy Reid is just an incredible head football coach in the NFL I don't have I Can't have a conversation with you like it's not okay to have that take any more Andy Reid has an authentic mind is just absolutely outstanding like pat and homes let's say the jaguars and they're having a mess right now\nLet's say that the jaguars the draft him home so they'd be in better shape yes but with pat homes looked like ... does in Kansas City no because of Andy Reid there's just a major difference when you have a guy that is willing to call the kinds of plays to incorporate the kinds of concepts to move to the kinds of schemes\nAll of the stuff that these guys are doing is making the NFL so much fun to watch it's creating a lot of points says well it's opening up these often says it's exploiting the rules that are designed for points\nIt's all it's it's made NFL football\nJust a lot more entertaining because I Want to see what these guys are going to pull out next and where they're going to place their guys in position to succeed and when you put them on spots where\nThe rams had a lot of talent and then you look at that chief team last night my God man diary kill and Kareem haunt\nAnd even where when they have to put him in I mean Sammy Watkins is on the team and it doesn't even matter and save me walking was a guy everybody's going to lay out at ... ... he was in the ... plays I think last night\nUh one was the main completion I Believe that was all I even saw him and Kelsey is\nChelsea just outstanding as well these teams are just loaded with talented athletes across the field on ... which almost makes it like a playground for good officers of color to be aggressive because you trust the personnel you have\nTo deal with the cheese is if you're playing the cheese and you make a single mistake out there you were done they will each you alive and that's what they're doing if if the bangles bales punished twice that's it you're done like unless you stop them somehow and defense which was obviously had\nNo attention to it but Jason ... the real story coming out of the game as Andy Reid cost a lot of people some money that is a it's an issue I knew I knew you'd want even in their\n... to myself how did you know ... you're forty five ten and what are you know what are you doing with the stars and going forward sheer field goal man all of America was rooting for computer oriented read and you didn't do it but that's all it gambling in America it's actually my my brother after the game and said\nThat's a big red cost me I'm Talking to some some some money there but otherwise good game [laughter]\nBut it really well you and your brother playing well last night by the way a sharp again and again yeah yes it's almost like he's good at his job we're\nLike this weird thing he actually he's played the band he's played the bangles now at least ten times in his career right by them or eight times in four years in Cleveland I I Would be hard pressed to find\nTen pressures he allowed in the past ... she owns the bangles they're they're ... they're big they don't move terribly well and my brothers can can handle that really well if you use those guys up so surprised to see him play well but the cheese right foreign one I'm\nLiving there there are six or five of them will certainly one that's already we seven six to one now it seems like they're headed for the as the championship game but unfortunately as some people talk about this yesterday we know the chiefs play off history so let's not get I'm going to be muted and my excitement for the playoffs until\nI see them you know when when one of these schemes and plans because I think the ravens are good I mean yeah he was super your present issues for them obviously chargers we and cause problems in the trial was coming back the kind of on the chargers so they wouldn't either rodents the chargers\nWell what it is I think in sports sometimes owner's business owners and I know you're a baseball got Jason and so why do we see sometimes when a battered just owns a pitcher and you think there's only house as possible and then they just keep getting his off them I you know I'm a I'm a giants when obviously\nI'm like Paul Goldsmith owned two months or something like he owed them like he he was like that it's just wondering if someone's forever reading just he just did and I'm an owner just owners human and the chiefs owned the charges right now it changes your obviously but\nI don't think the chargers I'm excited for the chargers and the plaza some people are miserable ... they're going to lose\nYeah well I mean if the chiefs are playing off in the way the ... and you're going to have to score forty five defeat them\nAnd maybe somebody can do that the team that worries me if I'm uh chief's fan most is the ravens that aims economics that some guys yes because they play actual defense you're absolutely right a guy that plays all fence for us is Alex more of as we will happen next and will continue\nTo

I don't just outlining my everything from ... ... well that's literally impossible but there is\nYeah I mean look at and that's that's the basic go right or all of them are going to remember is Justin soccer you know what I thought it was a cool scene and you know it it's not and and the victory is not for another comeback but when Drew Brees through that five hundred a touchdown pass to bend Watson if you watch the celebration afterward you see Ben go and give drew the football\nAnd say it was number five hundred and gives them this huge hug and I talk within a couple of weeks ago about you know Drew Brees and just how much respect he has for him as a person and as a player they're both almost the same age I mean\nBen's thirty eight years old for forty you know I mean yeah these are the grape or to the NFL right but you know the past the breeze through yesterday on the sideline to trick on Smith\nYou know where Smith had his feet in I mean it was just such a thing of beauty and look at it's an incredible often see the whole thing with the the saints has always been cutting their defense hold up and they did enough to get the job done I mean Greece had never won in Baltimore before\nRavens coming off an eleven ... performance against the titans I I give them a lot of credit that was that type of gritty when that sometimes you don't see from the saints because they're not regarded as a very good road team or the thing is though that scheduled not going to be getting very money here I I Believe\nFor four or five said so but you know with Caroline and winning that does continue to put the heat on them but become Sunday night match up next week as they had to Minnesota to play the Vikings gotta someone's gotta stop out on the one that's on point right\nMaybe not [laughter] you\nJust want away from what the NFL record now I think he's one away from Calvin Johnson a hundred yards streak he's got seven games he needs that age and he may well get it on Sunday Night Football I was more of as our guest here on out take the coverage or let's talk about the cowboys\nAnd how they had that game maybe and then there was a bad penalty I Want to know first how you feel about the penalty being called that changed the forty seven to a fifty two yard field goal\nAnd also Jason Garrett deciding not to take a shot with a timeout with eleven seconds left and no sense of urgency for the cowboys dolphins in the final minute of that game either\nFence laissez faire off for the Dallas Cowboys hey you know what we could have just moved a little closer but why bother hey we have a time out or kick her should make it you know one thing and and Jeff can maybe a test of this to it 'cause I thought there was a real interesting Twitter stream last night from Jacob Tammy\nTalking about how the snapper you know and you saw him he was spinning with a football yeah you know yeah and you know the thing is is if a team they could go to the official and say look we saw this on film this this guy is\nDoing something could you please make it a point of emphasis to watch and see if they're trying to draw off sides and you know I notice that the ball wasn't moving around nearly as much\nOn the snap for fifty two yard says it was for forty seven\nSo he's doing a little gimmicky thing hoping to get off sides hoping to get his team five yard maybe it was even subconsciously I don't know I don't have a problem with that you know I I mean and look fifty two yards in today's NFL you got to make the kick man you know what I'm saying is not this isn't like he was trying to do something like ... fifty nine yards to win the game for the buck\nFifty two yards as a makeup will feel go and he missed and that was it and of course chasing Garrett didn't do as kicker any favors either\nBy putting him in that position I just again for the cowboys so it's just this is how it's going to be one week they're going to be up and they're going to look great and we're going to be praising the coaches for the game plan and the next week\nThey're going to be down and for whatever reason now the cowboys it used to be a terrible a home team may because there were living large before the game I don't know now there are terrible row team and they win at home go figure it's an eight and a division nine and seven I mean look everybody's is ... I mean the giants are horrendous right and you know for the for the cowboys at its week to week\nRedskins do they show any consistency I mean there there we tweak to it just you know until the teams are stringing together like a three game winning streak honestly might be the most do we get in this division\nThis year it's just it's just a bad year for the NFC East\nTell me what you feel about the titans decision to go for two yesterday at the end of the game against the chargers in London\nAnd then the play called not to go with the quarterback sneak and trying to throw the ball to receivers that had well not caught the ball very well pretty much all season long how did you feel about both of those calls\nYou know here's the thing I don't have a problem with him doing what he did one going for too because I think his defense was cast in the way the charters were playing in the way Philip Rivers was moving the ball up and down the field I think he thought you know and it's like the ... call from a couple you know we're still talking about it from two thousand uh nine\nWhen he went for it again the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday Night Football deep in Colts territory because he just knew his defense wasn't wasn't going to be able to make the stop I think might very well felt the same way about about the way\nHis team was playing so let's go ahead you know to let's put it in our hands to win this game play call itself you know look in the thing is that when it comes to criticize him play calling I mean I I like to think that these teams when it comes to a game planning\nLook at analytics look at the highest percentage of success I obviously some of 'em don't just asked my McCoy right and he's out of a job right now in Arizona\nEveryone figured out he just likes to send a running back up under center and that's it and everyone stops and and now he's got no gig but I mean so that that plays tough yeah I mean look you could do a lot of spectacular things that markets Mario to probably wasn't the best use of him but\nIt was and I I'm not a big fan of the defensive coordinator I think ... floor I mean remember he was not the first choice by my anger able to to run this and he's the first time offenses coordinator\nAnd he's someone who's still trying to feel this way and and let's be honest here too I mean with this tendency team I think some some you know we can bashing like malarkey all we want right and you know say what it was exotic smash mouth and he was only going to get this team so far but when we look back at it how much was he covering up for some deficiencies I'm Marcus Mario to that are now being exposed\nYou know in this type of often it's just not a dynamic passing team and he doesn't have the weapons to have a dynamic\nPassing team so that's what you get I mean you know it's just a team that sort of a middling team looked ... they'll pop up the window when their shirt games but you know what on paper\nShould be they they I think they should be a better team than you know ... what they are now ... when you look at what they have on paper but it just seems like they're sort of destined for eight mate which in that division by the way again another lousy division of these out that maybe what they're headed toward you know and it makes it will keep them in a toward the end\nWe're going to ask you about that she's obviously the reformers last night forty five ten everyone's going to focus on on ... and and rightfully so but that you sent us quietly started\nTo play a lot better as has gone where did you notice from that defense to get them to play just a ... a Smith's better it's better than they were and I think that's enough to win ballgames without often\nWell I mean the Ford is is living up to that billing you know what I mean that that you know first round billing and by the way in a contract here so very fortuitous for him to have the type of season and\nIt's funny when he was drafted back in twenty fourteen John Dorsey said he thought he was the second best pass Russia and the draft and he got 'em in the twenties remember there were a couple of guys taking ahead of him today ... among them but he really felt that strongly about the Ford another Diaz healthy\nHe's doing better Chris Jones is is a bit of a game record on the inside remember to Anthony Hitchens learning a new defense he's had to settle down some Torino Daniel got some snaps yesterday and the secondary you know the communication part issue trade I mean you have you're losing their on their six different safety I Believe if I'm not mistaken\n... like you know you gotta have guys back there that are traffic cops and Eric Barry was supposed to be that guy and with him being out\n... it's been a difficult transition for this team but I think we're ... settled down now he's playing better football and look how many you know ... before we to offer too much\nIt's for this chief defense let's remember this is the same group that gave up ten thousand yards with a New England patriots the week before\nSo I I'm not a it's a it's a week and we think and what was so\nWeird about the game last night was it really felt like you know it was almost like a squash match and pro wrestling right like you knew the champion going in and then some ... he was going to stick around for five minutes to get the pinball and then you know be sent to the interviewer right I mean because that's\nReally the Bengals got such short shrift there were regarded as just you know they were there to just you know be the patch the Washington general so to speak as the Kansas City chiefs just tripled up and down the court draining threes and that's exactly what they did and and again same old bangles right and onto the perfect by the way it is there like a huge buffet in Cincinnati that no one's turned\nMe onto before this man is large and he's yellow\nHe is looking like he is at least Fifteen pounds overweight and again what does he adds to the Cincinnati defense at this point I mean\nA lot of talk about a lot of production walked all night that's what he adds\nUp you know terrible I mean just you know but again it's the bangles they they do the sort of stuff to themselves and primetime games Andy Dalton just comes up small I mean I Know it'd be the ravens earlier this year but look at his prime time record to spend most team just withers and that's why there and also ran and there'll be seven and nine and we'll be talking about Marvin Lewis at the end of the year\nThe bangles or George South but that was more of a not a really appreciated that reference Alex all was a blast talking to you will catch will catch you again soon\nIt does it go to\nThe vet out more of us on Twitter [noise] I don't see any of that ad says no I Know\nYou're not supposed to that's that's that's me in a north right there which I'm not going to make more now for for for a regular basis was bringing route verve and find out what happened last night and also this morning rake roost released from jail\nYelling in Charlotte yes exactly Jeff I'm sure excited to hear that news they re route was released from prison after Eighteen years this morning there in Charlotte North Carolina that after a he was in prison for conspiracy to commit murder [noise]\nYeah no that's not a fun story so we'll move on to Kansas City dominating Cincinnati on Sunday night match more homes three hundred fifty yards passing for touchdowns in a forty five ten decision the rams now seven in ... for the first time since Nineteen eighty five\nThey took care of the forty niners thirty nine to ten Baltimore failing to convert that game time ph D they start a New Orleans twenty four twenty three and it
