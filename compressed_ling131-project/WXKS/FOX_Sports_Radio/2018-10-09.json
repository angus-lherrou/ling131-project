I'm ... in different ways one of them is he says look we need to encourage a property owning democracy\nIn other words workers will be less ... less dangerous if they have a stake in society they own

my family you can walk [noise] Ninety four or five and what did you manage to keep on talking twelve hundred and I heard radio station [noise]\nFox Sports trendy and\nYou go to bed on that happening back to back years lightning strike striking the bottle back to back years living on bell is out there\nYou can get him he's an elite talent\nHe wants to play for your team all you have to do is give up some draft picks they're replaceable there ever noble resource every year you get new draft picks you can figure out the salary cap if there's a will there's a way you can get him and work out a deal so when we know again I I don't\nWant this to happen because uh I I don't have any skin in the Philadelphia Eagles camp I in fact I I Hope the opposite happens I Hope they think that window small what's going to be the second coming because that is the eagles go out and get let me on bill that makes them more of a legit contender against Iran's\nNFC now that the party shot if the eagles cannot work out a trade for Lebanon about which I Believe they can well let's say they ... let's say Pittsburg will not budge and they're being stubbornness or we're not going to do anything here or we don't want to trade levy on bell\nSo you've got to have a plan B gotta have a fallback plan this one's a hobby\nI the obvious fallback plan would be a shady lady or this case a shady running back\nAt buffalo not only ... contender I Know it was impressive the Josh Allen pass was eighty two yards and no touchdowns very impressed\nWith the move here right you contact to build you say shady come all the Sean McCoy who's done a better job will lead alluding a police in detectives any has defenders this season\nFormer eagle comeback he was collateral damage during the chip Kelly era\nAnd shady McCoy could work as a stopgap for the rest of your plug you mean ... is a free agent so who knows maybe you'll be here more than one year but that's that's the other ...\nThe a move\nYou go out and get living on bill B. move shady McCoy\nThat's it that's the list that's\nAll I got I spent another show on Fox we say hello to Edmund Dallas [noise]\nReally [noise]\nGarcia we got three of the four slots filled in baseball there's one seat left in the final four and that's going to go to either the red Sox who are went away or the Bronx bombers we'd have to win in Fenway in game five that's all that's left ...\nYeah that's absolutely correct and uh\nBoston looking looking pretty good I Know it was a you know just blog score in in the game last night but uh you gotta think the red Sox already because\nAll my guys in Boston though told me that the sky was following after they lost\nIn game two at Fenway that they were doing there was over and they couldn't when they got a bunch\nOf Mr soft these on the team so are you just barely preserve the moment that either you being a reactionary media person because the red Sox scored sixteen what runs at Yankee Stadium you not think they're going to usually when you go sixty runs you come back to school like two runs or one run the next game don't you\n[noise] um I don't know about that but I certainly don't expect the score sixteen rose again but now I think Boston's to clearly the better team uh\nThey showed that during the regular season they show that he had to have lower Yankees you're\nAdmitted was closed a during the regular season it was close and the reason was close the Yankees won a hundred games the red Sox won a hundred and eight because they had a better record against the Orioles so really came down to who did better against the Orioles\nThey also had a much better record it gets the Yankees and\nThe nod uh know tightened up it was a ... the red Sox they want a few more games but it wasn't like an oil lopsided over the ...\nI guess you think the red Sox are in trouble I think the red Sox are going to close it out in the next game\n[noise] so you think they win tonight goes five\nRoberta going five so you guys about the on the mountain\nGot poor cello and ...\nThat's the match so bad for you\nAs I Am amazed Everytime Sebastian pitches a great give I always think I could get a hit off the bat at this point so I'm shocked I'm always shocked when Sebastian pitches a good game\nAnd you're going to hear all the cliches about a grizzled veteran and a locker room presidents and how the young players love him and all that stuff that\nGo on and on and on and on a and\nI look at what do you have against grizzled veteran spin no it's just ... what it is [laughter] I look at so bad the it as a declining performer declining athlete\nAnd I and I get the whole war horse thing and all those those buzz terms that are thrown out but he's not that good of you should be able to score runs the problem for the red Sox is their kryptonite left handed pitcher\nAnd so that's the Yankees figure hey they Jay half though he pitched in game one how'd that work at\nAll just have a lot of that hopefully we meet the red Sox in the world series we're not talking about the Dodgers were in our brain to calm down rivers wearing a Dodger had an Dodgers and underwear probably yeah locked in man and shorts is all about and talks he's all about it\n\nAnd I met ... pirates are not playing right now are very upset about that\nAnd he doesn't watch the pirates when they're not good he didn't even pay attention oh hey he's out he checks out\nKind of like Dodger fans in LA they can't watch their team period because that\nIs true or not it it's amazing there's so many people that are like into the Dodgers in LA they haven't been on television years because you could watch it on TV\nThey're just excited now that we're not nearly feed them\nWell technically you're not allowed to Roberta unless you're violating the major league baseball laws yeah that's what I'm doing yes okay [laughter] oh you're kidding of course yeah never just an area that is that would be wrong inappropriate yeah yeah I can yeah that was a red\nSox this year were eighty seven thirty atheist right handed pitching Twenty one and sixteen in his left handed pitcher five games above five hundred against left handed pitching and I came to the weather is forty nine games about five hundred against right handed pitching so that's why so bad here\nIs on the mound for the Yankees tonight or it's been out of the show

L. history when it comes to passing your niche\nMatthew Stafford\nOn pace right now to eventually passed Drew Brees and become the all time passing yards a leader in the history of the NFL\nSo in like six or seven years\nSo that kind of gives you a sense of how much do we get involved Drew Brees a first ballot\nNo doubt NFL hall of famer I think a lot of you out there hearing Matthew staffer all time passing leader in the NFL and that kind of strikes eight discord it no with you\nBut it's more a function or at least as much of a function of talent as it is just the way the game is involved but take nothing away from Drew Brees what he's been to New Orleans money is meant to New Orleans when he and Sean Payton have accomplished is phenomenal we got a loaded show for you let me go ahead and hit you with a couple of baseball or outcomes as well\nOr the Houston Astros have advanced into the\nUh AL us yes they will be playing a as yet undetermined opponent\nBecause we got a big win for the Boston Red Sox a huge win for the Boston Red Sox on the road in Yankee Stadium the red Sox going up to one in that series\nSo we'll see whether we get a pay off game in uh in Fenway Park or whether the red Sox could close it out tonight so all of that is still to come but\nThe Astros advance wants more your defending World Series champion this is what it sounded like when the Astros won their division around series\nEric rounds hitting right side Yuri all habits\nHe under Hans ... first and that if the ball game they use that as far as that parents and the American league championship series they defeat the Indians are limited brain and when the series three games to none\nAnd also the LA Dodgers going up against the Atlanta Braves Manny Machado put away this game late\nWith a a I think it was a three run Homer to run home or whatever the heck it was anyway the Dodgers took care of the Braves and then our lock it in show came on at best one I Hope you guys enjoyed that last night here is what it sounded like is the Dodgers advance into the uh in El uh she asked for the third straight year\nThree balls two strikes to a father of the night Jansen do Freeman\nDidn't miss strike three Dodgers beat her age six and for the third consecutive seasons the Dodgers are going to the national league championship series\nSo it's only Yankees Red Sox left now in major league baseball as we get that to complete the A.

Brees as health he goes to the dolphins do you have any doubt that Nick Saban won at least one Super Bowl is not a couple if he had had the ability to coach Drew Brees with the dolphins\nI ... I don't see how he you know he couldn't have put himself in that position because we know what he would have done the defense of side of the ball and helped me with something real quick quick real quick track I mean ... when we talk about Nick Saban how many times have you heard the same narrative about what a failure it was in Miami for him\nWas any five hundred or so left Miami and\nIf the short run so I always kind of step back and say I don't know you guys if you're talking failure rate he left we don't know and just as you said breezes come now he would've had to have adapted on off at to accentuate were breeze would have done best\nBut I don't have any doubt that he would have the great coaches typically do\nBear Bryant switched up to the wish bone to rejuvenate his coach and career and Alabama and that's when we saw some of the best we've ever seen [laughter] they just go right down the line the best ones always do with the players that they have\nYeah team doctors they still like you know it was Dante colpepper and it was health and we understand it it happens from time to time but boy the what if it would have been something wouldn't it and Alabama fans who knows how it would have turned out who would have been that coach in Alabama and likely would have been coaches\nNot just Nick Saban on a run\nNo you're a hundred percent right and I always when people say oh he was such a failure at a at the dolphins I always go back and say wait a minute this guy beat mix say this guy beat bill ballot jak twice in the four games that he coached against them and I think statistically filled the worst game Tom Brady has ever had\nI Believe was a Nick Saban coach defense in that second year uh with the dolphins going up against ballot jak the difference was ... Brady\nAnd Nick Saban I Believe had Jay Fiedler Dante colpepper and whatever else ah you know not quite anywhere near the same caliber of players down with him in a in Miami and do your point on evolution\nWe've seen Nick Saban oval substantially because he had to a ball just substantial lead to beatnik Marshall and that all burned or off off its remember I mean when they were just out there was only given scoring points like crazy even bringing in Lincoln was a pretty big evolution\nAnd then I don't know how much you've got to watch to a ... of who we are talking about Iowa it not just the best quarterback Nick Saban Democrat I was looking at that through his first six darts Charles\nIt's the greatest six starts that any quarterback has ever had in the history of college football we're again we're not just talking and and and that's in people say well they haven't played any body\nThat if you compare his six starts with everybody who is one Heisman Trophy in the modern era over like the last Twenty years their best six games so the best six games at Baker Mayfield ever played the best fix that the J must win the never played\nThe best fix that Cam Newton never played the best fix the T. Bo ever played it's impossible to find somebody who's been better through six games regardless of competition than to has been for Alabama through the six games\nAnd it tells you that when he made the move in the championship game against Georgia realizing that if you're going to if you have to throw the football he has to be the one because Jay Lynn hurts\nUnfortunately and I say unfortunately because I've gotten to know him just a little bit and I really like the young man but unfortunately that he's not he's not going to be the guy is going to bring you back in that situation if not his strength\nHe can do so many other things well but that's not one of them in my own humble opinion but when he went out there and played it wasn't just off the shelves of balloons at night right there were errors there's an interception ... there was this there was that\nBut the point is that he had and what do you maintain and I still go back to winning touchdown it wasn't so much of a beautifully thrown ball and the guy lays out and catches it it's what he did it was all the quarterback things he did in the pocket\nHolds the safety would stare down the middle to make sure he can't get to the outside portion of the field he did all that and what do you have in in the season sixty snapped or so\nYes All right so so you're talking about a kid that just well trained but has enough presence to carry that over to the biggest game he may ever play in his life because nothing's ever promised beyond that and then of course from that point on\nThat is why I kept hearing all the stuff in the offseason about who's no you know who's gonna play quarterback I was like they passed the torch that night you don't go back\nYou can say whatever you want but you don't go back and I sit here in Orlando, Florida with this kid named McKenzie Milton UCF out at this the best quarterback in the country well\nTo it's hard for me to say that he's not because of what he's doing and where he's doing it but I'm telling you these two kids are both Hawaiian kids whatever they're doing it Hawaii [laughter] we need to get over there and get a piece of that\nBecause to his younger brothers committed Alabama's well since they moved to Tuscaloosa and Jordan Tama move Hawaiian kidded old mess I go right down why these kids can flat out plus whoever's doing the training there we need to get a piece of that\nThere's no doubt and I'm Marcus Mario to obviously you've had a a great deal of success and I should mention that to a has had a better six games threats Mario to ever had at Oregon too which again I think speaks to how unbelievable his performance has been in general\nAre we talked to a lot about the uh the giant side of the drama you've got the Carolina Panthers for a second straight week coming up you got the Redskins obviously coming off of this Monday Night football loss\nIs cam back in your mind to MVP caliber cam which is what the ah certainly Panthers fans want to see from him or in your mind is he still not quite back to that\nA sort of a unbelievable season that he had a couple of years ago\nNow he's back the MVP caliber cam to me and I know a through two interceptions last ball game but I thought that he got crossed up by a young tight end on one of them um ball ball was place where it was supposed to be in the tide and screwed up the route that's just what I saw I may be wrong [noise]\nHis ability to run the football\nWhich was supposed to be curbed you can go back to two seasons ago when Robert of air we gotta get get to get the heads off and we have in doing that and he's like I don't think that's going to be happening but north Turner coming in and everybody said well he'll restricted to the guy who did the narrative is just so wrong every time that people don't study\nOkay north Turner was coaching pity Bridgewater in Minnesota\nThat said he's not the biggest movement quarterback you've ever met so shatter that stereotype\nBut he adapted to what he can do and teddy went to the pro ball under ... Turner you know obviously the Troy Aikman one is the one that keeps coming out Alex Smith was part of north Turner's group people forget that with San Francisco so he understands how to how to use quarterbacks to utilize your legs well to me he is back in that form\nHe made some place in our ball game where he actually\nThey just laughed at people and ran over them he threw a block that knocked it outside line backer dead on his back on a on a on a play with the more ... it's just crazy what you're saying now is throwing the Baltimore accuracy these ever thrown at that part of that is what North Turner's brought to the office but\nYes I Do believe he is back in that form as Carolina keeps winning and put together a nice drank we will be discussing him obviously ... Holmes the hottest ticket going right now and rightly so breezes off to an incredible start again\nBut what cabinet means to his Panthers team is similar to what it what he was in two thousand Fifteen when they went to a Super Bowl and do that for a second Christian McCaffrey doesn't help open up a whole lot of possibilities and lasting clay memo to everyone who watches football\nYes Christian McCaffrey can run inside\n[laughter] which I you know when I say I have to do it this way but that was a big debate between me and my fellow analysts when he came out of Stanford and I stood out a big table and said he can run inside he can run inside everybody kept saying he couldn't\nYou are right on that when there's no doubt that you know one of the few I guess well I gotta jump up and down for that I\nTaught for three hours every day so trust me I swing it is that all it would make contact every now and then a on a daily opinions\nI'm all for rookie quarterbacks I Know you broke them down as they came through the NFL Draft all four of them are one or their games on Sunday which is a pretty big deal\nWhen you think about for young rookie quarterback from Josh Rosen Sam Darnell Baker Mayfield and Josh Allen to all when what have you seen from those guys now that they're all starting in the NFL\nUh to me Baker Mayfield\nHas been the most impressive 'cause he looks just like he did at Oklahoma which is what I look for it I'm sure on some level which you're just talking about with Christian McCaffrey is\nCan you translate what you did at the college level to the NFL level because if you can you're going to be really successful Baker may feel to me has been the most impressive but those four but I've seen glimpses from all of them to suggest that they could be pretty good\nYeah I Would agree with that and you know the week before all those quarterback thrown for\nSo typical rookie year you go from downed up there is just how it is Mayfield everything you said is is spot on in my opinion\nI saw the same thing for Texas Tech teammates wanting to play for him people wanting to make extra place for him you see more plays being made\nBecause he's out there you know that catch it can be a tough catch for receiver it gets made you know what I mean is that type of a deal that's what he brings plus she's a heck of a football player let's not overlook that and take leadership and turn it into\nEverything he's a really good quarterback was only going to get better Josh Allen tough hard nose kid that maybe didn't get credit for that people forget it get kicked around a little bit because they didn't get the offers out of high school with a junior college with Wyoming\nAnd Peyton Manning had already prepared a video to congratulate Drew Brees and this is what it sounded like it's pretty outstanding it was released a exactly as Drew Brees made I made the record on last night's game ears Peyton Manning reacting to being passed\nPay that's why I Drew Brees just wrote a rare or which one\nPressure your ... supposed to have touched on record right he's a right to to what great [laughter] drew\nFor a thousand days are held the record for all time passing your orange federal I got to tell you it's been the greatest a thousand days of my wife\nAnd thanks to you\nThat's over now and you ruined it for me so\nThank you very much or milk being left to work for two except slicing tomatoes making dinner for my family putting together this which is our [noise] also led to service a congratulations for the touchdown record because as you can see I'm very busy I don't have time to keep doing these videos for your congratulating\nBut in all seriousness drew congratulations on this record you've done it the right way all your hard work and dedication have paid off\nYou would have come a long way since this picture back in two thousand when you were in college and I was in my third year in the NFL so where do you go proud of you good luck the rest of the war\nIt's pretty outstanding I don't know that anybody\nIn the history of sports has been funnier and better off the field in terms of his persona than Peyton Manning I mean\nThe guy is still on every commercial break in every just about NFL broadcast it seems to me\nAnd uh I again I mean if you think well there have been great corporate spokesperson who have made a ton of money for the companies that are paying them Michael Jordan is the gold standard for his impact in what he did for Nike\nBut in terms of his overall impact and how well he's done for a variety of different clients are across the board Peyton Manning stuffed a top\nAnd you know that's an underrated aspect of the NFL ratings being down ... percent\nRoughly over the past couple of years is we haven't really talked about Dan Wetzel we add on yesterday wrote a great column on this\nHis argument was that Peyton Manning leaving the NFL had a Michael Jordan like impact relatively speaking for the NFL overall interest level\nThat there were tons of people out there who enjoyed watching Peyton Manning go up against Tom Brady and without that storyline some people just laughed and didn't stick with the NFL\nAnd I always think the NFL likes to fancy itself as the next may end up league they don't necessarily brand their superstars in the same way that the NFL MBA does for instance\nI think there is no doubt that when LeBron James decides to retire the NBA will be hurt because whether you like LeBron James or not he provoke say reaction\nSame thing was true a Peyton Manning certainly in the NFL the same thing is true of Tom Brady whenever Brady decides to stop playing I think the overall league will have an impact but that is again just ate perfect tone\nFrom Peyton Manning who has been the best I think public persona figure of his era in the world of football and I'm not even sure there's a close second\nBrady tried to of lake kind of open up and stop being as much of the Iceman\nBut the Brady a and manning dynamic\nManning was kind of every man the average guy who happens to be good Brady he's always been kind of that remote Iceman like figure you're married Victoria's Secret supermodel\nYou have this like lifestyle that doesn't necessarily seem that similar to everybody else out there who watches football and manning is always tried to brand himself as a regular guy who happens to be good at football in that\nClip congratulating Drew Brees perfect evidence of it when we come back I Will have the immortal\nUh five bottom five for you

Sports trendy and\nFill on Monday Night football the sci fi the Redskins forty three tonight CSI New Orleans quarterback Drew Brees the process through through for three hundred sixty three yards and three touchdown fears\nSo a down the stretch 'em I em remember I mean I don't think they played the rams yet right so you can basically pencil and who else two different losses there are in that division just based on those games alone [noise]\nI think Josh Rosen can improve over the season and certainly that's the tests that you got for the cardinals has how good good Josh Rosen be as we said earlier all for rookie quarterback so one games are but those to me are the are the five worst teams in the NFL and by the way if I were ranking the rookie quarterbacks right now [noise]\nIf I were making the rookie quarterback in the NFL I think Baker Mayfield is clearly the best I Would say that Sam Darnell has been the second best I Would I Would say rows and we don't have a lot of uh of film on him and he hasn't played that much you be the third best Josh Allen's not very good [noise] I\nMean I watch the entirety of his game against the against the tight\nMan he can run though I mean if you're a big guy\nIf your argument is that you can run well and you're a quarterback it ain't going well for you um they were awful on often I mean that's why the titans have to just be kicking themselves in the face over and over again over finding a way to lose that game I mean the titans turned it over three times\nAnd didn't just turn it over they turned it over near midfield or better position for the bills because otherwise the bills couldn't do anything offensively scramble for one touched down on a broken play 'em and uh otherwise like virtually nothing about the through for like fifty five yards I mean this uh\nI mean that's an unbelievable ... so those would be my bottom five and by the way the bills are out of the bottom five because they've managed to beat both the titans and the Vikings into games they shirts or certainly shouldn't have on my top five\nMy top five in the NFL right now I Will count down in reverse order they had to buy week\nBut they're elevating because everybody else's falling around them the bears the bears are three and one they could be for no if they hadn't given up a ... point lead against the Green Bay Packers ah I've got the bears at the number five overall team I'm Still not convinced mixture of is he is the answer\nYou did there are six touchdown passes against Tampa Bay buccaneers so I've got the bears in the five spot they're leading the NFC North right now\nIn the force bought I got the bangles I think at some point your resume stands for itself if you are born one and there are hardly any other teams that have gotten for when so far in fact there's only four teams in the entirety of the NFL with four wins through five weeks\nAnd I've got the bangles at the number four overall spot and the three we saw him play last night they dominated the Washington Redskins they are the New Orleans saints they've lost their open or forty eight forty of the box\nSince then they have been all dialed in beating everybody\nIn front of them they're leading the NFC South which one of the best divisions in football the St that for a new one in second spot I thought they were just okay on the road against the Seahawks the rams five into in the number to spot and number one the best team in the NFL right now\nHaven't seen any weaknesses their defense perform pretty well against the jags they are going on the road against the patriots this weekend and we'll see whether the chiefs can get to stick to know [noise]\nI don't think there's any doubt the best team in the NFL so far through a five weeks of the season is the Kansas City chiefs any disagreement with that five Danny gee no that's a\nPretty solid five the one team I Would say with an honorable mention that surprising a lot of people the Panthers\nYeah the Panthers than at three in one but they needed a sixty three yard field goal to beat the giants so I knocked them out that's why I had the bears in there\nAt three in one or the other team certainly that you can make an argument for based on the way they played the last couple of weeks is the uh the the patriots but we'll see what happens with the patriots against the chief this weekend if the patriots can go out and win that game\nThan uh I think you'll have to say okay this September doldrums or over the patriots have won three games in a row in her sitting at foreign to the chiefs go on the road and when\nThey knock the patriots back to three and three arguably and it certainly will talk a lot about this game all week as we start to pivot our attention towards the

they started the clock ticking I'm this this rams teams that are going to take any mercy on them they don't care they have their own injury issues but this is another blowout loss for Vance Joseph I think that's the beginning of the end for him as a coach here in Denver\nWhat do you think in general about replacing a coach during the season there was obviously a lot of talk about whether Vance Joseph was going to be the guy or in the off season he survives he comes back that like I said that the Broncos play pretty well on Monday Night football\nAnd then it just seems like the wheels come off in this game when you look ahead like you said you look at this a schedule\nThe rams are coming to town against the Broncos are then you've got the cardinals are then you've got the chiefs so on the road I mean two of the next three are against two of the best teams right now in the entirety of the NFL what happens like the does he is he coaching by the time\nThe Broncos are playing against the Texans in November\nYeah I think that's going to be an interesting question I think obviously there's a natural there's a natural break where you're going to make a move you can do it after the Arizona game 'cause it's a Thursday night game and you have ten days to try to figure out you know what the replacement is\nUm do they ask you to be asked to come back and finish the last part of the season he's part of the organization he's over there every day he's helping you know he's helped bring the scouting yourself with a bunch of different things so um do they ask him to come back to the coach I I don't know what the answer is there\nBut I think that would be the natural break now it Gary says no I'm not going to do that I just don't feel comfortable doing that I don't know who on that you on that coaching staff\nYou would make an interim coach I mean when you go through their coaching staff build coal large seems to be the guys on the line go just really respected around the league\nBut do you make that move is that your guys at the most grave the officer corps and it just doesn't seem like there's a natural guy\nTo select on that staff as it's currently constructed so would that seems to me to be there to would be the the natural break there if you get blown out by you get blown up by the rams you need a very well on Thursday night\nTo a team that's really not very good in Arizona um that would be the natural break to me\nI Know it's still early in the season but he's making Eighteen million dollars a year and the defense was this story and the performance against the jets but\nWhat's the verdict on ... or so far in terms of his tenure with the Broncos is this the guy that you've watched and thought okay I can see this guy being the the quarter back here\nFor the next four or five years and he can make a you know this is home or is this seem more like a temporary sort of a fix as opposed to a long term relationship\nWell you know it's interesting because we had this discussion orange clay and everybody was like listen\nA case team them is is a guy that you're gonna have to run the ball you're going to have to support or you're going to have to have good players around him um he's ... he's got great timing he's got all these different things but there was always the caddy out of he's not going to waste a franchise on his shoulders you've been a journey minute for a long time for a reason that a great season last year you gotta support the guy\nAnd as soon as you don't do that is a franchise everybody's like well taste is the right guy it's time to go get chat Kelly they call 'em swag swag get there's this fascination with backup quarterback that you saw play you know against\nThird team players in the ... you know and vanilla pre season games and they that's the answer book and you know and it's funny because everybody on my show here locally in Denver was testing or you know our text line saying well look all your quarterbacks one\nSo it must be the quarterback that you you should have gotten a record or play jak Kelly well you know I mean ... sand Arnold completed about forty seven percent of his passes a you know not one of them do not want him how to complete a percentage over ... over sixty percent of the fifty eight was that high\nFor Baker Mayfield so I'm like palm down it wasn't necessarily quarterback because you can put it almost Seventy percent of his passes\nFor three hundred and Seventy seven yards to CDs and warning or section ... it's that they can't protect them\nThat they gave up force actually gave up a bunch of pressures if they sit back and throw it fifty one times like they did they'll lose every one of those games I it whether it's Kay skill or whether it's you know young quarterback that you're talking about the future with or so\nAnd already they're very impatient here in Denver when it comes to ... and I think he's the guy that if you support him correctly um that he can win games but obviously that's not happening right now at this stage\nYou got the Broncos rams coming up this weekend you'll be calling it for Fox we're talking to march layers go follow him on Twitter at ... when you look at the rams and you look at the chiefs I think there are unquestionably the two best teams or through five weeks in the NFL which seems better\nYeah interesting a citizenship question I think it's the rams are\nBased upon I think they have a much better you know much better personnel grouping um they've had some injuries on their defensive side you know he has been out he's going to be out for another four or five weeks but\nUm I think the rams have got that kind of talent I think the thing that that you know the similarities between the two officers with all the jet motions and unique motions and you know all the you know all the with the quarterback is doing for both of those franchised I think that makes them\nI'm very similar in the way they go about their business so I think that part is great I think both from\nThe coaching standpoint the plate going oh both those had coaches are just so aggressive just you know throw cost him with a when we're not a ... to make a mistake we're just going to go after you\nOn a consistent basis so the similarities there\nAre great but I mean the rams are better team raw Shariah wise overall\nThrough five weeks or the raiders sitting at one in four I Know you're out in Denver so you're not that close to Oakland but the forty niners I think you can kind of you watch them play\nI think you can make the injury argument with the forty niners raiders that one in four surprise you how bad they've been what would you kind of a strategize in an analogize there when it comes to how John Gurdon has returned to the NFL\n[noise] well I mean obviously it's hard to get wins and I think they're rosters the oldest roster and football you know that's that's always been the deal with them and I think uh\nYou know I think all sorts of league um ... numbers in and I'm a male and the long run they'll be okay on the office of settled law I just think defensively\nUm I I think they struggle defensive a link from your roster standpoint they struggle\nAnd ... you started coupling that with losing your best overall player in kind of the culture setter in gloom acting and it's just a recipe for disaster I mean that's one of those things I've always said this about rosters in general you got to know who the guys are on a football team they can't mess with\nUm the guys that mean that much to the [noise]\nLayers within not walk world and the guys who set the temple and help set the culture at\nYou know I did a Chicago game and they raved about and we take a little note for two weeks now and he's changed our football team he's changed the culture of football team he's changed the way we practice is changed the way we meet he is the like as good as he is a football player he's a better person who's a better human being\nAnd how do you let that go from Iraq or\nHow do you know figure out how to create a or figure out a deal for that guy\nAnd you are all the players in Oakland when they already was traded they like they were shocked that this may it couldn't believe it\nAnd there's certain guys and they're not always ... sometimes sometimes it's a back up dude it's just the tempo in practice on the look squad sometimes it's the backup guy that is your best special teams player that brings love that he did a locker room that everybody loves ties the office of defense to gather\nAnd those are the guys you have your finger on the ... of who provide that for you that's the building the walk from that connectivity Milwaukee ... you'd better have your ... year old bulls because when you get rid of those guys\nThat that one dude in that law that doesn't go into some type of phone and I know you know you're supposed to be a professional or you're a professional athlete\nBut at the same time you're acumen and you lose those people and I mean it's devastating to log rolling out is that guy and and now you let that guy leave because you don't want to figure out a way to make the money work is beyond me\nLast question for mark ... again he's going to have the rams on the road against the Broncos this coming weekend in Denver\nWhen you look at Drew Brees and what his career has met last night becoming the all time passing leader what did you think watching that game what is Drew Brees meant to the NFL into the saints and to the sport in general\nYeah he is he's been an incredible human being is there\nYou know so not only just on the football field the guy's been top quarter backs of our generation was the top three in our generation that we've ever had the privilege of watching but you know I was out there for training camp this summer I was friends with Sean Payton and\nOh you know put some stuff together and work with they are all kinds of line a little bit and went through meetings and I'm In my family came over to the facility to pick me up a Drew Brees take time out of the day to spend with with the fans with people um was so gracious to my family but so gracious to that community is the ... part\nOf the national football league in such a part of New Orleans and\nUm I I tell you what he is just that we're thankful that Drew Brees been a part of the NFL for this long Eighteen seasons and incredible accomplishment and you heard it you know you already takes time I think his family's kids love on his kids a little bit and say you can do anything you can accomplish anything if you're willing to work for just such a\nWell he's in trouble for letting a monkey sit vehicles steering wheel and help steer the bus this video went viral on social media shows this bus driver holding on to the will of the bus with one hand while this monkey\nPerched on the wheel steers the vehicle with his monkey hand the carnage ... with his\nMonkey hand ... with with ... with his hand yeah well there you go I mean I get the monkey would have a hand\nDream about this before monkeys are creepy remember a robbery at their creepy because they have hands like humans\nWill the bus driver took one hand off the wheel and it looks like the monkey is helping him steering the video and everyone's laughing on the bus but the carnage talk estate road transportation corporation is not amused\nThey say the driver's been suspended from his duties while they officially investigate the incident official said the monkey was a pet belonging to one of the passengers on the bus [noise]\nI mean they know that the monkey didn't actually try and box right like what are they going to investigate it don't mean that would be a big upset if the monkey we're able to also reached the pedal and the or the bus like\nThis seems to me to be a driver just having a little bit of fun now I can also understand why you would be like hey there you know I don't know what forty people on the bus behind you or whatever the number is\nYou can't have a monkey sitting in your lap pretending that the monkey is driving the boss but it's clear that the bus driver is just having fun here so I don't know what the investigation uncovered\nThat this was like a pet monkey that somebody that the driver got to put in his lap like\nThis is an example of how a video just goes out everybody's like oh my God this is unbelievable but what are you going to do in a fire the guy 'cause he's having fun at his job seems kinda crazy to me\nThey're the plus monkey All right here we go we'll go to England now the our SPCA said that they sent an inspector two a couple of ... port England\nThis couple you're going to hate this clearly they spotted a snake when they open their of in\nA couple called the inspector to their home because when they went to their job and they were trying to cook some fries you know in England the ships they call them well they came face to face with an African brown how snake\nWhen oil ... alright pause here\nFor the sec there are I Believe and know snakes in Ireland right like that's the story like St Patrick they chase to all the snakes out of Ireland I Believe there are no snakes in Ireland\nOr their snakes in England I guess so according to me or this this sounds like it's like a\nPet snake because this can stay an African breed of snake like it seems like it would have had to get let loose into angle and like I don't really think of\nEngland as being a place where there are lots of snakes so I I guess what I'm asking here is are there snakes that are on the loose in England I ask because I'm flying to England on Saturday\nI'm doing the show from London for a week and in my head when I think of England I think of it as being a snake free zone like in in in the same way that Ireland\nIs an island and there are no snakes on it it seems to me that the same thing could be true of English\nWell that's a good call by you because later in the story they say that the our SPCA is trying to find the animals owner\nYeah 'cause you know people who have snakes as pets always lose them\nIf there's one thing we've learned from the animal thunder dome it that if you have a pet snake it always gets out the snake always gets out and disappears in somebody's house and somebody's neighborhood in somebody steady like it is without fail every single person who's ever owned a snake as often before\nCheck this out really quick a wife said I gave the inspector big hugging a cup of

off and go to games and play on their day around it and it really doesn't happen like that for anything else it's it's the Dodgers that do that in this town and I always tell you it's because of the fabulous Latino fan base\nAnd that's what most of them respond to mostly that an ... tree so\nWhen the Dodgers get go in the city gets going\nQuestion for you in general I feel like you're going to have an opinion on this too why did they sprayed\nChampagne after they win a wildcard baseball round series like so the Dodgers have been like we just said the three straight ... they've been to the world series they've lost game seven\nWhen you when a a a first round playoff series nobody else get tee shirts nobody else gets hatched they certainly don't go into the locker room and pop bottles of champagne\nI can understand why when you when the ... or the ... and you advance to the world series that you would celebrate like you know you when you're away I don't get I don't get the celebration of baseball here\nThe Dodgers had a celebration when they ... at least a wildcard\nYes then they had a celebration when they want me at out west yes\nThen they've had a celebration now that they've won the Nobel CBS they will have a celebration if they win the LDS and then they'll go to the ultimate World Series celebration or somebody well as they continue to move on\nI think that baseball has kind of become a place where they want to sort of embrace celebration more at least the new school does you see that ... will be commercial talking about let the kids play with you I feel weak and his top wagon all around\nAnd that's kinda that's kinda the norm I think it through the courage now by major league baseball for these guys to show that a little bit more emotion and I got to be honest clay you know be an apologist for this kind of thing but\nHaving worked baseball in the last few years just\nVery minor league and watching the people that work baseball every day\nAnd the ... that it is and what a bad mood all the players around and what a bad mood like when we show up at a football game it could be two oh and five teams but everybody's happy to be there you play football once a week it's game day you hear the dramas people are excited baseball's not like that airs or grind element\nSo when they accomplished something these guys cut loose a little bit I don't I don't have a problem with it\nStarting to me starting to me that you hate everything and have a problem with everything would be like you know what I enjoy all the excessive baseball celebration\nWhy don't you know what they might be excessive but the season is excessive hundred and sixty two games Dodgers played a hundred and sixty three I've been that the grind of the game is excessive so there is a release when they accomplish something I don't I don't I don't begrudge it\nYou're going to Illinois Purdue are they going to do anything at Purdue for Drew Brees that you're aware of what that game\nOh I don't know but let me tell you something my first game of us see that I scored a touchdown was Drew Brees as first start in\nCollege football that's pretty interesting not\nOnly is it interesting it legitimize like that's something all face for the rest of my life not because of me but because Drew Brees is that great\nLike he is an unbelievable figure in our game he was one of the all time great dudes and what he means to that city I Know you've been there is\nBeyond description and in some ways what he means for the people of New Orleans and the way he embraced them\nAnd the environment there after the super bowl and after Katrina and all the things that have contributed\nIs really special and I've seen them just walking around New Orleans and the way he interacts with people just it is daily life like going to the ATM\nAnd he's the real deal so I Hope everybody everybody from his high school is elementary school all the way through everywhere he goes where he does his laundry yeah those people should all celebrate Drew Brees they should do something for them but the games in Illinois anyway\nOh well I doubt they're going to do anything to celebrate drew\nThis is two trips to champagne for you uh you know they they yeah All right so the Drew Brees example is a good one too I also would say this when you see Drew Brees you just mentioned that you\nSaw him which kind of reminds me of having seen him a couple of times on radio row he's been on the show with us\nHe is like sometimes you see guys and you're like that guy is definitely someone special right like their size they're physical stature\nThough what they do NBA is a great example like you might watch them on television and you think oh those guys look like they're normal side\nBut then you see like Kobe Bryant standing next to I don't know Jimmy Kimmel and you're like my God Kobe Bryant is a giant like it's hard not to notice Coby Bryan if he walks around he seems larger than life LeBron James a great example lots of NFL players are also big physically all and on inspiring humans\nDrew Brees looks like you know he could be your accountant or he looks like the guy who's like working at the rental car desk at the airport when you get like right I mean he is the most average looking unassuming guy to now be the all time leader for passing your age which\nIs honestly probably why he ended up at Purdue it's probably why he went to the second round of the draft\nHe doesn't we still judge guys out oftentimes athletically based on their ... you know like their build and body type right when you think about money ball that was a huge part of the money ball story with Billy Bean was we judge guys who look big and strong in awe inspiring as if they're going to be better athletes than somebody who looks like Drew Brees\nWell Christian hacking Berg yeah it's a great field\nI mean hacking bird walks into the room if you didn't do anything if you came from Mars or the Ukraine and those two guys walked into the room and you said which one of these guys is the first pick of the NFL Draft\nYou'd go what happened Bert yep and that's what coaches do they still do it that's why everybody was so shocked at Baker may feel got taken number one and I want to take it a number one I Want to take and Drew Brees number one because they just weren't bigger that if you take a guy that's bigger number one because\nA guy that's bigger as more ideal because he can see over the line of scrimmage I mean it's not it's not rocket science in that regard but\nSome guys are special and they can make things happen and it doesn't matter what their stature as Russell Wilson is a big guy I mean we have a lot of guys that do a lot of great things or the NFL up the quarterback position that are six feet or or\nMaybe a little bit under and\nThat they find a throwing lanes and they can move around in the pocket and look nobody we even wanted Aaron Rodgers out of high school clay yeah he was at a junior college and no and I I'm sure I've told you this story\nBut Jeff Ted for it it was the coach a cow went to junior college to look at a tie to add\nNamed Jarrett cross and he saw the guy throwing the ball to the tide added saw little something in him\nAnd arranged a deal to get him released one year early from J. C. to go to Cal and that was completely and totally by chance otherwise Aaron Rodgers would be working at an enterprise rent a car\nIt is amazing how fine the line can be between all time great and somebody who doesn't even get an opportunity to do that thing for a living\nTom Brady has a concave chest and his draft video I mean he does not look impressive winning the fix brown you could very easily be at enterprise but [laughter]\nUh so you know maybe the best football player ever is is your door dash guy you you never know but there is something special about Drew Brees there's no doubt about it but\nIt is not necessarily physical it's what he gets out of it\nWe're not going to stop it I guess I Am five Seventy LA sports when you talk about the rams now obviously the Dodgers are into the uh the the ... which is a massive massive deal LeBron is about to START I think like October thirteenth is if I'm not mistaken is the first Lakers game you may know the actual date\nUm how much rams enthusiasm is there and frankly I think the chargers are about to get on a role too I think there'll be ... sorry beat the browns this weekend and and then I'm going to be over in London watching that titans and chargers game and the chargers always beat the titans so I feel pretty good about the chargers being five and two thirty seven\nYeah there's definitely talk about it there's definitely traction about how good the rams are how good Jared golf is how much better he is I I gotta admit I'd ever thought those little skinny legs\nWould be able to push across the line of scrimmage at the NFL level after all the shot God that he played in high school and college\nUh there there is ... but it's nowhere near as big as the Dodger abroad stuff", "show_name": "FOX Sports Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Newton", "day": "09"}
