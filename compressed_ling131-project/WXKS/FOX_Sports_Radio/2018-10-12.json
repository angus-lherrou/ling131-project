Hannity is reacting to he's a he's a president who came and how\nWe handle right away in Nineteen sixty one with the bay of pigs um invasion\nUh he had his doubts about it he went ahead with the fiasco he is now\nSyria he won by the feeling that he cannot from these generals generals my ... and he read off the top down devoted to teach you about the nineteenth tee ... the less now how it happened\nChaotic play 'em and wanting which politicians when they break all\nUm and he said you know the great danger details about the ball at ease calculation mistake in charge and he struck the U.S off shoot us off as she read that book copies Obama tapas\nPlace daily every American military base around ... ... president trying to ram the lessons of history as he sees it down right to do that as a military\nOne other example West Germany the East Germans the communist uh claimed to have fought the Nazis and therefore wipe their hands of the war guilt But West Germany cannot so how does that explain the good Germany and the bad Germany the first war good Germany the ... the second more bad Germany\nWell the um the west German Government has a ... style if we can get fined blaming the hit it off on a few a criminal man\nIt gradually have to like sick at the um\nI'll switch trials and other trial the trial Nineteen sixty eight by the involvement old they are just not the qualities that holds falling even hated thought there would still attempt to say okay this with a glitch it's walled\nA bad ... history by like the gym and hit all\nThe men who comes along in the Nineteen sixties until you got around to the gym and his lawyer who\nWho gets access to a fellow the all policies that will that had been a take it away or to um a Moscow and and and I opened up than in due course in East Germany show in fishes that\nThe leaders will walk in the world want if they had the same kind of anxious ambitions Hitler did in World War two\nAnd when they should stop light thing about this loan home to you teach history and this long tradition as he sees it old dangerous military said it ... in Germany it's one of them may want to get a ... law the dry big academic\nBasically boys off a into a massive media and and and political debate\nGoing quickly professor because there's such rich that's near books of British experience the English experience the Scots the Welsh the Irish everyone who lost their\nAnd parents or knows families destroyed or or ... or scarred by the first war you can you make the point that one way they deal with it is that they don't talk about causes and meanings and interpretation they talked about specifically the Tommy himself how does that help\nWell I'm nice soldiers of course have no idea what's going on around them in any meaningful and um uh the the the town to attend to the narrative on their experiences I'm late spring comes from other people\nUm what happens in the Nineteen sixties in Britain you think that the image of the second World War II is now very broad and and and hope that the war for um for for feed and against either do it he wrote back Britain fell on\nThat helped put in too\nIf you like relief or the defense if a shop and really the the sense of futility and tragedy and lack of achievement about Nineteen fourteen Eighteen\nAnd when you found a victory comes around these began to this is a very important I think you're getting people's memory and making people think again about how when the fiftieth anniversary comes around in Britain the story of the ... or fourteen Eighteen is presented as one over on relief utility\nThat you only that thing called a tragedy or the other extreme I fall because the all he did all these trenches laugh at several years from ... new\nMen who just lumped into the mob and selling it it's so ... story in fact well too that the British I think becomes very much thought into the law has a tragic and the talk\nFinally I Want to mention three artists that I did not know their work at all before or your book Paul Nash Richard ... Windham Lewis I had heard of wind and Louis has enough on guard but I did not know that the war propaganda office and in the first war had\nAsked them to render paintings of the front and you reproduce their work and your book\nIt's astonishing it's like a time machine for me day but that's what it pulls me back into a time where I can I Know the future but I don't see that this experience makes no sense to the people who are in it and the and the paintings are transporting\nThat wonderful painting what happened I think the British had no pools are we as many of the developing survival God out on the home to them or by Nineteen fourteen they will well behind the\nCubans and things like that today he just began to catch on the men who were then officer then recruited to do war ought\nHad goal the technique and and they look at the landscape on the west and huh they suddenly fool he made them come alive for that it's a war it's a landscape of shape\nAnd go out in your face brutality\nA Cuban would say in the ... that that they did it with less abstractions and I'm confident with more people but people in the sense of even more with the fact that\nIt costs that in this bill off and get a landscape the all the all the uh off the off these amazing and these men I think yeah the white did anything like that today it's a wonderful opportunity at case if\nAll the men and women coming together\nThe long shadow the legacies of the great war and the twentieth century professor David Reynolds is the author I'm John bachelor this is the John bachelor show [noise]\n\n\nI just want you work so hard to pay the mortgage a\nHome is more than for loans rule ... the porch swing summer night pajamas with everybody over for Sunday dinner in that old stuff here in the living room you just can't get [noise] this is why do you work a second job this is why you learn to fix things are so\nSo you could see one repairs\nHomeless or place your memory family sleeping in their own ...\nAnd then is why we want to now\nWe are making homo for free government resource that can make paying the mortgage [noise]\nAnd now even more options are available [noise] cold eight eighty nine Ninety five today that eight eighty nine Ninety\nFive or visit making Home Affordable but this is why I wrote to bother U.S Treasury notes from\nBoston ... home for conservative so much for your family your boss [noise] Ninety four or five and what did you manage to keep on talking twelve hundred and I heard the radio station\n[noise]\nFox Sports trending\nNFL on Thursday Night Football the eagles head to Europe to take on the giants and this one was all Philadelphia hostile\nAnd yet they sway you suck when he coached the browns but nobody wins the browns it was a long time ago\nIt's going to be different\nFive weeks into the seas actually six weeks now just a one in five so they put six games what exactly is different\nAbout pat sure I've waited a month I give everybody a month for over a month\nSchumer is not good at his job to the giants look like a well coach football team to you [noise] exactly so it's not a well coach football team you can tell when the coach has it and want to coach doesn't have it you can also tell from watching when a coach\nOr when the when the players respond to a coach and when they don't there are signs or indicators\nThere are none of those indicators with the giants a morbid sorrowful pathetic bunch of losers and nothing is change they might as well as kept Ben ... there was the coach and forced him to put your lives your Manny out there and all that\n... and the the biggest mistake that has made today every time teams gave a second chance to coach they bring up one name you know what name they bring up\nBill Belichick they say well bill village jak wasn't that great with the Cleveland Browns and now he's the greatest coach in the history of football with the patriots so guys need a second chance no I was discussing this any ...\nMeeting with somebody in the hallways here and I pointed out how ridiculous is is a Bill Belichick while he was the Jeff Fisher of his time with the browns also had an eleven when season in Cleveland made the playoffs with the browns won a playoff game as coach of the browns\nSo compared to the other coaches ... this is to compare anybody\nOr certainly patch ... like a four fifty winning percentage when he was coaching in Cleveland which is not good but that's not good pet Schumer when he was coaching the Cleveland Browns headed to eighty winning percentage he was nine and twenty three with the browns ... [noise]\nAnd well you I mean he has\nBeen appalling to watch him play quarterback patch ... play calling is atrocious is what is the giants were running screen passes behind the line of scrimmage on second down and twenty place they were throwing the ball behind the line of scrimmage on a screen passed\nAnd yeah they uh they had a big play at one point was declined Barkley but they ran how many screen passes how many passes within a couple of yards with a line of scrimmage\nIf you weren't dependent\nOn those plays for eighty five percent of your office and it's possible that you I managed to she's got a new to arm he can't throw the ball down to feel this is a recipe for disaster\nPatch trimmer should\nNot be long for the giants they are a cornerstone franchise right one of the the blue chip franchises in the NFL they'd like to talk about that they're also conservative franchise but if you look at the success of someone like Sean McVeigh with the rams\nThis ... and that's an extreme example but this is completely unacceptable barring some kind of sea change this unexpected\nCome to Jesus moment for the giants franchise Sherman shouldn't be cook he should be for neat though he should be done in wanting dawn is coach for the giants and this is not a well coach foot ball team that defense socks play calling socks Eli Manning blows\nIts bad bad bad bad bad bad they thought

out I did this last night I think part of the Dell back him juniors acting out is this year\nHe's aware that sake one Barkley is the more talented and more important office of player for the giants did you notice how sake one Barclay went up to\nA hotel back um junior and tried to calm him down on the sideline during his collapse during his fall apart explosive moment on the sideline\nI just think in general the giants are frustrated I'm fielding every call I can right now if I Am giants\nManagement to see whether or not anyone is interested in giving me anything to take hotel back um junior off my hands I Want to build the future of this franchise around sake one Barclay it's good for a rookie quarterback to have\nA really talented running back I Want to look to the Dallas Cowboys and say okay here's what they did with his he he'll Eliot I Want to look to the Jacksonville Jaguars and say okay here's what they did with winter for net\nI Want to take a a a example of everything that the saints have done with Alvin Kamara and all of these young dominant running backs\nAnd over the next four or five years maybe six or seven years hopefully sake one Barkley is going to get better and better and be absolutely dominant both as a running back and as a receiver out of the backfield and I want to build around him\nAs opposed to doing anything with Eli or anything with hotel back um junior\nAnd already I think things are only going to get worse when you bring in a rookie quarterback because everybody out there listening to me right now knows what it's like when you bring in a rookie quarterback he's not going to be consistent\nGoing to have some good games and some bad games do you want that rookie quarterback having to put up with a Dell back in the junior and his antics do you want to try and justify his leaving the field early you want to try to worry about what he's going to do on the sideline\nOn a night in a night out basis when you're trying to groom the future quarterback of your franchise hotel back him junior no longer fit this team\nAnd if I Am the giant starting this morning\nI Am putting out notice to anybody that would be interested in it what will you give me to take hotel back um junior off my hands this is not a playoff team for the next couple of years\nYou have locked up twenty million dollars a year for Dell back him junior and he is not your best offensive player sake one Barkley is\nYou build this team around sake one Barclay stable he's reliable\nHe looks to be a future superstar and you go out and you draft the new quarterback at the start of this season because this these at the start of the next season in next year's draft because this year's theme is done\nMaybe a little bit aggressive some of you out there may disagree but that is the solution that I saw\nWe'll talk about this a little bit what kind of trade value widow del Beck and junior have I Will ah bounce it off the guys we will also talk with my guy Lance Taylor we'll see whether or not he agrees with me on that decision is it too aggressive to think about trading hotel back him junior\nI'll tell you this I Can't get past if I Am the owner of the team if I'm the GM if I'm the coach him walking off the field at halftime with one second left\nI just can't I was watching this game with my kids and my eight year old said dad why would I Would sell back him junior do that why would he will leave when\nHis office has the ball and his team has a chance to do something I mean there's there to forty two yard line or whatever the heck they are after the eagles miss\nIf my eight year old is sitting there who's playing flag football thinking there's no way I Would leave the field with my team having a chance to score in any way possible with one seconds left on the field\nLeft on the clock why\nIn the world would you allow your twenty million dollar a year wide receiver to do it I'm not putting up with the antics anymore I think the giants made a mistake giving him the contract to begin with it's not Monday morning quarterbacking it's not hindsight I said that when they signed the deal\nI Would trade or Dell back and junior I'd be done with them if I were the giants particularly if I had a new head coach with no relationship with him and also if I were deciding to move on from Eli and if I have a talented running back like say God

easier we bring in now my guy Lance Taylor at the land Taylor on Twitter\nLT you just heard me poll and everybody on the show watching the game last night I said I'm done with Dell back him junior you can't leave the field with one second left when you're making twenty million dollars a year the antics on the sideline they'll look at me moments continue to become more extensive\nOr this is the giants team that debt in the water on the season say going Barkley is their best off into play maker if I could get out from under twenty million dollar a year deal that they should never have given hotel back him junior that was my opinion when they did it it's my opinion now what would you do would you try and trade 'em at this point if you were the giants\nGet I said it's a tricky situation for guys only twenty five years old and we do that he um you know and he's on is one of the best in the league but\nI mean this is only gonna get worse I mean the giants are maybe the worst team in the NFL sitting at one in five at least got worst record um Ninety million dollar deal I mean you just gave it to him was forty five million guaranteed\nI don't know what you can get I don't know what the market is and obviously this is a a wide receivers game now along with franchise quarterbacks and Eli Manning is he's awful I mean are you guys talking about it is just he's a shell of what he wants was\nUm I think their core is interesting I think teddy Bridgewater in New Orleans is interesting I mean is is Sean Payton really going to stick around post Drew Brees\nI don't I don't know if he is can you imagine bringing a weapon like back um junior and the New Orleans and ... and that that that's an equitable trade but I think Bridgewater is still a quarterback it's got a high ceiling and you bring him in and and you throw into some other assets in New Orleans and I think you can make some things interesting\nMy God can you imagine if you think Drew Brees well let's just say you are or the saints right now and you think Drew Brees has got to more really good years after this year that completely squares with hotel back him junior salary I think Drew Brees did like a one year deal could you go to Drew Brees and say hey drew\nYou've made a hundred million dollars plus with us\nDo you want to submit your legacy in when another Super Bowl can you imagine this off and see if we added oh del back him junior\nI Would be like signed me up right now and I would trade teddy Bridgewater in a heartbeat the saints is a perfect example of a team world Dale back him junior could make a great deal of sense maybe even give or maybe you could even get if you're the giants heady Bridgewater and next year the first round draft pick\nFrom the saints to me that's a trade I make I didn't go back and junior can be a difference maker for them in\nTerms of giving them a really really good shot to win the NFC and win the Superbowl overall and uh you got an aging quarterback and Drew Brees who's thirty nine years old but still at the apex of his game I Love that deal I I think that's a no brainer if I'm the saints I signed the paperwork on that and get him in immediately\nDrew Brees I may look Marcus ... the receiver back in the day branding cooks you know for a couple of years was a really good receiver knows how to tie it in and immigration but this would be his best weapon ever in the history or you know his entire career\nSo you play around with a guy like Michel Thomas and prove whether that often it's I mean it's already a really really good office but it'd be next well\nImagine if you're the patriots honestly if you are the patriots and you think Tom Brady is on the back end of his career which I think it's fair to say he's forty one years old you just brought in Josh board and you've got Julian Edelman back you need explosive ... maybe your defense is not as good as it's been in the past\nCan you imagine the patriots making that move I mean if you have an accomplished and reliable quarterback and you believe you are\nA a wide receiver away I mean even like here in Nashville with the Tennessee Titans I think they are in decent cap space\nI Would trade or I Would trade away the number one draft pick next year beyond a shadow of a doubt to get a Dell back in the junior and with the titans and you know also toss in\nSomebody else who I mean LA I I think there are a lot of teams that think hey we're a playoff caliber team but we just need one more play maker I can see a lot of teams being willing to make that move and if I'm the giants I mean I think you have to be brutally honest about where you are\nAre we going to continue for a Super Bowl and the next two years if the answer is no\nThen I go back and junior is the wrong answer for your team\nAnd so uh I mean it sounds crazy to say but I build around say going Barclay let's be positive here LT how good is take one Barkley\nA is unbelievable I mean fix consecutive games all six of his NFL starts he's gone past a hundred yards from scrimmage I mean he can do everything there's not a weakness in his game right now\nAnd you look at what dynamic running backs can do what Todd girlie has done for the Los Angeles which is what led me on bill can do when he is in my line of\nUm I mean there's it's it's priceless and I think ... just going to continue to get better and better and let's let's not forget he's doing it for a bad off is you know I mean bell and girly are doing it for a really good often says\nYeah I I don't think there's any doubt at all or as we come into the weekend um what do you see out there as the biggest and best stories in the NFL from a gambling perspective what games are you paying the most attention to [noise]\nUh you know I well this is kind of a weather weird situation but you know us being in the south clay you've seen eighty five Ninety degree weather this week\nAnd I look at the LA Rams traveling to Denver with a couple of of a prime weapons and Cooper cup and and\nA brand and cooks and concussion protocol ensuring McVeigh says look they're they're been limited to practice but if they're full go\nToday in practice they will play on Sunday but when you look at a that whether it's a low of Nineteen degrees and snowing and yeah so that's one of those weird altitude games that I think could be a lot of fun um we'll see what happens there I think ah you know you look at the chargers going west of Cleveland I mean Cleveland it's been a great story\nAnd you talk about it the giant can't win a Super Bowl in the next couple of years they probably need to to maybe look at dealing oh they'll back but uh you know Cleveland was in the situation a couple of years ago I don't think they're Super Bowl ready right now but they're fun team to watch\nThere every single game and actually the record should be better than it is right now\nDo you think about the cowboys and the jak game\nBecause I I find those are the teams to be very very intriguing to watch from a from a gambling perspective and also what the world's going on with these teams perspective I don't believe in ... I\nDon't believe in ... I'm taking the under in this game uh ... what happens going forward for both of these teams 'cause I I kinda think they'd cowboys they'll find a way to winning and both of them will be sitting at three and three thoroughly unhappy with their lot in life because they feel\nMe at least a little bit like teams that should be much better than what they've been capable of so far this year\nWell let me say the second half of last year Blake borders was playing career football and then when he was able to join the post season and I thought you know even in the second half gets doing on the AFC Championship game that kinda got away from ...\nHe's not getting a lot of help right now though clay and Leonard for next can't stay healthy do a secret yelled and\nIs not a primary number one back in even receivers are dropping easy easy balls right now and when they started\nTo an after beating the giants and and and kind of dominating the patriots we were say in Jacksonville was one of the top two or three teams in the league and then they lose they always lose the titans yeah that was a tight game and not the titans or a bad team right now at the titans are a little above average\nAnd then they go back they bounce back and that they dominate the jets and then you know against these kind of a coin flip I had a feeling that you actually win that game with defense\nAnd you know like ... was the old Blake also want to pick six and they didn't look good but nobody's really look good against the use right now I don't know um I Know this Republicans all over the jagged on the road\nSo it's a game I Would stay away from I think the jaguars are much better than the cowboys but uh you know where they are right now in the way they played last week and where the money is a it's a game I don't touch but you you might be right I mean if I had to play if\nI had to play out one angle on this it probably would be a total and I probably wouldn't lean under because I don't see the cowboys doing anything against ...\nLet's go to college football let's start with Georgia LSU um I Believe George is going to go in and went by double digits over LSU a I think we're gonna see LSU kind of come back to earth I think the tigers and I've been wrong about al issue so far this year\nBut I think they're going to lose this game lose the bam a and lose to Texas a and M. finish eight and for a what the you about George LSU\nOkay so last month they just came on the board was Florida against LSU and yeah I just didn't believe it unless you was you know a top five team I Know they were undefeated nugget were drawn a lot of credit job or not making mistakes and I thought he would make mistakes and the swat which he ultimately did\nBut watching this toward the team you know I'm I'm dating a Georgia girl Georgia grad and I get stuck into watching these miserable Georgia games from start to finish and although the final scores they look really good George hasn't been that good at least the last three weeks even on the fourteenth point when it gets Missouri Missouri was able to run on that towards ...\nAnd I I look at LSU I think both set you can stick to it I think they can have success against George on the ground and you look at you like one twenty straight home games in the month of October last October home last clay was\nBack in two thousand and Ninety boy temp T. Bo it's been a long time to tell us your last one of these games down on the value and I I just think tiger stadium is gonna be rocking in a row it doesn't make those mistakes\nAn door kill a man

on the road as underdogs against the patriots what happens\n[noise] yeah um [noise] you'd never I think you'd ever that is the patriots\nEspecially this is a little hole favorites kind of costs to buy the overtime but and I go to church because of the scoring opportunities both teams have I mean this gave us could it be tracked me and that leads me to think that poets are the chief ... especially at three and a half or the side to play I mean I think that that\nThe one thing that that is what's going to happen in my opinion this gives the patron or local football a lot\nUm the patriots what they do is they they tell their game plan to what the other team does poorly Jacksonville to run the ball golf on Sunday even with even they were down to end up in its early the game and you run the football the chiefs are giving up\nFive point seven seven yards a carry\nAn NFL team was allowing five point seven to carry that it was not the ball a lot on Sunday and that should limit the possessions for for for ... I and also at the clock so maybe it's not as ... as I could be\nA but that's what we're going to do in my opinion and it comes down to the chief drug they start to she's ... could stop or the patriots of cheese that with the skin the ... on a ... a concert at all or if you sit back and the coverage but kind of lives touched down the\nCenter of five percent of passes if you don't pressure has a has it and so I just think that is the game is is the patriots were the football and how to do\nWhat do you think's going to have another big game you mentioned that you went to war again you'll like Justin herb or do you like him did they beat Washington or not or will they be able to get the big when they're in a in your home stadium or willing she'll get away like they did against Stanford [laughter]\nSo rude but it's so true [laughter] ah ah you know here's the deal Washington number one of the country and all these threats are allowing are the least amount of explosive plays a or in the past year in order to this issue or\nTwo weeks now that the ... to repair for this how'd you get your wide receivers open your washer fat as which prepared for the last two weeks\nOr what what helps in this equation washers off what Russia ... hundred and fifty two hundred ... great um I work as a rule golf it's wide so if if we're going to stand away last year we get to open whether it's a very interesting information is one of its do round concepts whether it's corn mashed up\nWhatever you can do you guys oh good ... and I think that er or defensively there'll be fine ah\nAlthough as far as a matter of credit for an explosive players in the past game look I'm home all of your home or a or the or getting much better than people thought they'd be especially me I thought they were ...\nBecause I ... a pair for this they can manage to not there'll be some dumb mistakes that your staff or a great chance to win this game it's a game a chance to win the north so uh it's a it's a big game for us\nJeff shorts appreciate the time a man and joy or by the way we ... that sixty three yard field goal and you were in the panther stadium what was your reaction\nOh a believer not um I don't know how much time I got the heart out twice for myself\nThe first game and I thought we'd be with NASCAR and she said don't want to stay or everyone else is there a ... to be with three there for forty seconds book against that\nDaddy I'm ready to go home with [laughter]\nSo I was actually I actually made it back to my house I was at the stadium for that\nSo all of the war started above ... that's perfect parenting story appreciate\nThe time I met Jeff by the way it's going to be in a sitting in that part\nOf our coverage next week while I'm In London I'll be on every day\nBut a little bit of difficulty obviously doing the show from London so Jeff shorts and Jason Martin will both be at a final hour of the week up next we're going to talk with Jason wedlock we're going to talk with Joel class where you will give you all of the gambling picks both the NFL and college to make you rich let's hang final our next\nHow kick the coverage with clay private\nOkay this is a thirty second commercial I'm going to throw a lot of numbers that you would please stay with me\nIt just Fifteen minutes you could say Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance\nThis company has been offering great right to great service for over Seventy five years anytime you need help you could speak to one of their trained specialists twenty four seven the company guy go go to guy go dot com today sorry for all the numbers and five four three two one I'm Out of time\nTrade pros Ferguson proud to be a part in what you do and it's our aim to be the easiest one of your long the only job without one one thousand one stop shop kennel locations expert associates had an unmanned selection of go to and hard to find him repair products you can depend on us to do our part every day\nAnd for reasons one hour will call the next day delivery and online ordering in him in three management solutions are making things simpler for those that work the hardest visit Ferguson dot com and find a count on location near you [noise]\nTaking a look at your ride downtown lower ... and yet he had to survive the Kelvin is back in the ... back to the airport runway the ...\nIn South Boston so far so good on the river roads this morning this or put his ... by mothers against drunk driving mothers against drunk driving supports victims of drunk driving drunk driving and under age drinking at no charge call our twenty four victim helpline at eight seven seven mad help\nOr does it matter dot org\nThat's an A.

saying he wants to out of the men to do that\nDon't tell me about winning when you leave that\nTo do to Brooklyn\n[noise] [noise] that is about winning when you want to go to most of those trends added let's\nLet's let's listen to some ... called out yeah towns in wig and everybody has to\nWinning or the number one power is winning in all of that we're worried about [noise]\nI repeat Brooklyn New York\nThe odds with Chris Broussard Enron Parker weekdays is seven pm eastern forgiven Fox Sports radio\n[noise]\nFox Sports trending\nFell on Thursday Night Football the eagles were in New York is gone the giants this one was all Philadelphia\nOn lock it in and that may cost you your job just how good and how much better I'll be on the show than you uh you know trust me want a cousin south tower from Rachel Maddow work with me they'll want nothing to do with you\nI've a little bit afraid of that that'd be speaking to not want anything to do with you [laughter] do you think the giant should want anything to do with Dell back him junior after what we saw last night\n[noise] uh I I fit I listen to your rent there and I do agree with you [noise] if\nCrystal clear sake why I'm Barkley is their best player and hell he may be the best\nPlayer in football quarterback who knows a and and so I think what's hard if you listen to Troy and job of talk about\nHow charisma that it can just his leadership qualities and and what a great person said Kwan is and then contrast that with all due to have your highest paid player in your franchise player B a guy that has no leadership skills at all\nThat's the problem he he's a poisoning and walk around the guy that has made the most money\nA is a problem in your locker room and look look people didn't even talk about it last week he must that pont a gift Caroline and cost them a a touchdown\nHe must upon a yesterday last night he recovered and everything but older as much as they were all he had his best game last week and I actually had some problems that costs them point\nI just don't know if he's worth all the money you have invested in because\nI'm just not sure do bedroom junior is a winner he's a productive wide receiver but I just don't think he's a winter that's the problem for the New York giants and that would be why I might move on from\nYour let's pretend you're in that huddle on the off into the line for the giants hotel and\nBelieve me on it though while the giants are the worst thing I've ever seen in my life [laughter]\nOh del back of junior does not come out for that final play\nThey're going to say oh you had to go in and get an id which is basically code to cover up for the fact that he walked off the field before she was ready for him that impact you are are are you angry that he wasn't out there on the field of battle so to speak or for that final play\nDepends on my relationship with him you know previously I Would imagine it's not good with this because the guys just too much drama hey man we're just trying to conduct work here we're just trying to build a team here and there's always something going on with you and this is just another piece\nOr to the puzzle and so it would bother me it would just you know old Dale thinks he's better than everybody else he's not\nPart of that team and I listen when you live you know fifty one years like I have or even forty years or you know thirty eight years last year so you're going to be of some work situations that are not ideal\nAnd you have when at\nRed light comes on or it's time to go to work\nIt can't be hey I'm Better than everybody else around me and so let me throw everybody else under a bus and and and point the finger at them that's just not good those other guys guys on often to live just the other receivers running but they're human beings as well\nAh there's way too much finger pointing for Modesto\nSitting down during that interview a little way and just pointing the finger at everybody else and they're they're\nThey're not matching my level of production and I can't live up to my building because of he lived in the office runner but it's just the wrong play man they gave you a bunch of money\nTo elevate everybody else on the team not\nA not point a finger at the rest of the team and say they're not as good as you just bad leadership if it's a slow character\nWhen you see a guy like say going Barkley who I think is the best off into player on the giants right now\nTrying to calm oh del back and junior down on the sideline your rookie you're Twenty one year old and I know that it would go back and junior is still young twenty five twenty six years old himself\nBut to me that wasn't emblematic moment for where the giants are headed and if they are going to move on from Eli which I think it seems likely they are do you want a rookie quarterback having to deal with a Dell back and junior part one of this question in part two\nIs though Dell in danger of healing himself where he's an incredible talent a hall of fame talent\nBut he just doesn't have the ability to work with others and ultimately if you're a receiver that's a pretty big part of your overall job is to figure out a way to fit in on the office and have a great relationship with your quarterback\nToo early to Tio himself ... ... what I Do think\nCould potentially happen and I think coaches executives around the league may start going hey man these extra diva wide receiver Antonio Brown or\nThey'll come junior if they put up great numbers but I don't know if they're essential to winning a Tom Brady has been winning with whoever you throw out there for the ... for a long time\nUh and so I think ... what say quite Barkley they last night what what I see from Todd girly and some of the other running backs around the league\nI think there's going to be a resurgence scene and the value in running backs and particularly if you can get a guy like say Columbus because the giants actually last night basically quick call in place\nAnd they just said hey how can we get the ball to say Koran as quickly as possible\nAnd then we'll drive ... and pray that he breaks eleven tackles and make the play and the kid is actually that town that he could do that\nAnd so I I just think oh Dell is diminishing the value of the wide receiver and diminishing the value of themselves and teams will say you know or there'll be teams interested in him but there'll be like at that price\nThis guy makes nearly twenty million bucks\nA year or does make twenty million bucks year at that price is the word that I'm just not sure if I were wide receivers around the league and particularly the you know I think ... just five and a but if I were receivers around the league I wouldn't be concerned that oh Dale is diminishing opposition\nOutstanding stuff as always Jason what like can't wait to have you sit in forming next week I appreciate you being willing to do it from fall\nIn last winter and went like Jason watch the show speak for yourself from three to four thirty eastern noon to one thirty set your DVR on the west coast or west coast is never good luck when you on TALK along bulky dress shirt

State has a chance to take down Alabama we'll discuss next allocate the coverage on Fox Sports radio\n[noise]\nThe fleas and make you rise out of your share\n\nThis is why you know what we are in\nLast sports radio\nTheir job sites you times of the wrong resume to sort through that not smart\nYou are going to be assuming that both of us live long enough in Thirty years people are going to talk about Joel flat like they talk about ah Britain lost burger like they talk about um all of those guys burn linguist maybe it's forty years for that you have the opportunity and herb streets doing this to\nTo cement yourselves as like the faces of college football because you're so good at what you do and I say not on the air for everybody to here but it's something that I Would also add said to you before privately like you are insanely good at what you do um and uh and I am more biased than you are there's no doubt I'm In I'm In\nThe tank for the SEC I think the SEC is the best but\nI Do think that Alabama this year has been so good that there is a certain segment of the population out there that you like oh Alabama hasn't played anybody\nAnd I just think Ohio state's been pretty good too if you actually look at the Ohio State in Alabama resume there almost identical through six games except Alabama has dominated everybody on their schedule we can quibble about how good Texas a and M. is relative to Penn State\nEverything else but these resumes are pretty similar right\nThey are similar I I Would again I Would give the nod to Ohio State because\nThe quality team that they be is one a top ten team right now and they did that on the road and and a and M. is not that type of the resume builder for Alabama so there is still a a a significant\nOr you know a notch above because of that but you're right and and I think that that both of those teams are really good teams but famous been all different level and I will and and I've\nYou know full users for a privately it on other shows are they lock it in you know better runs a table they're they're staring squarely in the face of being talked about is one of the best two or three teams ever\nYeah hum that so yeah I mean that they're on that type of Iran and they are going to get looked at as if their resume is weak because they're beating people by an average forty points right now forty points which is insane or and what to is doing right now is just\nIt's incredible I haven't I haven't seen anything quite like this ah from him\nTheir ability to now be an offense that is similar to what an Oklahoma throws out there with quick strike ability the ability to put a monster yards and points in in in a quick fashion\nIt's scary how good that they could potentially be I think the only thing now that's a concern for Alabama is the fact that they're getting injured and and you know that secondary I think coming in for the first time in savings tenure\nThe defense was going to be more of the question mark than the often so I'm not saying it was going to be bad and not a lot of a terrible question mark but\nThe unit that was maybe not quite as dominant and now you've got some injuries on that side of the all that so I think that's partly a a concerned are part of the concerns over board but it's not like a lot of teams on their schedule is going to be able to take advantage of them with their often you know LSU at Harvard right now are are not very good offensively\nUm their defenses are outstanding outstanding in particular I'll as used but they're not going to be able to take advantage of of Alabama's defense because they're just not expose on the on the opposite side\nTo stats for you and I want to get just your thoughts as a quarterback and I want you to compare him to wane Haskins which who is also probably the second best quarterback in the NFL I mean in college football so far\nTwo Seventy five point two percent completion percentage yes Eighteen touchdowns versus only twenty five interceptions he hasn't played in the fourth quarter this year so he's not like ... yeah\n... oh God yeah that would not be very good yeah he's only got twenty five in completion versus Eighteen touchdown he has not played in the fourth quarter this year um which is an amazing that he played a lot and not even hardly on ah on the field he leads the NFL\nOr lead college football and falling apart here in the final and trying to run through this that in a total quarterback efficiency and everything else and Joel this is a staff that SB Nation track down everybody who is won the Heisman Trophy in the last Twenty years if you take the best\nTakes games they play during their Heisman Trophy campaigns that's our G. three that's Cam Newton that's Tempe T. Bo that is a that is Baker Mayfield that is every Marcus Mario to everybody who has been such an incredible quarterback and won the Heisman Trophy in the last Twenty years\nNone of them come close to what to what has done in the first six games of the season that's how good he's been historically maybe the best six games any quarterback has ever had\nCandy get better is my question will he regrets and how does he compared to Haskins based on your experience watching both these guys\nTo uh to is played the best of anybody in the country and and I think by\nMaybe not as significant but a wide margin clay or because those Haskins has been really good as well uh I think that his\nOrders play was in the toughest environment a and part of the deal in today's college football is that colleges and and to some extent the NFL but I think more so in college football they have an ability to get into the perfect play\nAll the time you know I every single snap you see them checking they're getting into place to take advantage of the defense of look I'm at Ohio State was unable to do that against Penn State which is part of the reason they start to struggle those first recorders but the fourth quarter for Haskins was really good but\nWhat he what he's looking up at is a guy that like you said is is is playing historically good now if I'm voting for the Heisman Trophy right now it's an easy number one vote for to talk about law\nI don't know what's going to happen right I mean you never know about how you'd never know about just you come out all of a sudden you throw for picks one day and just don't have it\nUh I don't assume that that's going to happen just because of how well he's been playing the season but you just never know uh but right now this guy is is as much of a a\nShoo in for that trophy as you can have in the middle of October ... ...\nThis is the only part that I Would say is at the end of the year\nHe better have the style numbers if you never plays in the fourth quarter because remember voters tend to vote for moments not necessarily just like a bulk of statistics they will vote for bulk of statistics and and\nHe'll probably win but if if all of a sudden you've got a guy with comparable numbers that has had incredible moments in particular and fourth quarters and in particular in November\nThen it could get I get I guess a little bit closer uh but that would be one of the things I'm concerned for a Alabama four and two for is is the fact that he is and the baseball hat on the fourth quarter almost every week\nBig twelve last night Texas Tech goes on the road and gets a big win against TCU we saw a Texas you called this game a beat Oklahoma incredible game to watch down there and by the way the pre game show from the from the state fair was incredible I watch that you guys did a fantastic job there\nI thought it really kind of brought home the atmosphere and set the tone in a really good way for that game which had a massive audience\nWhat's going to happen in the big twelve how would you assess the conference at the halfway point\n[noise] or if you're if you're in the tank for the big twelve or if you're the ...\nIt's well commissioner I think you probably would have rather Oklahoma won that game because they're just they're past is always going to be easier maybe not always but this year is going to ... to the playoffs because that's an easy yourself right Maria's during exceptional things as a quarterback there were just in the play off\nA it's been a dominant team over the last three or four seasons so\nThat would be an easier in to the college football playoff now Texas wins now you've got to get them to the finish line and they still have this last barrel and that is going to look atrocious at the end of the season\nSo it's a it's a bad deal for the conference but having said that what they have been in desperate need of a just overall from an overarching structure that conference is for Texas to be relevant for a decade they've not been relevant\nAnd now all of a sudden that they are I Would say they're in control of this conflict there the driver's seat of this effort in particular when you're talking about is getting to that big twelve championship game\nBut now I I think it's the easiest to conferences to to leave out of the play off right now or the ... and the big twelve and deadly because now you've got the what I Would say is the prime grand on the field Oklahoma the big twelve is behind the eight ball when it comes to one of the coffers\nAre eight packed twelve I Want to close out with you in this game you just mentioned that they are in a rough spot Washington loses to Auburn to start the season it looks like all burns going to go eight and four issue which means that is not going to look like a great loss at the end of the year\nWhen you look at Washington against Oregon Oregon couldn't close out Stanford can they be Washington what happens in that game up at Oregon\nSo I think it's going to be tougher Washington you know what's so rare so rare and it's just not a shot at at the SEC is Oklahoma has not played back to back wrote games on second week since two thousand and an eleven Alabama's only played one\nInstance of back to back road games on executive weeks all of a sudden Washington has that right now\nThey might be saying like well it was just at UCLA hasn't won a game last week and now they're at Oregon yeah I understand that but traveling back back weeks were college because it's just tough it just is you saw that they basically rear its ugly head at Stanford earlier this year when they went at Oregon than at Notre Dame and they just totally lost", "show_name": "FOX Sports Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Newton", "day": "12"}
