and I heard radio station [noise]\nFox Sports trendy and\nThe Boston Red Sox did what they needed to do on a Thursday night he was from one in which in the American league pennant they take the series four games to one\nOut as far as you guys\nAre so as a father for you know so it's like oh no not that fast that takes a while for the chemistry gets or were you ever read ... and those guys are so [noise]\nWhat else are we going to work towards to not only professor ... off of\nTheir profits\n[noise] to me [noise] that sounded like a man that knows he made a mistake that with that found like to make the front ... for what am I Would have I done [noise]\nWhat have I mean at least I get the hang out at Warner Brothers but water by done here what Brian James debut a loss in Portland was blank\nI've got the fleeting and flawed\nGot those two things I first of all it's the fighting because of the amount of hype now I don't watch too much television these there's other than games uh other than gifts and not that I'm Better than you put the I married I and I have a job and I work a lot so that those kinda things cut down on the TV and I know\nBack in my old days I used to watch eight hours of television a day or whatever but I'm On the Internet a lot I mean that's what I Do but I go to the gym they have these shows and sometimes they have the morning talk shows the talking heads during the breaking down and I've seen more coverage of uh Brian James how great the Lakers going to be this that blah blah blah blah blah blah blah\nSo this ... it's one game right one out of eighty two and LeBron James talked about instant oatmeal or whatever that it is a buzz kill right it's also a bit myth busting because\nWell Brian James can walk into anything we've heard this how many times from the LeBron James fan boys it think he's a God and they treat him like a God there you go to any team in the NBA and this team would make the playoffs they'd be great and all that\nIs far from a guarantee that this lake your team is a playoff to you it is far from a a guilty and think about what that would do to the legacy LeBron James\nHe would be a myth busting if LeBron James can't even get to the playoffs in a western Congress it would also be confirmation that all of those cheap shots that were taken it upon James over the years has said he's a product of the eastern conference he couldn't do it in the in the west those would also be verified\nSo it's it's obviously way early but you start thinking about that and I I heard the brown eyes somebody sounded like a scared man he says try to deflect and all that in China I I haven't done the process anything there's so many fan boys right next to laugh at everything\nBut Brian could make a statement about Adolf Hitler and the media would laugh history to play that soundbite again listen to this listen to the media is reaction forget what the bronze says listen to the media fan boys the cover the Lakers and listen to their reaction was was\nNot as fast as you guys think so [laughter]\nThis is a ... you know so it's like oh no it's not that fast food takes a while for the commercials that gets or were you close your eyes and know exactly where guys are so [laughter]\nSo that's where we're going to work towards to not only the first was awful [laughter] I think you hit it big as this process for [laughter]\nFor Ross sounded like he's like the closest ... and get the hell out of the Lakers that's what he sounded like to me where's that movie magic [noise] now my theory here is this this is a flawed blueprint ... what do you need to win in the modern NBA\nYou need a mix but you need a lot of outside shoot you got to keep up with the Joneses or in this case the curies and the Thompson the splash brothers and all they've got the rain in Oakland\nAnd there's there's no way outside of an out of body cosmic experience that this roster and get that done it's a flawed Ross and if you look at the western Congress food chain\nThe Portland TrailBlazers while they technically we had the third best record in the western conference last year they were like one game a away from being like the seven seed was ... it was all jammed up there was a bottleneck in the western conference\nAnd so you you say the Lakers if it takes some let's say half the season\nTo get going they're very they're very they're done\nNow are saying about instant oatmeal but if it takes them a half a season to kind of get the old engine going by the time they've gotta going\nThat's it you're you're done I mean you\nGet along jam in the west and you know some of these guys on this Laker roster are going to mail it in\nYou know that they've got reputations for doing that shut out your veil muggy chat outweigh Stevenson I mean this is why these guys have bounced around the end of the moment you get to the man that yeah okay how's he going to play a game number thirty six reasonably good you sure about that guaranteed positive\nPositive positive a hundred percent a hundred percent\nSo in the fourth quarter of this game\nIt was at one point ... number one but it gives you an idea of the margins are so so thin right margins are so stay\nSo thin and these NBA games and in the fourth quarter Portland out scored the Lakers by seven points in the fourth quarter said LeBron James had three turnovers in the fourth quarter\nHe had more turnovers than the entire blazers team had in the fourth report only turned the ball over one time which tells you what tells you Lakers aren't playing very good defense it tells you that\nIn the Portland TrailBlazers were ten of ten from the file and they got to get a lot of the points in the foul line and the Lakers could not stop Damien Willard and CJ McCollum closes the trailblazers there twenty points together in the fourth quarter\nAnd LeBron James had eight in the fourth quarter the Lakers always struggle up important in a good look at my main report\nOf a Chinese coming up with every defense technique you can come up with what else you got game one game on how you doing game one always lose in Portland what else\nWhat else you got ... and make the play offs to relax I'm fine I got bull\nBy I'm Glad you're fascinated by the Lakers are fascinated by the longest bringing a Laker head and you can do it I'm good I guess with him bending the Beau Biden\nRight are you there now it's gone\nAs far as the show ... by discover card we treat you like you'd game one game on how you doing game one always lose in Portland what else\nWhat else you got\n... and make the play offs to relax I'm fine I got bull\nBy I'm Glad you're fascinated by the Lakers are like ... I'm fascinated by the longest bring liquor him and you can wait\nI'm good I don't need that kind of tell you I Know you're a Laker fan I'm not to lie Beau Biden me in Beau Biden Benny and the ... or ... podcast with him bending the Beau Biden\nRight are you there now he's got\nThis forces your breath you buy discover card we treat you like you'd\nTreat you\nLet's go to the phones and the real quick let's say a little\nMad on the ... on the cable choked up hello Matt what's going on that\nGo more than ... hours doing I uh I I missed the first hour so I'm sure I miss a Christian I mean Houston confessions\nPiano no no no not Christmas turtle up he's like you do like he did call when did he call you didn't get a little he didn't call that's what I'm saying he didn't call he's ... he didn't call up\nI Wish I could say I didn't see that common\nYou know I I uh I was in my sleep number truck bed you know uh and uh\nCurrently going through a\nStrong still trying to say you know they pay some guy go commercial over here at the Bristol motor speedway you know on a Virginia Tennessee line so yeah you know uh but I I don't know if ah I I I don't know if I shared my dinner or know Saddam is like the great that now are but ah I have test proof\nThat I set price was going to go\nNow I was a little bit off I said fixing one Ron\nEight strike outs started at five thirty one east coast time last night\nYeah did you did you bet on the red Sox when you were in Vegas though\n[noise] I did not oh Matt\nMatt I don't know I I Know I won't I woke up those ... what were the ... what are the odds were after the Astros one game one and look like they were never going to lose I Wonder what the odds were on the red Sox the when the ... to to\nReally ... interest you know I looked at it okay you considered I did I\nGot you know I woke up as far as that great friday techno beat you know I you know get the air or no and and and you know we're just ... yeah she used to watch it she got exposed they couldn't win you know we heard the other day the red Sox wanna sweep the favorite sport on accurate\n[laughter] you support and once we know that's the way they call it in basketball the gentleman sweep that's where they always called the gentleman's we\nIt was accurate I mean you know ... as a family rooted outta Brooklyn the last thing I Want to see is Dodgers 'cause I ... I Can't I Can't do it but this family loyalty and they're on a Red Sox are just they're going to dismantle the Dodgers that they play\nOn I don't know about that yeah they are\nOn the Dodgers you the problem is both the ...

blood Brussels got to sit there while they all have the ring\nJog godly weekdays in ... new ... he's much more well rounded locks orange\n[noise]\n\nFox Sports trendy and\n\n[noise] that is a the exciting a beginning of the game the conclusion not so good for a Laker fans the Lakers went on the road and they lost against the Portland TrailBlazers here is something that I think is a big story that you're going to hear from virtually no one else in sports media\nAnd we're going to talk about why\nNBA ratings have tanked\nAs well Brian James has moved to the west coast now we'll wait and see how many people watched that Lakers game against the uh the Portland TrailBlazers last night but here's something that's interesting that I grab that one of you sent me last night\nAnd it is the number of people who live in each time zone in the country and I'm not sure when this was most recently updated but it's roughly accurate\nForty seven percent of the United states population lives in the eastern time zone so if you are waking up right now listening to me it is a little bit after six AM in the morning thanks for hanging out with us you are nearly half the United states population east coast\nCentral time zone twenty nine percent of the United states population lives in the central time zone\nSo I'm not great at math but basic math would tell me that nearly eighty percent of the United states population is either in the eastern time zone or the central time zone almost nobody is in the mountain time zone we love all of you who are listening into mountain time zone up early with us\nAnd then the Pacific time zone only has a little bit over sixteen percent of the population so about twenty percent of the population is in the mountain time zone or west eighty percent of the United states population I ain't got surprises a lot of people when they actually\nHere that eighty percent of the United states population is central time zone or east coast time zone and I bring all this up because all brawn James has spent his entire career in the eastern time zone and what does that mean\nThat means that a lot of times people get off work and they get home and they sit down and they've gotten used to putting LeBron James on the television when he's playing for the Cleveland Cavaliers or he's playing for the Miami Heat\nAnd when they do that they will then oftentimes will leave their televisions on for some of these double header games where the west coast game happens afterwards and then if you end up falling asleep guess what on your couch you're a advertiser your TV network gets credit as long as your TV remains on\nRight so that's why it's oftentimes the case that if a highly rated sports of it happens even the next morning the first thing people do is if their television turned off during the night they wake up and they flip it back on the numbers are always huge\nSo if you are or the Tuesday Morning after ESPN has Monday Night football the audience is much bigger\nThe Saturday morning for ... one after they have Dodgers brewers tonight game six a lot more people will be watching at best one on Saturday morning 'cause they'll wake up and they'll turn the TV on they fell asleep on the couch a lot of you know what I'm Talking about you're watching sports\nWhat Brian not being in the east coast this is an argument I've been making for a while and then continued to expand on it well Brian not being in the east coast is a major major deal\nFor the NBA because the NBA doesn't have a lead they have a player will brawn James people care about too massive extent well brown is the straw that stirs the MBA drink\nThe analogy that I Would make is thinking about Tom Cruise when Tom Cruise makes a movie over the last twenty five years people go see Tom Cruise is ... a movie how often do people go see the movies of the girls starring in a movie with Tom Cruise\nHow many women who have ever start in movies with Tom Cruise have ended up being celebrities in their own right who you would go see a movie with\nHe was married to Nicole Kidman I'm not sure that she counts but she certainly is a star\nDays of thunder I think it was where they met she became a star because she was in a movie with Tom Cruise\n[noise] other than that\nMaybe Cameron Diaz\nMy point here is people go to watch the star\nTom Cruise is the star of every Tom Cruise movie there is always a love interest of Tom Cruise that is in that movie and that love interest becomes famous a little bit because she was in the movie with Tom Cruise\nBut that person cannot carry a movie on her own because she's not the star she's just there alongside of Tom Cruise\nThat's what the rest of the NBA is by and large outside of the warriors the rest of the NBA is all about what Brian James is the star and we're also kind of relevant because we're on the same stage with LeBron James\nWill brawn James and Tom Cruise\nEverybody else just about in the NBA is the girl who stars in the movie with Tom Cruise\nWhat's my analogy here the NBA's opening night ratings on TNT\nWhich Twitter what have you believe is the greatest thing that's ever happened in the history of mankind because of the NBA fans are a lot more active on social media than almost any other fan base\nThe ratings plummeted thirty seven percent without all brawn James involved on the east coast\nThing about that for a minute\nAbout how much attention NFL ratings collapsing over the past two years got and then I Want to ask you a question why didn't anybody in the NBA media come out and actually say anything about this\nIf the NFL opening night ratings and going down thirty seven percent it'd be the front page of the New York times be the front page of CNN dot com be the front page of every major website in America that writes about sports and everybody would be talking about it\nThe NBA drops thirty seven percent and almost nobody will even mention it to you you know why that is because the NBA media is captured by the league nobody in the NBA media will criticize a player\nNobody in the NBA media will criticize Adam Silver nobody in the NBA media will criticize anything associated with the league\nThey're all a bunch of fan boys and fame girls\nNow partly I think that's because ESPN in TNT wildly overpaid for the NBA product and so as a result unlike the NFL which everybody lines up to rip and major league baseball which everybody winds up to rip almost nobody says a negative word about the NBA\nThe NBA is the golden child yet the ratings are collapsing why is that because the NBA doesn't have a league it's got LeBron\nAnd we'll brown is now in the west coast now we'll wait and see how much Laker game ratings increase with Ron but it ain't going to be enough to make up for the eighty percent of the audience he left behind in the eastern and central time zones\nThis is a disaster for the NBA I don't think anybody's told it to you\nFirst of all the Lakers I don't think you're going to be very good I think at best they're going to be the fifth or sixth but fifth or sixth best team in the western conference\nAnd that might be an exaggeration that's at best\nI only just seemed to be that good this year\nAnd it will bronze out of the play offs and if all brown is playing along after\nMost of you've already gone to bed\nThe amount of interest in the NBA is going to declined precipitously and that's without even considering\nThe fact that there's only two or three teams that can actually win a championship now it's only October\nSo we'll pay attention is November to me the NBA season should start on Christmas\nIf I were NBA commissioner and I was Adam Silver and I was actually making a risky decision I Would say you know what October and November basketball or over the NBA season begins on Christmas Day\nAnd we're going to extend it all the way until the end of July\nMaybe even the first week of August and natural player championship because there's nothing going on in July and August that's what I Would do\nBut the NBA not that forward thinking in that regard but I just want you to put a pen in that detail that I just share with you down thirty seven percent opening night ratings in the NBA\nAgain because the MBA doesn't have a league it's got LeBron\nAnd little brown is Tom Cruise and everybody else in the NBA with the possible exception probably of the warriors are the girls starring alongside of Tom Cruise and movies they're great as long as Tom Cruise in that movie as soon as they're not storing alongside Tom Cruise you never hear about him again\nHappened for twenty five years\nRight now in the NBA or we're gonna go be joined by my guide Charles Davis usually joins us on Tuesday he's calling games for NFL\nOr for Fox we will break down everything that happened in the NFL also let him rebel a little bit in the University of Tennessee's win over Auburn he's a longtime Tennessee alarm animal fake he called the game last year in London\nAlso ask him whether he agrees with me about the possibility of London being ready for an NFL team and whether or not he thinks that makes sense in the long range over here wants to get to\nUh as I said in the open you hurt all the different games are going on last night we'll talk Thursday night NFL football uh we'll talk the red socks on to the world series and we will continue to discuss everything surrounding all brawn are joining the Lakers and finally playing his first game\nIn the meantime if you've ever driven past the snowy bend your by I Ninety you're probably wondering whose idea was to grow grapes there that man was eat from wells bowl and it took him more than twenty two thousand seedlings of grapes\n[noise] big more than ... I think overall we're getting a lot of good can um I think it's been interesting because north term going into Beatty off into coordinator\nYou know how it is we take a snapshot of someone we decided this is who they are and that's how it's going to be forever more and we always forget that the best coaches out their evolve and change constantly you know time is always talked about you have to do that as a college coach because\nThe kids are always going to be the same age while you continue to get older so you better stay in touch better stay relevant et cetera\nPeople act like north Turner only coach Troy Aikman and it was one way to play quarterback and now ... going to be checked the evolution of his career check the number of guys who played form you'll see that running quarterback got mobile quarterback who's had pocket quarterback is that at all\nAnd with cam he's got a mash up he's got to go and throw up in the pocket going get out of the pocket and they are working to try and create an off that place to both of those strength\nCan't completion percentage higher than that it's been a long long time it's going to be one of the best ones is that if he stays on this rate\nHe still continuing the run the football I think for the Panthers bell they've got to find a way to push it down field which is something can be very well and as a VP or class had a lot of big shot down the hill off of their run game they don't have that so far this year but I'm Wondering if the rookie DJ more will get going\nThe young receiver Curtis Samuel can fly if they can get him going\nThen to have some people that can throw the ball to doubt field because Torrey Smith is probably the best ... threat now but he's not the same Torrey Smith he would have been he would have been at twenty four you know that goes\nOn in London I Know I texted with you some about getting their hall a game over here yeah I think the NFL will have a full time team in London and the next five to ten years\nThe NFL can do what it wants to you and I both know that they can go ahead and say we're going to place a team their ... and and feel like they could make it work the NFL is smart enough to be calculating and do all the rights ... surveys\nMai Mai Mai Mai pull on that it's very unscientific ... All right so when I was over here when I was when I was in London actually met with someone from my home town of new falls New York has been in London for Thirty years and the air\nAnd I just kind of took his pulse on that I said you know like you and I was just one person so we don't count as a scientist but what do you think\nAnd his his feeling of the American football's extremely popular\nBut so many people have so many different allegiances he said a bunch of ex pat there are a lot of people like this to and lift\nHim this team he said I don't know if one team become London's team he said it could\nBut I'm not sure that it would so it was interesting to get his perspective on it and he said there's so many people just love American football but not necessarily be hold and so I thought it was interesting because the one game I called was Miami in New Orleans and on my way to the stadium and at the stadium class that you probably noticed that as well\nPeople who are going to these games but the jerseys and the legion says that they're showing aren't necessarily the\nTeams that are play you know I actually saw someone and and the raiders were playing and my game I've never seen this before I saw a person\nThan they gave Jackson sixty six Oakland Raiders Jersey I mean ... gave Jackson an office\n[laughter] so I don't even gave ... and ... in\nLondon yeah I was like wow that's\nThat's really cool and I'm not sure agape could find the number sixty six in Oakland that someone is wearing so it was very interesting\nWhen a ... it is intriguing and I'm like you I like to talk to people they have no idea who who I Am or what I Do even the cab driver driving me over here to do the show this morning from the studio and I'm just kinda quizzing him because you find I'm sure as well\nCab drivers tend to be male they tend to be sports fans in whatever city that you're in you know that you can talk about sports in any city in the world that I think almost where the cab driver 'cause they tend to be sports fans in general and just try to get the Bible and the city sports scene without them necessarily knowing at all who you are and so I talk\nProbably had Fifteen different cabdriver since I've gotten over here every one of them to a man Charles has said yeah I think an F. L. team would do well here now they also said something very similar to what your friends said which is\nWhen you go to these games and uh you will see teams every fan base represented so it almost is a carnival of the NFL more than its affiliates in with any one team or one player which is the case in most\nNFL Stadiums right there is a Jersey the predominate there's a player that's the most popular\nUh and it's rare if you go to like you're calling this weekend a Carolina Philly if a guy shows up in an ally manning Jersey at that game it's going to be a strange behavior right\nWhereas there'll probably be a bunch of ... you know manning either pay ... Jersey in tomorrow's game here are Sunday's game between the chargers and the tightened so I Do think that's intriguing what's go uh to to Philly\nYou you're calling the Carolina you've seen Caroline and play a couple of times you got a pretty good read on that team do you haven't read yet on the eagles and what they're doing is they attempt to defend their Super Bowl championship\nNo I don't have a real read but um I I have an anticipation\nAnd my anticipation clay is that they're starting to get their legs back on ... for for lack of a better term\nAnd I I think every team goes through this and from the outside watching it you say to yourself how does no one ever get it well I have to say to myself for the same reason that every child is born in this world we try and give them the life lessons earlier\nAnd they don't grasp of until they are of age does that make sense like you\nKnow a total effect yes every\nPerson always says the same thing with only known that you know if I'd only applied than but but only listened well what I'm saying is every Super Bowl champion knows every team to lead this company for them right they all know that they're going to circle I'm I'm On the schedule they all know the efforts going to be fanatical they all do these things\nYeah every year every what has to struggle with it [noise] okay oh by God they're really plan heart\nYou know it until you get into it I think the eagles the kind of weather that early storm they've got their quarterback back now ash on Jeopardy is back that hurts his plan out of his mind that off as the defense has been phenomenal against the run by the Fletcher Cox is playing the best defense deco\nLeague this side of air and Bob all that's how good he has been the struggle on the back in but they're working towards it and the giants last Thursday they would you want to about the giant eagle needed that game is a get right game then they get a little bit of a mini break because they had that late Thursday this\nIs going to be very physical tough tough game both teams need it but I think Philadelphia is past the idea now oh my God people really coming after us and they've got that part figured out\nTalking to Charles Davis at the F the twenty to the voice of Madden as my kids are always a quick to say whenever they hear his voice anywhere where were you for the Tennessee at Auburn game and did you get to watch it live and what was your reaction\nI was in D.C is in our nation's capital getting ready for my game\nAnd where we were at our conference room I'm On Saturday and I was down there getting some work done and one of my colleagues looking through and oh hey Davis there's tendency I'll row gray and the first drive at the gate problem where they would just walk down building scored yeah as a boy very sharp\nAnd so we were doing some stuff I left for a while came back and then realized we had a ball game going on and then I was able to lock in mainly Mitt third quarter on\nAnd my impression was just take a side that victory\nJust that they played played hard on them and therefore quarters and that's more of what I expected in the Florida game because I'm Still not overly convinced that for the talent is way better than ours\nWe were lousy that night and for the capitalized on that so don't pick up taking away the credit from Florida they did what they're supposed to do and they did a pretty darn well we've made so many crazy errors that game\nI'd love to see us play and play it even so to speak for advice there'll be better but I don't think they were better by the margin that that we saw for now because this gives me hope and I think gives ballpark Tennessee fans hope\nThat we will play and compete and all the games would play the rest of the year I I don't have any illusions about our our third Saturday in October I have no illusions about that one that's Alabama that's a different class right now\nBut everyone else that I was worried about\nI think that we can compete with anyone else left that are scheduled and that sort of excited about\nYou were talking to Charles day as you've been calling NFL games for a while before that you called college football you been calling games for several years now at a high level\nDo you feel like the NFL final question for you or do you feel like the NFL's got his grew back like after a couple of years of where it seemed like all we talked about was off the field related issues why does the protest concussion issues\nAs like the NFL had one body blow after another that had nothing to do with the product on the field itself\nI feel like as a fan and as a guy who does sports talk radio that now my audience is like okay the NFL has weather the storm and we're back to talking about on the field related product issues and the products been pretty good do you get that sense calling games can you feel that\nI can that can feel it calling them clay I could feel it talking with people I can feel it flying and people would like what ... what are you talking about you know how the TVs are in the you know the a lot of the airplanes now so you take out there by plugs in\nI tweeted about what brought a and the Lakers debut and also the lack of interest in the NBA without Wilbur on animal is to be who does uh she just sports anchor with Fox LA\nSaid this which I thought was interesting I Want to get Danny jeeze uh a read on this a lot of the media that cover the NBA or ESPN they pay for rights\nRights holders are often cheerleaders they pimped coverage to drive ratings\nFor example well Brian isn't the biggest story in LA yet the Dodgers are you might not know that watching national TV Danny G and crew in LA how much bigger is the Dodgers in the NFL cs right now than bronze starting off his career with the Lakers\nI think it would be Dodgers one LeBron and the Lakers too and then the Los Angeles rams three that's OK\nHow much bigger would right now the interest in the Dodgers in ... LA be than the interest in LeBron and the Lakers at Fort Irwin is it five to one like how would you assess it\nI Would say three to one but the gap is narrowing because of how the season started last night\nAnd the Dodgers obviously had a day off or in light of the the series resuming tonight so now it's going to be all about the Dodgers again today so that's kind of how it's been going back and forth between the Dodgers in ... Braun Dodgers at least two to one\nDo you think the Dodgers will close out the series tonight they are small favorite on the road against Milwaukee\nI think so because re you has been one of the strongest pitchers for the Dodgers\nAnd the brewers were still a little confused about what they're doing with their starting pitcher weighed Miley gets back to back starts impressive unless it's not because the brewers pulled them after five pitches on Wednesday\nSo the one here's one wild card if hater gets in that game and shuts down the Dodgers for half the game then there's some problems for LA but if they can get some Miley early and get a lead then I think the Dodgers will win game six\nWhat is the expectation for who would pitch in game seven if that should arise\nIt well it would be walking would be Walker viewer\nBut ah boy if it if it was me I Would try to go to another Dodgers starter if I could if you go to ... probably retail yeah I ... bridge show was available I Would go to rich shell because he's a gamer and he's a veteran Walker throws pure heat clay\nBut what's been going on with him is the brewers are really good hitters and so sometimes when when Walker doesn't hit his spot\nThat's when the brewers were able to get to walk or so if I'm the Dodgers manager I'm going to go with hill for game seven\nAlright here is what's going to happen in our two we usually on Wednesday do me solving every problem in the outbreak audience everybody out there who is aware we do an anonymous mailbag it's written usually every Tuesday\nI didn't do it this week 'cause I'm In London I've been running around with my family we spent yet Lee yesterday at lego land which was awesome to boys absolutely loved it\nBut I Will solve every problem in your life here is the issue you guys have to call and my guide Doug has to field your calls in line them all up for you so that's what we're going to do with our two right now I Am solving every issue can be sports related\nCan be relationship related I saw I Believe I Am the king Solomon of the Internet and the king Solomon also of radio that means\nIt's like king Solomon I can solve any problems due to my great judgment\nEight seven seven nine nine six six three six nine you call up right now double wine you up and I will solve all your problems in the anonymous mailbag why on the radio any topic any subject I Will make your world a better place eight seven seven\nNine nine six six three six nine and our three for those of you listening on the ... gas\nGoing to be joined by Joel glad he I Believe it's calling Michigan Michigan State this weekend for Fox huge game and the Big Ten he's going to join us live in our three that's the road map for the final two hours plus I'll be giving you all my gambling picks\nAnd the final segment of our three as I always do that is the plant eight seven seven nine nine six six three six dollars a call now let me solve your problems our one in the book the anonymous mailbag next\nDoor down south kick their coverage with slaves rabbits [laughter]\nOkay this is a thirty second commercial I'm going to throw a lot of numbers that you would please stay with me\nIt just Fifteen minutes you could say Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance this company has been offering great right to great service for over Seventy five years it anytime you need help you could speak to one of their trade specialist twenty four seven the company guy go go to guy go dot com today sorry for all the numbers\nThat had five four three two one oh nine out of time\nHey I mean did you know the Honda Dream deal sales event is literally happening right now where you can literally get great deals on certified ...\nLiterally I don't just outlining virus from from ... literally a thousand breed as\nWell that's literally impossible but there is literally a Honda Dream deal failed event happening right now and Honda is Katie dot coms twenty Eighteen best value Brent seriously\nNow's the time to get a great deal of certified pre on Honda at your local Honda dealer based on twenty Eighteen brand image away from Kelly ...\n[noise]\nA fully engulfed car fire right now this is on the ... outside it's that falling out in the left hand lane right by beacon street in Chelsea erode is close right now traffic stop\nTo from city square Tobin Bridge inbound grid lodge for sixteen in Chelsea into the city this or put his body by mothers against drunk driving\nMothers against drunk driving supports victims of drunk driving drunk driving and under age drinking at no charge color twenty four victim helpline at eight seven seven mad help or does it matter dot org that's any Dee Dee dot O.

I found the other side\nYeah OK well first of all I Would encourage you to keep the ... going to some people are going to say oh you should not no I think that\nHaving another girl to kind of give you some uh distract you from like obsessing over the prior relationship is actually good even if you're trying to get back with the other girl friend because of the other girlfriend I'm just telling you if the other girl friends sees you out with another girl\nAnd is aware oh this guy is actually a you know like has some interest in has some some uh some you know like interest in from other women often times that's the best way to get another woman right it's it's like anything every guy knows\nThat women judge men not just based on what they think of them but based on what other women think of them\nBecause women much more so than men I think when it comes to relationships\nCompete with other women like\nEvery woman out there is thinking to herself like I Want this man that I'm with to be desired by other women right I mean that's just the way women think men I don't think spend as much time thinking about that we're more focused on herself I think males competition\nIs more often times like readily apparent like we're playing in a sport or I'm trying to make more money than you are I'm trying to work you at at at a job male competition I feel like as much more above board\nFemale competition is very much like kid\nYou know like oh it's cutting commentary oh it's like very social based so being with another woman if she is a good looking undesirable woman\nIs likely to make your fiance rethink her decision making I also think\nI also think you are having bought a a engagement ring I think I probably would have played the engagement ring a card when she was trying to break up with me\nOr they got to be like you'd think I'm a motion to lay on the unavailable I just went and bought you engagement ring\nTo commit to you for the rest of my wife and now you're breaking up with me a week before we were supposed to go to Mexico and I was going to propose to you know I don't think you want to get engaged and get married really quickly 'cause obviously she has all these issues but to me this is a this is a a play I think keeping the side piece is fine\nDon't talk to the other girl that much make her come back to you and realize what a good fit you were the other thing I Would say is I Would be happy that she broke up with you before you gave her the engagement ring\nBecause if you were given her the engagement ring and then she broke up with you then you're in a messy situation you've got to get back the engagement ring and everything else so my advice would be make her jealous that's my advice jealousy works really well when you can get a woman's stirred up and make are jealous of who else we got who's next up\nA well Alabama just drop so let's go to Spokane Spokane what you got\n[noise] they play a family in a while you're over

got a Fifteen year old daughter who wants to go to a drag queen show\n[noise] you're going to allow that who you're going with who is she going with\nA gun with another girlfriend [noise]\n... okay and Fifteen I don't know is she a like his she open about her sexuality I mean she like she a lesbian do we know and like does she identify in some way or that she I'm just kind of curious do you have any knowledge of that\n[noise] I don't\nThink she is I don't think she she fairly comfortable with it the problem was that if I have to be a little bit cautious because while you're at our local school on the little dinky out in the middle of nowhere we out of shooting with one\nDead and wounded and I really do you have the time to be a little bit aware of that but on sexuality march I think she she got ran the guy who did the um that I don't think she must be an or anything like that\nYeah okay well so here's my concern in general\nIf that she's Fifteen white so when I think about what I Would permit my kids to do a lot of water and they're young so they're not making decisions like this a lot is not necessarily where she's going like I don't think the drag show in it of itself is a is a no for me\nIt would be what is the crowd like at the drag show and the reason why I asked about her sexuality was well if she's a lesbian\nOr she has said that you that she is gay then I think it may be an attempt by her to find other people like her you said you're in a small town it's not so much about the event as it is just feeling like she's not abnormal\nAnd so that isn't that that's a big aspect of the decision making\nSo I Would be concerned personally about the average age of the people at the drag show right and so that the drag showed me a secondary to\nIf they're going to be a lot of drinking at this event or they're going to be potentially drugs is the average age going to be far north of her Fifteen and the average age of a person they are going to be twenty two twenty three twenty eight whatever that age range is\nSo that would be my focus is make it not about where she's going because I appreciate if I were the dad I Would appreciate the fact that she is telling you where she is going and not trying to lie and go somewhere else I Would just quiz her about all of those aspects associated with this event\nHow old are people going to be there how do you get in is there an age limit you know you have to be Eighteen to get in how are you going to do that are you trying to get in with a fake ID all of those would be the question\nI Would be less concerned about the event itself uh then I Would the age range of the people that are going to be there just like if she had come to you and she said hey dad I Want to go to this bikers convention I'd be like well I mean I don't necessarily think that's a great call for a Fifteen year old girl\nBecause I don't want my Fifteen year old girl to be surrounded by a bunch of fifty year old bikers who are drinking heavily and behaving in ways that would probably be inappropriate for Fifteen year olds to be surrounded by\nSo that would be the angle I Would I Would spend less time focused on the drag show aspect with her and first of all thank her for being straightforward and honest about what she's going to be I've been to drag shows right I I don't think of them as being like dangerous places to be but I did it as an adult right I wouldn't have wanted I wouldn't want my Fifteen year old son to go\nBecause of the age range of the people that are going to be there I think that uh I I think that's a pretty easy analysis they're alright what else we got up\nWe've got Alabama next Alabama what you got for me\n\nAnd then it goes [noise] is it just me who are in states where it appears based\nOn all the evidence there are a lot of low education people and I live in Tennessee there's a lot of low education people in Tennessee does it not seem like the callers have more difficulty actually getting on the show in those states like Ninety percent of the time it seems like Kentucky or Alabama is the location when somebody can't speak when we go to them\n[noise] I'm not necessarily trying to cast he dropped about three times while\nI was on her ears my other thing\nIn London right now I have been all over in London\nAnd my uh cell phone works flawlessly yesterday I did the entire show because the telephone in my hotel room broke and because Jason Martin wasn't able to get on a desire to see any connection in Nashville from my cell phone and didn't get a single complaint didn't get a single blip\nWhy is it that European cell phones are more reliable like can you call me from LA on my cell phone in England exact same cell phone that I use in the United states and it's more reliable I don't get it All right\nEight seven seven nine nine six six three ... I Will take a couple of more of your calls on the flip side here in the non image mailbag live on the radio you can always react ... drive is if you think I'm getting bad advice or good advice I can read some of those as well\nI Am again the king solvent of the Internet and the king Solomon of radio what reads do I need to do here I've got reads I Know 'cause we've got so many different at\nSo many different ads loaded up again you can load them up with ah with Doug eight seven seven nine nine six six three six nine we're also going to talk to John Campbell\nBrown odd shark it a little bit of gambling uh predictions and tips as we go into the NFL and the college football weekend but first I Want to tell you right now we are brought you buy Granger they are America's trusted source for industrial and safety supply\nVisit Granger dot com we'll be back on the flip side here more of your anonymous mailbag calls as well as my guy John Campbell with gambling tips on the NFL and for college a college football all that and more this kick the coverage on Fox Sports radio\nAbout it and or other times so that's where my opinion and I'll say something and we're getting an argument goes what she's dating me interact resource there say America ... right now because I'm ... I decided to stop\nStop it stop but talking when um she was trying to do that and now than when they don't talk to her anymore\n[laughter] so yeah the only really really box down here [noise]\nBut welcome to marriage a first of all secondly when you got married you should have decided that you didn't care about where anything was located in the house that I I don't know why men thanks for the call by the way I just have to give up\nAll right I can tell you the number of time in every man who is listening to right now\nHas had his wife say hey can you move this dresser over to that wall and you like riskier back and you bust your ass and you get the dresser over to that wall and she's like you know what I don't like it there can you move it back to where it was before\nI don't know why it is but women feel compelled to move furniture in houses when the furniture is already in a perfectly good place if she's moving it without you being involved\nConsider yourself to be lucky and just deal with it that's my advice these are not fights wars having if she ask you whether or not you liked the way the furniture is set up now compared to last you always say yes\nEven if you hate it as long as you can see the TV from the couch you have nothing to complain about Alabama you're up next what you got\nClay I Need your stage wisdom about eight months ago I took a new director level and\nIn that it came on the ... some wild gross we've had a private equity firms around at other buyers come take the company over or under their wing\nI've recently got a call from my my previous company want me to come back take a leadership level role and uh it's going to provide more money in the short term on Japanese Billy\nBut I've got the upside where I'm at now but the high volatility of it being purchased and bought out by a private equity for\nOur other though here's one that I had a job yeah All right I got\nYou got your scenario would this is about risk reward how much money can you make the best case scenario and your mind that the current job that you have\nA significant outweigh when I came back where I was with the outside of the potential by a private equity in the private equity firm\nBut significantly more means like five times as much ten times as much like two times as much like by at least five times as much and it and the other job is more reliable and you'll still make a good money but it's not doesn't offer the upside how old are you\nThirty six how how many kids do you have\nThree\nDoes your and they're relatively young I Would imagine if you're thirty six does your wife work at all or you the sole income earner\nSolar yeah All right so these are good this is I think these are the good good question here\nI feel like a lot of guys and women as well get into these positions where you're trying to weigh best case worst case right\nBest case scenario you could make five times as much money in the job you're in right now worst case scenario you could end up uh you know losing your job is very volatile and as a result you're looking for a job and you're in a tough situation\nAt thirty six I Would be inclined to roll the dice on five times in my money\nAnd the reason why I Would say that is at thirty six there are a lot of other jobs you could still go do in fact I think that's safe job that you could get an opportunity at right now\nProbably would still be interested in you in a couple of years if things did not do well at your current job\nSo my advice that thirty six now if you were fifty six my advice would probably be go take the same job because the last thing you want to get at fifty six as you get closer to retirement is suddenly the rug gets pulled out from underneath your your your feet\nNow if you're white the job that you've got now and the payoff is potentially much higher than you can handle the stress and the uncertainty and everything else then I'd go with the potential payoff 'cause five times as much money is a big difference in terms of what it could mean to your lifestyle\nThat's my advice there North Carolina what you got for me\n[noise]\nAll right we've got to move on to North Carolina I don't know what happened there ah let's go to Vermont again what you got for me Vermont\nClay big man appreciate that so\nSo here's my situation here um my wife and I had been married for almost\nFour years um we're both in fertility issues and won a well we finally saved up enough money and with my insurance now I'm we're going through an idea yeah and I don't know if you know but it's very expensive we are talking eight to ten\nThousand here yeah um my question\nIs she just over the moon excited and we're only maybe a month into it she is we've got a picture of our embryo and whatnot and she's written a\nBook to it and like my question is how to why\nThey reserved in case it does you know happened but at the same time I don't want to get it but I Know I have to be her rock yeah no it doesn't you know\nI totally get that well first of all good luck to you or because the process of becoming a parent is incredible as many people who are listening to me right now can attest what I have always read and always been told and also agree with is\nIn ... through the first trimester don't tell anyone and don't get to waste\nSided because it is so common for things to go awry for there to be miscarriages for there to be challenges associated with the in the in in any pregnancy but particularly when it's a challenging pregnancy and you guys have had to save up a lot of money to be able to do this\nSo I Would say you ah you know you can be her rock and I think that's a good way of putting it\nUm but you don't need to drive her enthusiasm to a different level at the same time you don't need to pull down her enthusiasm\nBut you yourself I Would say need to psychologically prepare for if things might go wrong and what I mean by that is if you're going to be her rock it's going to be devastating to her if things go wrong with this pregnancy and she's going to rely on you\nSo I'm sure you're excited about the prospect of being a father and everything else\nWould I Would tell you is presume the worst and hope for the best and if you presume the worst is going to happen then you are not going to be overwhelmed if the worst happens when both of you suddenly go from euphoria\nTo taking simultaneously you need to be the person who can help hold her up that would be my advice I think you're already approaching it\nIn the right way best of luck to both of you\nSalt Lake city what's up\n[noise] a long time first on love your show or stop I Want her to agree with you know one of your first caller is my wife stays home and takes care of a five girls and two three year old and they can destroy my out that about five minutes after\nAbout three hours yes yes I\nListen to all the time and I'm sure just missed it but I'm a big jazz fan I'm curious what your take is on the jazz on them that show and what you think bill in the west\nYeah well first of all this is not necessary for the anonymous mailbag I think if you break down the west right now\nThe warriors are by far a I think a prohibitive favorite the jazz had been in that four or five spot for a couple of years now\nI think they're probably right there in that four or five spot it wouldn't surprise me if they end up going against the Lakers and a first round matchup\nI think if you look at that situation over All right I mean Oklahoma City we'll see whether or not they can kind of now that they've got everything rolling when rep Westbrook eventually comes back and it's healthy we'll see what their ceiling is the spurs I feel I kept falling off substantially I don't believe in the trailblazers even though they beat the Lakers\nA yesterday or last night I don't really believe that much in the rockets I Know a lot of people want to believe in the rockets I think the rockets or a clear to to the warriors still\nI just think the warriors are there and if you're a jazz fan or frankly if you're a fan of anybody else\nWhat you're looking forward to is hopefully for your occasion to ramp leaving and the warriors eventually breaking up maybe ... Thompson leaves\nYou need that ... of four super stars to come on done in order for the NBA season to me to have any real excitement\nAh let's see who's up next I got time for a couple of more here I think uh North Carolina who who knows if there are a lot North Carolina North Carolina North Carolina working again here we are\nGoing to hear me now I Gotcha [noise]\nSo I Do a lot of the lower court but er I got a horse horse or lay it out or not that\n[noise] well I mean [noise]\nYeah no no no ... hit your parlay in a hurry [noise] [noise]\nOkay [noise] um\nSo first of all I always tell them thanks for the call I always tell people I Know that professional gamblers like Todd ferman my buddy is like never play a parlay card I disagree I think most people gamble for fun and you want a decent pay off\nIf I can tell you right now we're at virtually an all time low when it comes to the unemployment rate in this country\nWhat was straight and fifty years whether you're white black Hispanic Asian whoever you are [noise]\nIt's getting harder and harder to find the right people you know what smart going to ... dot com slash clay to hire the right person ... doesn't depend on candidates finding you it finds them for you it's powerful matching technology scans thousands of resumes identify people with the right skills education and experience for your job\nAnd actively invites them to apply so you get qualified candidates fast that's wise EPA critters rated number one by employers in the United states this rating comes from hiring sites on trust pilot with over a thousand reviews and right now my listeners ... recruiter for free at this exclusive Web address\nThe neighborhood or dot com slash clay that typically the dot com slash C.

I Believe ... you can get from this is true\nWe are rolling right now I'm at it's just crazy we were up in August uh twenty seven percent versus last year in terms of listenership that's because if you guys that's because of how much this show is growing because you guys are out there saying hey make sure you listen to this guy clay Travis he's a good way to start your mornings and because\nFrankly the pod cast is exploding or we're on track right now Danny gee for another record in October\nWe are we set the new record last month and we're on pace right now I think we're like Fifteen Percent ahead of where we were at this time last month\nSo we are blowing up and it really good way I Want to thank everybody who works on the show it's rare that anybody grows at the kind of re or growing in sports talk radio and that's because of you guys and are so many of you deciding to start your morning with us and\nDownloading it here in the ad I mean we got so many people trying to buy ads on the show right now I can barely fit I'm all in which is a good problem now because that's how we get paid\nI'm All right so uh the Lakers last night on Eli Broad what do you think the over under should be for a Lakers wins\nThis year\nLA brown is going I think the uh NBA is going to struggle because they don't have a league they have a player but eh labor on is out there they went oh and one they're going to come back home against the uh the rockets and have their home debut I Believe what's your over on your Danny gee for Laker wins\nYou know I yesterday on the show I was talking fifty a but what I mentioned was that they really need a pure shooter they need a three point shooter that can spot up especially for games more liberal in his resting or not doing well\nIsrael and willing to ... to retire maybe they radiate now or maybe they could trade with his sons to get them all Crawford\nThat's what they really need because the check this out um they could push the tempo they ran\nLast night they scored Portland thirty four to twelve and fast break points but there's three points shooting what was it five for twenty five per rent is Josh heart was the only Laker that could make a three pointer last night so that's where the Lakers need to improve they desperately need to trade for a three point shooter\nLook I I think that ah did this story line and we talked about it some earlier in the show the NBA ratings on opening night we're down thirty seven\nThe percent and I think a big reason why that happened was 'cause all brawn James was not playing on the east coast anymore in the NBA got used to this idea that they were going to have the ability to really take advantage of all abroad Advil leading for everybody on the west coast\nNow LeBron's on the west coast and an eighty percent of all American population is in central or the eastern time zone\nSo it's great to do well in the west coast but a lot of that was building awful abroad doing well on the east coast and by the way the Lakers were seven for thirty for three last night pretty awful shooting percentage from outside LeBron obviously likes to be surrounded by bought up shooters maybe they could shirt trade for Cal quarter\nAnd prolong has never ending a never ending NBA career our final hour of the show up next we're going to go to Michigan we'll talk with Joel glad about the big Michigan Michigan State game that is going on we will also talk with my guy John Campbell get you some gambling picks and I will give you\nMy gambling picks the finish off the

I'm just telling you I've seen enough\nOf it is relevant that he has great regular season\nThe California Chris Broussard Enron Parker weekdays it seven PM Easter for being with Fox Sports radio\n\nI like the eagles minus five I think the browns are going to finally ended at twenty three game road leading industry care going up against the box and the absolutely dreadful defense\nBrought under six sixty one against the spread on the twenty three straight road losses but I think that and here and and with the brown the biggest weakness is the on line a camera bag just cannot get to the quarterback it can't do anything on the fence so I kinda like the brown there too I don't know loving your your\nLion and I think they get it down in Miami I that there's this week is well\nAll right what about the game that I'm going to be out here in London how do you value and I don't know the answer this I don't know if you've done a deep dive on any of these games the chargers are traveling all the way from LA to play in a game that kicks off at nine thirty am eastern\nSo effectively a and and that's a that's in the states so effective obviously it's in the afternoon here\nBut effectively they are starting a game at six thirty AM their time right that's a really weird kind of feel there'll be up earlier than that do you factor that in at all obviously the titans are traveling over too\nAnd it's still a relatively early start for them it's an eight thirty AM start for a team from the central time zone\nHow do you factor in body clocks and travel situations for games like these or can you\nYeah I think you can and and you it is something you have to pay attention to I think it's probably worth about a point on the spread your charter ... probably be something more like minus five and a half minus five something like that and it's hard we noticed scientifically that it's harder traveling east than it is traveling west and and as you lose time there so\nLast week I'll admit I did not factor in uh uh the raiders Denver Airport travel decision to go over on Thursday and they just absolutely terrible and that gave me and see how it so\nThere's an example where if you don't plan out their travel situation properly they can end up in real trouble so I think it is something you have to consider and I think it is a slight advantage for the titans I don't think it's enough in this case to cover the spread they they just look so so bad last week\nYeah no doubt it's a a messy situation anybody else you like in the NFL in particular so we move on to college football\nI I'm going to keep taking me over and she has games that are that seem to go wrong here and and I like the falcons Monday Night to the giants are just so that I Can't believe that line came down from six to four and a half so I took that I like the fog and Monday Night a lot\nYou like Michigan on the road against Michigan State so far Jim ... is one into a against Mike a day and Tony and as a result Michigan State and then they got a big win on the road in happy valley but they've been very wobbly all year\nMichigan trying to keep it it's a dream alive in the Big Ten eastern also it's play off a dream alive what do you see in this one\n[noise] walk I feel like I was the only person in the world on Michigan last week and I and I just love that match up against Wisconsin but I like Michigan again here but I've learned my lesson way too many times in this rivalry 'cause I always back there\nAnd no matter what you just take Michigan State because they have covered this rivalry game ten years in a row no matter\n... that's a ... that out there\nIt's crazy and when you have these situations you do have to take that into consideration and there's one like this we saw with with the bangles and Steelers last week it\nThe Steelers always seem to win and cover when in Cincinnati so this is another one Michigan State no matter what is going on they seem to be able to cover the spread here they're getting it touched down at home the other thing I like Michigan State is the number one team in the country at stopping the run and Michigan\nCan't move it's authentic they don't get the wrong and going first so\nThat's something else I like I think there's going to be closed gate\nOr other top twenty five games that are going on in college football you can tell me if you like any of these NC State or on the road against cleansing Clemson a massive favorite considering the fact that in the state is undefeated I think a lot of people have not noticed that in the state is five and they didn't play\nA against West Virginia due to the hurricane that came through so NC State still undefeated\nMississippi State going on the road against LSU and we've got a pack twelve challenge Oregon going on the road against Washington state or Washington state I Believe they've got college game day there they are around eight three point favorite any of those jump out at you\n[noise] yeah I I got something going in all these games here and that he actually stay constant line is maybe the most interesting because in the state undefeated getting having three and a half point we've only has happened twice before going back to Nineteen Ninety five aware and a five and oh team is getting more than two touchdowns\nTwo thousand nine in Nineteen Ninety eight so this is a historically big line but I still like ... year I think they're just going around the state I Love and if they thought science by Clemson\nConclude or a running game is too powerful currency state defense so I liked that one everybody in the world seems to be in Washington state I'm Glad this lines moved out because I Love Oregon here I I think the college game day factor is climbing into this line a little bit\nI Love Oregon on line and Justin Herbert my incredibly well they were great running game of CJ or do\nI Love that one and I love the under this the low total in Mississippi State LSU but this is going to be a good old fashioned SEC game number one scoring defect in the country with Mississippi State going up against LSU and they're great defense\nNeither one of these quarterbacks and put together these two quarterbacks have only one touchdown pass in their last six starts as well so the event is going up against quarterback they can't seem to get in the end zone you could put the total at thirty I'd still take young\nLike that one in any other games that you like on the college football slate\nYeah well I really like I like Wake Forest getting tan I'm going to take them straight up as well against Florida State both teams coming off of by a I've had a good read on wait this year\nIf you can run on wake you'll probably cover again from going back in the last few years we have to run all over them they they easily cover the spread of course they cannot run the football there are a hundred and twenty fourth in the nation are rushing the football so\nCokie is coming off by people keep it close it might even part of one\nOutstanding stuff as always you can follow John Campbell at Johnny odd shark on Twitter you can also

that we just heard from my guy John Campbell who works at odd shark I didn't realize it but it makes some sense\nMichigan State has covered ten straight years against Michigan which is a ... that had happened are eight and a big part of that I think is because Michigan is the Cadillac program andme ... date historically is you know the uh what what is not a Cadillac\nLike a uh I went to ... like a

Brad\nShe Ohio State but how do you want to you ... you have Jim harmed by it no no no\nBut I should love Michigan because it had been my wife school but she does not respect in any way Michigan State and she's like I don't like Ohio State I Am zero respect for Michigan State because they are nowhere near are equal yet\nJill aren't always wanting to again to Michigan State I feel like a lot of people out there are upset about how he's done against Ohio State\nThis is meant to me this is a massive must win game for Jim horrible he has yeah can't go to one in three because again it's going to be hard to go on the road in winning Columbus for anybody so I think it's hard to judge him based on losing road games against top five teams but he's got to be Michigan State here right\nI I totally agree with you in particular with the way Michigan State season this going with the injuries that they've had you know last week they did not travel six starters from there often in Stillwater will get the win against Penn State\nAnd yet Michigan went out there and beat Wisconsin by double digits only the third time Wisconsin's been ... by double digits\nSince two thousand eleven the other two teams that did it one of the national championship Ohio State and Alabama and those years so yeah I mean with what 'cause all the sudden I think what you get and and and maybe your wife would tell you this is I think that you're starting to get the Michigan people believing like\nOh wait this is real this team is his best version um we couldn't win the rest of our games the way that Ohio State looks in particular on defense and what their options of line we might be the favorite in the Big Ten right now um I I think you're starting to get that that type of belief which means\nThat this becomes a must it's not just hey we really need to beat them because they're a rival it's\nYou can not allow it sees and with this much promise to get thrown on the bus by of all teams Michigan State\nAnd and that's all due respect to Michigan State because quite frankly if you go back to the pre season remember Michigan State was actually ranked in the pre season ahead of Michigan a Michigan was at fourteen Michigan State was at eleven\nSo Michigan state's got some talent they've got some experience they've got some teams are some guys that have gone up there and done this in the Wolverine\nBut but right now there's this sense that Michigan is on a special trajectory and and for that to get knocked off than a game like this I think would be\nBorderline traumatic for their fan base uh because I think all those things are true ... if you'd asked me right now or you were to say like hey you're going to go and walk and then that's your own money on who's going to be ten I think I Would have to say Michigan right now after seeing all the teams live\nWell and it's a part of that that Ohio state's ability to run the football has just fallen off the face of ... yeah I I I don't know what's happening there why is that you watch all these games you watch all these game tape I look at the overall box scores and I just watched each week\nTheir yards per Kerry and their ability to run the football has gotten worse even though their competition hasn't necessarily been skyrocketing what's happened\n[noise] well um if you wanted to boil it down I think that their personnel right now is a great I think last year they started to struggle a little bit\nAnd Billy price at the center position and help them out immensely see they've always had your urban Meyer has had an old victim guard every single year he's been at Ohio State this is the first year that's not going to happen\nYou know he had at ... and he had Billy price or the year they won the national championship yet ... those guys\nI'm so that's an issue the interior of that line see they're not tackled driven team when you're talking about they're running game when you talk about their run game\nThey are what I Would consider as a quarterback run and and interior alignment driven run ...\nWell they don't have a quarterback that's running it any more I think that's getting a lot of conversation with the White House can and they don't have a I have a dominant guard center guard competition combination Michael Jordan who is their best often says Lyman has moved out the center but he's trying to play center he's like six seven you know that's tough to do\n'em and they're just not getting any movement up front the the name of the game running the football regardless of who your hand to get to\nClay is getting movement if you don't get movement in particular with your double teams you will not succeed\nIf you don't get movement you have no ability to block the wind backers if you don't get movement you have no ability to start gaining any sort of downhill momentum with your running backs\nOr if you don't get any movement you get contact in the backfield or greater percentage of the time that you do if you do if you do get movement so\nAll of those things are happening right now and they're just being masks because they've got the elite passer joined Haskins is is good clay he is really good watching them live our soul press their veteran wide receivers are very good they can throw it on anybody but they don't do really anything else well their defense is not great\nThey're often said wind is not great and if it's not asking for four hundred yards you know they're going to struggle so I think\nThere's some there's some serious holes right now about Ohio State is thrown out there\nAre there are serious holes in Notre Dame\nThat's a good question I guess but I don't I don't know who's going to exploit them both for a potential playoff game right like what team out there on their schedule is going to explore them maybe Florida State just because the speeding athleticism\nEven though the Florida state's bad and you they have maybe one of the worst dolphins of lines in power five or\n... you know there are some things you ... ah last week if Notre Dame all they could handle but the the bottom line for me is that Notre Dame has transformed themselves the defensively they're really good team we knew that from the start\nOf the fact that in book as a quarterback now since he was inserted into the line up and at the starting quarterback lay their average in just over thirty eight points per game\nSo there are a much better team than they were at the beginning of the year and at the beginning of the year they beat a really good team in Michigan so I I think we got to prepare ourselves then I'm sure this just makes people in the SEC footprint view but I think ...\nGo to the playoffs dude\nAnd Notre Dame goes to the playoffs I Know you love ... and are you not at all nervous about this game it in the state board them this weekend\nI you know what I don't love clubs and I don't know what you got a number of our top ten right now right\nYeah but that was or no effect that paid almost beat Notre Dame I mean equipment rose here's the problem who else are you putting it number two right now\nThat's a problem I have\nI saw how state live play and I was like that well jeez that's not very good and at least in the last game ... hammer or what they ...\nYeah yeah ... or ... or something like that I think ... the more he gets reps is going to continue to get better or pro or is really good but they haven't been dominant the only team that has gone out there every single week it looked like a great elite team is Alabama everybody else I've just been shipping them around based on how they played that week\nAnd last week I was not impressed Notre Dame no it was not impressed at all with Ohio State if if I had any if I had any guts whatsoever output Michigan number two after what they did the to Wisconsin but I don't have any good\n[laughter] All right so Alabama would you rest to or if you were Nick Saban jailing hurts has dominated against Tennessee Two consecutive years both years that he started the games were not close\nTo his knee is not a hundred percent and they've got to buy we coming up\nBut basically bam a season is going to come down to LSU\nIf they beat LSU they're gonna be in the playoff I Believe 'cause I don't think Mississippi State can be um I don't think ... can beat him and even if they lost in the SEC title game I think as dominant as they have been it would be hard pressed to leave them out they would be the best of the one last teams I feel like bam if they beat LA she was going to be in the play off\nDo you buy into that and would you then make a decision I Want to uh as close to a hundred percent you could have him arrested for basically three weeks if you don't play a much against Tennessee\nWas and if there's any doubt whatsoever I Would arrest them um and have a dress to have them ready to go 'cause if you really needed them and you were at a ballgame lets say or even though I don't expect it would kind of see", "year": "2018", "show_name": "FOX Sports Radio", "city": "Newton", "day": "19"}
