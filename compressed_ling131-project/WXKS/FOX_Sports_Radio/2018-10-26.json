I don't remember the goose being in the movie but the ... I think so\nIs the the it's a wonderful state what simple enough our our ... our our two heroes of a steel goes from a amassed a dog who wants to kill them or stop them from doing that goes but they get away and they spent all night cooking it\nUh they enjoy it they eat their Phil and then they take what's left over to a friend of theirs right someone who's being held in in a guard house\nAnd obviously we are ... so but I mean it's so so what's what's wonderful is the description of the smells and\nYou know they're having you know this wonderful meal which is not something\nThat they've done very often of late I'm certainly you know on the battlefield so it you know it has all the sort of um you know had in his take pleasure of teaching a good Mayo and that's I think that's what's great about the book is he can\nChange register so so rapidly and go from you know one to the other\nTwo stories or I'm going to mention here John ... where these the gifted and James Hand leaves I Surrender comrade uh both are included here struck me Pete as\nStories that war the war is not going to and they didn't know that at the time I understand that Goldsworthy believe that a generation had been wiped out not ... not necessarily just his generation alone because he was an older man when he went to the front I think he\nHe was in his near fifty when he was there but the James handling piece of set the scene it's two men\nUh come working class one Irishman one Englishman are in a shell hole and they're surrounded by a fog they don't know where they are they can't get out\nAnd suddenly a very young and frightened German soldier\nSurrenders to them comrade and they grow angry with them and they grow enraged with him and they murder him in the course of the short story and it's a theme that could be on a stage that's how I saw this as if it more as a one act play\nA off Broadway in New York or in each ten day in London but the horror of it is that these men are driven Matt\nBy the fact that they're doomed to end soon enough they die too and I felt like I was reading the first war the second war the Korean War the Vietnam War it felt timeless how did it to you when you first came on at the\nWell I mean obviously it has a very sort of underground existence\nIt's you know it's been out of print it was a casually it's reprinted I yeah I found it in a very shocking and I mean to\nYou know I'm not surprised that\nYou know it it hasn't been available um and it's something which you know given what we know about you know was today and and so just in this race and everything it's obviously but have you which is unfortunately you know all too familiar\nRight where are the war is madness and the behavior is not is is Savage Savage says ... and and and the savagery itself is self despairing because it's aware that it it they have they have ... they have knowledge of that they've gone too far and they don't want to but they they don't want to die either it's awful\nBut there's also I mean this was sort of you know back in like quality of the dialogue it's very it's almost too real um [noise]\nYou know like many I'm John calls where they give it this is a dream he dreams that he's wondering in a landscape and there are men hang demand ghost hangs skeletons and young women with pale faces they're dancing around them\nI this is John Goldsworthy of the foresight Sacco who I'd always I'd always regarded him as a nineteenth century Victorian class to class conscious a satirist and this is as grueling I'll read as I've ever had about war how did it strike you\nWell I mean you know I agree with you obviously I was a you know it wasn't a I mean you know I just read his writing I mean you know he did write\nQuite a lot on the wall and he was very very involved in you know campaigning against it off to it so [noise] you know I was interested to read it and\nIt did it feel like he'd had a a complete change of heart from the foresight saga there's nothing of this ... there\n[noise] uh yeah yeah no I agree but also I mean he obviously you know it was [noise]\nWas you know core top and the sort of you know hatred and ... you know the time I mean I think [noise] you know it's it's difficult to sort of imagine you know the sort of passionate feelings that people had on either side of you know at the end of the war\nI Wonder if he had the weight to push back I don't know he died in Nineteen thirty two and then he won the Nobel Prize for literature to Nineteen thirty two and he died soon afterwards but he was illiterate giant the time he served ... in in the war but he's an older person so he doesn't serve actively at the front\nHe's a hospital orderly\nCertainly worth reviewing your opinion of Goldsworthy when you read that piece the book is no man's land fiction from a World War Nineteen fourteen to Nineteen Eighteen there are many other choices to go the good soldiers back the we've not touched on but it's a very famous book on I recommended will make you laugh uh Pete Erickson is the author\nI'm John batch this is the John ... or so [noise]\nThe unemployment rate is that a forty eight year low most people that want to

immediate mark Mary Joe Rogan\nNow your favorite radio I'm your neighbor cat downloaded open the re I hung out in ... I have\nTo start exploring fought students you home for conservative saw some of my family for five and what did you do talk swelled hundred and I heard radio station [noise]\nFox Sports trendy and\nThe Houston Texans have won five straight games in the NFL Thursday night contest on Fox the final score at home was forty two twenty three over Miami just showing Watson with five touchdown passes\nBut the way I look at the rockets is that window while it's not closed is really close I mean this is a little bit of air coming in just a little bit of air coming in the rockets window Chris pause thirty seven\nThirty seven years old Carmelo Anthony's in his fifteenth season he's already causing problems at age thirty four PJ talker who's a key role players thirty three and even know James Harden is still in his prime he's got a lot of miles on his body at age twenty nine he's been in the NBA for nine seasons he's hurt right now\nBasketball's a young man's game these guys are getting into that old geezer territory\nI where are you still good you're still good but you're not as good yeah I'm saying [noise]\nAnd and draft picks or a renewable resource I have a van july's about that for many years it's kind of like being a former you can't fall in love with your future crops you can't\nWrite you can't 'cause they're not guaranteed you know you could have a drought you could we have this these things happen and they happen also every year there's also a new crop of ... unlike a farmer which there are\nNo conditions beyond your control which could affect the outcome of that year's crop or that seasons crop ... invest what you're guaranteed first round draft picks every year we'd get rid of form you can't trade back to back first round picks\nI wouldn't have a problem with it now the final point if on the walls\nI Know is what I Do 'cause I'm ... how are and then what I Do is I Would avoid getting for first round pissed now why would I Do that\nBecause it it it's a fool's gold is what it is it seems wonderful but then when you ... your scratch a little bit you see what's going on here you you you look like a it's not that good it's more of a headache clinic because all of those for first round picks let's say what guarantee the first two\nNot going to have much value right because the next several years James Harden still good but you know he's going to slowly get a little worse but the rockets are still gonna be a playoff team is still going to win a bunch of gave me a lottery team as long as James Harden as healthy so you're getting too late\nShrimp pigs and then the last two you're talking about like twenty twenty three and twenty twenty five\nWho the hell knows if the NBA's even still going to be in business or in those particularly years now for Darrell Maury it makes all the sense because he's a God of God in the basketball world he is celebrated as a superhero it bigger than life person\nAnd he can play the role of carpetbagger because a carpet bag or if you're Darryl Maury if things do go sideways in Houston and the rockets it goes upside down\nDarryl Maury can then exit stage right and head off to a handful of jobs you get a job he was pretty much Philadelphia tried to woo Darryl Maury this off season\nAnd you know those kind of jobs like uh the Sixers jobs going to be available a he's a loved and NBA circles\nAnd he'll have no issue finding another job so I I I Know I don't know for first round picks it it's not like they're Fort Lauder because the the nets who got railroaded for training all those ... those were a lottery\nBut never given up the top five picks I still would have made that choice although the problem with that trade is they got an old they got older players from the south any guys and their prime they got an older Paul Peirce they've got an older a Kevin Garnett they may get older guys\nHey we say hello to Steve in this ...\nMean Perot good evening once again another

the best team in the AFC South now\nAre in the south yeah and I'm not really surprised if you would have asked me this back in August\nOf ... was going to be an MBP like clear you know coming up the the injury I think there were question marks and then obviously he's been banged up the entire year with river long injuries but when he plays like he did last night a queen football or the Texans for foreign the red zone turnover free they gave up zero Sachs\nIncluding a sixty nine million dollar buyout or ... miles on at Auburn getting thirty two million dollars bought out\nBy think Mal's aren't could end up being the worst coaching contract um you know if not sports definitely in college football but I think there's a thousand other girls that can do what Megan Kelly does and as I say that just miles on as an average coach a to a good coach\nA you know there's probably only you know fifty to a hundred guys that really can do what he has been able to do at least you know trying to keep up with a guy like Nick say but so I Would say Megan Kelly getting the sixty nine million dollars and you know girls and and uh you know different networks that are working their way up in different markets I mean there there's thousands of making Kelly's out there\nI I actually disagree there because I think being that good on television when she had her show on Fox News is rare and I think she's good enough that she makes it look easy but I Do think that the worst decision is having to pay her out sixty nine million dollars because everything surrounding that has been a disaster right her show didn't rate\nIt didn't make sense to move or to mornings like at least ... miles on has been in an FCC championship game and he's been in the national championship game so if you have to buy outgo smells on you can point to him\nAnd his current job having a lot of success but I think the level of like being really good at live television is rare\nAnd so uh I I think if you have a good staff\nAnd you can read off a teleprompter you can fake it for a while but sooner or later you get exposed if you're not really smart at that job so I think she's actually pretty pretty talented but man what a with that was on her\nYeah well I didn't take away from her I look I agree she's talented but I'm just saying I mean I I I've known some girls are smaller markets that have good charisma that that you get in front of the camera and can take it over and I'm just saying with that kind of experience once they get comfortable\nI think there's some some girls that could definitely do which he's able to do and to get sixty nine bay and we're talking about more than twice or what goes on but\nGet on ... and where is he hires honestly yeah what I think we have reached this superstar era\nWhere I think the NBA he's a great example of it in the world of sports\nYou either make like an insane amount of money in the NBA or you're like a you know you don't make I mean you you make a good living but it's not like you're on a different stratosphere baseball's another good example like Bryce Drew are sorry Bryce Harper is going to go out and may God Knows how much money to be a as a free agent in baseball\nAnd then there's a lot of guys on his team will be making literally like five percent of his overall salary\nThat happens now immediate\nYou got like Howard Stern making a hundred million dollars a year or whatever he was making it serious XM\nAnd I'm not sure there's anybody else in radio making more than twenty right now right I mean like\nAnd and and then there's a few guys making twenty and then there's very few guys and there's a ton of guys like ... you know scratching it out making forty five K. like the flow chart of of dollar signs is wild when you look\nAt superstars in industries now and I think that's kind of emblematic of Megan Kelly uh overall All right what is your favorite pick let's go back to the NFL I'm going to make you the are you are the GM right now of uh the Jacksonville Jaguars you are going all you're already in London\nBlood you got ... you got Blake ... what do you do\nYou we talked about how the Texans now or the prohibitive favorite there five and three ... three and four the titans are three and four what do you do with ... gave him talk about big contracts that are not deserved fifty four and a half million dollars\nDo you make a move deal look at teddy Bridgewater do you talk about trying to get away even live from the giants do you maybe we'll look out and say I'm Bradford Derek car God Forbid the break the glass and go get Colin Kaepernick what do you do if you are sitting right now with the jags at three and four with like ...\nWell I Know it's baffling right now that you've lost three consecutive games and for the last five in the last three games you've only score twenty eight point\nBut let's not forget you know if you let poodles aired out in the second half of its New England the AFC Championship game there in the super bowl and there's a chance they win the Superbowl last year [noise] you've got a game against the eagles as you mentioned in London this week and if you look at the numbers like ... has been unbelievable in line and which is kind of a weird stat to look at but\nHe he's starting to Blake board all staff that he would be better in London than he is in Jacksonville\nYeah but then you you know let's just say that he plays up to ... standards inland and across the pond a then you've got games against the Colts home game against Steelers bills coats again you're titans Redskins at home that often I mean the schedule really opens up you've invested the fifty four million dollars I don't think you make any rash moves right now\nAgain this the guy that was playing his best football last year bringing a sports psychologist find out what's wrong with the gap between the years he's getting the fifty four million dollars um I still think Blake boils can be a decent quarterback I never would have said that before I saw what he was able to do down the stretch last year but based on the way the schedule kind of lays out projects bull\nAnd they're sitting at three and four again Houston's playing great football getting to their you know getting a five and three but if you win this game you're you're only again back right now so I'm I don't think you panic and other coming off the last of the Texans last week uh but they've still got the Texans again coming up behind December so I kind of old old I'm Blake right now\nWe're talking to a Lance Taylor at the lion's tail or on Twitter you can go follow him there you can also listen to him Ninety four or five jocks down in Birmingham ... last question for you what's your favorite pick in the NFL and what's your favorite picking college football is the weekend is basically here\n[noise] um the NFL it it's kind of a tricky board this weekend and I've kind of going back and forth on on a few different games but I kind of like the Vikings on Sunday nights\nWhen reason I say this I'm a big rams fan as you know and I'm going to be a New Orleans next week for that ramp saints match up and it just seems to perfect rams are gonna be undefeated after they take care of Green Bay in New Orleans only with one last you know for supremacy in the NFC\nSouthern Minnesota although they're not healthy um I think Minnesota at home on Sunday night I think they get the same way the same point to really difficult backtrack roads ... saying able to come back in the second half against the ravens last week so I like Minnesota at home\nAnd they're in college my favorite game of the board last week was Washington state they had the twenty seven to lead a we were kind of lucky to hang out on the second half after the ducks come back but we did get home with Washington state\nWashington state if they get by fear for this weekend there is a good chance they could go into the apple cup with only one last they win that game when I called championship sitting at twelve and ... and it's a team to get into the fourteenth playoff but I think they lose this week on the farm I like Stanford minus the three probably my favorite game in college\nI Know I said a last question but you just mentioned that you're going to New Orleans and you will be down there for the Alabama at LSU game early line on that game which will obviously be a huge topic next week is fourteen points bam a minus fourteen or on some of the early lines coming out of the week in advance\nI gotta take bam a minus fourteen you've watched these two teams played pretty much every game how would you play it you're going to be there in person watching it what's the what's the decision\nWas somebody called me yesterday and they said in this kind of well documented you probably notice a albums eight no against the number and the first half this year and they asked me what that first half number would be a nice little based on the fact that his fourteen they're gonna inflated a little bit [noise]\nUm it's probably gonna be eight and a half maybe nine if you can get ... under double digits for first tap and especially coming off the by with two are in in the way he's played in the first half and you know Alabama\nThis seems to be fourteen Twenty one nothing in the first five minutes every day\nSo yeah I'd probably way the point I mean Joe ... has seen it seemed like Alabama or they're not going to be able to score with Alabama and I you know although it's the first true test and it's a great atmosphere and I know you've been there before and LSU if you're really part of coming up all by on their own um I just don't think there's any way you can't play battle right now\nNo I agree I think you're exactly right LT appreciate the time a joy the weekend good luck of the gambling\nUh you took place a man that that the way of Taylor Ninety four or five ... ... we get a bite out what check in the world sports\nHey what's going on ... yeah last night the Houston Texans took down the Miami Dolphins forty two to twenty three Texans quarterback to Sean Watson costing five touchdowns Houston wide receiver will for ... five balls are one hundred twenty four yards and a scorer although the Houston Chronicle is reporting that ... might have torn his ACL and the game [noise]\nEleven MRI today in the NBA last night LeBron James recorded a triple double lifted Lakers to a one Twenty one one fourteen victory over the Denver Nuggets James that twenty eight eleven and eleven\nMeanwhile the Boston Celtics down the Oklahoma City Russell Westbrook store the Oklahoma City thunder if you will\nOne oh one Ninety five steps finished the game on a sixteen one run to blow up the comeback that's under what is going on at all and always for on the season in the world series picking back up the night Dodgers and Red Sox game three in Los Angeles\nAnd it will begin at age ... eastern on Fox TV Boston holding a too low series lead ... back to you\nCome back here and I want to talk in the final segment of our one about this uh college basketball case if you weren't paying attention to it I think it is a massive story that has not receiving anywhere near enough potential effectively what the jury did when they said or sending these three guys to prison\nIs it codified NC double a rule as wall to talk about why I think that's wrong why I think it's significant and why if athletes or two I saw my guide Jake's of wedlock arguing this yesterday and he was a hundred percent right\nIf athletes want to get a ball so often in politics why aren't more athletes speaking out about the fact that this decision by a jury in a court of law is fundamentally wrong\nBut as I Am an aged and as I've seen the violent game of college football in particular I think those guys deserve as much money as they can get\nAnd frankly my enjoyment of college athletics is not implicated by what car a player drives or what apartment he lives in or whether he has better shoes and better close then he would if you are not good at sports\nThat's because if you listen to this show regularly you know that I Am a capitalist\nI Believe that you should make as much money for your talent as you possibly can that the foundational basis of American Life get paid son get as much money as you possibly can for your talent\nAnd the fact certainly that's what I Want and the fact that the federal government now is spending years investigating whether\nPredominantly poor kids are getting paid some money for their athletic talent at Eighteen years old to me is crazy\nThe idea that there are three guys going to jail for multiple years if you listen to our interview yesterday with Dan Wetzel\nWhat benefit are we getting by putting people in a federal penitentiary because they gave money to Seventeen year old kids families so they would go to college\nDo you really think that our tax dollars should go to put guys into prison because they're giving these athletes a small fraction of the money they're worth to go to college\nThe concept of improper benefits is just flat out wrong\nImproper benefits when put into a capitalistic perspective is money for labor for talent\nThat's the very foundation of American Life I Want to open up the phone lines 'cause I'm genuinely curious\nDo you guys agree with me do you care if college athletes are getting paid under the table and if so why do you care\nWhy does that matter to you and all I Would love to hear somebody argue to me why you care what car ... guy drives in college or what apartment he lives in or what kind of fancy meals he can afford to go to\nWe're not talking about millions of dollars we're talking about at most a hundred thousand dollars\nThat may seem like a lot of money but it's a pinprick of the value of a top athlete and often times he's not getting that money is family is\nAnd they're using it to have better lives in what is typically a family that is below the ... the average socioeconomic wine for sure of the typical American college kids I said it's for a long time you know what an improper benefits is it having a rich pair\nIf your parents are rich they can buy you a range rover they can put you in the most expensive apartment complex in the city that you live and\nWhy is the NC double a in the business of looking into this at all why has the FBI turned it into federal offenses eight seven seven nine nine six six three six nine in the wake of these verdicts if you are on this jury I'm telling you right now I Would have ... I don't think this is a crime\nI Would not have voted to convict these guys and I would have stayed there in that jury that room and stuck to it no matter how long we had to stay in their in order for it to be a hung jury\nDo you agree with me or do you think these guys should go to jail for pay high school players to go to college federal prison for years eight\nSeven seven nine nine six six three six nine I think there's a massive story that not receiving the amount of attention it should first hour in the books up next year calls on this issue on out kick\nOut kicked in coverage with clay from\nThey'll send them a technology makes whatever you love to watch even better if you never say no to one more episode stream faster than the speed of spoilers or binge watching bed Dell's\nAnd I'm a technology what you experience life like color brilliant sound clarity on interrupted streaming experience they'll send 'em a technology on the XP has Thirteen laptop with an eight the gym intel core processor the laptop for people who watch things on their laptop call eight hundred by ... or more that's eight hundred ...\nHey did you know the Honda Dream deal sales event is literally happening right now where you can literally get great deals on certified ...\nLiterally I don't just that way anymore ever since ... rarely eat at five in great as\nWell that's literally impossible but there is literally a Honda Dream deal sales have been happening right now and Honda is key be dot coms twenty Eighteen best value Brent seriously\nNow's the time to get a great deal of certified pre on Honda at your local Honda dealer\nBased on twenty Eighteen brand image which from Kelly ...\n[noise]\nAccidents Matty three this one on the north side as cars in the median strip wanting to break down lanes just after down the road that on the other side of the road Ninety three south on in that same stressed they're an end up are trying to recover from some earlier problems he acted in has been cleared I'd ask him right on the south on fat\nRich three also tough now between four Ninety five and one twenty nine [noise]\nDJ Marcel founding usage promise more up to you to learn more visit teaching march held\nA DJ march El Dorado and [noise]\nThis report is brought you buy the T.

thousand worship failing school than the than the dollar\nNo problem with a witness to shoot or wherever how it is that it would be no problem with it I'm a fan and that it got just about almost every day and look at it a a an addict to go out there and you don't want to have on hand though now\nCollege football with college football players that using their life they don't tell me that you don't think I tried to help them but you're going\nTo college football players than do when professional players that insane and I if I was like I'm like ... if I was on a jury I Would hope that we would be in there and they don't like the gym\nI agree with you I completely agree with you I I mean I'm curious I I I don't know who this jury was I'd love to know their make up where they older not sports fans 'cause I feel like most sports fans have evolved in the direction of the callers so far Daniel in Ohio what's up\nWith a [noise] I'm actually [noise] [noise]\nA great but by the way I mean I I'm having a ... about ... by the way they go on down there\nA firearm ... him on pay and playing them to come down to have that much money are we going to have a Alabama or across the board were all at athletes go on\nAnd I understand wanting yeah it's a good ... first of all you have scholarship restrictions secondly\nThe best players all ready to go to the best schools\nThis is my argument against in cw rules and all in general I hate bureaucracies that exist to change nothing in other words I'm not a rule guy if you tell me a rule exists I Am fine with a rule existing if it is necessary to change what would otherwise be inappropriate behavior\nAnd there are lots of laws out there you can think of that exist that probably change behavior let me give you an example\nThe fact that you cannot drive after you drink changes American behavior right\nThere are lots of guys and girls out there who choose not to drink as much as they would otherwise because there is a DUI law that is a good law that changes behavior and is necessary it makes us all safer\nNCWA rules first of all are not laws their rules but they don't change anything and what I mean by that is if you've got to recruit and he is looking at going to Alabama or south Alabama\nThere isn't a single football recruit in America that has ever said you know what I'm going to go to south Alabama instead\nThere's nobody in Michigan who said man I'm really torn I Can't decide whether to go to Michigan or eastern Michigan\nThere's nobody in California who's like man I really don't know what to do am I going to go to USC or am I going to go to Fresno state\nThere ain't nobody down in Florida who's making a decision man should I go to ask fire you or the University of Florida\nThe best programs get the best athletes already so this idea that suddenly if players are getting paid they're going to change the fundamental fabric of the way that college athletics works college athletics work is just not true\nI don't buy into it at all Andrew in North Carolina what's up Andrew\nThanks for having me on I I agree with with a few points and I my two main concern first would be capitalism and I'm I completely agree with you that they should be focusing on the tax evasion about capitalism relies heavily on\nOur money circulating back and and keeping track of that cash for the families are getting paid my second point would be kind of what the law on speaker just said about the um some schools have more influence with the sponsors and pay out [noise]\nAnd I think it is in tribute to the company or didn't require I'm going to grad I think several good players get taken from us and tell their school and I think the money has a huge influence and as we're on the audience the sponsors\nYeah I appreciate the call look I understand the tax evasion part if the federal government wants to go after these guys because they're getting a hundred thousand dollars let's say an income and they're not paying tax on it I think that's fine the reason why they aren't by the way admitting to it is because they're afraid of it of incidentally rule violations\nSo I've always thought it would be amazing I Would love to know in a one hundred percent free market once a five star wars\nWe don't really know right because if you follow college athletics what you learn is there a lot of five star guys that don't pan out you know you think this guy who signed with your recruiting class is going to be one of the greatest player ever come to your school and by his junior year he's still barely\nPlan that happens all the time so the market would set itself if every\nPlayer were able to market himself there would be some form of regulation that would end up happening\nOr frankly if you just said hey every college football team has got three million dollars to give out to players to have them come to play at this school in addition to the scholarship you could decide to coach good how to allocate the money\nJust like they do now in a major program\nSome guys would be worth a lot tons of guys would be like hey I'll come there just for a scholarship\nAt what you'd probably end up with his quarterback who's a really good five star be worth a lot of money I think that would actually be really kind of fascinating to see college go just have to figure out how much good quarterbacks or to see the value of everybody else I think that would be incredible Luke in Kentucky what's up Luke\nThis report is raunchy or by compassion international you can't change the whole world but you can be

I think they're really worried about it and I think the government and the ... ... ... ... ...\nWe're in a road with ... or ... or ... minutes earlier callers [laughter] bodybuilder who are already out there now that we're\nAllowed to use it to court [laughter] aren't going to play around with ... ... ... you heard or wherever they're going to do\nAnd yet they're ... they're not going to know it it it's a great points\n\nIs ... I mean I think Jay says exactly right I the analogy that I always uses this and you could apply it to your own job whatever you do for a living\nIf you knew that in one year you were going to sign a contract for twenty million dollars but during the course of that one year you could get hurt and never be able to sign that contract for twenty million dollars would you continue to do your profession\nI'll tell you right now my radio contract was coming up to a close and I knew my next radio contractors going to be for twenty million dollars and\nI also knew that if I continued to do radio that every day I did radio I was risking\nMy voice and that at any point in time my voice get stopped working there is no way on earth I Would do radio for a year I Would sit out\nWhy would you do the same if you're an athlete if you're a janitor and you knew your next janitor contractors going to be worked twenty million dollars but every time you off the floor you could be severely injured never be able to be a janitor when you sit out for a year\nIf you were a chemistry professor and you knew your next chemistry professor contractors going to be worked twenty million dollars but every day you went in and talk to your class you potentially we're facing a career threatening injury that would never allow you to be a chemistry professor again anyway you teach for a year or would you set out\nThese guys right their bodies are there are tools that is what allows them to make the money off their labor and every day they put it on the line it's really a difficult situation there's not a lot of examples of a Jeremy in Indiana what's up Jeremy\nOkay ... thanks for taking my call which ... our email thing here do you think there's a racial element that all\nFor years for what they allegedly did a year I just put it up on the whole question by the way if you can't get through and there's obviously been a lot of calls coming through\nOr do you believe people who pay high school kids or their families outside of NCWA rules should go to prison for multiple years a thousand of you have already voted in the first hour of this whole question being up first ... first our first two

really\nI don't think that they should go to Britain but I understand I guess we'll have you don't want a choir [laughter]\nLet me ask you this cat it let me ask you this why ... why do you care like my issue is I don't agree with the rule I certainly don't agree with the criminal prosecution why does it matter like I always come back to if you put a ruling in place\nThen I used as an example why we have a DUI law we do that to protect the lives right otherwise people would drink more they would get into car accidents what are we protecting by these NCWA rules and by this criminal prosecution of the cw rule violations\nLike that's my question if your what what what do great fear is out there that is harming society otherwise that to me is the ultimate goal of why we have laws prohibiting criminal behavior what are we keeping from happening\nThat Robert Blake but\nLet's say that my my argument but my argument here Kevin would be this is a flawed to begin with because competitive at ... even ... does not exist [noise]\nGuys go to the best programs that will offer them scholarships and we have scholarship limitations so it's not actually call by the way\nSo it's not as if you're going to suddenly say okay\nEvery great players going to go to Ohio State and Ohio State can sign like back in the day of bear Bryant\nThey could sign in Alabama a hundred people almost on scholarship and keep those guys on on the team and they wouldn't play with scholarship limitations we have naturally created a system whereby the best players are not all going to go to the same school but the\nBest schools those with the best resources the most fans the best facilities the most likelihood of putting people in the college uh from college to the pros are going to recruit the best\nSo I don't it's

ultimate question here which I Would love to see is what would happen in a pure free market\nIf there were zero NCWA rules other than the most basic\nHow many scholarships you get every college gets

Campbell was yeah I mean how much ...\n... yeah I mean that was the biggest surprise to me ah because I think Bryant they would have a link and Riley asks succession you know and and basically it's kind of take over almost like a vice president of vice president versus going out and getting a whole new coach and coaching staff\nI'm so that would be only as good as if that camels going anywhere guys I think that and and the this is wild speculation I think the NFL goes after and Lincoln Riley super hard and then if she goes anywhere back you would go to Oklahoma\nYou'd think Lincoln Riley like a guy like Jerry Jones if he had to replace the law Jason Garrett that would be the kind of move that Jerry Jones might make\nI think so man ... we got a quarterback that that still young that played in one of the style of off to college or on the deck than what Jason Campbell is getting right now uh you know uh so yeah Jason Garrett excuse me\nUh so I think that that makes a lot of sense I think Lincoln Riley is going to be the guy in college there goes after because it's clear next segment is not going to go anywhere David Charlotte's not going to go anywhere\nWith some of these guys don't think Jim ... going to go anywhere and quite frankly I don't know the NFL wants Jim are ball or with the way that it ended in San Francisco I think Lincoln Riley is going to be kind of the ... all the off season that'd be at a felt circles\nI'm and we'll see if he stays I Will say this I think coaching in college is better than coaching in the NFL you might think I'm Crazy out there but other than Bill Belichick and and for whatever reason Marvin Louis\n... tell me a guy that has job security in the NFL\nLincoln Riley you know you know can be at Oklahoma for ten or Fifteen Years he's already making what is it for like seven eight million dollars this year uh it's gonna continue to go up over the next few years so you're you're looking at a a place where you can make\nLegitimately clay I Believe the way that he's gonna get raises a potentially when at the way he's recruiting you can legitimately making Ninety or a hundred million dollars if your Lincoln Riley by being the Oklahoma head coach over the next twelve to Fifteen Years so why would you go to the NFL\nIt's an amazing about dollar figure to think about um uh by the way urban Meyer six years at Florida\nThis year seven at Ohio State so even the timeline very similar in terms of what happened there and if you remember obviously at Ohio State he wins the or the national championship and year three\nHe won the national championship a year or two at Florida and year for at Florida I'm just a just something worth paying attention to their ... the biggest game\nOf that we can clearly Florida Georgia\nYeah I think George is going to win this game I think Georgia is going to bounce back somewhat similar to what they did after they lost on the road by twenty three to Auburn last year\nThey lose by twenty at LSU than they had to buy week they've had two weeks to stew over it I think Georgia is significantly better than Florida and I don't believe and Philippe Frank's I'm not so as good as Dan Mullen has been with him\nI don't think he's a good enough quarterback to win against the elite level competition consistently yeah I Know they beat LSU but I don't think he can do it against Georgia you buy in that or you go on the other way\nNo I I listen I buy that I I I think that it might be closer than I think the line seven or eight right now but I think it might be closer and that\nUh I just don't think Georgia is as good of a football team is they worry year ago and then the players that are the same players as last year aren't ... aren't producing what they did a year ago last year Jake problem was one of the best quarterback in the country out there down if not the best\nThis year it's not a not even close to that and he has struggled struggled he only through the ball for a little over two hundred yards and they're lost the LSU they turned the ball over four times\nAs team which that's that's the only way I think for to keeps this close quarters in the top ten of the country and takeaways they've got Eighteen takeaways on the year and Georgia have struggled just to touch in particular in that last LSU with all security\nI'm a Ford has got the number one pass the fence and the SEC\nAnd from not necessarily the quarterback we've seen so it wasn't shocked me if it's closer uh I I I don't I just don't think George is that team that they worry year ago but do I trust we pay for X to Florida\nTo enough to pick 'em do I don't know I don't at all and I think Kirby is going to have that seem ready to go and if they I mean\nIf they lose who I mean think about this if Georgia loses who in the world is the second best team in the SEC we're right back to where we were a year ago\nWell ... I think people would say it's LSU we'll wait and see what happens in the sky it\nCome on though I mean really I was rather nice run but you think Joe borough is going to keep it close against\nTwo well no I've already said on the show that I Love Alabama minus fourteen and I think the ban is going to go in and crush 'em but I think vampires historically I I I think ... is a historically dominant team I I think are impossible that this Alabama\nTeam could be the best team we have seen since the U.S see you know Trojan dynasty era teams and maybe even better than those uh I Know Texas that beat him was great\nUm but ah but I think Alabama should go Fifteen oh and I think it's possible they go fifty know Joel and beat everybody by double digits which is just unheard of to even think about it on general\nHere's an here's an interesting thought and I want you to just mold is over ... because I I Would make the our [laughter] our\nPosition they're actually not as good as any of the previous national championship teams may be saved for the first go on with mark Ingram [noise] um I don't think the defenses nearly as good as they've been in the past I think even in the special teams they've always been just okay and special teams\nAre on the wall of Alabama well what makes ...\n... if they can't they literally cannot get a ... year which is just incredible ... because he's yes\nRight now on on a ... that's the most successful run I think they\nIf you get your book it it blows my mind having said that though it just goes to show you the ... the one physician and go wait that we get that one position while we're talking about all time great you got to be a great off it\nCould be considered in the in the pan yard of greatness in college football\nBecause again this Alabama team is not what it has been everywhere else except for quarterback\n... back I Would say this I think they're better at wide receivers and they've been now you can say look they had already Cooper they really I mean they're pretty during this whole ordeal\nYeah they've had great individual wide receivers I'm not sure they had all the more\nYou work better than any of the wide receivers that they have no\nWell I mean that's a high standard to meet right I I think the depth of the wide receiving corps better than they've ever had before and I've been out of the damn downside there is\nIt's hard to judge because when you have a great quarterback great quarterbacks make receivers right so yeah I think for instance Calvin Ridley last year would have been a top ten pick beyond a shadow of a doubt if he had played with two all season wall right he would have put up unbelievable numbers I think you can ... stepped in with the falcons and played\n'em and instead he had to deal with jailing hurts it was a good quarterback\nBut he didn't really have the ability to push the ball down the field or a last question for you\nHalloween is coming up\nWe'll talk to you so after Halloween I think next week when is the last time you dressed up\nYou know what I like I'd never dressed up\nYour as I Halloween costume guy right\nWell not now I've got six for two years old at home if I'm bored of it I mean yeah absolutely love it so the last few years\nI've been dressed up I was ...\nA little pig in the big bad ... like the big\nBad ... so I was a I had a huge pink costume on which was awesome um last year what was the last year oh my gosh Africa or something last year and\nThen this year I'm going to be donkey Kong because all my boys love Mario Brothers that are going to be like Mario Luigi ... or\nAh that also I err so we're having a Halloween party than I my wife has been planning this Halloween party so uh my costume I think you'll appreciate this I Am macho man and she has missed Elizabeth so we are doing it and\nThe ... and ... yeah she is going out and gotten like a Nineteen eighties or Arab", "year": "2018", "show_name": "FOX Sports Radio", "city": "Newton", "day": "26"}
