how can you lose your momentum they had all the momentum first two weeks\nA year beat the giants beat the patriots feeling good mocking television channels for not covering their games\nHow's that going how's that working out for you yeah we'd heard that play Portland reinvented himself and he had some some confidence now because of that championship game performance is the first half when he was good against the patrons you suck to the second half and then you come out and play like this\nNo party shot here we'll hear from some of the participants in a minute but Doug Malone\nNow this is not one of his finest efforts here he has some explaining to do the jags have lost their identity this is a sloppy football team right now is a careless football team\nAnd you can't be flamboyant and hockey and strutting around like a peacock when you're getting smashed on a weekly basis Jacksonville has now allowed Seventy points and over eight hundred yards the past two weeks top\nCompared to some of the all time great defense in the NFL they've given up over eight hundred yeah\nOurs in Seventy points the last two games\nWell\nThat's one thing to give up points to Kansas City but the cowboys not a positive note Jacksonville does play the Texans and that game is in the swimming pool in Duvall county\nWe've that game is in a home game for for Jacksonville so they'll they have that and the Texans are three and three and we know the Texans it three and three\nAre the worst three and three team in the history of the NFL the three winners have been gifted the three ... given away by Indianapolis who said\nWe all white we'd rather lose didn't tie bold move by Frank right but that's exactly what happened never that back we talked a lot about a year on this show\nWhat do you do if you had to tie and the the culture like we don't want to talk\nWe don't need a tie we're not going to take to die and they lost in overtime\nAnd then the cowboys that Sunday night game when Jason Garrett decided I have the greatest running back and football I have a highly paid office of line I'm going to ... on fourth and that one I Would not want to go for I don't trust my office of vinyl trust ... so I'm going to put the ball way cowboys lost that game\nAnd then this past week the Texas they won\nBecause of the beat him in effect it was ridiculous\nUnless you're from dogma Rhone coach your team has now lost three of their last four games you're defense has been humiliated on a weekly basis here what do you have to say for yourself\n... no excuses you know what I mean we just got to do a better job I Wish I could sit up here and say that was a great player that was a great catch in it where there were a good place I I don't want to take away from him you know we've got to take a good look at ourselves you know we've got to look ourselves and you know we've got to put the responsibility on all of us start with me and you know pull your bootstraps up and let's go\nTo they actually have bootstraps I don't think so this is an expression\nI don't know if they actually have boots that'd be something the bootstraps Blake portals your allege Blake tremendous effort their way to really guide Jacksonville is often so I think we can all say job well done I'm sure you're happy with your performance yes\nYou got to do a better job of ... early ... games we've played well as an off and we got started early you know so that that'd be and so that's how we need to start and find a way to start but we also got to find a way to where if we don't start like that to Dover come back and get rolling [laughter]\nYou know I think we're three three and how to start the game and not what you're looking for but she got to find a way to score points you can score seven points you got to find a way to move the ball [laughter] we got to continue to try to do a better jumped take care of it turns over too much [laughter] I was just kind of battle her off\nI have noticed the only thing Jacksonville does well in ... is the crossing patterns and if you can stop the crossing patterns enforce Blake borders to do something else he can't do it like that's the the kryptonite on borders as anything other than the crossing pass against the patriots and week too\nAnd I happen to do some radio right after that game I recall it was just non stop the patriots were not quick enough\nThat particular day with who they had on the field to stop the Jacksonville receivers from slicing up the patriots the fence it's so cool and Westbrook and those guys just had a field day and teams have figured it out\nIt would appear that they are now saying okay we'll ... we'll take away the crossing patterns beat or somewhere else in the field how's that working at\nA yeah not good not so good the real\nChristopher who's a he's a brewers fan so I Do not as good as it dopey brewers fan or he says Kobe's we had a hundred yards into touchdowns undo wall\nThey are garbage so from the real Christopher that's what he has\nSo he says right there the ... the senior trip says the patriots have scored more points in the last nine hours and the jags have in the last four games\nSince winning

and six am eastern three I'm putting it back on Fox Sports radio\n[noise]\nFox Sports trendy and [noise]\nAll the Steelers do is take the Cincinnati Bengals souls or I think they got away with an off as they pass interference call there at the end but you knew regardless they were going to find a way to win and guess what they did find a way to win twenty eight Twenty one the Steelers over the bangles\nOr the Bengals had an opportunity to get to five and one and take a commanding lead in that division instead\nThe Steelers are back in the mix or the ravens are clearly in the mix the AFC North is going to be a battle throughout we mentioned I'm already the chargers they were my Super Bowl pick I'm feeling better about my Super Bowl pick I think the chargers are going to win their next five there now sitting at four and two I think they are going to destroy\nThe Tennessee Titans I think it's going to be an auditor beat down in fact I Am going to go as soon as I finish this show there are open betting parlors basically on every block in England you could even bet on the NFL games in Wimbledon Stadium across the street\nFrom ... stadium so uh is sports gambling is kind of swept the nation ever since the Supreme Court said hey individual states can make decisions\nYou can gamble on everything here in London and so I Am going to go find a sports book and I'm going to put down I'm not sure what the ...\nLiz on how much money or how I can use my credit cards overseas and everything else\nI'm going to put down as much money as I can on the chargers die saw they opened a six and a half point favorite I think they're going to beat the titans by one of your more on Sunday in London I'm going to put down as much money as I possibly can to to hopefully be able to win and pay for my trip over here\nUh in one fell swoop there so the chargers I think are going to be nine and two are they I think they are going to win their next five if you look at their schedule\nThe chargers or what the incredible against the brown I think they're going to destroy the titans\nThen they get the sea hawks who I think there'll be then they get the raiders then they get the Broncos then they get the cardinals are so I think they went all of those games and they are nine and two going on the road against the Steelers are in the beginning of December so that's my prediction\nFor what's going to take place there with the chargers that's how convinced I Am\nA about my suddenly my Super Bowl pickle getting decent uh for the chargers there like I said ah here in London the Seahawks they haven't had any good games\nA magic if they ever get a good football game over here the Seahawks dominated the raiders the raiders are awful just an awful football team are falling to one in five the falcons beat the box and what was an exhilarating game I feel like if the Sean Jackson\nCatches if you saw the end of that game I feel like if the Sean Jackson catches that lateral play their IQ scores in the falcons lose another crippling game instead Jamieson Wednesday's return spoiled he threw to picks he did throw four touchdown passes everybody has been successful\nAgainst this falcons defense but the falcons get a wind up going back to two and four\nWhat an unbelievable game in overtime final play the game the dolphins and ... beat the bears bears falling to three into it look like idiots Drake was going to have the all time go play maybe for the last decade when he fumbled going in for a score\nA instead the dolphins come surging back big win for the dolphins\nTo get to foreign to after losing two games in a row they got whipped by the patriots and then they blew a Seventeen point lead author wrote against the Bengals but at least in ah in in wins and losses they are still a cop in competition in the AFC East\nThe Vikings control the cardinals not much to see their the jets dominate the cold saved Arnold really good game continues to develop the Redskins over the Panthers and the Texans get lucky David, Peter must have the self confidence unbelievable they're tied up Thirteen all\nInnate that Peter ... throws a pick six with Ninety seconds to play the Texans have won three games in a row\nOr it may be the worst division in football\nThe Texans the jags and the titans all tied up at three and three and one of those teams is going to win the division I don't know who's going to be I just know they are that the winner of that division is going to suck All right we got a lot to get to a brand new crew also open followed eight seven seven nine nine

I don't think there's any doubt everybody on the earth who's listening to me right now would have to agree I Believe\nThat at this point in time number one is Alabama number two is Ohio State in the third spot I think everybody out there listening right now should also agree so during the fighting Irish are clearly\nThe third best team in college football the question is going to be\nCan they run the table and I don't know the answer to that because they were not very good it gets Pittsburgh\nBut that got up to seven to know there'll be favored in their final five we'll see what ends up taking place in transpiring as they move along so the top three Alabama wind Ohio State to Notre Dame three and ended up for spot I got cleansing and Clinton has been fortunate to be Texas a and M.\nThey were fortunate to be Syracuse\nBut there is a really anybody else out there not central Florida I'm not putting into the mix there's not really anybody else out there that you watch in the wake of Georgia's defeat and sit around and say oh you know what this team should be their LSU is kind of right there percolating on the outside\nOf the of the top ten I think all of those are the four playoff teams and I think it would be an incredibly easy decision\nTo make right now if you were doing that college football playoff selection committee by the way I'm going to do my starting eleven I haven't written and yet we flew over here to London or I'll give you some more details on that trip\nSo uh I'm a little bit out of sorts obviously we're six hours ahead it's coming up on a weapon forty in the morning here but I'm Still getting adjusted having made the trip over from the states\nAlabama your question number one if we were doing the college football playoff Ohio State to me in the in the two and three I've got Notre Dame because I think Notre Dame the winds have been more impressive ... wins and then he got to LSU in Michigan kind of sitting right outside their tax is not very far off\nGeorgia Oklahoma that that's kinda my breakdown in general there's a lot of different uh ... things that can happen as we finished the season but the top four beyond a shadow of it out to me Alabama wind\nGame and I don't know if you've mentioned it earlier but I don't know if people know there's the only two losses for the chargers are to the chiefs and the rams so those are some pretty that's a couple of pretty decent losses so I'd like to be able to talk you out of his ... but I I'm I'm not going to I think you should place that bad\nI mean if I if I can get down enough money I think I'm going to pay for my entire trip to London now I brought all three of my kids and my wife as well\nSo uh so I think I could pay we're all going to the game in a in that poor kids tightened jerseys I actually after last night's game I sat down with the kids this morning and I was like hey guys\nI just want you to know the titans are going to get beat by twenty year more when we go watch this game this weekend I don't want that to impact your trip just assume that your favorite team is going to get destroyed I felt like I was sitting down\nSelling them their fondest hopes and dreams were a joke but I'm like I don't I don't want to be like crying after this game when we travel all the way to London to watch 'em get beat by twenty I said they're going to get destroyed\nSo just go ahead and have a good time this week and don't even worry about what happened to the game they're kids\nBy him some cotton candy there'll be All right\nYeah it's probably true ah All right so you're with me you're not try to dissuade me on that but now I'm not going to do it All right are the only team to maybe looked or worse than the titans on ah on you can make an argument the jags look as bad as the titans you can also make an argument the raiders is bad and honestly the browns but I think if you're a browns fan\nYou have to be fairly happy with the way the first six weeks have gone given past years Danny gee defend your team there is no defending them I\nTold her to get the horns ready we knew are playing taps well yeah we knew last week that\nThey needed to be the chargers\nAnd they weren't in that game they looked horrible again yesterday most raiders fans turned the game off in the second quarter\nIt's done at this point the raiders or on the clock who are they going to drive or\nDo you think the Jerry Parr experiment is over\nIt's really hard to tell because every ... what are you a salary situation with their car anyway you guy gave him like twenty plus million dollars could you get out of that contractor you locked in another couple of years later is actually\nCan get out of that contract if they want to so\nBut you gotta ask yourself is he the problem the old line is garbage two seasons ago it was one of the best lines and all the football this season they have rookies on the line injuries are plaguing them and the old line is an absolute mess\nUh let's go but uh yeah I Know you feel the same way Roberto let's go uh let me get some of your calls in here quickly Mitchell in Ohio it's up Michel\n... before us I Want to say I just want to say that I Can't remember the last time of his name was scored a touchdown even underwear\nAnd they're not holding the charges to fail goes that's probably a good bet but a\nLot of the word it touched down by the way with the touchdown they scored in overtime to beat the or the eagles I mean and then otherwise they didn't score against the bills and they didn't score against the against the ravens and they didn't score against the jak so they've only scored touchdowns in one of their last four games\nYou're going to hold up against charters but uh\nSo it's probably a good bad but like many times we've got to watch the movie where it's the same thing every time the bangles take the leap where I'm like I mean it remaining killers have gotten a failed to win the game I mean you just gotta wonder when somebody will figure out kill the clock [laughter]\nYeah well I appreciate the call the Steelers own the bangles souls\nThere's no other way to put that Anthony in Nashville it's up Anthony\n[noise]

Cofer used in their starters suffered the loss at best of seven series now outside of one one\nYeah I don't think that your big takeaway can be about the raiders the raiders from now on do rule you can't talk about the raiders on the show go Dodgers then when you go I when you go to yeah when you go to one in five\nYears or so or relevance you can always talk about the raiders in context of what do you do with the overall number one draft pick and we're close to even be able to mention the titans any ... any longer a Eddie Garcia what would you say your takeaway AS number one from college football in the NFL the weekend that just was\nI Will say that I Do agree with you about you in a city that that loss on the road again soldier you enlarge yeah yeah absolutely but the one game that made me just kind of ... in the ... the world's happened there I don't know what to think of the Jacksonville Jaguars now I mean\nThey lose to the titans and now they were embarrassed by Dallas who hasn't impressed that all this year I just I don't know what to me\nThis is it's this team a contender in the sea or is this a team that just is kind of sleepwalking at times\nI think a lot of what the NFL will do is make you question your sanity unless you're like one of the best five or six teams which tend to consistently kinda perform well you might lose but everybody is going to have a couple of weeks in the NFL where your team plays and you think it's as if they aren't even professionals\nBut it's it's when those games get strung together that you really start to get concerned and I think that's where if you're a Jacksonville fan or your titans fan like when you watch your team lose to the bills when you're a jags fan and you watch your team okay losing the chief says All right but losing the titans nine to six\nNot very easy to explain away\nAnd then losing forty seven and putting forward the effort that you did I mean I I'm genuinely and treat the Texans are going on the road against the jags this weekend I have no idea what's going to happen in that game\nBecause the Texans almost had their third straight overtime game I don't think the Texans are very good I think this is suddenly an absolute must win game for the jags and then uh you know for the jags at least the schedule gets a little bit easier after that\nThe eagles come to town the eagles are not playing that well we'll see what happens in that game and then they go on the road against the colds and the colds are awful right now so I I Would think at least a little bit optimistic there Doug what's your biggest takeaway from the weekend that was in college football in the NFL\nWas issue span or that he was saying I mean this is Jerry Jones the higher Conor McGregor it didn't even make sense to me that I mean a professional fighter he's lost three out of out of his last four or five and that's what it takes for these uh Dallas Cowboys get hyped up enough to dominate a game for the first time the season that I just thought that was hilarious\nYeah I I think you've got to be a little bit nervous if you're a jazz fan because that's the kind of game where you should get high for just if you're a football fan right when Jay Leno Ramsey less colds easily just go into the end zone without even trying to tackle him\nIt looks to me like there is an element of the team might collapse now we'll see\nBecause if they go out and they beat the Texans odds are they're going to be in first place by themselves in the AFC South 'cause the titans are going to get crushed this weekend by the by the chargers for the third straight lost and that that the game between the Texans and the jags will be for first place in the division\nSo the Texans can go by the way if they were able to go on the road when their fourth straight they would have gone from oh and three the first place in the division in the space of a month so there's obviously still a lot of different directions is can go I think the jags bounce back and beat the Texans 'cause I don't think the taxes are very good\nAnd I still think the jags probably should be favored to win this division because I think the titans are awful oh let's go to your calls um eight seven seven nine nine six six three six nine I promised I'd go to you or should I go to Larry in Richmond\n[noise] [noise] good to hear from you this morning I was at the Auburn game this past Saturday\nAnd it was about the third quarter when you could hear tigers fans in the stands\nAre griping about mouse on forty million dollar buyout up mentioning his contract that I wanted to talk about a similar situation at Louisville where we are board members coming out and publicly saying\nThey don't have the resources to pay quality to train of a fourteen million dollar buyout no matter how bad Louisville's\nTwo and five seeds and goes and clay I wanted to say that between ... and Louisville um this might be the first season and major college sports ... the river city\nUnable to fire underperforming\nCoaches because of it and minute financial reasons [laughter]\nThat's actually a really good point uh thanks for the call\nI think Auburn could find the money\nBut it is interesting when you give these coaches this kind of guaranteed money forty nine million dollars for smiles on I'm not kidding when I say this might be the worst college coach coaching contract ever signed if Auburn if the wheels fully come off Auburn season\nBy wheels come up I mean I think the best case scenario for Robert now is seven and five right now would mean you went for four\nOr three and five in the SEC best case scenario because they are going to lose Auburn is at Georgia and they're going to lose to Alabama those are two really tough road games it would be stunning if Auburn one\nEither of those games so to me that is a that is the wheels coming off and that's not even counting potentially Ole Miss getting the when this weekend\nOr a or the last potentially who else they got on the schedule a and M. and m's playing pretty well that defense pretty legit Goodwin for the Aggies they almost gave it away on the road against South Carolina let's go to a I think it's catfish Jake is up next\n[noise] well the way so some ethics take away from them or they take away from this weekend was that the\nESPN and found a whole area right at this point if GM walks out and celebrate with statistics at all the graphics up during the game for a guy who admittedly not long ago pled guilty to punching and choke on his pregnant wife\nAre pregnant girlfriend carry kill and the reason they did it because there's no video or the other guy wouldn't be in the late but there's not a video so they celebrate them and talk about man I failed does a lot for a guy who has done something like that that's what I took away from this week's show\nYeah you know that's an ugly situation for retiree kill because you're right he would be Ray Rice if there'd been a video of him choking and punching his pregnant girlfriend there's no way I don't think that an NFL team or the employee him\nBut because there's not a video he is a big time play maker for the Kansas City chiefs and uh I always said about ray rice I think that he deserved an opportunity to come back and play for an NFL team and people say what do you win the world are you talking about you saw what he did on video so yeah\nThere are a lot of guys playing in the NFL right now who have done the worst things there just wasn't a video of them doing it\nAnd so my position in general is we all deserve second third chances in life if you own in acknowledge what you did wrong\nAnd I think that as a society when we treat people differently if there is a video remember he pled guilty to this there was no uncertainty about what happened did you actually read the reports\nBut when the video came out people said oh this is unacceptable well we know that ... killed choked his pregnant girlfriend and punched are like dad is indisputably true\nSo you know the fact that there's not a video of it why do you need to see the video I mean to me the standard should be the same when you're in a criminal court when you are pleading guilty\nOr no contest or taking a plea agreement in a domestic violence incident\nTo me that's the same as being able to see the video just because people are too dumb to read an article and project what happened in their head um I I think it's crazy I gets ... let me get a couple of more of your calls Lucas in Bakersfield what's up Lucas\nMorning right what have you on your way to go from that never do spot checks part well yeah are they called it it might have a shot it it'd be a ... well\nI like I I don't think there's like I've been very critical a gym horrible\n'cause in the wake of the Notre Dame law at that point in time I think Michigan was nine and nine in their last Eighteen\nMay have found a way to win six games sense they haven't always been impressive they were fortunate to beat northwestern after getting down Seventeen to nothing\nBut in Michigan is undefeated for the rest of the season if they are tenant one against Ohio State I don't think there's anybody out there they could question that Michigan against Ohio State would be for a playoff spot so if you are in Michigan fan\nPop your Jersey my wife said Michigan grad will but the trash talk going on I think that's fair Ron in Vermont what's up front\n\nHello yeah we got ya\nOdds Ryan got an orange paint and a new law actually just a fan\nSo uh it's great to be more on my way to work\nWhat's up I'm going to Canada\nDay here we've got plenty of time on the clock couple a touchdown and we're just taking shots at the end zone any bubble I can just fall down for an extra couple yard so why are under the sideline or defend dunk and try to do something other than that they too crazy shocks and what's up with the one\nAnd a tracker only a\nDire what's going on with that\nYeah appreciate the call if you didn't hear the tiger interview um we have now got Google or set up I actually said on the air or off air I guess they started off the air I said hey I might miss the tigers story while I'm over in London this week so make sure we have Google News alerts set up so if our guy\nSurvey by the Arizona Cardinals looked at the Denver Broncos\nCardinals

guys how long do you think it I could just moved to London and continue to do American uh sports talk radio\nBecause I got to be honest with you this is not that bad like I get to be on here from eleven to to write eleven to England time and I'm just dominating here 'cause I'm thinking to myself you know what I'm going to finish this show\nAnd then I'm gonna go right my column about the weekend that was in college football and then I've got nothing else that I have to do I go out to dinner I can stay out late I'd go have a few beers couple of ... and then I can just wake up and come to the show again\nAt eleven eight like this is what coward lifestyles like you would ... the ... you would be broke within a year because of all those gambling windows you talked about\nWell that's true I mean I they're they're on every block you are the William hills and and what not and I'm going to go to William Hill and I'm gonna make that move selfishly because I Know they got a lot of money that they're spending in the United states I'm going to give him a ton of free publicity I now here's the downside\nI Would I don't know if I could do my TV show 'cause I'm not doing a television show this week while I'm here because it's going to be on so late but in terms of radio\nI got to tell you get up and doing and eleven to to morning show and and and the United states like I just feel like I'm so far ahead of everybody else because like a wake up your digital I'm In the future that's where I Am I'm In the future for everybody else right now it's a great way of putting it\nI Am just like I'm six hours ahead of the east coast\nAnd like I'm Still productive now like I knew everything that I was going to do I was out and about early in the morning\nOr on like three am on the on the east coast I'm up and moving around by a now\nThat you know sometimes the late night sports like I you know I didn't watch every minute of every late night sporting event but let's be honest I mean\nEven getting up at at four AM like I Do in the states like I ... I think my lifestyle potentially could be better go out to dinner every night I how long do you think I could do what do you think the what do you think Fox Sports radio would say if they were like hey\nI Want to do in the morning show but I it doesn't have to be London it could be like\nIf I decided to move I mean I don't know anywhere in anywhere in the world outside the United states how ... what do you think the response or my bosses would be\nI'll say about a month later and they get the bill for the for the connection\nDidn't think they can actually did that I like I said I don't know what the technology cost I'm In a studio here technology has become such they're like I'm sitting in a London studio if you just took this studio and put it anywhere in the world like I Would have no idea where I Am I'm fortunate 'cause we've got a lotta studios that we can use all over the place\nAt some point they would just pay to have a studio full time for me I Would love to know the answer to that like if I was like hey I'm moving to Australia but I still want to and I don't even know how to ...\nYou know what the time zone differences but I still want to do east coast morning radio and the other question is how long could I Do it if I just didn't tell listeners how long could I Do a show from overseas where they would have no idea I was doing it I think I could do it\nFor years I think a dead giveaway would be that you start talking about soccer a lot and we would know something was up [noise]\nIs why it's it's amazing because I was just thinking about this yesterday 'cause I watch the NFL all day from London and obviously it's a big topic because\nWe'll the NFL move in and get a game and a team in London I think the answer is yes I mean people over here there is a lot of interest um in a in the NFL and I can see a growing a great deal when they actually had a fulltime franchise\nAnd it it it it felt like we were in the technology age now where I feel like you can watch sports anywhere right so I didn't feel like I remember years before when I Lived in the Caribbean um I Lived in the U.S Virgin Islands\nAnd you felt like you were in a different world there because your way out in the middle of the Atlantic ocean and it was hard to be able to get every game they didn't have the NFL Sunday ticket\nI feel like now the technology such I'm going to be honest with you I you can go on do you guys know that you can go on Reddit and type in if you go on Google right now\nAnd you type in pretty much any sporting event that's going on in the world and put read it at the end of it read it like the world's largest Internet message board you can get a free age the feed stream directly to your phone so\nAnd again it's pirating but yesterday when I was in London I didn't have it every game uh you know like access to every game I get by in us I've got NFL red zone so I can just flip back and forth and I'm watching like every major moment of every game\nSo I there are a lot of games obviously they came down to the wire whether it was the Steelers against the uh the bangles\nWhether it was the uh the game between the uh the dolphins and the bears whether it was the jags against or not the jak whether it was the Texans are jak spent whether it was the Texans against the um who they beat the bills\nLike there were a ton of games coming down to the final play especially in the early window so the early window here in London I had that crappy sorry guys\nRaiders game they were just getting drilled by the sea hawks on my main TV and so I was like you know what I Want to make sure that I'm seeing all the ends of the game they were doing a good job breaking in and giving us highlights throughout those games but I just typed it in on Reddit have you guys ever done that and you can watch an HD perfectly\nFrom your phone or your eye pad or your computer whatever game you want\nAs anybody else ever tried that I haven't I don't know how I knew because my kids told me\nMy kids are so active on the Internet they were like hey dad and I don't know how they found that they are like if you go on and read it and you just type in any game it streamed live in age deep perfectly and you could just watch it for free\nI said there's no way that is true and I never you really need to use it\nUh because my kids were like hey we want to watch the game that's not on in our local broadcast and so they'll just go in through their X. box and I'll come upstairs and their streaming whatever NFL game they want to watch through red eye and so and I hope I'm not going to get it turned\nWhat teams have you seen play and you feel like every week you know what you're going to get from them I've got I think five there's five teams you can rely on right now in the NFL through six weeks\nIn a good way there were some teams that you can rely on in a bad way but I'm trying to focus on the good right now the rams\nThe rams are going to be good they are six into last night you know we saw\nWe saw the chiefs and we know the chiefs are going to be good even though they lost last night I feel like we actually learn more about the chiefs than we did the patriots keys are going to be good I felt like the chargers\nAre going to be good if you look at who the chargers have lost two they've lost to the rams and they have lost to the chiefs those are two really good teams\nI feel like the chargers by and large are going to be good I felt like New Orleans\nIt's going to be pretty good even though they lost in week one\nTo the uh to the box they put up forty two points I felt like the chargers we can rely on to be good\nI'm not sure we can rely on anybody else based on what we've seen there's evidence that the team can be awful people saying the patriots therefore and to the patriots were awful\nAgainst does alliance the patriots were awful against the jacks those are not two very good football teams that the patriots lost to\nThe bangles they've been competitive every week but they've been competitive against everybody whether they're good or bad the ravens just attack the titans eleven times but the week before they lost\nTo a pretty bad I think Brown's team and they couldn't scored a touchdown so I think the only teams you can rely on right now in the NFL\nPretty straightforward you can rely on the rams you can rely on the saints you can rely on I think the chargers certainly the chiefs and I think that's it\nThrough six weeks I mean I can be good or bad\nThe NFL has been so unpredictable I think there are only about four teams you can rely on and feel like you know what I I I Know what I'm going to get out of this team that's four in the NFL how many teams can you rely on so far in college football\nOn a high level to perform at an excellent level every week\nI think there's only one team I think it's Alabama everybody else in college football so far has given you reason not to believe in Ohio State was very fortunate to get past Penn State they weren't even very good against Minnesota\n... very fortunate to be Texas am incredibly fortunate to be Pittsburgh sorry Syracuse Pittsburgh beat Syracuse Notre Dame they could last several games they were lucky to win this weekend against Pittsburgh\nLSU maybe I'll let you been the second most reliable team I think there's an argument to be made there because while they lost to Florida their performance was pretty reliable\nThey lost they lost to a good team on the road I think probably Alabama's the most reliable I think you could make an argument LS used the second most reliable Michigan oh they were lucky to get past northwestern even though they got the big win over Wisconsin\nYou can also obviously lost Notre Dame to begin the fees and Texas no way they lost by fourteen to Marilyn Georgia know up until this past weekend Alabama Georgia to most reliable they got there asking this weekend by LSU\nOklahoma lucky to get past army goes out gives up forty eight to Texas central Florida maybe\nAlthough central Florida only one by one I relied on the cover and they couldn't do it for me it gets Memphis either one reliable team in college football right now it's Alabama at the high level like there are only four in the NFL it's pretty good breakdown\nThat gives you a sense could be a wild season in Alabama got an injury\nWith two or I'm not sure they're reliable at all if you were talking about what was not in the game like Alabama\nJust becomes a good team not a great team but they have to go to jail and hurts final hour

I'm a I Donald Trump calls in live and we got him on the show well yeah well the the I was focused ended it we don't even have a [laughter] and the president just calls in and we just go to the phone lines and instead of random people calling in from all over the country\nIf the president calling ya Washington DC\nWell see I was focusing on the other side the defense so the celebration you you want\nSo you were answering the question that I\nDidn't ask exactly so you want to have you ever went to the failing to giving up the sex\nI set of Lebanon F bombs like having to drop ... to ... I I I ... and look we cursed I think a couple of times in multiple years on the show every now and then a curse word will come out and that's\nYou know we've got a drop it or whatever but it's relatively rare that that would happen on this show so it's not even the equivalent of meeting on the radio because again eleven sex to me is eleven distinct failures\nOf the packages example for FedEx is I think a decent one like huge deliver your job is to deliver packages and you go to the wrong address even though the packages correctly addressed if you delivered one fourth of your packages to the wrong place\nYou would probably get fired and I would bet that's about as bad as any FedEx driver as ever done\nAll right so the equivalent would be you missing eleven lives sponsor reads\nWhich is almost impossible for me to do I mean we have a lot of ads on this show I'll tell you this I because we flew over here to to do the show from London\nMy I didn't set an alarm because uh I was up late watching games but I'm like there's no way I Need to set an alarm because the show doesn't start 'til eleven here\nAfter my joke about making fun of that my wife didn't set an alarm\nEither and the kids obviously we traveled with everybody everybody was still asleep at ten twenty five so my wife wakes up at ten twenty five and she's like don't you have to do your radio show this morning like yeah I Do the radio show every morning\nI was like but it's it's cloudy year so it wasn't that bright and sunshiny and I was like yeah but it's what time is that exist like eight thirty or something she's like no it's twenty five and I was like oh my God now I knew that it was close like I had done the research to know that the studio that I'm using today is really close to the hotel we're staying in\nSo I had already done the research to know it would only take me five minutes that was the other reason why I didn't set an alarm 'cause I'm like okay I Know it's not going to take that long and I was up late watching football\nUh over here with a six hour time difference I was like it's not going to be that much different\nBut man that would have been maybe vehicle if I hadn't shown up first show I haven't ever missed a show now we've had issues with technology not working for us\nBut has there ever been anybody that is just not shown up like what would you guys do if I just didn't show up one day\n[noise] um we have we have a ah we would\nOrder pizza and have a party do when you have any\n... any has the story there was an employee here Eddie what did he do he when he walked off the set\nRight yeah he wasn't the only host though there was he was doing a show with someone else and he just decided that I don't want to work here any more [laughter] I live on the air yeah he left during the middle of the show you just like oh\nWow that's a hell of a way to go and so that was like the the uh uh the guy for the bills who just a dry you're so tired at halftime then come back so the middle of his show he just like yeah I'm Out so what did you guys do\nWell via the other co hosts just took over\nA finished well there's two if there's too I mean yeah it's still ridiculous for somebody to leave in the middle of the show but if you have it goes well what would happen like I've never knock on wood I haven't been sick\nSo there's never been a moment in time that I've been doing this show I don't think I've ever Mr radio show again knocking on wood for being sick I remember doing one radio show where I threw up\nLiterally during a commercial break and came back to finish and then threw up in the next commercial break and I had the flu and I was just like it hit me\nYou know sometimes when you get sick like it just hits you all of a sudden and you're like you go from feeling like a fairly decent to just like you're done almost immediately to flu sometimes hits you that way\nWhat what happened so I haven't ever called that have been like hey I'm not going to be on what would happen if I just didn't show up one day because just me you guys have three hours to feel what do we have a scramble for that and we have any idea what would happen\nI think it would be the triple ... show the genes would fill in on the microphones\nYou guys are you know yeah yeah trouble with the longest you've ever had you've had to fill in before we had tech issues on the show what's the longest you've ever had to fill in Eddie with not knowing the host is going to be there\nI think maybe a segment and a half was probably the longest\nI've ever felt like I I assume forever right because you're like what's going on where's the host\nYeah you're you're just you're wondering how much material should I use because I don't know how long I'm going to be on here so you are you know I got to stretch out in a sweating bullets [laughter] yeah yeah a little bit\nSo All right so what would be the equivalent of eleven ... for me on this show\nI gotta think making a like making a mistake a key moments are doing a recap of a game and doing it like over and over again\nHow about this hour working talking bad about a company and you didn't realize they were paid sponsor on the network\nThat have that with that first of all I'm sure that that either has happened or will happen at some point in my career so that wouldn't surprise me at all\nAnd again that's just one mistake\nSo I mean I think there's a difference between making one big mistake right like they're all different sorts of people out there in their jobs everyday everybody who's listening to us right now I Can't think of one big mistake that you might do at your job and it's a bad one and it might be something that would even get you fired\nBut it's just one big mistake is not a Web an awful\nRice but if you have the oil and it's the equivalent to the total of eleven giving up a loving sex right\nMaybe but I think it's easier it's easier for me to forgive one big mistake than it is eleven small mistakes because eleven small mistakes is incompetence\nWell how many how many ... are you okay with them giving up\nFour or five like if if you have a game as an off into the line and you give up four or five ... not a good game\nIs not an ideal game by any stretch of imagination but a a four or five sec game you can see how that could happen as ... as a weapon sack game at home when you have the highest paid left tackle in the entirety of the NFL I think he's the highest paid left tackle ever\nAnd you have another first round draft pick at at right tackle and again playing at home is big to me because you don't have any of those you know like ... if you got a great home field advantage\nIn the NFL or college there's often times where I tackled just doesn't get off because he doesn't hear the snap count and somebody can get around them and like make a play and get a sack that can happen two or three times remember also talking about\nMark is more Yoda is a mobile quarterback he avoided another four or five sex by avoiding like a rash or coming clean\nAnd rolling out and make you know either scrambling or just throwing the ball away so if you had a stationary quarterback in other words if you had let's say blame gathered who's the backup and can't move at all\nHe would have probably gotten fact Fifteen times in this game at twelve is the all time record in the NFL so we're talking about one of the worst performances\nIn the history of often civil lines in the NFL open phone lines I'm curious on this we're gonna continue to pack a day to we're going to continue to unpack and ... eight seven seven nine six six three six nine\nAlex ... is actually going to join us later in the week so no gas at all\nWe do this all the time on the show on Mondays no guess Mondays where we only allow you guys to react to everything that happened in college football\nAnd the NFL we will continue I'm Travis this vow kick the coverage eight seven seven nine nine six six three six nine at the number eight seven seven nine nine six six three six nine yeah when I got it right oh let's put dubbed a work right now the job is gonna field's your calls yeah\nUh if you've ever driven past the snow event years by I Ninety you've probably wondered whose idea was to grow grapes there that man was eat from wells\nBowl his name is from wells bull that's a hell of a name and it took it more than twenty two thousand seedlings of grapes\nTo invent the Concord grape a tough fruit that could thrive in cold winters it was either that or moved to Florida and you can infer by the twenty two thousand attempts that wasn't really an option for a man whose last name was bowl\nThe world's tough it's antioxidants Welch is tough as grapes\nHow\nThe\nBut yours and mine like absent truly unbelievable sporting related events like let's say the miracle on ice in Nineteen eighty which was a reflection of you know going on during the Cold War America trying thing over the Soviet Union\nThey're relatively few sporting events they truly change the world Jesse Owens maybe in thirty six in Berlin beating Hitler's Germany like those things can matter in the larger context but most sporting events don't Steven Kentucky what's up Steve\n[noise] [noise] [noise] yeah we got you what's up [noise]\nAll right I got back lash up stores for China grocery stores in western Kentucky [noise] really exact according to the you know call no show eleven times\nStill gets the job [noise] alright yeah now has [noise] has to be suffering along with that because they will call no show manager [laughter] [noise] yeah\nThat's not a bad analogy because that that's the least eleven distinct failures\nAnd that I think it's rare that most people would be able to fail eleven times\nAnd be able to keep their job the worst case scenario for you if you are and often civil line is to allow a sack right that's the worst thing you can do\nAnd to have it happen eleven times\nAgain I think it's significant that it's at home I also think it's significant that you would have the highest paid off and said why men on that line and another first round her and one of the highest paid off in civil lines in the entirety of the NFL that's tough to explain away\nKim in Rochester New York what's up Tim\nHey I'm first of all the ravens that was incredible uh they didn't say turnovers yet they had eleven fact that they say\nThat right boy to you got to give you gotta give Mario to a little bit of credit you follow the ball once and recovered it I got knocked out of his hand but to get hit eleven times and not turn the ball over is pretty incredible in of itself that's a good point to the ravens didn't even get a single turnover despite creating a lead in sex\nTrue um so I was thinking equivalent as far as your job or since you're a part of a team as well like markets Marietta part of it too\nSo I was thinking if you work too perfect for the call or the patriots kicker even gotten past eleven times that would be the equivalent\nYeah they sure don't but that's not the worst thing I can do that's why I think like I meant mess up people's names all the time on this show right I'd say the wrong team when you're doing a national radio show it's not like you're sitting down and just talking about one or two teams like you would for a local show\nSo you're dealing with a lot of names so mispronouncing your name or saying the wrong team name I mean look I'm certain that if you go back through all three hours of the show my live radio talking has not been flawless almost no one would ever be able to do that\nAnd so I don't I don't think I mean like do I get things wrong all the time yeah do I say the browns what I mean the bills sometimes yes do I sometimes use a quarterback who's been retired due I sometimes say uh I I don't know some were maybe I mentioned John Elway when I'm trying to talk about K skiing um yeah I Would bet something like that happens\nBut those are not major errors you can kind of follow along with it even if I did it all the time for instance Petro five Degas comes on with this every Tuesday I don't think I've gotten his a hit the radio station right am five Seventy sports in LA\nThat's the way it right while you're ... you know you around so I get that wrong every time but it's not that big of a deal Michael in LA what's up Michael\nClay you so much white but most of the guys to shame and I've been following you plan and knowledge and entertainment level is way off the charts\nBrazil I appreciate that\nLet me tell you what I Do is financial advisor and I don't get a commission unpaid Sherry which means my advice is based on [laughter] for my client I gave a lot and bankers [laughter] my clients and everything and the very next day\nAnd that would be like a law that I Would be to be fired and into the equivalent to not working out for for my client weaning my pain and my quarter back and then pay my wages [noise]\nYeah that's not bad uh I could give out eleven bad blood bank guarantees in a row\nNow the differences that would happen over the course of eleven weeks and our blood bank didn't cash this past week but eleven in a row it's tough to lose on when you have you on that in baseball on your TV ... baseball baseball's a little bit different because the money line in baseball and some of those baseball bats they were counting his beats were like\nWho's going to hit the first home run in this game so you know it's like well the one to win that so\nIt it's hard to lose I mean again oh in eleven is just as hard as eleven to know from a gambling perspective but it's hard to do that I mean anybody who's ever tried to hit a parlay card\nIt's just as hard to get a Lebanon winners on a parlay card as it is to get eleven losers like either way to me you should get paid off I mean if I had a gambling come if I had my own a like a gambling house\nI Would do that for the ... like look you win if you get eleven right and you also when if you get eleven wrong we may not win the full amount but you get like ten times your money if you get eleven wrong too 'cause just as hard to be wrong eleven times is is to be right eleven times let's go to a Adam in Indiana what's up out of\nIt right there are just so it's kind of like oh no I leave your house and the her no power or Lebanon hours I'd say that'd be that'd be about eleven sex\n[noise] yeah that would be tough if you if you left the house but again that's I'm assuming one error to me the thing that's amazing about eleven taxes you have done the worst thing you could do with your job eleven different times which is almost unheard of it hasn't happened in Thirty years in the NFL\nAnd almost did something that no one twelve is the record\nSo it's almost something that no offensive line is ever accomplish here's the other thing it's not like the titans ran eighty place they were so bad off instantly\nWe ran forty place so it's not as if it's the percentage of the of the snap that lead to attack this even crazier now I guess you could also say well teams passed more now but the titans didn't even past that many times in that game\nThey tried to pass it didn't even try to pass that many times which go watch out kicked VIP line Let's go to Brian in Atlanta what's up\nMore than ... I'm a director over supply chain for a for a large organization oh it'd be like ... times a store ran out of chicken and didn't do their couldn't sell\nGood an open their doors because last screwed up loving time and made them shut their doors I I think you get fired for that right oh definitely I if I did it twice I'll get fired yeah\nThanks for the ...\nUh sorry cut him off there thanks for the call trying to get to everybody thanks for being an al ... VIP as well to go to Dylan in South Dakota what's up building\n[noise] yeah I think with your background you may have like a criminal defense attorney causing a number of an eye for an arraignment at the same time and having ...\nThat's pretty good that's pretty good deal in South Dakota you had eleven different ... ... ... people that you are representing and you were intending for them to plead not guilty and instead you pled guilty that's pretty incredible Jason in orange county what's up Jason\nI it would be a big uh me on the show I tear apart your argument and you say hell no I'm going to double down take another caller get torn apart by that caller\nAlive in color straight argument you lose all your credibility\nIt would be tough to get dumped on by eleven straight callers because frankly I don't think that eleven stray callers would be able to actually talk\nUm because inevitably if we take eleven call somebody comes on and then it like they lost the ability to speak or or their cell phone is so bad but yeah that would that's a that's a good example would be up a weapon straight callers just came on and dumped on me\nBy the end of the eleventh call I think you guys would be like why does this guy I have a television show and I think there's probably a lot of people out there saying why the world of these guys getting paid millions of dollars to block per quarter back if they failed eleven times or any Garcia what you got ...\nGot a guy go scoreboard for you we'll start with postseason baseball game to American jeopardy series red socks over the Astros\nSeventy five Boston's Jackie Bradley junior to begin with a ... voted double in the third any drugs in reruns barge picked up the winning relief started David Price ... for use their starter sort of lost the best of seven series now tied", "year": "2018", "show_name": "FOX Sports Radio", "city": "Newton", "day": "15"}
