Smith is worth a look see especially in a daily fantasy league play that maybe you get a big in out of here mark Ingram getting back into his role at least at the goal line gets into a top twelve position and Kirk Cousins we celebrate her cousins around here so he gets he's a punching bag for everybody\nHad a great year man he's like you look at his numbers Kurt cousins at a damn good year I mean he I don't know his fumbling issues are weird though it's a strange thing you have a question about it what like who is the guy the old the old ... there was a Roman Gabriel used a level on yeah and I remember hearing that like a kid who told me that yeah ... yeah but\nHe it's it's weird thing her cousin's just always fumble football like he's got an abnormal number of fumble Z\nBut if you look at his numbers he's played really well he played good for for Minnesota\nYeah both for fantasy and for real purposes look the defense has been a shell of what was the right and he's had to carry this team throughout the season was the big question for for a lot of fantasy owners and wringing their hands over some smaller shepherds from Stefan dig over he'll five major today oh ...\nThat's what I was going to my next question for you my comment Fox Sports radio fantasy football inside of you've got Adam stealing who is the talk of of every NFL receiver discussion of both and fantasy and in real life because he's going for a record seven straight a hundred yards receiving games I Believe you spent six in a row\nAre looking for a seventh or maybe it's eight what he's looking for eight yeah I'm so he's he's going for the record and he's been unbelievable\nWhen you have somebody like that who's got a record on the line how do you how do you react to that as a fantasy owner because I can understand to two thoughts thoughts here you could say okay I I definitely have to\nUh play Adam stealing because I Know they're going to try and get them the record but also wouldn't you think that would open up opportunities for somebody else if the saints also know they're going to try and get them the ball well that that's just ...\nAnd you're looking at the the number of targets rolling through in and for her cousin he's at that point where he's got to be careful because he's tried to force it into the on a few times the last couple of weeks and end up her record purposes just you when you got a guy that you know is going to catch anything\nAre out there which kind of funny because ... digs as a national commercial\nWhere he's got stuff's sticking to his head out to people commenting on or so maybe you'll look his way and so he's a top twelve play again this week so I Would expect to see some fireworks there the guy that's been the forgotten men and all this\nKind of Rudolph needs a little bit of love too he's he's gone under fed through the first half of the season so look for him to get right against the saints or the middle that deep that's\nMy comment Fox Sports radio fantasy football inside of you can get him on Twitter at swollen dome harass him yeah other hammering it bugged the bleep out of him if you got a fantasy football question at swollen dome is joining us here on Fox Sports radio I'm Aaron Rodgers has never been this big of an underdog\nIn his career at the rams\nI I think that this is look I I have to bet the Packers just because the value is so great that you can't turn something like that down for last as what eight and a half I think it was right and they have no idea that if it is it nine points but even with that rams defense\nI mean from a fantasy perspective who you plan on the Packers outside of Rogers\nGet Rogers and you keep wishing and are you talking about play calling\nYou just keep wondering at some point when Aaron Jones is going to get the ball yeah which I'm regular and and I look I I wouldn't you like there's a lot smarter guys that had been out of football forever so you know we we can laugh about Jeff Fisher he's forgotten more than any ... of course but the record is what it is\nA ... you look at it a Packers team where time Montgomery wasn't a running back and make him a number one erasures that our air and Jones is averaging six yards you carry since coming off the bench and yet he's still in the doghouse still gets only a handful of touches\nA game seems like you'd give him a little more of a push so I think this is the game where you you might have to do that to try to\nTry to keep pace of trying to keep on Jared golfing company on the side and I know Cooper cup once again so
