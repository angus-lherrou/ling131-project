an auto for the story of Apollo right\nThe great success to bask in Nineteen sixty eight that was then this is now we worry about ... the my favorite robot and Bob has the book university Amir about Hubble but within these last days it's going to just say smoke can you update us Bob\nYeah I should point out that a University in the mirror is now available in a book and it's you know it has an uptick include the uh the two thousand nine repair and I predicted this kind of stuff happening that book um NASA today released an update\nOn the effort to bring up a lot of shakes motor back at the full operation the key here is that they have a gyroscope\nThat they wanted backup gyroscope ... they've lost by transcripts of the last ... years since last repair mission that down to four gyroscope so\nThey they were down to ... say last one\nAnd so the backup gyroscope is going to bring be brought up into line if you have three gyroscope she got three dimension no control and you can point the telescope per precisely will they brought up the back back up and it didn't function properly so it leaves them only to working a charter school they're trying to figure out what's wrong with that one bad gyroscope\nThough the backup gyroscope but here's the bottom line they still don't have an answer to that but if they cannot get that job if they can get it fixed just us a Hubble is now they've said they got to go back to full operation tests before but if they can't get that fixed they're going to drop down to one gyroscope load\nWhich means they will be able to do science\nBut they will not be able to take the same kind of shocked pitchers they've been doing for\n'em twenty five years we will basically have lost ... capability and we will no longer be able to see the sky with sharp vision as we have the last twenty five years it's going to go back to what it was like\nBefore Hubble when we actually were blind to strongest blind now I Know strongest talk about it that the optics and these new big giant telescopes but they can't do what ... and are they will we have limitations\n... boots good news year high of ... is a enjoying itself in orbit around where you go and what is mascot\nWell OK mascot was one of those mini land hopper bounces they sent down last week mascot was his that was a German French designed mostly German and it was just it was all box set down hits the ground bounces a bunch of times once it's settled that has a little robot arm that allows it to push and\nA jump a few more times it only had batteries for about sixteen hours function at work that Seventeen hours it did three hops and to and this week they released images showing where it traveled on the surface\nAt that posted on behind the black sea can see where traveled took a lot of close up the images and the bottom line is that it would have found is that this surface is crazy than expected there was absolutely no flat spot on the surface everything is\nApples and rocks and that might\nTell us why this week\nThe high a boost the team announced that they are delaying landing in the pie a boost to until January they were going to do it later this month that delaying until later January and they said the reason is because the surface of the of our youth who is so Boulder strewn that they don't have any flat spots anyway and they don't want to take a risk\nAnd so what they're going to do is spend more time doing observations from a orbits\nAnd uh to do a much closer to study the surface to try to figure out if they can get down to a spot that will have less risks that that's what we stand right now Bush or John\nQuickly Bob a sign updated anything irregular in this in the ... were headed towards minimal anything ...\nWe are in minimum John and that may be the entire irregular story here because we're not really supposed to be in minimum for at least another year and we're in minimum there's no doubt about it the minimum began about three four months ago and it ... the the number of sunspots is his\nPlace enough in minimum we aren't at the minimum minimum in the middle of the points you know the point where it's actually the lowest but we're in minimum right now and this means that this was a very short weeks total cycle that just ended and that is unusual they usually if that week they are\nUm that long and this one was weak and short\nAnd uh once again a less so low sunspot activity usually is associated with cold climates on the earth and lo and behold we had colder climates the last decade or so or the so called ... and they call the warming is pronounced and real and there's no question to that\nAnd so uh that's what we stand right now what is going to happen in the future you don't go for ... for ... this is really\nWhat the next cycle will bring us is pretty exciting because it might be a ... a ... or none of the solar minimum that is not big put ... all we can be ... a a grab minimum and if we enter a grand minimum this will be really an exciting thing\nFor straw for scientists science we never seen one with the kind of insurance who've gotten space right now\nThis is what we don't really understand why these things happen we understand vaguely what causes them but why they vary in change and why the sun has a cycle it's not\nReally understood well how the dynamo on this on the magnetic field really produces this stuff why it changes so having a grand minimum here would really give scientists to the opportunity to get a better understanding\nFrom the more sip of superficial understanding they have right now\nWe go to the surface of Mars quickly Bob we have a less than a minute honeycomb this looks like the product is that al ... is that water what creates the image faintest\nIdea I posted this image

Smith a Canadian in his own right invented the sport of basketball basically in a group and Canada's trying to bring bring their sport back to the motherland apparently a business group in Quebec\nMet with commissioner Adam Silver earlier this week and they are preparing to install a bit to try to bring a professional basketball franchise to Quebec\nOf course we know they have a great success what's wrong with the rafters not so much success with uh Vancouver Grizzlies that moved to Memphis but trying to bring basketball back to Canada you liked the move or no\n[noise] um [noise]\nI just wait it don't they have the raptors [laughter] thrown into does not not Montreal yeah ... I don't get a team in Seattle first yeah I don't know what why does why don't lead is it just to have options and you're not sure\nI mean you think Vegas was probably in in the pipeline somewhere too because they are going to have two professional franchises within the next couple of years I mean\nThe NFL could figure out which which games they could put in London and win games they could put an ass tech a stadium but they couldn't figure out a catch until recently right place I why why don't why are we doing this all wrong white and the most difficult thing first aid seat look\nSeattle seems like they desperately wanna team back right and and I don't mean growing up this this super sonics were always a good team no doubt and they had good players I get that just seems like a no brainer nobody's clamoring for called back\nRight they had a great fan base to Seattle to instill do we know there was a lot of a priest is the game earlier this week where the Oklahoma City thunder came in and Kevin Iran war is oh Seattle Sonics Jersey and they went nuts they loved it up there still\nAnd and by the way that's not it not to take a shot at our friends listening on a TSN up in Canada you know we love you you know we talk CFL football here and in fact we're going to do an all CFL edition of the Jonas knock show here on Fox Sports radio that'll be coming up October thirty third\nAll CFLs talk for hours of nothing but the CFL October thirty third here on\nFox Sports radio and I believe us at Oklahoma City thunder of course the rent no place for the Golden State warriors so that's a slip on my part by the way we want a cat here thing everybody's hammered nobody is perfect idea fine for a while and it's still plan who knows\nBy the way so I think a big reason why Seattle in a big reason why the sonics mood was because there wasn't a lot of private funding for a stadium apparently this group and Quebec\nIs willing to pay two billion dollars to fund the building of a stadium and buying a franchise so I think more or less nowadays we're talking about these franchises popping up who's willing to basically pay the entire bill and not have to use public money so I think that's kind of the direction these things are going because people don't want to pay taxpayer money for these arenas\nLook Adam Silver you want to do something fun man All right 'cause I Know Adam Silver everybody fall washes like he's the he's a cool guy man he's he's a cool commissioner is so cool like because he fired Donald Sterling means\nFor God's sakes man he had to do is listen to that interview he gave and you want to fire to me and what are we talking about it I wasn't like a a momentous job done by Adam Silver that was a no brainer ... um\nAnd I'm Still really wants to to make a move that is going to resonate with people why don't you do the smart thing ... and put betting boost in every stadium okay let's turn this up a notch right let's let's really get people excited to go to a hawk scam\nThat's ... that's going to be difficult no matter what you do\nYou see your negative such a negative person Kevin ... just the negativity from Kevin fingers supporting candidate over Atlanta how dare you\nI'm just a realist Joan now who doesn't love amounts he's come on yeah All right [laughter]\nRight rather than taxing by ... by the way the mouse he's correct\nCowboys and then it was once again Jerry Jones did an interview earlier today as he always does it's I mean there's a microphone on his face is going to talk is amazing on the fan once again it says Jason Garrett is absolutely the real deal there is no fraud and Jason Garrett he is going to leave the cowboys to a championship\nOf course he's just a few games or five hundred has only made the playoffs a couple of times\nAs head coach and he's been there for a long while and to piggyback on that story earlier this week I saw this too\nApparently cowboy fans have started a petition to bring back Tony Romo out of retirement\nTo petition is twenty five hundred signatures\nAre as of about ten minutes ago they had about Seventeen doubts gives me Seventeen hundred fifty\n... okay if ... and this is just the blind game if I told you that I've got a quarterback\nAnd he had a really really really good year [noise] um and in fact he's had some really really good games and then not that long after that really really good year I took away his top too wide receiver targets and also his office of line was significantly worse\nAs you expect him to still be a great quarterback no questions asked\nAbout let's see the hall of famer no like Aaron Rodgers type\n... right ah that's Prescott yup and for people that are that are crushing die Prescott like it's a deck Prescott problem in Dallas what were your ex but what did you think he was I don't understand like he\nWouldn't you games he's already won ... games at the NFL level but you need pieces around him he's not Rogers to your point he's not a uh Drew Brees he's not Brady and anybody that's expecting them to still put a big numbers when he lost everybody his off I mean he lost it often to blame into a disease before the season\nAnd the idea that you should still be putting up these great numbers that he did his rookie years just unrealistic yeah it really is I I just I I I don't understand now the petition to bring back Tony Romo mhm [noise] I was so I was watching the\nTony Romo football life documentary I have ever done one of yes or no it's it's actually really good um Fox Sports radio makes an appearance on the uh Tony Romo
