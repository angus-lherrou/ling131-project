{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WXKS", "content": "Here I Am it's time\nIs that if we're not here now can you hear me [noise] my name's Pam parents [noise] and I just when\nAdvocates volunteer living on Ghouta living on a daughter were brought to you by United Way an ad council\nObjectionable um founding board member of the project and my new podcast as wrongful conviction available on our heart radio on wrongful conviction I interview a different exonerate every week to help them to tell their incredible stories of tragedy\nAnd triumph against the possible I mean you got it here to believe it raw for conviction for my heart studios\nAvailable now our radio [noise]\nThe original ... comments section always having to deal with some kind of ridiculous fans from Berlin Boston home board\nTalk twelve hundred [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn bats are definitely ... book is a mad catastrophe\nAnd we will follow Conrad with his delusions about how to defeat the Russians\nPizza and for army against the Russians who are overwhelming him from all directions she gives the order to march on ... which is well to the north is Nordstrom the northern\nA policy the northern campaign that he's going to launch but she doesn't use the few aircraft he has he doesn't use the ... he has so we had no idea where the Russians are\nThe way you lay this out a ... I follow you very carefully Jeffrey is this a is is well known in Europe that Conrad campaign was ignorance an amateur tourism and he threw himself up against the Russians what any idea where they were\nNot exactly I think that the Austrian surprisingly to get a pass on most of these things are there are viewed as having fought a gallon little war against the Russians scheme roller and you know this is to ignore the central reality here which is that\nWe're planning in the seventies in Vienna in Berlin had assumed that the Austrian Hungarians although numerically weaker\nThan Russia I mean remember the population of Austria Hungary in Nineteen fourteen is fifty three million population of Russian I mean it's a hundred and fifty million three times larger a\nCorresponding we larger army cheaply because they can afford it thanks to French financing part of the French strategy to hold up the Germans were bigger richer was to finance real ways and military expansion inside Russia\nSo they knew they were they they'd known since the you know since the late in the Eighteen hundreds of they were going to have to fight the Russians at some point\nIt was the strangest strategy was that the author Hungarians all those smaller would be qualitatively better\nThey would have a faster nimble are harder hitting army better trained better morale swift or and they would strike quickly into the Russian Empire\nAnd they would the real the the the presumably slower Russian mobilization by stray that the Newark star you mentioned is pushing the low blame the idea this blow this northern blow that would hinge the Russian mobilization create chaos in the world is more efficient ... you know what I mean to advance\nInto Russia and not not defeat the Russian Empire because there's no chance an army of\nForty five forty eight divisions is going to conquer the Russian Empire march all the way to Petersburg but no they could've really ruined the Russians back retarded their mobilization allowed the Germans to win and the west and then allow the Germans to redeploy two million troops to the east to\nFinish off the Russians and so you know the ...\nI'm a stumps and the Austrian did okay that they want a couple of frontier battles and it was only because a big Russian numbers they they were thrown back but in fact\nThey knew they're gonna have to cope with the Russian numbers and those frontier battles that they are celebrated for having one home are often crossing were minor victory speaking in fact I argue in the book they aren't really victories I say\nIt's like a a boxer who wins on points in the first round but then gets knocked out in the second round claiming that he wasn't about you know in fact\nThey win these battles these early ballots but then the Russians pullback regroup and then a counterattack and destroy I mean literally destroy the stronger and all kinds\nOf the arrogance of the Austrian Empire they believe they always had to attack though they were out numbered and the Russians learned to survive by digging in a shooting and then as the as the Austrians got close to ... the Russians would run away and reposition themselves for the next\nFor the next contact and the Austrians never had anything to shoot at now that was just Austrian styling it they'll they come off as if they're too arrogant to be in the battle they don't believe the Russians should oppose them\nWell you know it I ... some of them some of them were certainly arrogance do you see officers you know ... it in the book I have anecdotes robbers will say to them and oh just advanced the Russians are hiding in their trenches there's nothing to fear from them there's some areas there are certainly but at the office of tactics the bullet the gate tactics\nCharging a Russian gun lines in trenches\nReally had more to do with the national in linguistics problems in the army and there was just no way to get these multilingual true forward in any with any kind of precision if they'd been spread out and open order\nSo the ... the solution was to map them in the storm calm the ban it charges much like those used by Napoleon at the beginning of the nineteenth century and send these massive storm called that the Russian trenches and this was absolute suicide\nThe casualties were horrendous and the and the Russians were stupid fight\nThere were like what army fight this negligent ally and foolishly\nThen not only were they attacking with these mass to ban it charges in the trenches that were bristling with court firing artillery machine guns and magazine rifles but they were doing it without any artillery support and without in with one machine gun purpose Taliban and the machine\nIs often didn't work because of the point out in the book the troops to try to waterproof them smeared than with lard alarm clock the machine gun machine gun couldn't fire so you see cuts reports quick clean the lord of the machine guns are not working but they didn't have you know they only had light artillery they had no heavy artillery\nAnd uh so that the the the Austrian attacks\nAre slaughters absolute spot in his pictures in the book to these shaped up bloated black and Austrian corpses after every after every engagement\nThe two armies that and the one against the Serbs in the south pole T. R. ex army is turned back smashed back it will go back again and again and again but it smashed back and the army for Conrad going to the north runs into the Russians and his overwhelmed\nAnd when we return we'll be tough how Austrian explains itself because one of the things about Conrad and one of the things about ... is that they're always hurting the rationalization for their memoirs each time they lose the battle\nThe book is a mad catastrophe the outbreak of World War one and the collapse of the hops for ... ... an empire Jeffrey ... is the author I'm John bachelor [noise] this is the John ...

to deal with this right so they use the term thorough\nInvestigation Rob Manfred should've just announced after spending no time we determine we don't care that's what he should have been announced that would've been [noise] the proper statement and he could finish the statement by say by the way I watch the playoffs on Fox Sports one and Turner\n[laughter]\nAt the very best if you're giving baseball the benefit of the doubt this was one sided right baseball started with the conclusion and then work backwards to come up with that conclusion although I don't even think they put that much effort into it the Astros we mentioned this the other day it bears repeating the Astros used an excuse me by Chris\n... who was the cheating cardinals old executive that's what he said in a courtroom a federal courtroom\nAnd how does that go he spent four years in the gulag using the same issues that major league baseball bought Korea said the reason I was committing espionage on the Astros is because I I think the Astros are spying on the cardinals\nAnd he got four years in jail for that major league baseball when it's the Astros I agree that's what they were doing\nSo\nCan talk to my own independent investigation and I have to terminate\nPastors are guilty what's my evidence fourteen percent of the twenty nine teams not named Astros believe Houston's dirty athletics Indians Dodgers check check check\nNow what were they doing\nThat we don't all the details the early reports say rhythmic clapping to indicate fastball breaking ball banging a garbage can with some kind of it's the

Instagram\nProfile removing the fact that he was an Astros employee does that sound like someone who's an innocent man or does that sound like someone who's trying to you know paint over the blood spots on the wall yes cover your tracks and we haven't even\nGotten into the increase spin rate there are other major league baseball player shot a Cleveland Indians who suspect the Astros are cheating using spit balls or doctor and baseball and Rob Manfred\nWho lives in that Manhattan bubble he has his blinders up and he's mimicking Leslie Nielsen from that great scene in the naked gun move on nothing to see here please the spice\nAnd the baseball writers many of them yeah you're right make sure I get those free hotdogs yep way to get a last word here\nThat isn't as big a joke as the Peyton Manning investigation\nBy the NFL Peyton Manning was caught\nMuch like this dope red handed using his wife is a drug Newell by the fine investigative reporting of al Jazeera did a great job\nIn the dark side documentary which is still available on YouTube assuming YouTube doesn't go out the painting denied it said all these nasty things in the interview that was all choreographed the NFL had their associates bury the story to give me an idea\nI I remember this kind of stuff that the fertilizer that was being served up by associate with the NFL whoever wrote that America showed up and where the sun don't shine this is a\nQuote from someone who was a network broadcast or that done on Peyton Manning\nShe meaning Payton he said he didn't do it\nIf he said he didn't do it it didn't happen then it didn't happen he didn't do it that's it that quote came from key Shawn Johnson who was working as an NFL broadcaster ESPN he said he he uh paint and he said he said he didn't do it if he said he didn't do it it didn't happen that he didn't it didn't happen he didn't do it that's it\nHow about this this is Jim from Jim Nance it's a story that's on all levels a non story\nHere's the problem in court\nMany of the claims made by al Jazeera's investigative team against Peyton Manning's wife were proven correct\nThe HGH was shipped to manage house and the wife was the cover yeah\nWhere's gymnasts where's ... Shawn Johnson I don't know where these uh these bozos are but we'll get to the bottom of this\nHigh crimes and misdemeanors the Astros edition the Astros will be expose all this will come out you know what's going to come out\nWhen guys start writing books that someone is going to come out a couple of years from now a few years from now guys get book deals and so ... here's how he cheated point by point to go through all of it it's going to happen it's gonna happen\nShould also mention that after game one of the ... the Astros one seven to to the red Sox were terrible in that game since game on the red Sox and the three games that have followed\nHave scored twenty five runs\nTwenty five runs the red Sox scored and the three games and the Astros have scored a total of Thirteen\nRuns so advantage\nSauce yeah\nIt's about an hour show on Fox we say hello to well he's not\nThere you're referring to the Ben ... show on Fox Sports radio\nRagged Ralph's having a sandwich seeding sandwich right now is what he's doing delicious sandwich\nFrom all the way\nI have nothing to add\nTo that'd be a drop Roberta can we put that as a drop I think that would be great would you like me to read voice it for you yes can you do it with a little more uh gusto\nHave nothing to add them that was pretty much the same tone deaf you didn't really change potato\nI have nothing to add\nA little better okay\nHow's your sandwich is great do you think big ... of course you're paying for\nWe all paying for the sandwich and when he goes as we pay him that's the deal why didn't you pay a coup did you pay him yes right\nBurner you paid them right yep\nWow around nobody told me anything\nYou really didn't pay out no nobody told me and the sandwich and you didn't pay [laughter] ha ha ha\nThat's like a ten dollar sandwich\nHurricane dollars Thirteen dollars that sandwiches Thirteen and I didn't get one 'cause I'm On my back on my diet but\nThirteen dollars that you saw Thirteen dollars from big Lew would you like the same dome he's listening right now\nI Would say that one there was a joy meeting big what do you have your ally he hates you well he may hate me but it was a joy for me to meet us incorrect\nHow can you determine if it's ... give me the Thirteen dollars and I'll give it to the next time I see yeah no I'm not going to do that just give me the thirtieth I'll take you ... do miss out on the third thing about that yeah that's it I give me the Thirteen I'll pass it on the big blue uh-huh who's working as ass off you think he can afford to buy or you idiot sandwiches come on\nWe pay for the sandwich that's how we do I understand that freeloaders here well I I Would disagree with that sometimes ah sometimes is that we use the word\nOK every time you get a honey mustard\nI Do I get honey mustard every single time I eat chicken fingers\nMy man every time you get honey mustard delivered\nWhat would what he's talking about if a soft spot huh\nThere's no ...

getting a couple of reasons why the storyline is Vance Joseph is you know the ... they're fighting for his job the players you know rally around their embattled coach\nDon't hold your breath things have gone upside down just like the red Sox broadcaster there the Broncos have had the lead for just twelve percent of their all offensive stabs lowest rate in the league if you get smashed by the jets you can get smashed by the Arizona Cardinals Denver's a bad football team they have dropped four straight\nGames Vance Joseph is record on the road is an atrocity since he took over as the Broncos coach their defense has already quit I don't see it changing your your case Keenan puts up some decent numbers but a lot of ... forest errors\nThe Broncos also have a achieve divisional game next week against the Kansas City chiefs of rematch dare I say key that's if you think Denver's a good team and be but I don't think there's much difference between the Broncos and the cardinals Arizona is not a good team either but I I've seen how terrible\nThe Denver defense has been against the run and I look at David Johnson over there and I said boy he hasn't had that breakout signature game yet this could this should be should be the game and in spite of Josh Rose [noise]\nThe cardinals thirty one Broncos twenty seven [noise]\nThe Thursday even though the giants poop to bed last

visiting team which is why there was so much origin cats\nThe way up to be this is a completely different because one I don't think the way the fans did anything wrong sitting there on the ... wrote that baseball into their to their death penalty they did anything wrong at all\nThat's what I was going to ask you clay is ... that's just a natural reaction by the fans but winning if you're sitting where those fans were sitting wouldn't you think about it at least for a second\nI don't know what they could have died I mean because it isn't that simultaneous incident where first call yeah do you have to give credit to ... because I don't think there's any way this call gets made in what he is leaping unless he's gotten to where the baseball it\nAnd in what he is leading up to try to make the catch and I also understand from a baseball perspective how it's kind of it at an awkward situation right because you don't want to\nUh instead of I fan to AIPAC players when they're trying to jump into the crowd to make a play like that but to me what ... was doing was\nAn unnatural play and I mean on natural by the context of dot and it'd be like somehow or you know outside the bounds or baseball but just that it's relatively rare\nThat a guy is able to play a ball as well as he did and leap to take away a a what would be a home run\nA player based on getting a wall like that based on having the athletic just get up and put himself into perspective with the band there where there even at a cycle atheist situation\nSo that they had that back and done nothing at all and allowed ... to make that way people will be criticizing the fans to I think it's a natural reaction river the fans were probably tracking the ball so if you think about the way the fans are thinking who were sitting there and the outfield\nWhen the ball is moving in your direction you probably are not looking down in any way at the wire you might be cognizant of the fact that he's getting close to the wall\nIf you are a regular person who was juiced acquaint baseball you track the ball not the person so I think what's likely happened did those guys are thinking oh my God it's going to be a whole ... going to get here and as that ball is basically making its way toward them\nIf you take your eyes off the ball and look down and move you bet I I think that's what you end up getting hit the head with the ball\nSo I think is a natural reaction is they're following the ball the whole way probably a little bit panic like all paying our winter or the baseball is that like that start to realize wait a minute am I going to have to make a play on that oh my God I don't want to look like an idiot oh my God I don't want this to you and you're just tracing at the whole way\nSo I I I just I don't blame the fans in any way I blame baseball and I blame the year because I think Joe West when he went in and looked at this on ... I Know he made the call instantaneous we aren't the field\nBut I think your natural ruling should be to me ...\nAnd then you go watch the replay and then if the replay you decide you know what that reaches interfere it that you have the right to change it will continue to break this down I think at the map that story a globe of all why do I think we got a wife to work and make we call a ...\nA

that she fought back with one of the things she says which is something I've thought for a long time as\nIf she ... players in the stands fans are supposed to move over those are the rules and they'll be shouldn't let than sit there they didn't reach over the fence and I think she's right like is there\nSomething we should be talking about in terms of creating an alley of just a couple of feet so that this can happen because this is the problem here is this isn't like a lot of other sports where you have a ton of other opportunities to win the game yes this happened early\nBut baseball is a game of such a rare opportunity when it comes to scoring runs that even though this happened that early\nIt absolutely could have changed this entire game meaning it could have changed his entire series and could have changed the world series as well\n[noise] yeah I agree with you completely now my position is ... is just the general perspective I don't have a problem with the fans being right there on top of the field\nI Do think that if you want it to be a hundred percent sure whether or not fan interference was in ...\nYou could have a camera that run down or the at the healing or whatever they give you a ... ... much like you have down the goal line and we talked about this on the show before one of the frustrating things I think about for instance college football replay is and I think about the Mississippi State Auburn game a couple of weeks ago\nI didn't think that ... Fitzgerald got in but we don't have a definitive line oftentimes because there's not as many cameras the NFL they have or cameras\nSo we tend to get better angles if baseball is a hundred percent ... you know concerned about this in areas where you could have a fan interference way\nIt seems to me especially in postseason when they're spending so much money to make sure that they get those games\nAre right and have so many extra umpires and everything else out there 'cause remember Joe wet you'd have a better vantage point than you would have typically in\nA regular season game because they were ... extra umpires out there having said that why not eliminate any doubt at all and just have a shot they call them straight down and it's looking bad is reaching over to the wall which it appeared to me he was\nThat he has no more right to the ball and the fan does and therefore it would've been a whole Ron\nWhat about you Jeff short how would you uh ... what do you think about uh the the play it though\nWell issue we have in baseball umpiring issue and this is this is kind of bigger I think in my opinion than than justice play we treat baseball umpires life Supreme Court justices who have lifetime appointees we're Joel West and no one's going to overrule Joe ... Joe ... says\nThis is what happened or they're going to just go job because he's cowboy Joe he's he's done it forever he's the he's the longest and your empire um he makes the gear everyone's dump hires the gear the winners and west vest like he created the gear or they're not overrule him if he said this was the rule or do you mean this was how it went down\nVery rarely will he be overall I think it was a younger umpire\nWho made this call seems overruled plain and simple ah I agree with you guys I think you can tell that to fans did not\nLeave ... out of his seat to make the catch is not like she leaves you just put his arm straight out and in my opinion he was in he was behind the walls and you're right that's up into the crowd is global on your clothes I mean that students a lot of friends are on that but I should have been a home run in to your point about momentum and baseball\nThis would have been huge member Boston came out score to run to the first inning kind of quiet that crossings really loud there in Houston comeback their their best player hits home ruined the first time the game to game completely changes and obviously you know call and I even out needed even different maybe if your if your second and third in that situation and they just call regular\nA singer ... uh the changes that inning as well so the the worst possible outcome for that does happen and going out\n[noise]\nAnd and I think the challenges you kind of look forward to is this also ties in with the conspiracy theory out there right the conspiracy theory is whether you want to buy into it or not and it'd be clear I don't buy into it\nIs that baseball desperately want to have a Dodgers against the red Sox theory\nSo if a if this is that what I don't think there would be that conspiracy theory we're on used in right now and I guarantee you there's a lot of people driving around in their cars they use that word thinking\nThat this would not have happened if it had been the red Sox right now I Do think that uh that that's a little bit more of a challenging situation because\nWe're not a whole ... is interacting with the fans are and I think Jeff I mean it Jake and Jake and in particular raised a good point which it\nAnd and citing came up and maybe not the best way to do it but it baseball were truly worried about this rule they could easily require that nobody's allowed to sit in the front row there in those seats right\nAnd then you would have a barrier where a fan and the second row is able to get his hands on the ball it's pretty clear from a pure physics perspective that it'll let me just jump Dover and is reaching like if you if you can get your hands on it on the second row eats into the stands right like I don't even think there would be a debate then\nUh and then if the ... still such a phenomenal athlete that he's running into a guy in the second row of the fan as they are trying to make a play on the ball it's clear that it's over a wall and what he's trying to do is make a phenomenal white and bring it back onto the field of play what I think it's a little bit challenging about this rule in general\nIs the idea that you know basically fans could be at war with players and you're trying to stop a guy from being able to catch the ball right I mean in theory somebody could uphold rookie ... now that the easier argument for it being interference\nWith the media would acquire goes into the crowd to make the way there are on like any other sport you know the field of play in baseball different it bans on the front row in the NBA and the ball is going out of ... and the fan and reaches out like we could pretty clearly self evidently the\nHit the fan has begun an appropriate way and in fact when there are like ... usually you see the fans they're actually moving away like you always get those awkward interaction where a player will dive into a fan of lifetime screen shots are hysterical because the person on the front row in the NBA is doing everything they can to avoid getting it\nAnd avoid becoming a central part of the action and obviously in a in hockey you've got a situation where the uh\nThe ... and it's impossible unless the Plexiglas gets broken for anybody to come into play and uh and so this is a unique situation at baseball to me\nIf you want to have an on the front row and easy solution is I have a perfect camera angle down the wall\nTo verify whether or not ... but he just picks a you could do it particularly even if you just want to do it at the post season because I think in regular season baseball it would be rare that this would be the focal point why not just have a camera angle camera with the perfect thing go to allow the umpire to be like okay\nThis either it was in a crowd and therefore there is no fan interference or we're not\nDoesn't that seem like the perfect solution Jake um art\nYeah you would think that you would have whatever camera angle you needed to avoid a situation like this that could then potentially harm the integrity of the game\nThat you're playing in front of you with all the states that are on the line\nOne thing I don't know if you saw the shot there was a shot\nThat was down the side of the wall but there was a security job looking over to watch the game that was blocking the angle of what was actually happening\nLike you can do but you can still to this guy like it's all you're seeing is this guy in a black shirt with the word security on it with the play happening in front of him which we can see because he makes it much better doors in a window\nIt's really funny whenever that happened to like you're like oh we got the perfect camera angle and then there's just a guy who happened to be at the exact day gory blocking everything you would be a and a and ... and evidently it seems like that actually what happened but\nTo me it's the I mean even based on the angle that we have and what I eat here is for somebody who's like an expert in ...\nTo do like a ... actually able to diagram at like ... and then they get this thing go like\nI I'm sure there's somebody out there with the mathematical you can get that could\nA given the angle that we have actually give us a geometric equation the draw you know sort of re dimensional urging of what we're seeing it still photograph video or to actually demonstrate what I Believe is clear which it you've got to go off was over the wall and he may well I've been able to make it incredible white but\nFan had the same right to the ball that you did and therefore it should've been a home run I think that's what\nA physical diagram of this play which show a Joe ... didn't want to make that call he wanted to be the hero you want it to ride in and day at a credit for that you were to be there right the first time\nAnd I don't ... I think he sold it pretty good if you're watching the game you know he's like oh I got hit by a lot like selling the idea that he would've caught it\nI'm not sure what it caught it anyway because it still would have paid for 'em and all the way I mean he's basically climbing the wall and definitely stealing a home run it would have been an otherworldly ... not that they couldn't have done it but just it would have still been an incredible patch to complete\nEven without the interference call will continue to unpack that a I Am ... I Hope you guys are having a fantastic Thursday wherever the country or the world\nMaybe this is out the coverage Jeff short\nShaken art and I'll take it it'd be running along at our two I'm at lego land out in a in Windsor right outside of why they're getting ready for ... years and we will be back breaking down a little bit more about the uh the Dodgers when they're now a redo in their series against the brewers\nYou ride that right on into the world series\n[laughter] I Know you hate the Dodgers are and you have short despite the fact that you grew up in LA I Know your audience than having said that uh do you think that the uh the Dodgers are going to win the series everything to brewers are going to come back\nOr the Dodgers game seven I'll tell you why I think the brewers win game six the problem for the brewers is if he doesn't pitch out of the bullpen they don't win games like ... and he's not a picture of the pitch is very often back to back him so they're gonna they're going to empty the tank of of hate are they going to lead\nA special or in this game in game six and they're going to let them pitch in and they're going to win that game most likely he's almost unimaginable right now they'll they'll let 'em throw three innings\nYou know five six seven or seven eight nine ... whenever they have to do hate or will be in that game if they have a lead especially as Memphis in and I and I think the Dodgers will lose their game so we keep the brewers in game six is get an early lead then game sevens are free for all and I think that's\nThe way the Dodgers set up with\nWith their bullpen and what they're called ... I think they win game seven and a yeah I was so ready yesterday we this long conversation going grocery yesterday and how he has a four point to the post season\nAnd I was so ready yesterday I had my ... my Twitter rap open up my phone I'm just I'm praying he's used are you going to get to ... and bust I came up in the second inning I was ready to go down struck out and are going on you know look\nHe gets knocked very often for not being able to go deep in the playoff games we talked about this yesterday she looked real you'd yesterday or how to kind of had to eat my words his curve oh goody was hung around the bases he went seven innings ah they took him out the right point but you know he made me were pretty fools you know sort of\nIt is wild to think what would happen if we get the Dodgers in the red Sox in the world series and we get a World Series game Clayton curse Shaw against David Price what the world\nJust kind of end when they fail like who would win this game I mean because I I Do think it's\nMuch criticism is quite her shots of that for me it's like a billion times better than David cried has sent into procedures so far right and yeah hardly anybody talked about David Price I think it's because he's not there every year a it's a good question for John rosy are you guys have to kind of hit him with what would happen if that World Series match up occurred\nUh because David private beta infinitely worst than quake Kirsch show and he doesn't get any where you're at the same level of criticism and it may be setting up where those guys could end up going out to get your God Forbid it ever games that I don't even know that the world like this come to a close\nA and it might be like you know a black hole eating it felt like I don't have any idea how baseball the able to handle eight David cry get quite ... a world theory that\nUm because you've got to be with me that that by Barclay ... Shaw gets wave or criticism that David Price though David Rice has been much worse big tide pitcher who's failed in the postseason\nYeah definitely I mean I I couldn't agree more as a matter of fact I think it might come down to the fact that\nWhen you talk about the most dominant pitcher in baseball over the last ten years most people go to ... first I think he just gets more of the praise as well David Price I don't view in the same class as Clinton courage show\nOn a national basis at least and I think that we've already seen the stories and we've watched a lot of times where it looks like David prices mentally weak\nMentally sometimes you can get shattered I don't think we've seen that from ... he just goes out there seems to have bad luck is curves not working\nMore is just bad and gets behind some of his counts I just think he's a better player overall and if you're a better player and then you don't perform under the highlights you're going to get more of the flack maybe than somebody like David Price\nPersonally as a hall of famer that's why he gets more scrutiny and different prices not a hall of famer I think that the red socks though David Price in game seven there they're not they're they're doing something wrong there is no chance he was sort of game seven but they would find every\nThe way to throw some what else to point bullpen game I Can't see him throw in game seven I'm at all in in in in the world series I I Can't imagine that they would put themselves in that situation\nA little bit of an update here are a lot of times that or will end up saying that

ended up costing then the game\nLike Houston is not exactly a small market but Boston's a completely different animal yeah and without much ESPN loves to cover for example the red Sox and the Yankees I just feel like it would have been such a bigger controversy but if you go back we've seen this in the playoffs before we saw the Jeffrey mayor play\nWith the Orioles and the Yankees this time and it went against Baltimore in favor of the Yankees several years ago or maybe over a decade ago now I'm getting older and older it's like Twenty years now is it really ...\nI Would have been a while and then of course and then of course for the most famous version is the Bartman play which was totally different because he was leaning over this fan I don't know what else this man could have done this and was not\nIn the interfere with the game at all yeah that that man Oh yes\nHe didn't do anything wrong he just was no you didn't end the worst part of thing about uh two in my opinion is he was listening on the radio\nSo he wasn't even the radio was a little bit but it's a way to say even he didn't know that much so we was he didn't look up and see most of their a poor guy meant die hard cubs fan I I I I Hope you enjoy the world series of years ago we used the Bronx enjoy\nI think he said he did like a they reached out to him and he spent like a statement he is done everything possible to stay down like everybody has tried to interview Steve Bartman and for his sake he just wants to be left alone\nThey invited him to go on the on the on the parade to make everything right I don't know how you turn that down if you're a die hard cubs fan while I'll be like I'd be crazy\nYeah it's it's definitely difficult to say the least but that was a lot of drama there we talked some about Clinton curtail their towards the end of the first hour Jeff I'll let you go ahead and eat crow as Danny ... sports the largest grin and Sherman Oaks right now I mean a Clinton herself was brilliant yesterday\nHe was great and I told them this off the air I said you guys and I was sitting there and and I was I think the\nSecond inning was kind of right and so I was about to start my radio show ... ... pm eastern so I was I had my I had\nI had my eye pad on I'm watching I'm doing my radio show I got my got my my my phone my apple open my ... open I was ready to just go in I bet you were her shots and then he struck out his his aunt who's been pretty atrocious with with with runners on base and this\nAnd the series so far and then the Dodgers obviously a you know they won the game will will will if the very end um with ah\nWith battles and but she uh the\nRent will do Jeff the rest of the Dodgers bullpen was actually good I Know there's a lot of talk about the brewers bullpen\nThe Dodgers bullpen is there are a overall is one point six to ... and unfortunately had a a a rough I gave up a couple of hits in the run there at the end but the rest of the bullpen look nice and then the big surprise for the Dodgers had been Pedro biased because\nHe's obviously been a foreign inside of all Dodger fans ah but he's come into his own the past couple of months uh as far as he can look good he's look good so if Pedro buys is pitching welding the Dodgers are going to be looking good at the end of the series here\nIsn't there a concern about about Jensen still coming off that he hasn't quite but there's things that his back from us from his little yeah as month off after the heart to heart issue so I think his that to me is the concern is that people kind of see like he's just not quite the same guy a you'll be ... ... they're not to go to Boston right to to um\nFor the world series that they make the by the red Sox win because it goes by record now right at that stupid rule about\nAll the all star game now is by now is by record I think the thing with Jansen is that you're now going to pitch him for one inning instead of three\nRemember the post season last year they got tired yeah he did and there's no way you can do that now with his health concerns so that's why the set up rule is even that much more important the Dodgers have a couple of arms in there that can set things up right now but I Would not put Kelly in unless\nIt's just for an inning because of what's going on with his heart it can you imagine if he's having a procedure during the off season where where they basically burn burn off the part of your heart that's causing the problem and the sound good yeah and he's like oh I'll just do it in the offseason guy that's\nCrazy yeah I'm a boy does he like he he took her three weeks off in ... and then came back um yeah it's it's pretty remarkable that uh that he's still pitcher and I'm just wondering what's going on\nNow as far as ... I ... I knew it too I I imagine you cause Roberta and I we were both in a tenth of that crowd was rocking and ... yeah I got to give a lot of credit to the Dodger fans the place filled up entirely by the third inning\nIt was hard getting in I mean I left Burbank at noon for a two oh nine pm starts and it was still hard for me to get to the stadium and I left at noon\nAnd in the stadiums Fifteen minutes away from where I live normally so you can imagine people not having to take the day off from work\nHaving to get in through all that traffic to the stadium and once we were all at once they announced we were now on the national TV the towels were waving the crowd got loud and the crowd stayed loud even when the Dodgers were trailing and then when they finally tied it up\nThe place went nuts and cui kind of opened up that lead\nIt and the best part of the game was when Clinton curse all was hustling around the bases yeah that was the best part because that's what we know about and also she really was\nBut that right there that a bit of mines is the guy he plays so hard and yeah sometimes it's curve ball is off yesterday it was spectacular but sometimes it's off sometimes as you pointed out yesterday is back hurts and he tires out that was not the case yesterday it almost seemed like he could have went of a a complete game yesterday\n... do I think you you I think they're talking about the right point for covering this one is that we've seen his story or the third time through the orders tough for him and and look he's pitched great get them out now with a lead and also if you have to\nBring them back for any reason all game seven I don't know I don't know how the schedule so it's up to even get 'em an ending or two if you need him\nHe's still there I can if you haven't put extra inning or throw an extra thirty pitches maybe can't come back in a short short restaurants or anything if you have to in game seven so it made sense to take 'em out there are no he he puts ... yesterday he looked like ... you know himself and the reason why him and David Price don't get the same comparison is because\nOf the hall of famer he's the best pitcher for the last ten years they were probably just not that and that's why did it probably doesn't get the grief that that curse all it does um plus all up prices postseason up issues are against one team which is a Yankee easy that campus you know the Yankees for whatever reason and so that's why I think as well as we've seen curse all\nAnd it's all throughout his career have you'll have games like this in the postseason also have games where where he allows a lot of runs so uh I I did my words last night he portrayed\nIt did will ask John rosy about that perfect time to have John on he'll be with us after the break before we get to John oh\nLet's get the truth car where you can easily find the car you want which are price for sure car you can avoid the confusion you encounter on line by getting a great price you can count on before you ever even visit a dealership\nThe ticket price includes all dealer fees and accessories true car will show you what other people in the area paid for the car you want now you're going to know what a fair price is so you can feel confident and you're certified deal is no it so they are going to set their true price competitively because ultimately they want to run your business\nOver three million cars have been sold the true card users by the true car certified dealer network and there are now over Fifteen thousand\nTroops car certified dealers nationwide your car users save an average of over three thousand dollars off the MS our peace so when you're ready to buy a new or used car visit true car to enjoy more confident car buying experience\nSome features not available in all states one feature coming up is John rosy stick around for him we'll talk baseball next year on al ...\n[noise] all of your favorite towns are\nThree on the way\nI like the way we're dominating this year's coverage are you in [noise] it's Fox Sports radio\nEverybody's got to do list drop off the dry cleaning pick up some milk here's an idea let's add save hundreds of dollars on car insurance\nAnd the good thing is you don't have to drop off or pick up anything all you have to do is go to guy go dot com and in Fifteen minutes you could be saving Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance extra money in your pocket it just may be the most rewarding too do you do today\nHey did you know the hunted dream deal sales event is clearly happening right now where you can literally get great deals on certified pre ...\n...

Joe or a rookie umpire hum I think there was maybe ... with the replay program\nA little bit of reluctance to to say your colleague was wrong I think there might have been just a on a human level but the ... that calls so important and and the review lasted so long several minutes that that I think that there'll be was certainly doing everything they could to get the call right and I\nThought as as you're looking at it from from left center field there was that one if you look at some of the ... some of the replays it that you can see it and I'm over ... dot com I I Believe there was one which from the camera those probably on top of the crop or boxes or in center field\nWhere it looked to me like like the contact that as I mentioned earlier was probably over into the into the stands as opposed to being over the field of play um based on the sort of the side all bleak angle of where where ... was where the fans worth I think that that contact was happening in in the crowd but\nIt wasn't I can understand if available that it wasn't totally totally a completely a convincing so I just think that it was a matter of of of the lack of one hundred percent clarity on on where it was from from my standpoint I was about Ninety five percent sure just my in my own amateur view of things that that there was\nThat it was contacted I have an above the wall and and into the into the ... side of of the field and if that's if that's not good enough it's not good enough but that's\nA to me are really intriguing part of the decision but I I think in all honesty and there'll be dealt with this forthrightly as they could and ah and and the standard is that they've got to be clear and convincing and there was apparently a very small lack of clarity on exactly where that contact that place\nBefore we get to the queen colonel's performance game five tonight David Price Justin Vernon lander um student price you can you give them five solid tonight or they just hoping that maybe he gets three innings in\nWell I certainly think Dave it's capable of of of of going deeper into the game and and we saw I think his his earlier start in the series was was okay I think he um other than the stuff was lively I Know that ... this postseason track record is what it is\nBut that was a big win for the red Sox wasn't eating the victory himself but\nHe he pitched well enough and again that his team one which I think it was a key step for for the red Sox and accused for David Rice\nOr so I think certainly the the way things have gone\nI'm asking four to five innings is is very realistic and and I'm here from David standpoint he would love to get to five because then of course you can qualify for the winter her team is that I I think we'd be remiss if we didn't mention the key part of the way the red Sox play last time sort of the way the game ended was was better than his catch in left\nField which made all the controversy and and certainly again that the guys were as as well place because of that are out to bail round is over\nThere the Astros have to run to the first inning and again which they scored zero run and lost by two that's beginning part of the end part was better than they are met again Jeff Jeff passes called it a great job of illustrating this he stepped in briefly right before the final pitch up by the step and a half\nAnd that's the difference of that that is a dream baseball scenario as as controversial as the as the caller was\nThat as as a baseball fan bases loaded to out to run game bottom and then I and the best dinner that you've got a uh thinking line drive the ... the game's going to end right there and and I just I Love the way that are played out\nAre just sort of just understand where the drama and then of course it was it was a great catch ... and the red Sox had the late\nJohn rosy our guest here on out coverage follow him on Twitter at J. O. in ... John how close are we to potentially erasing the claim current job postseason cursed talk that\nCrops up because he's kind of been the dominant pinching name for the last decade so he takes a lot more flack and maybe other guys would but what a gym he put on yesterday it feels like we're getting to the point where that narrative is becoming more prevalent ... and not even an object of baseball types\nI Would agree I to me it was ... with Clayton I I think he just felt that a couple of years ago a really admit probably even earlier than that I remember when he he won a game and twenty Fifteen to force\nThe division series back to back to New York you want to you want a game it was back to LA at the time I think\nYou want a game for in in New York to to avoid elimination that's that says now three years ago he's had a lot of really good start that that I think we're spoiled by Dodger hoping that wasn't good enough and in this even goes back to the ... years were were Donny kept them in the games on them and they probably should have but I I think that a lot of big moments he of course won the pennant clincher last year in Chicago\nHuge came out yesterday a seven innings one earn\nVery impressive thought he was in command from the very beginning so to me that the current shop poses a narrative is is fundamentally different than than the price of one of the price one as a real struggle I think I think Clinton that\nProbably more good than bad in the last several years in the playoffs so ah I I think that's to me the book is closed on that it's just a matter of getting any new in the world series which of course last year and gave five it was was a struggle for him but\nUh I was a huge huge outing for his team yesterday um the the ticket three truly going back to the Milwaukee a and and what could have been obviously his final started a Dodger at Dodger Stadium things play out uh in in the the ... the series and then of course in in the postseason an off season with his\nOpt out in his contract so it was a multi layered start for for the Dodgers for ...\nThat they could not have asked for more than what the race gave them yesterday so uh and of course right now he'd be lined up the likely pitches them thinking about the days here in my head and he would be\nRegular rest a star game one of the world series issue the doctors advance\n[noise] not about a minute left your last question about the series the brewers seemed to not be able to win without hater pitching uh I I Know councils kind of talked about having to find ways to win without him but obviously if he wasn't game six he'll be probably won't be able to throw in in in game seven how the brewers women series without having hater paternal\nWell I so I think the way they're at right now is is of course eight arrests today off traveled a uh I I Would imagine he's done is pitched some on on consecutive days and so I think he'd ... if he goes to innings in game six\nHe could probably still be good for one inning game seven but maybe not the same level of affected this the brewers I find their strategy as a of a course in game five they start with Miley and bring it right and what drove after the first batter the game which is\nA unique and so they're trying to take advantage of the Dodgers I this is a strategy that you take when you don't have 'em for aces lined up in your effort which which by the way a very few teams do\nAnd and I'm I'm fine with it when you look at the Dodgers I Believe they've got a a payroll vantage about three to one over the brewers and so if you've got to\nBe imaginative and and creative to the to stand do to do then that's fine but that's the ... the brewers believe they've got to play that way to win and uh they've had some success but I think ultimately yesterday was it was a very telling moment where they've got to have a guy coming to pick one better then come back and start game six\nThat there's a lot of strategic elements there for the brewers that that I think eventually will more than likely catch up with you unless you're able to really pitch extraordinarily well every single game\nJohn always a pleasure we will talk to you next week we should have a World Series match up price versus Berliner ought to be fun tonight\nThat wait a couple of former teammates or a couple of over ... award winner so or should be

over Milwaukee they leave the national league championship series\nThree games to two game six will be a friday night at Miller Park in Milwaukee\nIt that a change in mind on anything\n[noise] ah I mean I think it's interesting let's bring in the LA crew as well yea for this because I'm a I don't know if Danny is now like breathing into a paper bag hyperventilating hearing this or not but what is your take on this de de\n... I don't think late ... going anywhere he's he's a Dodger for life and I think the Dodger front office is going to make sure he stays in blue\nSo he he can opt out of his deal\nRight 'cause he's he's still under contract for next year but he has a player option correct correct yeah and and he's he's making a lot of money and um you know we we've seen in baseball by the way the salaries and free agency last year were not what people expected it Judy marching has got a hundred million dollars less than he thought he would end the Quakers was obviously a better\nA player disposition than Judy monuments is but I don't know if the money is quite the same in baseball as it used to be Bryce Harper will be fasting to find out what what uh what he gets\nI Would say no way I was in um they just lose the giants more often that'd be nice\nTo you had to get that owns a giant slice of like he he's got a career one point six you're a U.S the giants and like his weapons like point a to get to try and get some Joyce and he still has\nLike a million dollars left on a on the sixty five guy who got to he he can opt out of the final two years in sixty five million remaining in his deal I'm reading this\nFrom the Los Angeles times yesterday before game for the you know the U.S he was asked about the ... and he just kind of quick wish that I have not made a decision which is probably smart he's going to try and play baseball until the Dodgers are either eliminated or they won the trophy\nAfter winning the world series and then he can address that there's no reason to put himself out there and say that when he may be a little bit on short but I actually would be relatively surprise Jeff if he were to leave Los Angeles\nOh we're too especially if they were the world series this year I mean you know he he'll be here in Los Angeles especially be pictures well let's say in game one in Boston and he wins that game I mean he'll be forever alleging Los Angeles I'm I think if you left when he left without a World Series um\nI don't think he'll be shunned in LA but I think the fans will be pretty upset that he left them without bringing the world series especially if you went to like the Yankees or somewhere else in one of the world series on on on a different to Danny ... do you think that that Dodger fans would lose him a little bit of you went to like the Yankees won the world series with them\nI don't think it would go to the Yankees I think if it would go anywhere with me somewhere like the Texas Rangers is that what you're going out yet they always from you use a Texas boy\nYeah but money money's speak Spanish and in for Steve ... I feel like Rick I'm calling I think he would have to consider a\nJeff he's got good character though and he and his wife they're famous for all the charities that they run throughout the world\nI think that that's what he mostly uses his money for away from the game so I I I except for that though I don't think he's an egotistical driven money driven dude like that so I think he'd look for the best situation for him and his family rather than the the biggest payday\nI Would also say that if he's doing a lot of charity work being in Los Angeles is a big boon to that like that that benefits you've a lot being in that market because it's just you pay attention so much more to a few ...\nLike franchises in major league baseball than you do any of these minor teams talked to my trout about the\n... there's a team of north of has a good amount of salary for next year the salaries that are on on them and that times have you have an KUVO at that may have been there but if they're not gonna make a run in but you're talking about the Seattle Mariners\nYeah the Seattle Mariners are going to make a run it a shot no um that'd be very wary if he was a giant I don't know if I can accept trained on governor for ...

of the camera and here's here's clays reaction to what I said\nYeah I agree with you completely now my position is ... is just the general perspective\nI don't have a problem with the fans being right there on top of the field\nI Do think that if you want it to be a hundred percent sure whether or not fan interference was it like\nYou could have a camera that run down or at yeah healing or whatever they give you a ... ... much like you have down the line and we talked about this on the show before one of the frustrating things I think about for instance college football replay it and I think about the Mississippi State Auburn game a couple of weeks ago\nI didn't think that Nick Fitzgerald got in what we don't have a definitive line oftentimes because there's not as many cameras the NFL they have ...\nSo we can get better angles if they all is a hundred per se or you know concerned about this in areas where you could have a ban ... air it ...\nIt seems to me especially it proceeds when they're spending so much money to make sure that they get a game a write in so many extra umpires and everything else out there as river show what you'd have a better vantage point than you would have difficulty in a regular season game but they're ... extra buyers out there\nHaving that that why not eliminate any doubt at all and just have a shot that come straight down and it will be bad is

of the show now with about eighty five hundred votes did ... you get the call right on the ... potential home run last night in the game\nAnd the numbers what we see is usually what happens in the first six to eight hundred votes stays pretty constant no matter how many votes you add to it\nAnd now with you know eighty three hundred votes eighty four hundred votes it's still about what it was sixty five percent of you believe it was a home run thirty five percent are on the side of fan interference now like I said we had John rosy on last hour Jeff and he did make a pretty compelling argument in terms of\nSafety and in terms of the one thing I knew was those or you know very high value tickets to sit right there\nOn the outfield wall and that they probably didn't necessarily think that they would change it I just hate the fact that we we're limited by the camera angles because of the security guard and what ... said in that piece of audio is right if you watch a football game if you watch college football game on the SEC Network for example\nThey have like a third of the cameras\nThat other ESPN major broadcast have and it's actually cost some reviews all ready to seize them because they just don't have the angles that they do everywhere else you would think though that in the ... in the world series playoff baseball after such a long season\nYou would find a way not to be caught where you could not have an angle or something like this\n[noise] why agree I mean I think the same when the super bowl right how could you not have a camera right now in the end zone uh the goal line to know if we if a player is isn't or not no I I'm with you I think that you're not just from players in in the playoffs why can't you end up having you know an extra cameras that somewhere some sort of system\nTo ... and I mean we we mentioned earlier\nOf tennis you have a system to track if the ball hits the the you know the talk at all or or\nOr or the lines that I don't know how other major sports can figure something out to be more ... more a more definitive I look I life there's a human element to baseball I like al ... different strike zones and\nAnd the other officer judgment calls it can't be reviews so it's not like it's really I'm for it really matters much more I like there's a human element of baseball but you have\nThe capability to\nReview and replace some of these ... you know these calls like this that's a judgment call 'em then you should have the cameras in place for that 'cause like you mentioned the the [noise]\nThe game could have changed heavily on that point it didn't it didn't because the ashes of able to come back and go for three but even just having those two extra runs to them in the difference obviously to run loss um and then again I think last week [noise]\nIt just leaves a conspiracy theories I'm a moderate conspiracy theory guy especially conspiracy theory guy\nIn sports and now we have people that can say hey look there's opportunity here to benefit the red Sox and we know baseball would rather have Boston in LA in the world series and have a rematch of last year or the ... the worst case scenario would probably be the brewers and the Astros in the world series and look I don't think that that was this this play any role\nIn the decision to to to go out to be out here in coal interference but it leads to a little bit of talk about conspiracies I I don't think any of you guys were there's Jason Danny or a burn or think that this conspiracy here to help the red Sox but if you believe that this helped her disruptor taste\nYeah no I don't believe that at all but I Do think that it definitely opens you up to those questions because of the team that benefited from such a controversial call I Do think that baseball benefits a little bit from this because in certain cases I don't believe this as a blanket statement\nBut all publicity being good publicity in this case\nTalked you know almost two hours and Fifteen minutes exclusively basically about baseball there's an NFL game tonight\nFootball is king in this country speaking of the king LeBron James is playing his first game and the Lakers uniform tonight we have barely even scratched the surface of that topic so\nI don't think we'd have been talking about Clinton herself dominance for two hours and Fifteen minutes I think we would have talked about it to be sure maybe even off the top of the show but this happening is what has driven conversation not just on this show I'm sure it's going to dominate conversation on virtually every sports talk show\nAcross the nation today whether it's a local show or anything else here on Fox Sports radio you're going to hear it all day and that is good for baseball I think there's a question to be asked now\nThere's a lot of sports on TV right now this time of year there's a whole lot of sports on TV Tonight including an NFL game not maybe the world's most appetizing match up who ruin this season but people exactly people are still going to watch it it's going to be on right there at the same time as Red Sox Astros\nAnd LeBron James is on national television

Iraq to be put on your end show it was unbelievable call on YouTube I can pull it up and send it to you I Will if a play on the show obviously but it was unreal he was like\nHe was on speaker phone he was like shaking as he's reading off his paper dude it was a real and I were really for twenty or Twenty years old going national radio given Iran it was fantastic I thought\nYeah well that right there was not going to be wracked and it was not know that was that was that was something to be sure but uh he waited patiently and dumped came in during the break he's like look\nAndrew in Orlando says he has a world class take he's just he's really proud of it and he really wants to deliver it and that kind of laughed because anybody that generally says that they have a world class take has like a slow dribble or to the first baseman\nGenerally every single time and that's pretty much what we got there\nIt's hard to come on the radio and did it take you must you liked unless you have done this for a while and you you've called it a bunch of shows obviously you know there's there's um low loyal callers call into a lot of shows and they have much better takes its tough man I'm I'm not gonna argument will pass on that he was excited he was excited I like the excitement corner show\nHe was at least we didn't hear the paper crank laying on the air\nWhich also I I did that the other day I was I was given my titans list I have to talk about on serious acts on radio and uh and they were like ... you know I I Know you watch the times from so I said let me do my room I just moved up papers around a bunch and it just like redwood read off my sheet of paper that I had prepared a classic ...\nHow do you guys this yeah yeah he does a great yeah I'm Sorry yeah the guys\nThat you can always hear ... paper historically or the aforementioned J. R. and Rush Limbaugh those are two guys that have made part of their career out of ... papers\nI listen to Rush Limbaugh exactly zero types of things you have\nNo idea I'm not I'm not surprised I mean I I'm ... I'm just suggesting that that's one thing that's always been set it up and there was one of the paper yeah he does like he does it actually like into the microphone like it's not as hard as it is so does\nHer own stick okay\nI don't know if it was part of a stick or what I was like this the habit of his just to close up and throw it when it's done with it\nYeah LeBron is not done LeBron is sort of the story today I think do we still have the phone call or or or to see gone the debate is telling me no he has gone so he did not wait around the brawn James plan is first game in a Lakers uniform tonight against the Portland TrailBlazers\nSaid before I think the Lakers make the playoffs because they have labor on one thing will brawn James does do generally is make everybody around him better\nAnd I do think that some of the guys that you might not know their names yet you're going to know I think he's going to make the branding arms of the world better I Do think that they're going to be the story I think you know what yeah Josh I I think he's got seven games on national television\nJust in the first month of the season like the Lakers are going to be over exposed to another level even from what the Lakers generally are\nBecause of just the circumference of LeBron James is impact and his outsized influence on the league but\nI'm going to be watching like I mean we can sit here and talk about all the brawn James but the but I'm going to be watching the brawn James quite a bit this season where I'm at with the Lakers in terms of just kind of a win last total I think this can kind of become a roundabout discussion if you have thoughts eight seven seven nine six six three six nine\nYou can chime in with your thoughts on the brawn but I feel like this is about forty seven when theme I don't think they're going to win fifty I think the west almost every team in the west is better than they were a season or go Phoenix one last night Devon Booker\nHad a really nice game under the under eight and had what Eighteen ten and six and he was eight of eleven so he looks pretty good as well I think Sacramento is a better team than they have been over the past half decade the clippers made themselves better in the offseason\nDenver is a very dangerous team Utah is a dangerous team Portland is a dangerous team New Orleans is a dangerous team\nAll of these teams in the west are going to be tough one of the things that LeBron had the benefit of in the regular season in Cleveland and in Miami was that much of the rest of the conference or cakewalk during the regular season these are going to be dog fight every night for the Lakers and I'm curious at his age Jeff\nHow LeBron holds up if he has to go out there and play to a high level on a night tonight basis to win the regular season games\n[noise] you know you mentioned the the seven national TV games or whatever it was five early in the season that that was my first thought is how how hard it for probably going to play and some of these games considering that you know he's been a guy that's really going to kind of conserving his energy for the play offs and last year I think he knows are not going to make up the playoff run this year so maybe\nHe does try to give it a little bit more uh more energy or in the season to really sell the Lakers and and look I think his job this year is very clear it's what it was last year it didn't work as well as\nAs I think people expected was he's got to get people to come join him in Los Angeles um yeah the the young group of of Lakers and Danny can speak to us and\nWe're both as well they're they're they're decent young group a Lakers but they need another veteran next year and so adding that that's his job is to make playing with the Lakers fun and exciting and trying to get another veteran and come join him a ... I Believe the Lakers have room for\nAnother ... contract yeah in a a this all she's also someone seal ... somewhat to join him um\nAnd just make a ... you know brings Showtime back to Los Angeles making exciting to to play for the Lakers again\nAnd just get a veteran in and then I think Roland extra who's like you have to rent leaves Golden State which we don't you don't know if he's going to do um you know that that means go that makes them more a more vulnerable to play they have to pay quite Thompson I Believe as well so you know the the warriors might not be the same team next year and if he can improve the Lakers\nWith a veteran I'm In Austin and there are viable young\nYeah if it's me and and dating I Know you guys that in LA of course big Lakers talks I feel like if it's me based on the tea leaves and just based on guys that it looks like are going to leave\nAnd the Davis says the guy that I wouldn't want if I'm a Lakers fan yeah\nTo join LeBron James next year I think it's possible Anthony Davis is the second or third best player in the NBA I think you would fit very well\nOut there I think you can get them away I don't think he wants to stay in New Orleans because they just don't have a winning plan behind and they lost a couple of guys that help them\nMake that little mild playoff run they had last year I don't feel like the rain is coming there I think if the ranch going anywhere it's probably going to the East I'm not sure exactly where maybe he goes to the next maybe he considers Washington I I don't know exactly the salary cap situation on some of those teams\nBut generally speaking if it's me and I can only get one guy to join LeBron James in a Lakers Jersey next year to Anthony Davis\nOoh I Would you rather have you'd rather have the unit brow or more so than like game Willard or Libya or how about ... and another name that's been Davis\nI think I'd rather I think I think Davis yeah he's he's like a generational talents and to have to be able to run the forward that size um\nPair with what they already have plenty of of guards and they don't need another they don't need them Willard quite Tom's obviously ... with his ability to shoot would be a great addition to the team but\nThey don't have a yard like Damien ... on his level\nI Know but I I Would rather have the the all world talent who's seven feet tall than the point guard because you when you look at the Bronx and play that position if needed like Kenny shoot threes though and the ...\nI was a kid he consistently it three's\nBut I don't know if they need that from him they need it I just think he's ... how do you turn down in all world talent like that over the one that is why\nClay would be such a good fit I think because that's the only thing the Lakers are really truly missing right now is a pure shooter you need a guy that can score and can get hot and go off and if the bronze having an off night he can kick the ball out too that shooter\nDoesn't worry you that clay might be different player with out all those guys around him\nYeah a little bit I mean he's more of a\nCatch ... he's more of a catch and shoot player who has certainly benefited he is certainly benefited from the just the attention that stuff and Katie obviously pull away but\nOne thing that clay Thompson does have is incredibly quick release with his jumper so I still think that he would I think it'd be a great fit don't get me wrong I just looking at the Davis and say man that guy along with LeBron James makes them such a physical team and it gives them a size dimension and the one thing that we're seeing about Anthony Davis is\nCalling the town's hasn't exactly blossom quite as far\nAs we thought maybe he would a lot of these guys these tall are guys that are more versatile and can step out Anthony Davis is still the cream of that crop nobody else can do the kinds of things that he can do an alter a game in quite the same way so as much as I like playing originally I thought you're going to LA would make a whole lot of sense and I still think that it would\nIf it to me I'm taken Anthony Davis all day long and twice on Sunday the only guy would not take Anthony Davis for Israel urban at least not in the update studio out Los Angeles Ralph take it away\nSure about that [noise] maybe I don't know I'm trying to be nice\nTo your man army and you know you've been you've been taking them for a while but meanwhile the Boston Red Sox are they took a Houston for a ride on Wednesday night general", "year": "2018", "show_name": "FOX Sports Radio", "city": "Newton", "day": "18"}
