{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WXKS", "content": "John ... John bachelor show Thomas Bogart\nIs here his new book is December mentality that mentality\nAt America's entry into World War one the president of the United states has been given the cameraman telegram and it is a fantastic plot for us in the twenty first century Mexico will attack the United states with ... with German assistance the Japanese will join in this attack\nAnd reward the Germans when successful in Europe of overwhelming the British and the French will give California to Japan and give Texas and Arizona or and New Mexico to ... uh to Mexico itself or allow it to happen the United states will be re partition as a result of this alliance\nThe other part that has ever been telegram is that the Germans are going to begin unrestricted ... that the unrestricted warfare was always part of a German plan of aggression to intimidate the Americans\nThat's critical because there was a war party and an anti war party in the Congress the anti war party is very suspicious this telegram suits the purposes of white hall of the British Empire of Lloyd George David Law George the new prime minister out of money out of time\nThey know that the British are are desperate and probably should be seeking piece terms or some armistice in fact the president at Christmas Nineteen sixteen into January Nineteen Seventeen what the president a Wilson was often in the headlines\nLeading a a peace idea an arbitration idea with himself as a referee saw all of a sudden the referee is compromise but not yet\nThe president is not ready to go to war he's holding back\nOne of the tests that they go through in order to convince the Congress that the Germans are aggression aggressive and that the British did not concoct is is they want demonstration that the Americans had the ability\nTo solve this code is one of the scenes I Love more than any other than your book Thomas when a degrade Nigel degrade the crypt analysis expert in Rome forty who actually did part of the decoding others that room and telegram\nTakes an American named bell into the ... office in the halls office and allows bell or participates in belle translating that they had to demonstrate that\nThe Americans had the ability to translate it it was a theater piece Thomas it was a fiction but haul gotten away with it yes\nIt was far you're absolutely right what happened was you know when the telegrams publisher march first it was a debate in Congress\nAnd to many um you know many many representatives and senators skeptical and say well we're actually coming from and suspicion was that this was given by Great Britain to the United states in order to bring the United states into the war and this is actually a voice in this congressional debate and this was\n... absolutely true I'm now the Wilson Administration um then as you said I'm I'm a Vietnam ranges for um a Mr bell from the American embassy in London um along with whole to the crypt this telegram\n[noise] um the evidence is that fail actually unable to do so and and degrade takes over and do that for him but then the Americans the American administration can truthfully say\nThis was captured ... by\nAn American I'm a so they wouldn't have to lie to Congress and say ah you know this ... this is what actually true in in in in a in a shallow fence um but the greater truth of course was\nNot what they did buy the British it's called the Arab the third time they answered the question or they answered the wrong question very and very\nDetailed so but I'll ask the right question in Iraq and in fact hall had constructed the ... of the telegram when it got to Mexico City or intercepting it so that they could do the code on code that\nAnd present that is if they'd interrupted the Mexican or the Mexican reception of the\nA telegram what's critical here is that there was an agent network stringing between Berlin and London and New York and Washington on the Mexico City and you've solved all this Thomas in one of the joys of reading your book let's go to march second the ... the roundtable dining club in New York\nOut the guest of honor that night as a man named captain guy got an around him are a lot of pro war big deals including of course the former ambassador to us\nBass it or to Britain Joseph ... chose\nAnd a captain gone wrong and that is challenged is this a fraud did you do this is this your scheme and captain gone just not tell the truth Thomas it's a joy to see him mislead the war party to their satisfaction people want to be convinced\nBut gone reports to haul the Nineteen out of twenty American gentleman believe this is a fraud\nThat's right I mean that that that is that is very doubtful if if that was actually true to me it seems that\nWhen this title gr music she published on march first Nineteen Seventeen or the the debate is more well is it can we take this seriously you know this this is so outrageous um um is this something to be taken seriously and you mentioned the round table um um dinner\nUm how how easily these these pro ... American ... pro war party is convincing he goes to show\n'em the telegram very quickly becomes a political tool in the United states it's really not so much about\nIs this a veritable threat I don't think many people believed that Germany in Mexico you know were physically capable of invading the United states and just membrane yet um but for the pro war party it becomes you know yet another\nTool in their push for war but then you also have the anti war party that dismisses this telegram is something ridiculous this can be taken seriously this is just a\nA this is this is this is just a sign of how desperate the Germans are so um it is often has often been sad that the telegram most sort of the Pearl harbor of World War one\nAnd my argument is no no it really wasn't it was not it was\nUm if anything it prove divisive because it reinforced pro war sentiment were already exist that um but even after the publication of the telegram you have a very strong um um peace movement I'm antiwar sentiment in the United states\nAnd telegrams does not unlike Pearl Harbor able to to rally the public behind 'em ... American administration going to war and when America does enter the war in April Nineteen Seventy my thesis is\nIt is a much more divided country than for instance Germany France Britain were in Nineteen fourteen and you can see evidence of that after the war\nWhen a America does not signed the peace treaty of Versailles retreat into isolationism and really comes out of it only when Pearl Harbor all curse\nI'm socialism and telegram does play a role in American domestic politics in Nineteen Seventeen but not in the sense that it unites the American public um for intervention\nDid not unite in fact you a stylish the fact that the anti war faction was determined to believe that America has been tricked regardless of this Emmert mentality Graham and at the end result is a hundred thousand American casualties ... did not match the\nUh the gym and telegram or the the so called threat of the Germans the Mexicans and the Japanese that was fantastic and it was used as a\nAs a ... but that it was the illegitimate that's what they believed even in Nineteen Eighteen is that correct\nThat is correct of course in ... in a narrow ... almost true it was not a fraud and there were not people who were saying was the front of the same time but the suspicion at the time I'm by by isolationist or non interventionist senators and and newspapers was\nThat this was play to the American I by the British with the goal of getting Americans to the war and this is of course exactly the what had happened\nAnd it's the fact of the matter solved by Thomas Bogart their mentality Graham intelligence diplomacy and America's entry into World War one it is important to know how it all started I'm John ...\nHow can I help my daughter was every\nSearching for help with Dr reading\nHow can

the game something that Aaron Rogers said resonated with many Packer observers Rogers initially claim that the Packers were a championship defensive level team any non playoff team on the offensive side\nAnd when he was asked specifically\nWhy the Packers are having problems getting the football to their top play makers and creating big plays an offense Aaron Rogers said quote it's by the plan\nThis is clearly an indictment of Mike mccarthy if you're not familiar with the inner workings of Green Bay Packer football\nOr you should be even if you're not a Packer fan because or a stockholder because Mike mccarthy has been the central guy behind the offensive game plan for for many many years in Green Bay and Aaron Rodgers a pointing out it's by the plant so I got a couple of thoughts on this real quick I\nHey Mike McCarthy\nIs on borrowed time in Green Bay here's the beneficiary much like Mike Tomlin in Pittsburgh that in those two towns Pittsburgh doesn't fire coaches Green Bay doesn't fire coaches it's a unique environment in Green Bay because it's a team it's a community on teams\nNot your normal set up their our stock holders there is a board of governors it's it's a unique set up an American sports with the Green Bay Packers have and that is allowed Mike mccarthy\nTo continue to live off that Super Bowl of twenty ten the Packers over the last eight years\nOr five and six in the postseason you think about Mike McCarthy's entire career in Green Bay he's had hall of fame quarterback Brett Farr and Aaron Rodgers there's one Super Bowl to show for it they've had some dominant regular season teams they want Fifteen in one one year didn't win in the playoffs they weren't twelve and for\nA few years back nothing to show for it\nAnd McCarthy continues on but this is clearly a referendum on Mike McCarthy's\nPerformance and ... and the second thing here in Rogers does have to take some accountability and responsibility so it's it's not all on Mike mccarthy mean Rogers is not incorrect that the play calling you sub standard\nBut this is also a page out of all brawn James handbook for Aaron Rodgers the passive aggressive\nHandbook which LeBron is known to do and you know the bronze going to do it this year when the Lakers start losing they've already lost one since the got LeBron James he could run off the court by the Denver Nuggets in the exhibition season of huh but it's about the Green Bay Packers\nBut the Packers are predictable when it comes to the play calling their unimaginative the way they call plays thinking about what the the Packer often to look like if they had someone maybe not even as good as Sean McVeigh but like a poor man Sean McVeigh\nThe rams had more play make is okay but think about what the rams do\nOffensively and and what they can do with Jared go off and you have Aaron Rodgers who's supposed to be much better than charity golf and the Green Bay Packers just kinda\nJust kinda you know or doing their thing\nAaron Rodgers a number one quarter everyone says number one quarterback were were twenty five percent into the NFL season he's the thirteenth rank quarterback in the NFL\nThirteenth and the NFL Joe\nFlaco is breathing down the neck of Aaron Rodgers and the\nQuarterback rating so they didn't come at us and that's not to believe but the point here but does any app [noise] yeah the answers\nThe answer is no I mean the answers nothing\nDuring the season the stock holders will get together\nThey continue to over value\nThe Packers a positive note for Green Bay I mean you look around the Vikings are they've come apart at the seams their signature defense can't stop anybody the eagles have all kinds of issues or it Carson wince can escape pressure\nUh the they're blaming the offensive line now 'cause Carson went through the steps slower and suddenly is getting ... with the same office of wind that was there last year and now they can't block anybody\nOr so there are ... but but there there is a separation already I mean the rams and the saints\nAre much better than everyone else in the NFC we say hello to Edmund Dallas steamboat Willie\nGarcia right\nChilling out hanging out ... thank you yes\nThere you are you are obviously you're ... you're only when I was not exempt you might have been eating\nI Wish I was having no cannot ... Cooper said there was a pie in the refrigerator\nLemon pie was in ... I'm not a big big lemon guy\nWas it lemon ... pie or lemon pie there is a difference I think it's just lemon lemon ... what about lemon ... no not a big what about lemon ... not really what about lemonade do you like lemonade or you know on a on a certain hot day lemonade can be quite refreshing\nSo you're not a generally speaking not pro lemon\nGenerally speaking that is correct my my my uh wife enjoys a looming cheesecake and I I Will tolerate that because mostly for the cheesecake part of it\nI've never had lemon cheesecake I like lemonade or I enjoy\nEliminate enjoy that I like lemon pie and I like a it's not my favorite banana creams might go to pies John the pie guy knows that's my go to pie is the banana cream pie\n'cause he's still John du pont guy by the way he was find out right now on the wings guy let's go to um\n... as he changed his name let's go to the legendary color we ... we know him as John the pie guy but he he used to be in the pie business but he's no longer in the pipe is Hello John the guy\nWas going on I'm Out in the pie business\nYou know none of them and he's all about that provided recovery I'm all about that pie boss yes oh yeah but I can\nI can always get you know I got to make a trip down there but I Would either be the wave guy or a lift guy here pretty soon to be doing that\nOn the side you were to you know you guys can not picking up a form of\nCoupons so what do you work who says all of the above you want whatever you can provide he wants all the above all the [laughter] well\nFor the nickname I mean you've got to pick that I Can't get my fellow man that's a little a\nTruly go ... what do you think your Kobe Bryant giving yourself a nickname only ... you can do that you know I just do what I said\nI Can't get myself a nickname what color if you guys get you guys got to choose a lemon pie is ah\nFrom a previous show that's what she got that one of the sugar free so a\n... minute down I Want to buy what show had was that Jason Smith show is that in here you know I used to the average Joe\n...

horrible man that dirt infield the whole thing\nWhat a joke I cannot wait for the raiders to get out of there and I feel bad for the Oakland A's because the raiders get to go to that brand new facility in a couple of years in Las Vegas obviously what are the Oakland A's going to do after that they need a new baseball stadium badly\nBest part of that stadium still I think one of the best stories is how Randy Moss supposedly wouldn't run routes they're required him to run on dirt yes ah such an amazing story I'm about to about how messy that the that stadium is\nSo we got the NFL uh and evidently a dog is a lot to check in with that later um he's trying to get everything set up after he was in Paris after he decided to at the jet away for the Ryder Cup and watched by the way the U.S get destroyed\nBy a by Europe but we were we talked about that on I guess it was friday morning was a friday morning we will you know as the good yeah it was a three one lead that the U.S had in the first four matches and then everything fell apart from uh from that point forward I'm One of the things that\nI thought was a was maybe the most intriguing in general about the er about week four in the NFL kind of across the board\nThere was one awful roughing the past or call from the Cleveland Browns game\nBut in general it seems like there was a memo that had gone out that told NFL officials not to be as aggressive and throwing the roughing the passer flags\nI don't have the data in front of me right now but it seemed like the number of roughing the passer flags versus week three and certainly the first three weeks of the season were significantly diminished it I think there had to be a memo that went out to all of the different officials that said hey guys\nThe biggest complaint we are getting right now is that you guys are excessively enforcing the new roughing to pass or a penalty and as a result I thought I thought all of those kind of a dried up and a substantial fashion which really I mean I've got an argument I'm going to break it down for you later in the show I mean the NFL is close to getting its group back\nI have this sense that the ESPN CBS NBC and Fox partnerships they all just basically decided we're not going to cover the protest anymore\nAnd I don't know about you guys I don't even know how many players or kneeling now but everybody in the media has just been like screw it we're not covering this anymore it's really pretty wild to follow if you think about the last two years how every single national anthem was chronicled in an obsessive fashion\nAnd then the ratings collapsed twenty percent\nAnd I think the TV partners as well as the league have finally said something that I suggested awhile ago which is\nYou got to treat the protesting players like kids misbehave\nThe more you pay attention to them the more it continues if you ignore them I think the analogy I had was never had kids if they're running and playing in the backyard and they trip and fall and everybody pays attention to them then they start to cry\nBut if they look around and realize that nobody saw them or at least they can't tell that somebody saw them they often just get up and continue to run\nAnd I think the fact that I don't know about you guys have you seen a story about protesting players\nAt all this year from any of those major league partners I think everybody got together and finally said guys were getting killed a year we lost hundreds of millions of dollars because of all the ... of the NFL and the ... at them and everything else I don't even know anybody ... right now is anybody even though we\nDon't even know because like you said nobody's covering the story line just\nDied I mean I I'm\nI'm not a conspiracy guide generally speaking because I've been conspiracies are hard to follow there is one hundred percent but in agreement a handshake by all of the league TV partners and everyone else associated with the NFL\nThat they will not cover this anymore because that story just went away I mean think about it did they ever even officially announced any kind of policy that was a huge story around Memorial Day when they said hey we got a new policy for the national anthem and then it just vanished\nAnd the result has been fans are coming back into the game it feels like\nThe overall quality of the game has increased in terms of points being scored entertaining uh overtime three different overtime game the amount of ah\nUnexpected outcomes and games whether it was the ... starting off the season\nBy whipping the New Orleans saints on the road or whether it was something as crazy as the bill's going on the road\nAs one of the biggest underdogs and twenty five years to win in the NFL it's been hard

thanks mainly just significant radio airplay for the single hurricane\nSandy [laughter] [noise]\nTo me that he was finally scoring us with the number one single Saturday Night\nNow they're setting the pace and the rams\nI'm looking forward to them getting a challenge like the Cheech get last night and I know everyone who's listening to hold up a second they got sounds big time by Minnesota and they did I don't disagree but they also played from the front in that game\nThe the cheese last night cat had come from up the pace to get it done\nI have no doubt in my mind the rams can come up the pace and get it done but that's when you really grow as a team and that's when you have your set yourself up for playoffs success because you have to have had a few moments along the way that you can kind of refer back to like hey guys we've been here before we done this\nIt was front running teams that just beat people down all the way through\nClay how many times in our lifetime have we watch those ... and then they get into that one game and there's oftentimes the championship game\nAnd all of a sudden they hold a second we have been here before will be doing and that that might not turn out as well I mean it's real simple I mean you can go back in your mind you can think of and go oh yeah yeah yeah yeah I remember that in Nebraska team lost in Miami the national championship when they went for two\nI don't know that they were behind all year [laughter] you know we're\nAllowed to play area Dayton, Idaho doing our\nSurvey is one that immediately comes to mind for a lot of people they lose to the giants they had a couple of close games but I think I'll go back that they were\nThat they were even in a tight game they are kind of stunned them beyond belief\nWhen you look at a at the overall NFL landscape through four games I said in my open it seems like the NFL's got its groove back the game going really entertaining and they're really entertaining fashion there's almost no discussion about off the field in less than ... good off the field drama for the bell by which I mean\nAlways the levy on bell gonna come back can you believe what somebody's tweet said it's almost all related in some way\nTo competition itself do you get that sense when you were calling the game that the NFL after a couple of years stumble may finally be returning to just being a football games are being football entertainment again\n[noise] absolutely and I think it's a huge sigh of relief for most people\nAnd I don't care which side of the spectrum you fall off they're a good number of people who have their issues with the NFL that I Would sit down and listen to [noise] and not dispute\nLike I don't like it for this this this and this and here's was bothered me this is the net and most of those people that I that that had those issues with the NFL\nThey've you know some of them would say well I'm not going back you know I'm done with the NFL\nAnd most of them are really saying I just want to find a reason to love the NFL again give it to me\nIn this field this season feels like they're giving it to the people that get in so many different ways look the anthem thing we're not discussing it right now I think we're essentially down to Kenny Stills and Albert Wilson with Miami\nThat that we're discussing and there's not much of a discussion I think that the Kennedys stills when you talk about what he's done in this community and everything else there's there's almost a hey he's kneeling but look at all these other things doing we're just not talking about and then the game\nHad been extremely compelling what are we at six overtime games already we go down to the wire on Monday Night football again last night\nThose things are really helping when we're able to put it back on the field it takes away from just about everything else and that's a good thing for the NFL but I think you're right the ... there for the league and let's hope that it continues\nWhat do you think about the Frank right that we I I obviously I'm In love with my variable I live here in Nashville what ... done the last three weeks three straight wins as an underdog this team seems to love him saying hey we're not going to attempt a field goal and go for the tie against the eagles was an incredible game in overtime came down to Marcus Mario to throwing a touchdown pass with Eighteen seconds left\n... wins everybody says he's a genius what did you think about the Frank right decision in Indianapolis getting that game\nMy thought in general was it was the context of the time that was left on the clock it um it would have been hard even if they got in that first down potentially for them to get into a field goal of you know kind of range yeah uh whereas they basically gave the taxes that opportunity there your coach you're making that decision what would your analysis of the Frank right decision to have been\nBut I thought he was being a little overly aggressive there because of where he was on all things you point out especially where he was on the field and what are we always talk about when you make a decision you often have to have the context of what if your decision goes the opposite of what you're trying to accomplish what was the fallout\nAnd the fall out there it was really kind of setting themselves up setting them up for a pretty easy shot at a field\nAnd and that's actually what happened but here's the flip side of it all\nBrand new head coach you notice like clay you're trying to gain the trust of your team you're trying to get your team to buy into you all those buzz words and phrases that we use all the time [noise] and I don't think that Frank Reich as much of a problem with that with his team\nBut I think he also is told his team were going to be aggressive similar to what Mike rape was doing and he wanted to prove it to them so it may be a loss there\nBut I doubt that his team has lost confidence in him as they head coach 'cause it's the same as good a scuffle for wins all year long and he was trying to get them what I think it ultimately probably not the right call I I'm not going to sit here and say I would have would have stood up and you're not announcer booth to go to a great idea I have been on the opposite side\nBut I'm not going to ... them forever for that one either I think it may pay dividends for 'em down the road Mike ... who you brought up remember after the season opener you were wondering okay what's going on with\nThis all I was ... ... right I feel I you'll you'll appreciate this yeah I feel right now about my ... like I did about Bruce Pearl at Tennessee for basketball by ... I'm an unabashed tendency University of Tennessee fan unabashed heightened fan\nAnd it's rare you have a coach who you are I Would I say\nIs like if somebody tried to tell you tried to shoot him I Would Secret Service dive in front of him and [laughter] All right ed so uh it so I'd love to every I still love ... I Love everything about what he's done for his entirety but\nYou come in after just along the ... I Would say where you're just like man there's no reason to be excited or energetic about this program or about the team\nAnd he immediately flip the switch and everything changes and I see a little bit of my ... uh in his parole and the same way that I felt\nWell well well to your point on that Mike ... has been telling his team and he really told them and this one because they are planning to send their goal champs\nWe're going after him we're going to be aggressive [noise] I I don't know what kind of speech he gave but it almost felt like herb Brooks talking to his team in in the locker room and it was it before the game against the Russian but during practice\nSession when he said there's a way to beat them you don't defend them you attack them\nRight you remember that the yeah like yeah to tackle\nAnd he told his team that we were going to be aggressive we're going to do that and then he is head coach had to symbolize that and I loved his explanation post game when he ran a field goal unit I said we were never going to feel\nMy team knew that but we were going to show this and then we came out we went for it and it worked out I just love that approach and I think Frank Reich is probably tried to do something similar in Indianapolis is results probably in the wrong spot\nBut I'm not doing it in for giving it a given it a try because we ask anyone preseason as Indianapolis contender you've got to resolve to do and he's trying to build a program there\nYou've got giants Panthers coming up the Panthers coming off a by week the giant sitting at one in three we mentioned the NFC earlier and what exactly was going to help it happened in that division is came back\nA because it wasn't too long ago you know Newton and the Carolina Panthers are going up against the Denver Broncos and Peyton Manning and the and the Panthers were nearly a touchdown favored in that game and everybody was talking about cameras the reigning league MVP in the face of the NFL for years to come\nAnd the last couple of years have been a real struggle for him do you think the Panthers are back to being that upper echelon team can can play at maybe not exactly the MVP caliber but can he demonstrate that he is an upper echelon quarterback as well and it's like\nI say yes from what I've seen on a three games sample and I think it's got a chance to keep getting better and you remember when north Turner was hired as often to coordinate there's a lot of head scratching people who are who what North Turner Cam Newton don't see that at all and that's because we get very stuck in\nThis is what this coach did before and this is who we had planned quarterbacks for my you're not going to run Troy Aikman like you're going to run camp I mean that's just stupid but everybody seems to everybody there's a lot of discussion that\nNor wouldn't be able to change quote unquote and can wouldn't be able to change and I said right from the beginning I said it these to meet halfway\nWhich actually expected them to do because cameras now in his eight year\nThey've got a chance to be successful that did I say that there's going to be business now I just that they have to be halfway meaning nor can't just you know chain into the pocket and can't can't just say I'm going to run it and run around and do all this other stuff yet it checked out so well he's doing all of that plays like sixty five percent ... percent grown up\nCans of career fifty eight fifty nine percent thrower so he's doing more of the stuff norms asking and then return nor has kept the quarterback run game in effect with that off that and I think that's paying them great dividends and last but not least\nI said it before the draft I'm going to say it again now I screamed it from the rooftops and I'm not sure it won't hurt me to hear me down every one more time\nChristian McCaffrey can run inside okay if I act like he can't run between the tackles he could at Stanford I was ... he couldn't the pros he's doing it now and he's catching ten passes again give it to our\nOnly uh we're talking I Want to get at the top of our two year we're going to give you the top five bottom five in the in the NFL is I Do every single Tuesday after the NFL weakest complete a but daddy gee you were at the raiders game you heard people talking about my book out at the time of your story I don't know the whole story here\nYeah ... it was a it was interesting to hear people talk about our radio program and obviously I was standing in the background so they didn't know that there were listening airs but uh\nIt was to greater officials who were walking around with general manager Reggie McKenzie\nAnd the subject of Dan Patrick's radio show came up so you were talking about the DPJ show in one of them said yeah you know I wake up early and and I I go to the gym and that's when I listened to a quake Travis on the game and then after that I Dream the damn Patrick show\nAnd then the other guy was like yeah man that's quite Travis guy came out of nowhere and he's like yeah I mean in his book he's got a book now and the other guy said you know the thing is I I like 'em but I can only take like thirty minutes of your show [laughter] and uh I\nHad no idea no had no idea you were working on the show you're just a huge dropping their right\nI mean because I did have to have a media passed and it said Fox Sports radio on it but obviously it doesn't say what show you're working with or anything like that and you know you learn early on in radio that a word of mouth is the best promotions so when you meet folks you tell them about the radio show and make sure they're listening\nI'm and before I forget by the way a couple of coliseum employees who listen to the show every morning on our affiliate Ninety five seven the game Walter in Selma I told them both\nI Would give 'em shot up they listen to out kick every morning\nAh up in Oakland or it was really cool to hear those tomb raider officials talking about the damn Patrick show and kick the coverage\nAnd then so my job there was I was going to get a post game interview from the winning locker room for our weekend show which was Brady Quinn and Jonas knocks so I go down to the locker room and the pursuit of comes up to me is Marcia John Lynch\nAnd I'm standing there in ... in the first\nWords out of his mouth I kid you not was what up the N. word and she out of all the players he by far was the coolest he was walking around now he won't go on the air with anybody and he won't officially do an interview but he\nHad the best personality out of all the greater players down there\nAnd so I had to work hard for the one interview I got for the network and it turned out to be really good Mr pick sticks from the Ohio State Jerry on Conley who we talked about a lot on the show a couple of years ago when the raiders used that first round draft pick on him even though he had that controversy swarming around him at the time\nComing out of college he was really good on the air they played Brent must burgers pick six a play by play call for him during the interview\nAnd he said afterwards and and I this kind of scared me because he's on\nMy cell phone live on Fox Sports radio and I hear calmly say oh yeah\nShit su he dropped a he dropped a a word you can't say when he was live on the network they spend a good five minutes with them\nAnd afterwards he was really happy and ... then came over to me and he was like oh man you got here we are to go on the air when he doesn't talk to nobody and he called me the N. word again\nAnd so was it was really funny because he's kind of like the court jester and their locker me it was just walking around stirring things up he he told me Derek car would not talk to me it's like go talk to you and ah so yeah ... march on was it was a clown but in a good way it was fun being around him\nSpeaking of a cloud and maybe not in a good way I think dark cutter may have made one of the dumbest decisions in the NFL season so far with the Tampa Bay buccaneers and what he decided to do I know Frank right decision to go forward in overtime against the Texans got a lot of attention but I think that died in ...\nCut her best and explain what I'm doing and why I Believe it Jamieson which then is now the new start or when they come out of there by week but that game against the bears was such a disaster I think we need to dive into it and talk about the decision making\nAnd the leadership that ah they're cutter has shown or not shown stopped by bottom five an

Cincinnati Bengals [noise]\nThey got the touchdown pass a Julio Jones from Andy told than they are the number one team right now in the AFC North\nThey have been pretty outstanding all year I Believe they're only defeat if I'm not mistaken Carolina Panthers or so maybe you could make a case where the Panthers there over the Bengals but with the wind over the ravens with the fact that they one week one over the cold I've just got the Bengals why didn't get it to five spot that was a tough call for me\nIn the forest spot I've got the Jacksonville Jaguars\nI'm pretty good about about what happened to them they're only lost nine six two the titans who I have in the third spot tightened beat the defending Super Bowl champs they beat the week before that the jags on the road Marcus Mario to back healthy Corey Davis maybe overriding the titans but at three in one I've got them is the third best seeming\nThe NFL and then the top two teams in the NFL you can flip flop 'em however you would like the rams and the chiefs I don't think there's any doubt the rams are the best team in the NFC and I don't think there's any doubt the chiefs are the top team in the AFC\nDisagreements agreements how brilliant am I what analysis and would you have here Danny gee [noise]\nA brilliant as a strong word or don't have a problem with the top five the bottom five and I'm not just being a Homer but the raiders probably should've beat the Broncos they were in the Miami Dolphins game all the way to the bitter end and we know that the dolphins played good good up until last Sunday\nSo I don't think the raiders or the second to last worst team in the NFL there are there in the mix but I think you have them read it a little low\nThat's a fair criticism [noise] um\nSo yeah there were you know top five rams sheep titans jak bangles a bottom five in order descending order Steelers forty niners jets raiders cardinals um and maybe I've got the raiders treated to unfairly ah okay so uh this is pretty

just flat out unbelievable so tomorrow I Am doing a book signing in Nashville it's the first book signing that I've done obviously Nashville, Tennessee is my home town I'll be at the Vanderbilt a Barnes and noble\nVanderbilt University Barnes and noble there on ... avenue tomorrow at seven o'clock central if people are in the area and they want to go and get their book side\nI also I'm going to be down at the beach this weekend I'm I'm going down to uh to thirty a the area of the in between Panama City and San deaths and Rosemary beach and the side a lot of people have been down there\nThis is something it's never happened to me before yesterday so I have to book signing scheduled for the weekend down there ah on the beach I'm doing I was doing one in the side and I was doing one in a Rosemary beach\nSo one of those guys who runs a bookstore down there some dog books as the name of it right there on the beach basically in seaside seaside the great community um if you've ever watched the movie the Truman Show they filmed or the Truman Show there it's a beautiful beach community\n[noise] they have this book store right there on the town square and the owner of the book store called and cancelled my book signing because he said he disagreed with some of the opinions in my book\nHow crazy as\nAn independent bookstore I'm not getting paid anything ah I was just like you know what I Want to give people an opportunity if they're down there I Want to be able to give them an opportunity to get an autographed copy of a book because I Know lots of people like to get autographs copies of the\nBooks the guy admitted he hadn't read the book but he didn't like my cover he literally judged in my book by the cover any canceled the book signing\nLame how unbelievable as that look we\nMost often as I was I'm Sorry I was gonna say most of us on your own staff disagree with a lot of your takes but we work with you daily if this is where people need to have open minds no matter what side of the aisle you're on you can't block something just because it doesn't fall in line with your personal opinion\nAnd this is I think even crazier is this a bookstore so of all the places you would think that would be open to creative thought or arguments that you might not agree with you would think that an independent bookstore would\nBe kind of a bastion of intellectual freedom right I mean that you can walk into a book store and buy a book and that you don't have to agree with every single thing in that book and look if the guy had decided you know what I don't want to host this book signing at all and he just said you know what we're busy that day\nBut to agree to host it\nAnd then to decide based on my cover and then like the dust jacket\nThat you're not going to allow me to sign books in your store I I just I were\nIn a strange place what's disappointing to me to about this decision it I've been in that book store a lot I guarantee you I have spent hundreds of dollars on books in that book store\nUh probably every year I spent hundreds of dollars because I'm Down there at the beach where you're going to buy books like you want to have a book to read on the beach I got kids so I'm regularly buying kids' books from them and it's just continuing this this situation where everything in our country\nIs so political in this day and age that I got to think about my shoe purchase I got to think about what restaurants I can go like I don't want to do that\nI just want to pick places and be able to walk in there so\nI thought this was pretty crazy I mean I'm I'm not done that it happened\nBut I'm Still kind of surprised um you know there's a difference between being done to where you're like I Can't believe this happened and surprised where you're like man I'm kind of you know like I didn't expect this to happen but I'm not done by it\nI I just I Can't believe that an independent bookstore would make a decision like this so anyway I'm doing assigning unless they cancel it at Vanderbilt university's Barnes and noble tomorrow it's seven\nAnd then I Will be doing assigning down on the beach I Know we have a lot of listeners out all over the southeast to go down to the beach October\nDown on the beach or there is actually the best month because the weather's perfect underwater still warm enough to go on the Gulf Coast I'll be doing assigning it Rosemary beach so I check out the book Republicans buy sneakers to you guys have been phenomenal in your support of this book and and honestly I'm blown away and Danny gee on top of that\nAs if we didn't have enough positivity going on we also set an all time record for September downloads on the podcast I Believe correct\nCorrect yeah I was looking at the total downloads right now it is pretty amazing and you gotta think obviously we're not on on the weekend I'm so twenty shows for what the total downloads are just mind boggling\nMillions of you are downloading the shows now every month which is a which is incredible when you think about the growth of this thing and to set a new record in September and now we're in October so if you haven't signed up for the ... make sure you do so you don't miss anything at all we'll be joined by march ... here on the flip side\nAt the bottom of the hour he obviously is an NFL expertise also\nA big bronco guy so he's the perfect guy to talk to on this Monday when it was so close to the Broncos\nGrabbing control early of the AFC West and sending a message that Patrick ... could be beaten\nInstead my home's a rodeo wrangler\nA accent at all managed to ah to grab control of the of the division instead we'll talk to ... it's about that\nOur three we'll be joined as we always are on Tuesdays by a by Petro Degas also at the bottom of our two we haven't done an animal thunder dome in a while probably animal thundered on time and I still need to make my case about why the Tampa Bay buccaneers and made such an awful decision by deciding to go to James Winston and also\nWhy that performance against the bears should be alarming if you are bucks fan or you are in any way\nAssociated with the dirt cutter coaching staff all that and more coming up next I'm Clay Travis let me tell you by the way this show also in addition to everybody who's listening to it we've got so many different advertisers coming in they had been doing it incredible job of selling the show\nAnd one thing that's really challenging right now no matter who you are hiring the right people\nIt is one of the lowest unemployment rates\nIn our nation's history the lowest right now I think statistically going all the way back to Nineteen sixty eight so the war within like fifty years of unemployment whether you're white black Asian Hispanic whatever your background is there's never been a better time to go get hired right now and if you are trying to find somebody\nIt can be really difficult to get the right higher\nBecause there is such a difficulty out there in the hiring market right now so why wouldn't you take advantage of my friends right now and do something really smart and take advantage of the upper critter\nYou know what's really smart indeed it is going to zip recruiter dot com slash clay to hire the right person be smart hire the right person at ... dot com slash clay zipper critter doesn't depend on candidates finding you find them for you\nIt's powerful matching technology scans thousands of resumes identifies people with the right skills education\nAnd experience for your job and actively invites them to apply\nYou get qualified candidates fat that is why is it for critters rated number one overall by employers in the U.S this rating comes from hiring sites on trust pilot with over a thousand reviews right now my listeners contrite zip recruiter for free\nLearned more discovered dot com slash machinations apply now back to ... and the guy go I'll keep recovered studios\nWe are indeed here and the guy go out ... studios where it's easy to say Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance that guy go go to guy could calm or call eight hundred nine four seven auto the only hard part figuring out which way is easier we're joined now by mark solaris sand or Mark I'm sure you were up late last night\nWatching as the Denver Broncos look like they were in great shape and then Patrick my home's magic happened break down the game for us how big was it\nWell I mean it was it was obviously a huge impassioned homes you know I'm I'm One of the guys that just looked at in Los Angeles and the kid's gonna there's obviously going to be positive struggle young choir but\nI'm telling you what not only magical not only ability to escape the pocket but throw accurately on the run always looking to throw the ball now we're on the ball pushed down the field find somebody\nUm he was he was nothing short of amazing so you know it was just one of those eye opening experience for me watching ... a month for all your you know watched every game but um it was it was something to watch him play the game the way he did it as the boys\nTo come back from a fourth quarter deficit\nUm you know when the when the bubble game so I just thought he was amazing I thought it was a great game you know I I keep looking at the Broncos like\nWhy would you ever do anything other than run the ball you average it over ... why would you let them get back in the game and why wouldn't you continue to run the ball why would you ever go to the air if um if you're if you're doing what you're doing just to keep them on the sideline because he was at magical especially outside the ball last night\nHe's won three of his first for on the road last year we saw the chief start off by you know and then everybody caught up with them and they ended up losing in the wild card around in the NFL playoffs is there any reason to think the rest of the NFL\nIs going to catch up with Patrick ... homes is this potentially similar to last year were Andy Reid comes out the ... looks explosive they look unstoppable and then they're going to hit a road bump along the way kind of and everything doesn't go as well as you would have expected [noise] yeah\nI think you know I think the difference this year than in past years because certainly there is that aspect you know ... you know I mean it's sort of stood observation you've watched them play before and\nThe thing about Andy resolve it's just such a good job of stacking concepts making everything look identical\nAnd then through formations and through motions they end up especially given you so much I can do that you don't cover something they get explosive plays either in the running game or the passing a machine all the screens all the different things they do um\nThe issue is that is when somebody finally defended and somebody does a great job that you missed some of those throws\nCan you line up and either just say hey we're going to dictate to you weren't a lot of in\nIn heavy and more and play smash mouth which they've never been able to do I think the thing that sets them apart this year is when things break down they have a guy that will make a play 'em and and more importantly not just scramble for six yards\nBut I'm Talking about making unplanned cushion of both deep down field and you saw it happen a couple of times in those final draws\nI'm an hour from the left hand it throw but those are throws down on the sidelines of the tie it in four years scrambling around and that's a huge difference maker when you have them when you have 'em dead arise you have everything locked up your coverage is great\nOf your pressure is great and you can get a guy that can escape and still make a big play down the field that to me is what sets those two part and probably the reason that Andrew Read you know went away from Alex Smith and said this is going to be my guy\nHow sick or case keen on the on the mist throated to marry is Thomas late\nYeah you know interestingly enough I mean it was it was perfectly executed um I wasn't really happy with the ... Thomas's effort I'm ... and you know I look about drone I I'm going to go back and look at it but\nUm you know there'll be upset about\nThrow but just ... just like oh I Can't get it and I don't know a couple of steps make a stab at it\nYou know instead of letting go ... he's the guy that is totally scrutinized in Denver and I live in Denver and this is you know arguably the best receive are the most dynamic receiver they've ever had and people can't wait to ship them out of town\nSo you know I I don't know that it just it perceived lack of that or if it's you don't mind biased I because I hear so much ... talk you know my own local radio show in Denver about the merits Thomas it's really interesting but\nUm you know I'd like to go back and look and see how off that throw us I don't think it was nearly as overthrowing has\nA really wants to make it out to be but yeah he had a wide open you know you put that ball on a rail and or your your guy chance but certainly I think there's a ... if you go back and look there's at least in my estimation of proceed like after that I throw\nA march layer and you can follow him on Twitter at ... he does a lot of work for Fox Sports he calls game he's also like you said got a radio show in Denver what's the by going to be in Denver this morning when you're on your show\nThe Broncos fall to into coming off of five and eleven season so so close to winning against the chiefs\nIs this a uh the sun is going to come up in a tomorrow kind of setting a there are a lot of positives or is it a we're ... we're still stuck in the doldrums kind of feel what's the vibe of bronco nation this morning\nWas the vibe is there's ... there's a couple of different things going on um people don't like mass Joe says um and as good as the Broncos play they're going to look at this game saying\nUh you averaged over seven yards you carry why do you get in the second half away from running the ball you know why are you still pushing the ball down the field people will look at that people will be critical of him saying that was a winnable game we should have won and the difference will be coaching I thought he coached well\nI'm you know I thought the Broncos were definitely prepare especially on the side of the ball\nAnd um but people\nPeople will be after to me there'll be after dumb areas and there'll be after Vance Joseph that'll be\nThat'll be where people stand on on this particular law said you know you've got a home game against the chiefs and they'd been the hottest game of football and I know there's no moral victory but compared to the way you play to get good teams in the past\nWhich if you look at last year Philadelphia game the wood out a New England blew 'em out\nAmie bloom out scarcity blew them out so I look at this and they step in the right direction I Know there's no moral victors but you could take you know you take 'em\nYou know so to me ... ... this last and saying that they they played really well the key with upper echelon days I just don't think people in Denver gonna you know are going to kind of give him a whole pass on that\nWe're talking to mark ... we also ... local Denver radio I was like getting the pulse of a a a marketplace out there what is the vibe on the Rockies compared to the bronco so the Rockies obviously have a huge game going on today on the road or against the Chicago Cubs to see whether or not they're going to advance the play offs\nHow much time would be spent in general in Denver and your mind with sports fans there talking baseball versus talking reaction to uh to what happened last night in Monday Night football what's the pulse of the city of Denver this morning [noise]\n[noise] yeah well the Denver Broncos football drives the city um Iraqis people love to go to the Rockies the Rockies have a great following it it's on you know this time of year and obviously with this game gets cubbies a reason that has been absolutely awesome it\nUm you know all season long ... works out about him to to get a little national attention today a pitch it against a Lester but yeah I mean if you really look at it it's it's called ... or the ... in a wild card game\nWill probably be a twenty Broncos oh yeah\nYeah and it's just like the Denver does not care about college football they really don't care that they honestly they don't really care about much the thing that drives the ratings is growing because that's what drives ratings in Denver and and people are going to be talking about that last\nWhat else jumped out at you from the weekend that was in the NFL I Know there's a billion different games going on but as as the guy who pays a lot of attention to the league in general what were the other big stories now that we're a quarter of the way through the season what to you as been the biggest takeaway\nWell I mean I called the game I'm a Seattle versus Arizona and you know to see ... the way he's played and I know there's been a lot of controversy and people love talk of honor your contract although they never talked about that when the team's guys at three years left\nOn our contracts you know there's there's such a discrepancy there but um yeah I get it a fans root for laundry now than they are not for for guys in general but\nUm you know to see him get Carter of the sea of flip off the sidelines I'm here the frustration there the interesting thing about are all in that organization and Pete Carroll talk of the girl is\nYeah he's upset yeah he's frustrated with the business end of things but the guy wants to be the best player in his position in the history of the league\nAnd as Peter said who would not want to coach a guy like that like that's how passionate is so yeah there's you know I understand that frustration I understand the upset um you know unfortunate that he got caught on camera unfortunate that he did it um you know no excuses I'm sure at some point he'll probably regret it but\nTampa Bay buccaneers or two into and they take possession of the football eight days ago\nEight days ago less than eight days ago 'cause there was late at night and Monday Night football they take possession down thirty twenty seven to the Pittsburgh Steelers and Ryan Fitzpatrick has them in the midst of a big comeback they've come back from a thirty to ten deficit they now have\nThe ball with a chance to score and win that game in the process Ryan Fitzpatrick has thrown for over four hundred yards for a second straight a third straight game something it's never been done before\nIn the history of football three straight and completion and the books come back out on the field to have to point they go for the pilot thinking oh we're going to use our time outs will get the ball back Brian Fitzpatrick it doesn't happen\nAnd the Steelers escape with eight thirty to twenty seven when the bucks don't play that well they have three more turnovers than they do then the opponents do but they had the ball with three minutes left with a chance to win that game and arguably jerk cutter should've gone for it on force in tan\nAnd if he had who knows what might have been sued in that game All right let's fast forward to the next week it's a short week Seamus Winston comes back for his suspension and you go up to Chicago what happens you bench your starter at half\nTime and it was having an incredible game not really look riot fitzpatrick was nine of Eighteen for a hundred and twenty six yard what he's done something that has never happened before in the history of the NFL which is throat for for over four hundred yards in three straight games he has one bad half\nOn the road against the bears and frankly the story of this game was not Brian Fitzpatrick bad\nIt was the the Tampa Bay buccaneer defense allowing Mitch ... of all people to throw sticks touchdown passes so you bring in Jay miss Winston at the half for what reason I don't know when stint comes in and throws two interceptions\nAnd then you decide you know what we're ... Brian Fitzpatrick\nFrom this point forward he played one bad\nIn three and a half\nGames you bench if you bring in James ... who doesn't play well you've got to buy week why would you do this\nThis seems like a situation that has been thoroughly mishandled in the space of sixty three minutes the box that go on from undefeated and an off into juggernaut the likes of which we have not seen ever before in the history of the NFL\nTo a team that is going and handing the reigns back to James went that now I think this is not a decision that's being made for football reasons\nI think this is a financial decision the boxer trying to figure out whether they can justify paying James Winston twenty million dollars a year and picking up his ... year option\nThey picked up the option but it's only guaranteed ... Jamison went than is injured and not able to go elsewhere so I don't understand this decision at all\nMaybe the idea is hey we're going to play the falcons in two weeks and the falcons are really bad and so every quarterback looks good against them because you can put up so many yards passing like we just saw Andy Dalton do like we just saw\nDrew Brees do and maybe the idea is oh we're going to hand the reigns back to Jamieson he's gonna throw three or four touchdown passes and he's going to save us but on the road against Atlanta's seems like a really strange decision to hand the reigns back to the gym is particularly when the reason he's been suspense\nIt is because of sexual assault\nThis entire thing I Believe was bungled by dark cutter and the Tampa Bay buccaneers I'm surprised that not a bigger cut topic of conversation\nThat James Winston suddenly gets the job back and Ryan Fitzpatrick get the best I think the way this was handled is a mess especially now because James Winston has come in and not look good\nYou got to let Brian Fitzpatrick play the rest of the game if he was bad maybe then you decided to go back to James but after James through two interceptions doesn't make sense final our next\nOut kick their coverage with clay thriving\nEverybody's got to do list drop off the dry cleaning pick up some milk here's an idea what's that save hundreds of dollars on car insurance\nAnd a good thing is you don't have to drop off or pick up anything oh you have to do is go to guy go dot com and in Fifteen minutes you could be saving Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance extra money in your pocket it just may be the most rewarding too do you do today\nI'm Jay foreigner CEO of Quicken Loans America's premier home purchase wonder we've created a new way to protect you from unpredictable interest rates are exclusive rate shield approval first we lock your interest rate for up to Ninety Days then if rates go up your rates days locked buddy of rates go down your rate drops either way you win\nCall us today at eight hundred quicken or go to rocket mortgage dot com\nRacial approval only about on certain three year fixed rate loan scoff across the British and conditions people having liquor licensing office he thinks animal is number three thirty initial conditions are exclusion\n[noise] having a tough time in the pike this morning and he's not a ... than in Framingham all the way to root sixteen and with you more than four Ninety five is a price in the median strip this prior to the turnpike and slow from one night in Milford to that point\nThis or put his ... by mothers against drunk driving mothers against drunk driving support victims of drunk driving drunk driving an underage drinking at no charge call our twenty four hour victim helpline at eight seven seven mad help or visit mad dot org that's an A.

luck making good friends over there you're European God we had a lot of fun and the atmosphere there I'm not kidding and it was by far the wording that I've ever been to I mean so if there's nothing like it I mean it was incredible\nI don't think of France or certainly the Paris area as a big golfing community where no one wants to stay like how did you get the LA I'm just kind of curious in general because you think a lot of times\nPeople think about Scotland they think about England if you're going to talk about European golf courses I've never thought about golf courses in France as much what what was the situation like\nThe court right outside of her sons which I guess just south of a pair for wasn't like in the near where it was like thirty forty minutes away from her themselves and I mean we stayed in little they're being being kind of course it was a pretty easy to me right in there\nSo what's the vibe like I've never been to a Ryder Cup\nWas the vibe like on the golf course in general and what would your typical day be would you like scout out one whole stand and watch things there all day or did you rotate around the course quite a bit what was your what was your preferred viewing strategy\nYeah we we kinda just go from whole whole because he didn't really by group today and there's ten thousand people there so if you're trying to follow somebody it's gonna be tough getting shot because there's just way way people following you know the only five groups at a time when we would go a\nYou know jump from whole the whole so we go to you know rather than watch it when it was nice because around on the green there was really really got a good downhill using you could go to a spot but my favorite by which is actually where I was when you got me on friday\nWhen it was a part three and a lot of action there\nIn a ... that whole decided a lotta matching throughout the week\nSo why would you not telling me that you are going to the Ryder Cup\nI told I told them he like a week and a half ago 'cause I don't have a phone number email yet and I'd\nLike you you well first of all my email address is public it's clay Travis ... dot com bust them daily okay where's daddy daddy gee you are told that do is go into the Ryder Cup and you don't think you need to tell me that he's going to the Ryder Cup\nI don't know you I'm On my phone is like yours clay we get so many text about different things and different people on the show I paid attention to the dates that he needed off I didn't pay attention to where he was going until the day before we got on the air which is why I broken on friday and told you that he was there\nYeah well look I mean you came into the G chat which we have up 'cause we got a bunch of different studios we've got Nashville we got to LA we've got people moving around all different parts of places and you came in and you said I'm going to be out Thursday Friday Monday you put that in the G chat and I was like okay it seems to me that you would add on oh and I'm also going to the Ryder Cup\nMurder napping and I were going to be out and I was going somewhere really value on it you know looking\nBack on it maybe you tell the guy who show you're going to be on that you're going to one of the biggest sporting events of the year overseas in Paris like maybe that's just something to mention\nIt wasn't fun experience no getting to hop on the show on friday a need to talk with you though\nI I Am impressed that you answered the phone on the face time and that was a that was impressive that ah that you did that we could have planned it out\nIt had to had anybody decide like the number of details that I Am told that don't matter at all is like Ninety nine percent of my life and people tell me things that don't matter at all they don't impact me in any way and they feel like I Need to know and then this is actually a positive story that would've been cool for somebody to share\nAnd we could have talked about on the show in advance\nBut it wouldn't have been as humorous I think you've made for better radio on friday morning because you truly were surprised on the air\nAnd in listening back to that veto and the guys in the production studios in the back they made an on air promo that immediately because they thought it was so funny so if we had planned it out it probably would have been you know not not as exciting as you're getting in the face time from doubling the course\nYeah I probably would have us Heineken nothing that point I Would think\nYeah that's probably true too I I Would have wished you would have been even drunk or to be honest alright so uh one thing we need to do by the way things up and we're glad to have you back we got to cut your paycheck if you're gonna fly to afford to fly to Europe and go to the Ryder Cup or we're paying your way too much money I got to say this\nOr this at ... Iran and Patrick my home's comparison\nHas got me this guy or we certain that that my homes is not co Joe's illegitimate son do we know who actually is Patrick mom's father because we need to put together here's a here's a homework assignment for you Danny gee we need to put together a mix of Patrick ... homes and add ... Iran for tomorrow's show\nAnd play those guys talking and you convince me that those guys are not in some way really [laughter]\nNo no we don't wait until tomorrow I can do that before the hour is over\nWell do it it will do a good job of it if you got to the final segment of the show we'll do it we're going to talk to Petraeus about a day 'cause I'll tell you this right now if you weren't going to take an air boat tour in Louisiana swamp\nAnd you roll up and there were a father and a son who were in charge of the Arab do you ever done those air boat chores boat is phenomenal if you haven't ever gotten on an air boat like old school you know they have the big or they go through the swamps and everything else I think are they are they now outlawed some places like in the Everglades\nI Know that there have been some laws passed in certain states because of how they had been flipping over and there were some ... ...\nOh I didn't know that part out is fun I thought they were just really loud and bad for the environment so I think they might have banned some of them in the Everglades but the air boat tour is phenomenal like if you've ever been to Louisiana you can go out in the swamps\nThey have banned them in Louisiana they have a band anything and Louisiana you can do like literally they have drive up decker he stands where they just put you know what you don't ...\nI'm not kidding about this you know how they legally allowed there to be drive up liquor decorate fans in Louisiana\nThey put a piece of tape over the straw and that classifies as a closed container and Louise I'm not even making this on if you're driving around in Louisiana in a cop pulls you over\nAnd you have a liquor drink ... and like the cup holder beside you it is considered to be a closed container it's not an open container\nIf there is a piece of tape that covers your straw dive ... below like rest of the country or like there's no way that's no that's true so they definitely have air boat tours and you get outside of New Orleans just a little bit\nAnd this is exactly what everybody who drives an air boats sounds sounds like that's where the dad and the sun you

stole a screeching stop\nThe Airbus guile hop out of his chair he'll leaned over in the Arab vote and he'll just grab an alligator and pull it in the boat so you can hold it I Swear to God this happens on every air boat tour of ever been on\nThey just stopped the boat their boat captain leans over grabs an alligator not like a ten foot alligator obviously but like I don't know three or four

this uh this website address and I said hey\nGo by three shirts for me I don't want to be involved in it at all you pick 'em out you go do it you could use to promote clay if you do\nSo I feel like uh I I'm just dead so I appreciate your concern\nYeah that's okay just pick a deep breath yeah all out of ... we don't have that problem on the west coast unless you're watching a night game in Hawaii\nYes what did you do by the way cow Oregon face for watcher\nWell you know what I was at Penn State Ohio State game and I didn't get that was the only really late night for me to I didn't get home to like one we walked back my wife was so mad\nWhen you were a you appreciate this like we finish the game so we get outside and you know how it is when a college football or an NFL game in like at the last minute nobody leaves the stadium early so there's like a hundred and Fifteen thousand people and there's a bus we're supposed to take back\nAnd so I get out to where the bus line is and I'm like oh my God this bus line is just I mean there's hundreds and hundreds of people waiting to get on the bus to take us back to the hotel so\nWe're at the very back of the line and I said to my wife I'm just I'm Sorry it's one am I'm not going to stand here and wait on this bus let's just walk back so I get out my phone and I'm like it's not that far of a walk back to our hotel\nAnd so I didn't realize you've ... you've done a game of ... they probably before have you ever\nOh man so it's in the middle of nowhere Idaho I Swear to God we started to walk back and um and there's this guy who's directing traffic and were like hey what's the best way to get back\nTo our hotel and he's like you go down that road there and he's pointing down the side and he's like\nAnd it's not a paved road but you have to beat it it's literally pitch black it's one am but he's like it's a nice short cut and I'm like I'm not going off of paved road in the middle of nowhere Pennsylvania to walk back to our hotel so the next thing that happens is we're walking on his side of an interstate\nAnd my wife's like this is the worst decision you've ever made you know like for the I'm just she just wearing me out for like the whole walk back hold a mile and a half walk back to the hotel we do beat back the uh the the buses and everything else but I'm Still hearing about the stupidity of my decision to walk back because\nIt's one thing if you make a bad decision\nIf you're a man you'd probably get over the bad decision I'll be hearing about the decision to walk back for the next decade or leaving football games for my wife right because women seem to agree\nTo marinate in bad decisions that their husbands may\nI disagree first of all yes you're right you're wife will never let you forget it if she didn't like it she's gonna wear you out and that's what wives do and that's what happens you get worn out for a living\nGood ... good question here well no I can I just\nCannot just please for a moment yes\nIt's always better to walk back after a game ... broadcaster if there is a mile or two miles it's better to walk I don't care if it's on an interstate or the wilds of Pennsylvania in the wintertime you gotta walk back you were right\nYou paint the bus yelled to crush the bus we will fight yeah the same\nThing happens in Austin, Texas even if you try to escape with the police escort you're not going anywhere there's too much traffic there's too much humanity they don't leave the game early you walk back you beat everybody back you're drinking before everybody it's only like a mile and a half you can do that\nI I'm with you I knew she was wrong\nYou tell your wife she's a lovely lady she's very smart but she's wrong\nDo you agree in general that wives root against their husbands\nIf it's about being in a in a disagreement\nLike actually they're likely to be right if she thought that you can do that yeah right\nIf there's a fifty fifty decision and a couple has to make a decision and the husband picks one side\nThe wife will root against the good outcome so that she can be right I don't think men do that as much like if it's a fifty fifty decision\nI don't root for things to go badly so that I can tell my wife oh this went poorly I feel like every man who's out there right now who is married\nIs like yeah my wife to if we have a fifty fifty decision to make and I don't take her decision she ... like if you're waiting in line at the airport not even that serious of a thing and you're like hey I think we should go to the line on the left here\nI think your wife would rather stand in line for ten minutes extra just so she can say at the end of the line you know we should have gone to the right side\nI think he's rooting for things to be worse so she can be right this is if there's a big issue at all marriages women don't do that I don't think men do it women have like they have like a rhinoceros memories I think is right Nasir skin elephant skin whatever it is they remember everything and they root against you and fifty fifty things just so they can be like hey you know what I was right\nWell I think you are on one today but\nI think it in your case because of your pompous attitude your wife probably really relishes when you're wrong as well you're you're you are so overly coughing does that make sense\nNo I can I can definitely see that\nLike when you said last week like I might go to bed at Penn State Ohio State game when literally\nPeople plan trips like that two years in advance that was the most sneaky humble brag I've ever heard it was awesome\nI don't think that's I here's my thing\nI don't like having definitive plans in life because things might arise for instance we got in the uh on our trip back we flew up for one day we flew into Pittsburgh rented a car drove independence day right\nOut on the way back we got stuck for four hours in the airport because we were not able to to leave you know the plane was something is not working some light didn't come on so they have to fly in a new plane from Baltimore by the way when you're at the airport in in Pennsylvania and they're like\nEverything's fine we just have to fly in a new plane from Baltimore everything is not fine All right so if that had\nOn the flight up I Would have just been like okay we're canceling the trip we're going to turn around and drive back so when I feel like when you're doing like a day trip like that I'm always flexible and willing at the last moment to be like okay we're not going to do this I'll just go back to my house and watch it on television\nI just say most people do not operate like that they're committed all the way through and they just deal with it but you are a man of means and you have\nYour math Lutz no I was on a southwest flight to Pittsburgh it's not like I was flying in on a private jet let's be honest I was on it now I was\nThe way I saw Randy Johnson on a southwest flight that doesn't mean anything\nOh that's a tough race Randy Johnson long legs not having any first class that's a tough tough break for re without offering\nHe was wearing wrangler is and he's mean either want to talk to anybody it was it was rough on him I\nStill think one of the all time great highlights in the history of baseball was when he threw that pitch and killed that bird\nThat really upset him though but you're right I mean on believable [laughter] see those feathers fly to know that one bird I knew what hit him and die instantly to think about the actual timing of the moment [noise] under God have and\nIt is an amazing moment in the history of sports but it did really upset Randy Johnson is a gentle man and did not want to kill that bird Juno since we're just\nSaying random things that I work with a director at Fox a he's a great guy out of work on his crew anymore Mitch Reagan and he bought meal hurt the very famous drummers drum set from rush\nAnd he he had it and then Randy Johnson bought it from him and they presented it to Randy Johnson who likes to play the drums\nI was wondering ...\nSee where that connection was going to come in and I was thinking maybe that he like accidentally killed the bird when he was delivering the drum set or something like that I could watch that clip over and over again of the bird just exploding I mean the odds of that happening I Can't believe I mean I almost never happened before but what what are the odds\nOf it happening like that\nOh and also being a fastball like it wasn't like it was a ... ball pitcher you know the bird might have survived that way but to take that Randy Johnson fastball at like ten feet away was ... when John ... who refused a bad against Randy Johnson back in the all star game years ago after Randy Johnson through one behind his head\nI have never heard that bit of baseball lore but this year it is accurate ... everybody's wrapped up and the Dodgers celebration and winning man out west for the six straight year\nWhat a thank you uh where would you rank the enthusiasm meter because we we talked about the rams before they played on Thursday night with you last week and now they're I think alongside the chiefs the unquestioned best two teams in the NFL you got LeBron about to start with the Lakers\nYou've got the rams that the best team in the NFL the chargers most people aren't aware they still play in Los Angeles but I'm told that they are actually a franchise playing football in Los Angeles and you've got the Dodgers how would you rate the LA fan market enthusiasm for those those events going on right now\nWell when the Dodgers I mean it's cool to feel abroad and a Laker uniform but preseason MBA is pre season MBA the Dodgers in the playoffs rarely do fizzle\nA very very uh explosively\nWhere when that happens whether it's good or bad if they're winning or losing people live and die with every pitch they just do that the city that's always been the city of that\n[noise] [noise] hello\nWhat is what we're borough what do you do it just hitting random ... why does this always habit with you Petro the guys just fall asleep in the studio did you hear that\nRandom like screaming thing in the background there the ad that started to come on\nI heard nothing while", "year": "2018", "show_name": "FOX Sports Radio", "city": "Newton", "day": "02"}
