was a recording saying he was out of the coverage area\nAll right so you are he leave out I'll dial their coverage there and let you get that number dialed in All right yeah I Will ah no one right now no one right now it's like you know what I really want to hear clay do break down the giants versus the eagles oh you've got potentially a famed catch tiger killer coming on the show or the other things going on\nIs that Thursday Night Football which is going to err on Fox by the way like\nThese buttons\nYeah I thought that I could push the buttons um I was a\nYou know the thing is so see on the handset that's where I dollar gas and then I hang it up and it goes to this phone box on the phone box which goes live on the air there's also numbers so to get a little alive call to dial live I'm dialing on the box but it's not\nWorking so I'm not sure how this works for a live dial\nYou the the amount of incompetence on\nHow they're competent clay that's never been done on our network before so how would any of us know how that goes\n... that's the mom to be it would seem to me that someone at some point in time should have thought to themselves hey what would happen if we tried to dial somebody live on the air and try to\nOur inability to both place and received phone calls on this show is dubbed there are you there but can you dial India just give me the number of how many people on this show does it take to dial\nIt it's not a problem to dial it it's a it's a problem to dial it live as we're speaking on the air I can do it but you're not going to hear me doing it is that okay\nI don't know when we talk about the only talk about the giants and the eagles [laughter] this is just got to be such a downer we've gone from have are going to be talking to a tiger a hunter the greatest dire hunter in the world to look we got in the NFC game it's a really big even know what I'm gonna do I'm going to go to break we there there's a lot of drama starting off the show here\nCoup is already hung up and probably offended like the entire might be in the middle of an international incident now and if there's ever a tiger loose in America and we need a famed tiger assassin he might not come here now because we somehow provoke an international incident by refusing to take the tiger killers phone call we will find out what's going to happen here\nThis is why you can't miss out ... I don't have any idea what's going to have it on the show you don't have any idea what's going to happen on the show or by the way you play tonight\nThe play tonight is not to touch either the eagles I don't think for the giants if I had to bet on one side of the other I think I Would take the giants a massive game actually in the NFC because everybody is awful\nEverybody right now in the NFC East is awful this looks like a division that can be one within eight and eight or nine and seven maybe even seven and nine record the giants are sitting at one in four\nHotel back um juniors given all sorts of different quotes about how awful Eli Manning is despite the fact that statistically Eli Manning is having one of the best seasons of his career\nThey just lost on a freaking sixty three yard field goal by gram going oh down in Carolina\nThey right now or the giants are staring squarely in the face a one in five star despite the fact that everybody seemed to be excited about their team they are getting rid of their last Sacco who hasn't been able to block anybody since they drafted him\nThey are are dealing with a ... a question of whether or not they can integrate say going Barclay and though Dale back I'm a junior end of the same office and actually be successful they just scored over thirty points for the first time in a couple of years\nAnd then he got the eagles coming to town who are dealing with the fact that a a giant is now out for the season and they don't really have a proven running back\nThey have Carson winds coming back from an injury they are coming off to straight losses all of the talk about how much better the eagles were going to be with Carson when then they were with Nicole's remember they started to win one\nAh or is it one and one I Can't even remember they lost I guess it was a week to to the uh to the Tampa Bay buccaneers and then they brought back Carson wins it felt like kind of a panic overreaction\nAnd since they brought back Carson and when they have gone one and two\nSo he's come back he's only won one game that only victory was against the colds I Believe and then he lost it over time against the titans and then last weekend or the eagle scout whipped by the Vikings so the eagles even though they're defending Super Bowl champs are sitting at two and three\nAnd if the giants could rise up and beat them we're talking about two two and four teams All right well we got going on there I talk in the background what do we have\nSo this is what it sounds like when we do his cell phone right now okay you got to do the job or any ... to be kidding me five\n[laughter] oh man I Will do it again it was it's the same recording and has cheesy music and somebody with a thick accent saying that [noise] there goes\nMy number one on them [laughter]\nThat's really happy music or get when you fall in in the entire Miller [noise] ah [noise] All right well we will continue to pursue\nWhat a what a downer that is we will continue to pursue ...\nAli Khan ...

Thompson to to come and are enjoying the er the Lakers also I Believe I'm correct in this the guys at odd sharks had a had Anthony Davis\nFavor I think to join the Lakers in the off season right he's an unrestricted free agent at the end of the season in my in my correct in that\nAnd uh and that that he was favored to join the Lakers as well so uh the off season NBA free agent drama is going to be a much bigger story I Believe that anything that's going on on the court this year even though I Know that LeBron James will be covered with bated breath because he's in LA\nUh and because everybody everything that LeBron does is is an obsession\nAnd I already know because we talked about the gambling on the warriors and the Lakers game last night I don't even know did did did full warriors team play\nLast night in LA because cousin Sal who is on a walk it in with me\nSaid last year his son wanted to go see Steph Curry play and so he took him to a preseason game and then both staff and dream on green set out the entire game so I Know in the NBA pre season it's a lot like anybody else's pre season you might not actually get to see the stars when you pay full price for a ticket\nEverybody played I Believe it's a dream on yeah the uh who to the Lakers open with a poor to open up in Portland condo Wednesday\nLike that is kind of a a crazy thing wouldn't you think\nThat the NBA would've wanted to have the first game of the Lakers season take place and have as big as massive of an event as they possibly could kind of surprising to me that we don't have a major signature game in staple Center for labor law bronze LA debut on the very night that the season opens\nAnd that they go on the road against the timber wolves nobody cares about the temple or not even people in Portland\nBy the way really quick did you see the thirty four foot shot that LeBron's sunk right as time was expiring\nGoing into the half no I didn't know amazing I Know it's just pre season in practice but he put on quite a show for the Seventeen minutes we put\nBill abroad fever is out of control already in LA drew Martin joins us now he's that drew Martin bet he works at sports book review dot com I always say\nSports book review good place to go to check and make sure you get the best possible law or to take advantage of whatever the gambling situation is it can make a big difference whether you get the half point or you don't get that point and vice versa sometimes there's point differences a legitimate point differences\nIn a in the the range of available gambling options in Vegas that offshore let me bring Andrew ... drew tonight\nThursday Night Football the uh the eagles going on the road against the giants the entirety of the NFC East has been a mess so far nobody has a winning record in that division right now any early read on how you would play Thursday Night Football in the NFL\nYou know clay I actually you were just talking about lying movement and one thing with the NFL betting markets that I Want to point out is a Chris the Costa Rican international sports book book maker to the American facing better\nActually just moved to two and a half on this game meaning they don't want to take any more big bets on the New York giants so I think that's like a a leading indicator here of which way the markets pushing you know this is a short week for both teams\nThe home team on a Thursday night has been absolutely money and that has a lot to do with this move that I was just talking about also Philadelphia one in four against the number year to date loss for street that you know their their backers of loss for straight so I think all things really point to the home team here and I I like the New York giants are clay\nAll right so the other Thursday I did it seems on friday at the top twenty five game and I'm kinda curious a little bit about this because I think they've been under the radar remember South Florida now has Charlie Strong former Texas coach as their coach they go on the road against holds a\nBut they are five and ... so my question for you drew is just this how good is South Florida are they I mean I felt like nobody is even paying attention to them or they just played a hundred point game against UMass of all people are but somehow South Florida has found a way look they'd be George attack they beat Illinois are they any good at that friday night game were paying attention to\nOh yeah I I think they're actually very good you know the south these these Florida schools like USF UCF I think a lot of people are under rating them you know the type of ... the caliber of athlete that they're able to get they recruit a lot of a power five teams so\nYeah that went against Georgia Tech is what really kind of opened my eyes to this USF team they can move the ball up and down the field\nTulsa the fence on the other hand uh you you know it's not terrible but I think they're going to have a long day the only way I Would look as a delay here with the bulls\nWe get too early uh the big games or at least in the big twelve Texas Tech is going on the road again TCU tonight at the Thursday night game and then friday Arizona and Utah play both of those games may surprise people any big game play or anything you like about either of those\nUh you know TCU their quarterback Robinson should be back he should play quarterback in ah Texas Tech one thing to to know going forward with them this is the first of three straight games they're going to be playing a team off of a by TCU off by\nA tonight so I I Do like TCU here I think they just kinda got me more Jimmy's in Joe's as far as being able to to to win by more than a touchdown um as far as the it again I I I'm not really involved in that one so I I don't want to get out any uh you know information to your listeners that uh that I'm not\nToo confident in three top twenty five games uh three top twenty five games going on in a and all of them have a lot of significance I'm curious whether you like any of these to play admit they will be the signature ah attention games on Saturday\nGeorgia going on the road against the LSU they are around us seven and a half or eight point favorite depend on where you look\nWashington going on the road against Oregon the huskies are three point favorite Oregon\nThis will be a huge massive game of Oregon had not blown that lead against Stanford and the final top twenty five game Wisconsin going up against the Michigan Michigan moving all the way out to an eight or eight and a half point favorite in this one Wisconsin born one Michigan five and a one this is an elimination game\nOr for both teams in terms of uh trying to compete to make the play off for sure of those three any that you particularly like\nYou know I'd probably go out to Eugene Washington Oregon last two years Washington is really dominated the series I mean as far as points go a hundred and eight only twenty four to Oregon but this year clay\nWashington yeah there are five and won but only two and four against the number in one of those winds was against the Utah a couple of weeks ago I was involved in that that was a lot closer of a game than the final score indicates I think that there's kind of a lot wrong with this Washington Huskies team\nAnd a ... you know playing Oregon off of a by with organs quarterback Herbert either next level guy eighth and the nation and pass or rating in this particular matchup strength for strength in Washington past defense only let up three passing touched down here to date for Oregon passing off and\nThere are over ten yards per attempt and off of a by I really like Oregon the home dog here in Wisconsin Michigan that the big one in the Big Ten\nThis one bought up we were just talking numbers bought up from six to eight and a half like you just said Wisconsin lit up over five hundred yards Nebraska just last week that's not going to fare well this week in Wisconsin defense only return for starters from last year\nPlus a bunch of injuries on that side of the bark ball going up against shape Paterson who almost Seventy percent completion percentage in only three picks this year\nMichigan look really good last week against Maryland I actually took a loss and that but learn from it Wisconsin foreign one straight up only one in four ATF year to ... year to date against division one opponents I don't think they cover here I like Michigan to win by more than a touchdown\nWhat other games are on the horizon that you care about things that are big plays for you on the college football slate coming up as we move in starting tonight and into the weekend\n... ... we talked a as far as like this but last week with Georgia southern came in I'm going back to the wealth tonight they're that they're playing against Texas state Texas state is one of the top ten worst teams and all of the division one football going up against Georgia southern who it is a short weak and none of the road teams something I don't like\nAnd I saw this article in the wall Street Journal a yesterday morning right after I finished the show I was sitting down to read the wall Street Journal and I said my God it's not just in my intuition\nIf I were a coach I Would be doing this all the time and it's the way by the way that Sean McVeigh who might be the smartest coach in the NFL right now ended his game against the Seattle Seahawks this past Sunday\nWith a force than one in his own territory what did he do\nHe got quarterback Jared ... to sneak the ball and they won the game and they rent it out and the rams are are still perfect partly because of it but that more than one conversion was not actually that much of a surprise just an unbelievable staffer you guys\nThis year the quarterbacks and he has been attempted on third and one or force in one forty four times alright forty four times in NFL team has decided to run the quarterback snake on third in one or for than one [noise]\n... how many out of forty four I'm going to pull you guys how many out of forty four times has the third and one or Fort than one quarter back snake been successful all start with you Danny gee\nI'm going to say only to have not worked\nAll right what about you or what about you or do\nI say a hundred percent a hundred percent right do what you got eighty eight percent\nEighty eight percent and Eddie Garcia what have you got well let's go Ninety five percent all\nRight so you guys are all with me here or you just guessing a high percentage because you know that it's going to confirmed my thought or do you also does anybody out there believe that the quarterback sneak are you guys with me do you believe that it's under\nUtilized as a method to convert first out\nYeah because we even saw skinny legs Jared golf pull it off at the end of that game so you know what we know it works with every quarterback yeah\nEverybody's on my side here this this blew my mind when you consider how difficult it is in general to sometimes convert on third in one or Fort than one you got it right Danny gee forty two and also you did Edie Edie as well forty two out of forty four times the quarterback sneak has been affected\nAnd overall since two thousand Thirteen quarterback snakes have a success rate of eighty five percent and on all other plays that non quarterback snakes they have just a sixty five percent conversion rate so if you are a coach\nThe quarterback sneak is more reliable than basically everything else you could do and it's interesting\nPanthers coach Ron Rivera called sneaks a twenty seven percent of its short you're already in place and meanwhile Pete Carroll away does it two percent of the time and Jason Garrett and Mike mccarthy almost never run quarterback snakes\nAnd so my thought is in general rod Rivera runs it and it's almost always successful for the Carolina Panthers Marvin Lewis does it with Andy Dalton or Doug Peterson does it with the eagles and he's never failed\nTo convert a fourth down or a third down on a quarterback sneak ballot jak obviously does at a time because a Brady has been so successful with it horrible and Baltimore does it with a with Joe Flaco\nUm to me and what's crazy also is Jason Garrett when he does use jak the quarterback snake he gets a first down a hundred percent of the time\nSo when I look at this data\nWhy do you think that coaches who presumably would have access to this data to don't decide to quarterback sneak more often I think it's because they feel like it doesn't look good\nI feel like much of coaching is about like many jobs trying to look good for everybody else who does your job you know tennis players when they hit the net and they get a point there like raise their racket and they apologize for it I think the quarterback sneak is the equivalent to that for coaches\nThey feel like we spent so much time prepping for plays over the weekend I felt bad running this play they all should be doing it a lot more than they are when we return top of our two will dive into Thursday Night Football\nWith the giants hosting the eagles who's

Jimmy ... for the first time since demanded to be treated he reportedly challenged she lays ... even front office members jury fragile said after he was just the competitive\nThe two most successful shows and all of sports talk radio right now or Dan Patrick and calling coward\nDo you think that damp all at first of all day and Patrick and call a gallery probably wouldn't have a tiger killer on the air so clearly I'm not able to leading the most successful people in our business\nBut do you think they would give way to get ... on the line Paul's listening right now we need them to call in how damned Patrick handled this what Dan Patrick praises staff\nWhat do you say you know what you guys have done an incredible job or Seventy five percent of the way what Nick Saban let's think about you know if Nick Saban worried my shoes what am I the way you know weeks overdrive on this two minute drive we didn't get a touchdown\nOr certainly a field goal because Alabama can't make field goals that we didn't actually win the game but we drove it down into a first and goal situation before we through an interception I think coach saving we deserve a little bit of credit for house almost successful we work because that's what you're arguing right\nWhat are they all went you pick up against for years is that you're on an early morning time slot which is great for east coast because\nSix to nine that's cool and we get good guest in that last hour especially from the east coast and we and we've been lucky enough to have some really good people wake up early on the west coast even but like yesterday you were complaining about Drew Brees Drew Brees doesn't want to wake up at you know having\nHeavens forbid what what time is it were were Jews I wouldn't\nHave been the same time zone as me he's in New Orleans it's five AM\nPuts a year's liberty liberty like that is not going to wake up at that time to do radio we know this but\nWell let me also add this our other disadvantage is that Fox Sports is primarily a west coast based organization yeah so for instance everybody who I Know at Fox Sports\nOther than like went lock almost nobody is willing to Joel ... sometimes is willing to wake up that early petras obviously will\nAre there are limited guys and those are all in the third our when it becomes the five AM hour on the west coast the challenges ESPN is for instance in the east coast based news organization\nSo everybody that they have who's in the New Yorker the Bristol, Connecticut area or whatever else they are running on in the east coast clock Fox is much more likely to be running on a west coast clock so like we we tried to get Jay Glazer scheduled to be a weekly gas\nAnd it was like scheduling Glazer was like trying to schedule the president of the United states oh yeah he almost impossible\nTo review wiser he would not wake up at that time he said I don't blame him look if I Lived\nOn the west coast I Am not a morning guy despite the fact that I now get up early in the morning and do the show I Would never like I used to get\nI remember like before me they had that show Fox Sports day break on\nAnd I was because everybody has my cell phone number I Would get tax message and they'd be like hey can you get up at six Fifteen and do Fox Sports day break and I'll be like are you kidding me the answer is no if you want to tape the night before midnight you know I'll tape with you at midnight and zero percent chance I'm actually going to come on no way at all well first\nTime in the history of this show it would have actually been better if we were on earlier because he doesn't take his phone into the field or if he does he's out of range which is what the problem has been the past two mornings so I Hope we can get them when he comes back to camp and that's what I'm going to keep effort in\nOne time is it what what what did you find out wars is twelve and a half hours ahead of us ... how are they a half hour ahead of us it's weird yeah it's a they have a half hour so it's twelve and a half hours\nWell there's no way then they like that that trying to explain first of all most people don't understand how time zone to work the other challenge that we have is we're dealing in like three different time zone simultaneously so I'm not you\nYou are in the western time zones Pacific time zone then oftentimes very many of our guests are in the east coast time zones so we just do what I just decided on the show is we're always on the east coast time in general all our paperwork who confused\nAnd all the emails and paperwork they give us here in the west coast studios all on central time for some reason\nSo as as where I Am I guess yeah that's a mess but also with my TV show I'm On Pacific time with the television show so I wake up to do east coast radio and then I Do after noon Pacific TV I never have any idea what time it is but the fact that they are twelve and a half hours different than us\nThere's no way that this tiger killers going to understand that so we'll see we'll see what ends up happening Paul pass by that uses your Ninety ... with us\nYeah he's with us here All right all\nRight so here's where I've been listening this I'd say right now is the prime time to call the tiger hunter because they just got done a long day at work they probably had happy hour at some type of local establishment celebrating their day you got to get 'em now before it has a couple of opposite I'm\nPaul what are you ... or by the way Dan Patrick so what do you think the uh odds of us are breaking the news about him killing the man eating tiger would be and how unbelievable would it be if we got the exclusive first interview in the wake of the tiger being killed and everybody had to a site\nUs as the source for the news worldwide because it's a worldwide story world school actually if\nI could speak for me I mean tell us in our producer I Want to break there is to I Want to back to an e G here I think it it Ninety percent of the job should get a hold of it uh Indian tiger killer a twelve hour time zone that that makes a day that takes them our\nInternational phone calls are always tough [noise]\nCall in which is big but it's damn Patrick says paint just show me the baby what Dan point is that you know if you go when your wife is giving birth until the baby's here the the obstetrician indoor job hurt his job you know what I'm\nSaying who is on the person you guys have ever had the book it's a damn Patrick show is there something about a year like this guy drove us insane this woman I I don't know I'm just kinda curious\nUm boy that's a tough one I mean Michael Jordan is still the well you know we're still trying to get Michael Jordan on the show I'm ... years where Bob Knight would not talk to anybody ESPN we convince Bobby Knight\nOr the day before his first game at Texas Tech to come on the damn Patrick show and the reason we convince them is because we're going to have in mind ... Ohio State football with both ... and Bob and I said oh hell yeah I'll do that and that's how bad and I started returning to ESPN that was just one of those where I never thought we'd get them\nOh wow no that's pretty awesome do you think we're going to get the tiger guy on\nYeah but I think there's got to be a twenty four hour watch I think oh you know passes you can't leave the base you know the old military term\nUh I think so it's got to be near the phone at all I Do at the energy but you better get coffee and\nYeah we got to be on high alert and and the the things for the call Paul who are you guys have today under their Patrick you\nOh you know I'm so lot tire killer store\n[laughter] a follow Dan Patrick's show obviously and Paul paths that ball paths to on a Twitter\nI'm I Am cautiously optimistic are going to get the tiger killer on\nA I Am also a little bit nervous based on groups report in our one that his accent\nIs going to be so substantial that none of us are going to have any idea what he's saying\nYeah the the other problem that I ran into yesterday is agents started telling me in winning gave me the hard know until I followed up the next hour in talk to somebody else he said no he gets paid to not do media and so that's when I was texting you yesterday\nYeah what was my response where did I tell you\nYou said make sure he knows that a movie is going to come out of this and yeah yeah and I and I he\nDoes a good job on our show I'm not even kidding about this if the if the greatest tiger killer in India comes on and does an incredible job on our show talking about stocking the man eating tiger that's killed Thirteen people in India and all the different ways that they tried to get them I have a one hundred percent chance that someone will option that as a movie\nBecause it's such an unbelievable compelling story about the you know trying to track down this man eating tiger I mean I Would wait here's the easy\nQuestion would you either read a book or watch a movie that chronicled in great detail the pursuit\nOf a man eating tiger my answer is one billion percent yes I'm watching the man eating tiger movie or I'm reading the man eating\nTiger book zeroed out\nOh movie hundred percent\nYeah I mean think about this were a net flicks like a multi a multi episode trail I and we were on the trail of the killer tiger like I don't know why this isn't a documentary already to be honest and maybe it is maybe somebody's out there with cameras already would I Would definitely turn into a movie so I said look will make you a movie star\nSo ah anyway stay tuned never know when the tiger killers going emerged this is also a good example of why you should be signing up for the cash because lots of people out there right now listening to us\nThey're on their way to work they are going to hear twelve minutes with us they are going to hear ten minutes twenty two minutes whatever it is on your way to work and then you have no idea what else you're missing you might miss the tiger killer coming live on the show because I don't know when it's going to happen you know when it's\nGoing to happen I got no idea what's gonna happen next segment and I'm hosting the show or by the way next segment I Do have kind of an idea it's gonna be John rosy we're gonna break down the ... the as who's going to head to the world series

to the course night game Ann Arbor I expect a dramatic finish a one way or the other\nWay you think about the shape Paterson I mean we haven't really talked about it very much on these shows in week one because there was a lot of discussion about him coming into the season\nThen like you said Michigan kind of fell flat in the opener against Notre Dame and they've won I Believe five in a row sent this would be six in a row and I think he's got ten touchdowns two interceptions what kind of letter grade would you give shape Patterson so far the halfway point\nI think I'm a minus ... and maybe just the the one loss of Notre Dame will be will be the only reason why there's the minus there I think he's been the best\nPlay making quarterback probably the ... since he's come here and and increasingly impressed about his play making ability um I I think he's a really good athlete or you can tell there's a lot of ploys they're his ability to use his legs to buy time in the pocket I think it outside of the ... has been impressive\nSo I I think is his decision making has gotten better as a as the seasons go along as has come from the offices isn't as improve so I'm a I'm On board I've been very impressed I think it's interesting you think about the Big Ten in the a lot of attention on Haskins and mix or early so he is not the not the biggest name quarterback and the conference but you know if he wins on Saturday and if\nAnd find a way to Michigan State in East Lansing of the following week I'm into pretty big games in a row I mean I don't Wisconsin and then on the road from Michigan State if he finds a way to win both those games I think that the uh the national buzz surrounding him what will increase a lot here in the next the next ten days or so\nSpeaking of national bus I sit on my show yesterday and I can't even think of another good analogy in the world is sports\nFor about a hundred years if you were Red Sox fan it meant that you were basically they're red headed stepchild of the major league baseball you are certainly the ... much less in the rivalry shining bright white compared to the New York Yankees\nIf you are like a sixteen year old kid right now and there's probably some sixteen year old kids driving into school this morning with their parents are driving themselves in or whatever else who\nGrew up and they only know the Yankees Red Sox rivalry in their own experience as one that the red Sox owner in dominate\nThat's a pretty seismic shift you know we think about like over the jury jak three of baseball how long Red Sox fans were like the the week on during the typical little brother and\nNow they have become the big brother can you think very many even other sports analogy is like that we're now we've talked totally flipped it and in the wake of their win over the Yankees if you were talking to a kid maybe even a twenty year old now and you were saying hey\nWhich is the more dominant franchise in that Yankees Red Sox rivalry in your life they'd be like oh the red Sox by far\nRight and that's that's a fascinating inside and it was interesting actually I think it was a couple of nights ago I as a jet Fletcher a long time a base for baseball writer there in California tweeted that he said his son was\nGoing to root for the Yankees because the exact quote was that the red Sox won the world series so many more times in my life basically\nExactly what you just said that that's that's the prevailing opinion of of I guess neutral\nSports fans that are under the age of twenty that that's basically what it's because ... I think in Boston um I I saw I saw it started to turn a little bit even when I was in college there again early do thousands way before the red Sox won of course the patriots began to change it with their championship and the old one season\nAnd there was that time when basically in that decade all well and I guess the the Bruins wanted and and twenty eleven so there there was a span of time there and then the Celtics and want to run around that that was like oh wait I Believe it was\nUm like like off off for the teams that won it in like a two or three years span ah championships with which sort of changed fundamentally that\nThe the New England fatalist them around sports you know we're always going to lose and ones that are going to drop its changed fundamentally in Boston that used to winning and everything it seems\nAnd and but I think most point late in the in the rye were against the Yankees I I think you might say that towards the end of the time when when the giants and Dodgers were both playing in New York\nGiants won championships and the Dodgers really had and then of course they moved to LA and it flips and and the giants had not one in San Francisco until twenty cents so that that is a historic rivalry in in baseball certainly that that maybe is the one girl you would say but you're right it's almost\nWithout precedent that it would change that abruptly and and the rivalry of the stature but but it has and and I think that right now you look at it and and I think the Yankees it's important for for Yankee fans and maybe for\nEven for us in the media to not overreact to too much to the to the to the way that series one of the Yankees still want a hundred games and Aaron Booth to lead a pretty good season for rookie manager a but then in the red Sox were more talented and Alex core as the manager himself\nOr they get a little bit of a better series then ...\nWhat happens now in the ... you got the defending World Series champ Houston Astros going up again the team that won the most games overall in the season the Boston Red Sox who wins\nThink Houston does ah I I look at the way that they that they play together so well this time of year I give a little bit of an as a Houston's pitching\nAnd and listen David Price is going to have to get big outs and and probably win a game for the red Sox at some point in time\nI you know David struggled again and and the first round against the Yankees and and ... and and will continue to do I think last year in the series actually was probably bosses best pitcher against the the Astros although he was pitching at the time out of the bullpen\nI don't know if the red Sox could win this series without David Price being David Price and and by that I mean the David Price of his regular season self\nAnd I think that's why it's one of the reasons why it's such a fascinating to watch because I think everybody knows that it has to happen that they need him\nTo do that and and they moved the pets um is going to have to be as MVP self from the regular season to really get back on a contract for the red socks off it so I I think it's going to come down to a couple of guys and also kimbrell\nKimbrell to me that was a very much a wildly ninth inning there in in in gave for in the Bronx\nSo I I think that the key guys right now the I don't know I don't know if all the pressures on them but I think the guy that I'm watching the most right now that's\nPrice kimbrell I think they're all going to be really key for the red Sox if they all come up big the red Sox can win if they don't I think that\nYou look at the postseason know out of the defending World Series champions and say that um the Astros probably find a way to win the series\nWhat about the ... the Dodgers going to advance to ah to play for a second straight season into the world series or do you think the brewers and I look I Know we talk a lot about\nYou know titled deficits I think the brewers have not been in the world series since Nineteen eighty two I mean that is a long time for Eighteen for a franchise to not be relevant kind of on that national stage is this the brewers opportunity to get past the Dodgers what do you see happening here\nWell this is really interesting play this the series because you've got on on the Dodgers side\nStill something of a traditional rotation and ah by the way I I Love the ... you got a very a smart of course board operator because you get the we are bringing us in the ... her shows a entrance music he\nCame on so well done and that that is that you've got a great crew there as you know that already quite but I'm telling you gotta really smart grew back there um so I I think the ...\nHe he you know ... of course when the the game last year to get the Dodgers end of the world series but it is a really tough out in game five I I think that that he can define\nHis legacy over the next two series and\nHe now gets the game one third of course he started game to the first round or a hundred and ... it was so good in game one but I I I Love the way the brewers are are are using the pits you right now they're ... they're thinking of starts in games in two and three innings segment as opposed to\nHere are here are my starters they call the initial out getters as opposed to stars which I think is a great so it it's a it's a fundamental change in philosophy I think that what we saw in the first round was great by the brewers\nIt may have to work a little bit differently in the second round because I think the Dodgers are better overall club and it's harder to use your book on that way when you play three straight days as opposed to straight those middle game three or four or five so\nI think the brewers find a way to win the theory that really do I think they're just the way they're playing right now it's just fascinating but this this is where if the brewers won the series\nGet ready for a fundamental shift in the way baseball management played because this is still a slightly traditional Dodger rotation against a really\nModern smart thoughtful of on guard look at it pitching by the brewers so and of course as you point out the brewers have never won the world series in their history so no matter what the winner of the the\nNational League is going to be at the same with a lot of history there either it's but it will be the ones with eighty eight or the brewers who have not been since eighty to it I've never want to\nIf the red Sox and the Dodgers advance in Clayton curse sharp pitches against David Price will the world come to an end\n[laughter] no I I think oh I'll be fine clay but it'll it'll be it'll it'll be a lot of fun to watch a game I think encourage a playoff struggles that Ben not nearly as severe as David or if\nTiger killer we thought we were going to get him to any gee what's happening [noise]\nWell I how much do you think it would cost for you to buy ... roundtrip airfare for me to fly out to India\nBecause I think I think it's now I'm getting a cheap I don't know I Need to handle this in person so a got a call on the hotline\nOr about two minutes ago answered it and it was ... agent the guy that I tracked down yesterday when this all started\nAnd so I'm really excited and he's like yes yes she is available right now this is the phone number to reach a mad he's waiting for your call she tells me the number I repeat it back to them twice she's like yep yep so hang up with um dial the number get stupid recording on that phone number is so hard to connect\nTo for whatever reason\nWhen you try to dollar phone in India most of the time you get a recording\nSo it's just it's just crushing to be this close yeah and you tell me if I had tried to kill a tiger man a guy that that we have we\nHad him on oh jeez come me too I'm like yeah perfect timing and then it's stupid recording I'm going to keep trying that number he gave me because supposedly that's where he's at at
