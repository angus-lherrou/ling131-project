eat interceptions had a quarterback reading of over a hundred his first stretch against his first twenty four games he was an elite quarterback\nWas wonderful right is great\nAnd then something changed\nLike a snap of finger\nA couple of fingers their week nine of the twenty Seventeen season jak Prescott that glass slipper cracked and broke a broken into a million different pieces over the past Thirteen games since week nine of twenty Seventeen season that Prescott has eleven touchdowns Thirteen interceptions\nAny quarterback rating of Seventy six point eight\nIs this quarterback really it is a horror show watching this guy tempted matriculate the ball down the field\n\nBut Jerry Jones continues to be in love with listened to Jerry Jones talk about that press got it's kind of like you want your mom or dad to talk about you listen to Jerry here and he mentioned that Jerry Jones talking about that Prescott where he is on back\nSome things that clip of some of the other day [noise] uh\nI I'm firmly in a corner that we've got\nQuarterback that we can build where have you come back Scott make no mistake about it\nYou just don't look at the numbers just try to avoid numbers void that he's\nAlmost a full season with ... more interceptions been touchdowns any quarterback reading of Seventy six point eight and Jerry Jones said make no doubt about it I always got to say that\nRight he's got to say that that's part of the job rise but Gerry typically goes off the script he's been known to go off the script from time to time\nOver the years with the cowboys how 'bout them cowboys right and here's Jerry and I think he's doing a comparison maybe not even Tony Romo his name came up let's listen I've not heard this let's listen to Jerry Jones here and he talked about his past with Tony Romo we'll see how that ties into that Prescott\nI cough close the patterns are that are have been on for the call ... ... who could morning or can we fight on Sunday if they will go around and so\nIt's always it's always when you go you're the conflict with good one for school if they're going to always be a lot as quick as we talk about that is the most second guess head coach of quarterback\nThat the problem Jerry is that Tony Romo was good jak Prescott was good for twenty four games and has been bad for Thirteen Years\nAnd I don't recall and we can go to the numbers if you want to go to the numbers when you go to the numbers I don't ever recall a Thirteen games stretch in Tony Romo his career where he put up eleven touchdowns and Thirteen interceptions\nWe walk in and maybe it happened maybe somewhere along the way maybe somewhere along the way that happened I don't recall it happening\nI I don't it ever happened was that bad for an extended we go to the database and look it up and we have we have access to that but I don't recall it happening and Tony Romo\nIn the history of the NFL if you if you look at his numbers he had a higher pass or reading Steve Young Peyton Manning go down the list Kurt Warner hall of famer hall of famer hall of famer Joe Montana\nSo it's I'm pretty confident in Rome or did not have a stretch of Thirteen games as bad as the Prescott\nHigh has had recently are not just the continue on the numbers don't tell the whole store they tell most of the story they don't tell the whole story professional sports are about adjustments or anything in life is about adjustments if you're not doing something well\nYou need to do it better you need to figure out how to do it better whether you're in an NFL player or you're you're you're a construction worker and you're you're you're making better whatever you're doing picking up trash if you're not good at it you have to get better at\nDefenses figured out the weak points intact Prescott and he has been unable to correct the issue is not for lack of effort\nBut this is the new normal one or two games you say I that's an outline that's a that's a hiccup but Thirteen straight games playing like a bomb that's more than a hiccup that's a slow\nMotion train wreck is what that is washing Prescott play quarterback [noise]\n\nHe's twenty eighth and completion percentages in the end all be all but considering his nickname three D. debt jak dank dunk decorate the three days\nA that's alarming because the cowboys don't throw the ball down the field very much in the press got twenty fourth in the NFL in passing yards he's tied for twenty fourth\nIn touchdowns it's not good\nAnd you heard final point you're Jerry Jones there he's gotta he's got the ultimate quagmire because he likes the guy he wants to stay in biased quarterback\nBut slowly we're moving towards a moment of truth for the cowboys and there's this debate some bull even Jerry Jones is going to say who cares this is my guy I'm going to give them a hundred million dollar contract\nThere is some of the media to believe that that he's going to get a hundred million dollars ... my theory is outside of jak Prescott having a reversal of fortune the cowboy bras is going to have an intervention with Jerry Jones and they're going to say Jerry you can't do\nYou like him but you can't do it he's playing like Thai ride Taylor or to rod Taylor did back in Buffalo you can't give that guy an extension you get rid of that guy\nAlex Smith\nCJ best third I didn't even know where that is more reliable than ...\nSo my\nMy plan on this is outside again of Prescott having a major reversal of fortune which is highly unlikely the cowboys will say who's got next let's start window shopping\nAnd who can they get likely a veteran who would they go out and get who they turned I got a couple of names human ions remember I told you first this is after the season so we got a long way to go\nFill up river is about that the chargers on a terrible team but\nThey likely you're going to fall by the side of the road before the season ends and the chance that they draft the quarterback and Philippe rivers\nAnd go over to the cowboys and finished his career in a high profile situation and try to get some more toothpaste outta too how about this one Derek car that\nCars not exactly live in the world on fire John ... not happy with the new grill later the raiders could say goodbye here's another option for Dallas Jamie miss Winston\nSee that [noise]\nSay Tampa Bay is often gets muddle up now that when students back it'd be taking over as the starter against the land of this weekend things don't go well\nSee once that ending up in Dallas and then everyone's favorite stop you have you know everyone's favorite stop you there is two guys that come up here if you need a band aid at the quarterback position they're two names one of them is ... ... that's the ... and then Ryan Fitzpatrick and there you go\nThat's the list those are the options in the wild card will be someone like Andrew Luck but that's a wildcard we say hello to Edmund Dallas steamboat\nDarcy or [noise]\nOr you started off talking about a Troy Aikman where his comments on radio yes that was ... I assume you mean because he's a former cowboy you can't criticize Kern County or is\nPart of the fraternal fraternal order of former players really yes okay you're not supposed to do it that's why most athletes are terrible on radio and television\nBecause they never want to criticize like a dam pleased to act on the ... will be network for example he never wants to criticize any baseball players 'cause he works for the state run and Moby network and all that\nIs part of the fraternity so he just went up\nBut I mean I could see if it was Tony Romo and there were still guys that he played with in you know on the team or are in the league but Troy Aikman has been out of the league for quite some time I didn't have any uh you know suing the NFL ... that are still planes\nThat works for the NFL when you have to be approved when you work at Fox new NFL games the NFL doesn't want your calling games you think if like CBS hired counting cabinet the NFL would approve of that\nProbably that right\n[noise] you're Colin Kaepernick it's a pretty different situation than ... a visitor somebody like that but the\nPoint is the same if you upset the powers that be at the NFL you're out of out of work\nHabits to destroy you you're going to upset the people in the NFL if he's critical of jak Prescott\nHe he could upset someone who's very powerful and Jerry Jones will come on you know the Jerry Jones has the power\nNo I think Jerry Jones has ... has plenty of power but I I think that you know he's not going to get upset of Troy Aikman does his job that's his job\nI totally disagree there's an expectation among people that in the NFL if you're a broadcaster calling games you will not go over the\nWas the you know you want the red Sox to use him a lot against the you know we don't we know you'd oh why not ...

don't have a lot of confidence though so yes is a very big now but by Alabama was at home than I Do think they covered this month\nYou or sent me some data before you came on this or this week and you said you're seeing the highest over rates for both college football in the NFL that you've ever seen at this point in the season and in particular\nIf you were just going out and blindly bet the over in every college football game you'd be winning at a fifty five percent rate and if you'd blindly bad the over in the NFL you'd be winning at a nearly fifty four percent rate\nUm does this stuff tend to even out or is there something fundamental that has changed in both college football in the NFL that the odds makers have not adjusted for\nWell I don't think the odds makers have adjusted for the new rules in in the NFL here with the rough and the costs are causing and the and it got designed to create more often which is what it's doing so\nI don't think God's makers have quite adjusted but usually over time the even out over the course of a season they're fifty fifty or fifty one forty nine ah and prevents you from just blindly going on one side or the other so\nIt's actually good news rooms to an anomaly like they're saying and when you see an over under takeover early on because if we can go the other way and make money over time if you can stay disciplined enough in college this is the highest overate we've ever see the NFL not quite the highest but pretty close to it and I\nAnd I think odds makers are starting to adjust to see a one of the highest total as we've seen in years and the chief type game here and so they'll start to adjust technically is one that will come back\nHow do you play you just mentioned it the chiefs paths which is going to be the biggest game by far of a NFL week six how do you play that one\n[noise] yeah it's what we haven't seen the ... the top fifty nine and a half and we haven't seen a total of sixty two thousand for Indiana wow so this is yeah this is a very very big number and\nJune Ricardo a legendary odds maker from from the south point told me a long time ago you said kid you take the over in the high numbers and take the under in the low numbers and while that doesn't work out to guarantee profit all the time that tends to be ... and that kind of and the city where I can become numbers the\nLast time we did see I told him sixty if you go over the total that's where I mean with this one too and she said passage path getting her off and going now and she says I don't have a great defense either so I I looked at players one over\nThe one place where you could have been really successful so far in the NFL in this is again data from you is that the home dogs in the NFL so far through five weeks are Fifteen and Seventeen against the spread that nearly eight Seventy percent wind rain anomaly or something to this\n[noise] now this is an anomaly and this is another one where home dogs and to even out two fifty fifty over the course of the season and Emma half do for sports books because this is traditionally a favorite spot of of the ... better than the big better they love to do you get points at home\nBut I think this will even out and I think what's happening here at home teams in general in the NFL they're hitting a fifty eight percent so far said own team's doing very well we'll see that even now I think that it has to do with the rule changes here and when there are real changes the home team gets the benefit of the doubt and major pro sports a major college sports so\nI ... it makes sense to me that the home team are covering the number ... and probably getting most of the calls when we look at the guy that they're so ... but this one will even out as well\nThe or the other thing about this I Want to go back to the chiefs pat gain a the chiefs are obviously five into one of two five and no teams along side of the rams there are three and a half point underdog\nAnd historically it's been incredibly rare for eight to five and no team to be an underdog at all but certainly to be more than a field goal underdog\nNow this is crazy we we've only seen two five teams\nAs underdogs more than a field goal in in the last Twenty one years so this is an extremely rare situation we saw that in two thousand seven and two thousand nine that they say is when one on one and in those games but yeah it's extremely rare it's one of those things that really stand out on the board\nSimon ... getting more than a field goal\nThis week here so I said this is going to be interested in the path to kind of been in this situation or they they played the cowboys in two thousand seven they were five point favorites too in that one I and I ended up the and ended up traveling as well so he by yeah is this is a really rare situation\nEagles giants how do you play it on Thursday Night Football tomorrow\nYeah the um the eagles have the number one ton of possession in the NFL and the and the giants have the Twenty one or the twenty first ranch yards per play defense so I just think the evils are the better team and over the course of sixty minutes they're going to wear the giants down\nThursday night our favorite night in the NFL the favorites I since Thursday Night Football Saturday they have like fifty nine percent so\nWhen a handicap this game I tend to look at their favorite first and I I think the eagles are better and that's how they're going to what\nWhat about the rest of the NFL slate what games in particular jump out at you\nThere's a couple of the bears a minus three at Miami backing open as a check which which uh is one of the gift wind banking and as moving the right way Miami buried injured on both sides of the ball\nSo I liked it bears there I like the ... the cowboys in and are going back to the evening out same I'm fifty two roads and blamed the point here and a whip the jags\nFourth ... going up against the thirtieth scoring oftentimes I think they're just suffocate cowboys\nWhat do you think about the ravens on the road against the titans both of these teams were three in one both lost in late fuel goals the ravens around at three point road favorite over the titans that's an intriguing game to me\n[noise] yeah it is and I feel like I have the titans figure it out here they are confusing team for a lot at but I took the bills last week against the titans\nTanks are food supply to whatever level their opponent players that and the ravens are really good this year on both sides of the ball and with the titans at home here and I think the elevator and profound back after the bills here so that's one way I Do like a home dog I I'll go with the type\nA couple other games I think are interesting in the NFL um you've got a a charger seemed going on the road against the browns the chargers are going to be in London next week so they're traveling slowly across the country and then hopping across the pond here\nAre the browns are a little bit of an underdog the chargers have a chance if you look at their schedule to get on a roll but really that's close to a fifty fifty game how would you play that early kick for a west coast team\nYeah really really tough one and and you said I think the advantage to the east coast team there and I we're seeing a home plus one in mind this one um I tend to be the underdog and there was really close lines and a ... and it is a really tough spot going to while I'm In the next week especially for a west coast team here so\nI kind of on the ground that I Want to throw up in my mouth robots are saying that because I haven't paid them all\nYou're in for a long time really but I I I'm leaning to the ground and not one\nGene miss Winston gets his first started this season against the falcons the falcons are one in four they've lost a lot of close games but they are a three and a half point favored in this game how do you play it\n[noise] yeah you crazy line here as well we've only one other one in four to favored by more than a field goal in the past ... years so this is another really kinda weird situation\nI think the falcons a little better than the record suggests year and I I I like to hear the Tampa Bay just their defense or especially in the secondary continues to struggle so I like Atlanta\nWe're talking to John Campbell you can follow him on Twitter at Johnny odd shark you can read his work and watches work as well at odd shark dot com or where you get all these gambling and informational related needs All right let's go college football quickly here\nGeorgia going on the road against LSU this aligned to me kind of interesting opened that around six and a half I got it there it's since bubbled out to seven and a half for a what do you anticipate in this one\nBig line where I Georgia has never really played anybody yet they're you know looks really good but I'm only anybody at South Carolina probably the best off I'm quite so far so\nI think Alex ... at home I think they're trying to get enough that they can keep this one close and especially now that the wind at that touchdown number [noise]\nBig big game and the pack twelve north to Washington who lost in week one to Auburn has not lost sense Oregon last that really collapsing game against Stanford that they're only last\nWashington right around at three point favorite in this one they'll kick off or or early relatively on the on the west coast right around I think twelve thirty a a Pacific time how do you break down Washington Oregon\nUh Oregon usually does very well for better than this little narrow lead them to want to get ... leading\nBy Washington in ... handled by a combined score of a hundred and eight to twenty four so I think there's a little bit of a bench factor here from Oregon and they're coming off a bomb or getting a couple of spiders back on both sides of the ball\nI loved it online and off for Oregon and Washington hasn't had the ... that we expect it from them this year so I can to Oregon I own getting only got ... ... and and I like Oregon\nCan I say\n[noise] animal [noise] All right\nA man eating tiger in India\nHas killed Thirteen people it's actually a tiger is meeting a female tiger\nAnd they have been chasing the tiger trying to catch or kill it for six months in India\nThis is I'm reading directly from the New York times article for the past six months

seems like the Hail Mary of all Hail Mary this cat has killed this tiger\nThirteen people or by the way you know what I'm going to bring in the crew to start off our to hold on let me keep going here there's another detail here that's also crazy\nI'm One of the five elephants that they've been using to try to catch the tiger this this this this by the way the whole thing just need to be a movie if you're waking up right now in Hollywood or you're finishing off a bender in Hollywood right now and you are listening to this and you're not thinking myself my God this is going to be an incredible movie\nOne of the elephants that they had been using to track the tiger got loose I Swear to God this happened to the elevator got loose and rampage through a village smashing fences eight grabbed a one woman with the trunk and slammed her to the ground repeatedly\nAnd after killing her the elephant stormed into another village where it had voted a man walking down the road leaving him with a deep gash in the forehead\nAnd finally they had a mother who who that's a traditional elephant trainer\nThe rangers captured the escaped package ... it was still dragging its enormous steel chain so in addition now to deploying obsession cologne one of the elephants that they were trying to use to track the tiger got loose and kill people in an Indian Village\nSo the lesson here I think that we

you possibly could like one bottle is fine\nBut why wouldn't you get like a massive spray or like they do when there are those are at yeah just that area and just make it impossible for the tire is to not know that the alone is out there\nAlso of India's willing to sacrifice a couple of good horses why not take someone who's on death row out ... them in civil Joan and have them run across the brush field\nAs as like human bait yeah\nThat would be by the way another amazing part of this story if they did take a condemned prisoner who was going to be killed and they said they took volunteers in a prison and they said okay we will give you\nTen thousand rupees or whatever ten thousand ten thousand dollars in ... rupees if you will be willing to risk yourself and also if the tiger doesn't kill you you become free\nLike that would be a pretty amazing story what if I were a prisoner I'd be like okay I think I'll take those odds now be scary but I think I Would take those odds All right we're opening up the phone lines\nAre Paul paths just called in from the damn Patrick Joe ... is is the most crazy story you've ever heard [noise]\n\nBy the way I Hope that this television this radio show\nNever responsible forever trying to kill a tiger because we can't even put somebody on the radio when they dollar station what happened there\nHey what's up man how are you ...\nI feel bad for these horses these wars are just sitting there and a barn somewhere woke up and down to my mind in their own business\nGiven these kids arrive on weekends or whatever horses do over there and also some guy leave them in the middle of the field and it just lather in them with cologne session with ice or were you on a big night out or they bring it over some lady because you know you think I got clone on it's gonna be a pretty good night next thing you know your fate\nDid you ever have obsession cologne\nYou know I think I was more of a polo guy back\nAnd that was that was obviously the polo and the obsession cologne if you are alive in like Nineteen Ninety to Ninety Ninety three\nThat we don't we'll house everybody either had the poet might have been like eighty eight to Ninety three where polo and obsession cologne\n... I bet I bet if you looked at like a flow chart of a cologne sailed right now like Nineteen Ninety poet obsession we're doing like billions of dollars a year I didn't even know he still they still make polo\nI I don't know but if I remember the polo gift packed with like you've got a polo a cologne you've got the Tommy Hilfiger shirt you got Jean short that were cough\nAnd your hair should either that's all I remember I was an amazing time I don't even ... I don't know that many men who use\nCologne like I'll Wait for like a six month period when I had my obsession cologne that I actually use it but I remember all every guy was either on the team polo or your team obsession and there was like a three year period there where America in general was all in all in ... alone\nIs it still like the the men still regularly use cologne like I I think of it as like a really older man move\nBut I guess it's kind of like the country club guy with the Wii next sweater those guys still wear call but normal middle class Mary guys like us we don't need to put that out there anymore I mean if you wear cologne I think your wife might be mad at you\n[laughter] or you try to cover up the fact that they were with a woman wearing perfume which is still very calm and what do you think about the odds of this tigers being caught by by using obsession cologne\nWell like you said if you want to do that thing with the prisoners I think he's got a great TV show like hey I got to run right now is we just book the ah the tiger killer for our\nView of the day and I and I were to God if you guys get the tiger killer from India on I'm firing everybody on the show

obsession in polo cologne if you were alive in like Nineteen eighty eight to Nineteen Ninety three\nYou remember that that was like the Ali Frazier of the oil in the wars that was bird versus a Magic Johnson that was a LeBron versus Michael Jordan that was the epic cologne battle to end all cologne battles from like Nineteen eighty eight to Nineteen Ninety three\nPolo and obsession and went toe to toe I mean I was like a Reagan Gorbachev I mean you just didn't know which way that thing was going to go\nThat was the allies against the Nazis the allies against the axis powers I mean that was an incredible moment in time in the Senate industry the likes of which we've never seen since\nThe uh no pun intended they're the only thing I Know about the cologne in and the and the and and perfume industry right now is that my wife spends\nAnd I'm not kidding about this several thousand dollars a year on bonded number nine does that make sense to people that might be totally messing that up anybody else have any idea what that cologne that perfume type is\nI think it's bond number nine and they have all these fancy bottles and Everytime we go up to New York we have to go to the bond number nine store and they only sell it at Nordstrom and it costs like a billion dollars per like symbol full of perfume and they have all the special fragrances\nThey had at nine eleven memorial fragrance I don't know that that seemed aggressive to me for a New York city a perfume to decide that they were going to have a nine eleven memorial fragrance I seem to aggressive dummy but women bought it like crazy they're like nothing makes me\nWant to remember nine eleven more than this really great smelling sent it just brings home nine eleven for me seemed aggressive I don't know if I'd been in that board room and they'd be like hey we got this idea we're going to creating nine eleven memorial sent for bond number nine I like I don't know guys\nDid you do it Titanic set seems like a

A. L. C. S.\nWhich will be in Fenway I'm guessing against the uh against that who's playing there the Houston Astros or you can go to a game four of the world series if the red Sox make it\nYou know either way I get we got game for but I have to pick 'cause my buddy gets the other ticket but I get the get the first choice [laughter]\nSo you you're a die hard Red Sox fan and so you would be guaranteed able to go see the red Sox play games for is that in Fenway or is that in Houston do we know yet we know right\nThere ...\nOr ... or ... accused him okay it's in Houston alright to gain for being used in a war you can\nA weight on the world series not knowing who is playing or where the game is going to be played and potentially be there right\nOkay a that's a good question and thanks for your dog for saying eyes well I think you've got to go to a game for a in with your favorite team because here's the way you have to break this down the red Sox have the best record in all of baseball right\nAnd I don't know they still do that stupid thing in the area in the all star game or whoever wins the all star game gets home field no the best record now now it's best record right so you know that game for is not going to be in Fenway either because the red Sox are going to open with the first two games in Fenway if they advance to the world series\nSo you would be there doing game foreign Dodger Stadium which could be fun or you'd be doing game for with the brewers but it might not be game for with your favorite team it'll either be the Astros or the red Sox playing and either Milwaukee or potentially in LA\nI think the play here is easy if it were in Fenway I think it would be a no brainer\nBut you're going to have to go down to Houston I think you go see your favorite team play instead of rolling the dice that your favorite teams going to make the world series I don't I don't think that's a really difficult of a of a call and the only thing I Would say as a as a cab you out there is if you have been to the uh AOL cs before\nAnd you have never seen a World Series game then I think you might say okay well you know what I'd rather go see a World Series game even if my favorite team is not playing just so you can check going to a World Series game off the bucket list and look for World Series game in any of those other locations would be fine\nBut to me you know the AL is going to be hosting game one into so your game for would either be Milwaukee or LA\nAnd as much fun as it would be to go to a game for it might be Milwaukee against the Astros and you wouldn't care at all about that game I think it's better to have a rooting interest I Would go to a game\nFor the ... who's up next Charleston West Virginia\nCharleston West Virginia once you got for me [noise]\nThey're going to love the show hey I'm question I have I've got a twenty three year old son that was in prison for two years to get out there the weeks ago and\nHe is working a job within two

Want this I Want this where he got as much or more spending cash and his whole family does because they get a paycheck each week with no bill [noise]\nDo you live at home right now\nHe is looming yeah\n[noise] what did he go to prison for [noise]\nA a [noise] armed robbery\nArmed robbery All right he's Twenty one yeah do you feel like it says is the first question is do you feel like whatever\nLed him to make the decision to wind up in prison for armed robbery\nDo you feel like he has got his life on the right path to where he is not in danger of recidivism in other words of going back to prison if he's still hanging out around the same people has he at least changed his life and it's only been seven weeks but at the at least changed his decision making that you can see\nIn some way you say you've got a job he's living at home like what a what have you seen that would suggest that he has changed his lifestyle\nYeah he's not hanging out with any of his buddies were two years ago it was more of a mixed up with just the typical stuff that happens in West Virginia words drugs and was\nHe let me ask you this and that's why I asked why he was in why he was in prison did he have any kind of drug addiction or any kind of issue with uh with drugs because I Know so many people now with the opioid epidemic and everything else have a connection ordered a downside associated with drugs did he have a drug background at all [noise]\nYeah they did okay I'm\nGoing to why they did go to probation and then with his new job um [noise] you know and he's not handling it said he's working seven to five every day where he's coming home tired you know and I just I Want to hang out but you know he's home and he\nHe goes to sleep at a decent eight eight thirty compared to three or five years ago\nHe out All right so look\nYou got three boys they're not at the age that your boys are but I think in this situation\nAnd I live the deep apple lifestyle right this guy your son has come out of prison he is working seven to five he's only seven weeks in your wedding him use a car you may be giving and financial support\nI think you embrace him as deeply as you can embrace a member of your family um and so I Would not be concerned about the financial or the tough love aspect of life right now\nI think this kid no telling what he saw when he was in prison for two years no telling how rough that two years was\nI think he needs you to embrace him a lot more than to give him a tough love approach now\nEvery kid is different right I don't believe there's one size fits all parenting\nBut I think in this situation\nYou want to embrace him to such an extent that you do not in any way encourage him to pursue the people who let him down the wrong path in life I Would want this kid living at my house I Would want him driving my car I Would want him involved in as many different family related events as possible\nYou nearly lost him if he went away to prison for two years if he's back if he's living at home if he's spending money but he's spending it and living in a a in an otherwise you know normal lifestyle he's working seven to five every day\nI think things are moving in the right direction I Would just continue to embrace him as close to me as I possibly could uh if that were my son that would be my advice who's up next\nWe got Indiana next Indiana what you got for me [noise]\nSo I started dating my wife I years ago when we're in college and the poor college student her family always want to do a family dinner down there so I go down there for a good home cooked food\nAnd her family down in the shoe bomb show in love with\nHim away from Tennessee the Indiana they've missed flavor child or they think all the food is just all of them are not good enough so let them know that the food needs a little bit more flavoring or what should I Do hear\nYou tested you'd never say anything for the rest of your life and you eat that food and you smile at it like here's the deal I think a lot of bad relationships with and thanks for the call a lot of bad relationships with the in laws are predicated on frankly stupidity", "show_name": "FOX Sports
