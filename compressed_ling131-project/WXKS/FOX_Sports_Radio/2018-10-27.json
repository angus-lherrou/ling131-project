[noise] ... okay let me ask you this cab\nYou're running the Minnesota timber wolves zip er which means that you would no longer be doing this show ... I Hope that you never get the ... I'm not trying to keep a man down I'm just hoping you'd never get the opportunity to run the scientist that thought\nThat being said if if a team offers you for first round pick [noise] are you taking that deal [noise]\nIt depends because I I I think those two diverging theories and that sort of rules for an office right now you have ... who wants isn't a win now mode and he feels he has got a car and he sounds and he's still as Jimmy right now when he has Andrew Wiggins if those two guys can never put it together them being cat in weakens\nBringing a guy like era Gore and along with them first round pick we're still going to be competitive now\nAs opposed the trading Jimmy Butler away for for first round pigs and a couple of ... players who may have a little bit of upside but I have a lot less production an era Gordon will be less appealing to me so I can understand why it's on civil do would say I don't I Want a breeze is bringing somebody that I can still keep us as a competitive team on the floor while also getting his assets for the future\nYeah I I I guess I don't I just I Wonder what other offers are out there right I mean it's funny because here's the problem when guys come out and they announce adult only go to a select number of teams if you're another team was trying to make a a play on somebody yeah Paul George great it worked out for the Oklahoma City thunder but\nThat's that's really taking the risk that guy is going to stick around long term and you traded away a lot to try and get them I just I don't know what other teams are going to be offering as much as what Houston is willing\nTo offer I mean there are more aid I'll give them credit man that guy's doing whatever it takes to try and beat the Golden State warriors\nUm I just if if I were the Minnesota timber wolves and I know Houston is a good team so those first round picture going to be later in the round Chris fall's getting older or who the hell knows how this team's gonna look moving forward I just I don't know that you're going to get a better off than what they've gotten so far yeah\nAnd one key thing you mentioned first of all getting older injury issue throughout his career Jerry\nThere was some ... concerns the weather's career as well so if your views are projecting you traded away those assets and let's say Jimmy does want to sign that extension which will be a max extension now you're paying ... Jimmy and Chris fall and absorb minute amount of money no one of those guys fairly often get hurt\nYeah yeah it's ... and look at and at some point there's always the team who didn't win it all but they were always sort of close to winning\nAt all no doubt that there there was always the team whose was pretty good during that run but they could just never quite get over the hump um I I I'm trying to think like if you look in the NFL like the patriots have been dominant for a long time and the Steelers do have\nThe one Super Bowl that they've gotten recently the one at a we think it's recently but it's almost ten years ago now Jesus ...\nBut the the Steelers are that team on the outside who just can't get past the patriots and the charges were like why what else he was still there example yeah perfect example and I just wonder if that's where Houston's at that they're just not there is a really good team\nBut they're just not good enough to get past Golden State and you can say well I mean come on they add a seven game and if Chris Paul wasn't injured they would have won that game in Houston okay but that's the problem Chris Paul is always in your right to see if you can't depend on them sooner or later you just have to be resigned to the fact that people were just not ever going to get over the hump\nExactly speaking of injured to mark his cousins what the Golden State warriors now will be back till sometime around the all star break as he recovers from his Achilles' injury but still have to stop them from getting beat up on the bench during their game against the New York Knicks he was actually seated traveling with the team on the bench and actually got ejected from the game\nI don't know if I've ever seen this happen before he he guy so basically I Believe in a Jackson equals too technical files so democracy because there's already has accumulated a couple of technical sales and he has even played yet\nThat's great but and so he got into it with was in his Canterbury what game yes but that is cancer likes to mix it up she does character yeah he he's funny he's and he's a really really nice guy he was on um uh we had a chance to interview on Fox Sports radio\nProbably a couple of months ago and he was one of the most down to earth athletes loves New York ... loves being in New York Nick loves loves the just the spotlight and everything are are that comes along with being a nic\nUm but yeah I I saw that and then ... get it gets objectives you gonna get fined oh did we get is fine I think so yeah oh I Believe so he's a ... [noise]\nGod they're good she stepped Steph Curry on Thursday ridiculously good and then they they go to New York and it's like you go on the road to travel all that way you get to Madison Square garden you got an earlier or start time to a game that you're not used to get your Golden State and they still wouldn't by almost thirty ... back to back it's crazy", "year": "2018", "show_name": "FOX Sports Radio", "city": "Newton", "day": "27"}
