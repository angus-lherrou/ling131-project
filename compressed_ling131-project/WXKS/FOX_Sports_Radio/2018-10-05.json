T.E Lawrence he's gassed in May of Eighteen Kermit eventually will destroy himself correct\nYes he commits a well he he's he's the one who becomes closest to Franklin Roosevelt and and he is an alcoholic he's very depressed he goes up to serve in World War two and the illusion any illusions in Nineteen forty three he blows is the what was his brainchild\nOf and but ... and ... is compelling and he's extremely smart and learns Arabic it does all the right things and the one who goes with his father and these are edition or eat it's however says a permit ah my blonde with a black car and eat it was ...\nShe was she she knows that that the decision not to run in Nineteen away it is a mistake\nA ... a T a TR other sons Archie and Ted junior or they or go off to France as the whole family goes off to a friend's everybody's in uniform one of the sisters goes off the ... I I I like the scene where Nicholas Roosevelt one of the cousins appears in uniform and eat it breaks down yes\nVery sad so ...\nIs not one hundred years later gas but news comes in March of Eighteen that Clinton was cracked up crashed the plane but he's OK\nMarch of Eighteen the training that grabs a couple of motorcycles too that's when a a John Mitchell the boy mayor of New York yes or dies in a plane crash training in Lake Charles Louisiana so\nFlying a plane I've done a couple of books on written back around and I know that\nGetting and one of those planes was not going to come out at at\nA training base that the quietness at for almost a year they lose a pilot a week to train those\nPlanes were what you call them flaming coffins but that to fly them was always a risk even to land them to take them off a march of Eighteen Archie is wounded and gets aquatic ... quality care Ted juniors blown up with the same a shell that hits Archie Archie badly wanted\nVery badly wanted his knee and his arm is is is really the the nerves or damage it's gonna be\nMonths for him to recuperate and he ends the war back in the state because he states because he is so bank ... he is yes he's he's raided a ... as as the U.S army does this he's raises a hundred percent disabled in World War one but he goes off in fights again in World War two in the south Pacific\nWhere he is again a hundred percent disabled so these Roosevelt are very brave guy as junior\nIs wounded eventually he's wounded in July of Eighteen but he's blown up with Archie Ted junior will be on the beaches up on the Utah be that's right he's the famous or generals who lands I think he's deputy commander of the division fourth division\nAnd they're lost and he says we start the war here exactly he has a heart attack within a couple a day that's right guys right on right on the beach uh now we've come to Clinton\nThis is a very hard part of the book to read because you know what's coming\nClinton is killed in action\nHe's ambushed as you presented by Germans fighting over showed a shutout Jerry business in July of Eighteen the big battles the massive loss of death the really stupid generally will come in September and October\nMassive direct just solved by our divisions against fixed fortifications of the German army first troops with machine guns and\nUp depots but I'll leave that there he's he's killed in ... the news comes to Roosevelt first from the ... amendment Thompson yes he delay there's a delay a couple of a couple of hours a day or so until they chose to eat it but they don't absolutely know it well telegram\nComes into the newspaper says watch sagging more hill for the rest is censored the telegram has brought the tiara by this reporter NTR says it's not Kermit he's traveling it's not it's not it's quiet and shy and don't tell Mrs Roosevelt and then the word comes\nAnd and it's a it's it's this tragedy and stages where\nHe's been shot down but is he dead is he alive right complained wasn't burning when it went down and hope that he when he crashed before you can survive a crash is he a prisoner\nPeople don't know and it takes a while before the word comes in from the Germans they start dropping is affects behind the American lives they put out\nStatements that Clinton is finally dead he was killed with two bullets in his head that he would ride right away\nOr the tragedy now worsens because TR apparently loses all interest in almost everything except for what his grandchildren\nHis grandchildren of course he has to finish World War one he has to he has to go out his his health is increasingly deteriorating and even before Clinton's death he spends a month at Roosevelt Hospital on the west side here in Manhattan\nUh with with abscess is and his uh there's an operation on his on both ears and his left ear is completely ruined the ... yes he's got ...\nAnd he and his heart is slow yes and he's lost his balance so he has to learn how to walk again in that you if you take a look at the picture to cover picture in the book you know the usual thing is T R is when he's speaking you banging his fish into his is open palm and in that\nPicture he's holding himself up with both hands against the podium and against the stench in holding the roof up and that's a very telling picture that September thirtieth Nineteen Eighteen he had\nA physician who was treating them routinely yeah she did they use morphine regularly\nThey used morphine that we know of twice and probably more in when he goes back into the hospital on armistice day on armistice day Nineteen Eighteen he's given morphine for the pain and he has given morphine for the pain on January fist\nOf just before he goes to bed or the night of his death\nRight and now we come to the part that you piece together like a detective story was it was it a decision of him his own to take his own life or to risk his death with morphine\nThis really came to me at the end up writing the book I write at the end and and the information came in in a torrent\nTo me once I started to think about it having the background that T. R. and then finding more and more it's sort of a means motive and opportunity\nI mean nothing definite in terms of proof and there was no autopsy there's no autopsy a he has a real streak of suicide in the family\nIs brother attempted suicide suicide erections curl about ... whole a whole bunch of them\nRight um he is a person he's a manic depressive we think of obese or manic right and we forget that he can be really down on thing is ... years in in\nIn regular breathing and then he stops breathing in the middle of the night is that consistent with her over more ... absolutely and he carried morphine with him\nOn trips to kill themselves if he got into a gym in Africa and yes and and the Amazon with Kermit Kerman is talking about that\nOr the oh in South America not enough yet without America the book is T ours last word there are a lot more scene and mystery however we've touched upon the fact that this last arc of the great Teddy Roosevelt\nDeep deep trouble ds T ours last war Theodore Roosevelt the great war and a journey triumphs and tragedies David Patricia is the author I'm John bachelor this is the John ...

neither of these guys are what the next wave of managers\nAren't major league baseball like it or not saber metrics is a really big deal and front office now they like managers\nMan when Mike ... pm eastern Fox's ...\n[noise]\nFox Sports trendy and\nThe postseason baseball game on national television series in Los Angeles Dodgers use the ... the Braves won on [noise]\nYeah you're going to get a lot more feedback then you probably do because like you said in the daytime when you're normally on people still are adjusting their schedules are during the week day so I'm sure you're going to get a plenty more feedback\nAs more people start to tune in during prime time hours and you don't what what game are you up because there's a full slate of games tonight\nWe're on a good question and we're on at that one has the uh the the Rockies brewers and then they have the uh the Braves and the Dodgers and we are on in between those two games\nSo uh there's a lot of baseball games on obviously the benefited there isn't an NFL game that is going to drain or soak up a ton of attention but we will be on\nIn that middle power part of the day on fs one right after the morning or that early afternoon game and then before the or the evening game from Los Angeles so if you just have it on fs one and you're watching baseball day it'll be impossible to miss this\nNice yeah and I I think the standout players were pretty much what we expected there's a reason Baker Mayfield was rocking that Christian yellow Jersey\nYellow which is amazing hater came in the game did his thing and then for the Dodgers boy the bats we've always said that the we weren't worried about the best we were more worried about their pitching will review throw seven innings only four hits\nAnd then ... Peterson starts the game off with a home run max months the who is a great story after the age don't to him and now he's one of the ...\nHitters on the entire Dodger line up and then ... Hernandez went yard so overall just a really good sports sign and I got greedy I was trying to watch it all so I was switching back and forth from channel to channel to channel\nYeah and and now that we move into the friday games and uh the Rockies brewers I mean it's an absolutely massive game for any of these teams that are trying to prolong the series if you go down oath to\nEven if you're on the road Road Home doesn't matter as much in baseball that's pretty substantial and if you're a Dodger fan at this point you got Clinton Kurdish all coming back right\nYeah he had starting game too\nBecause I'm looking right now at the odds the Dodgers are minus one eighty five which is a huge favorite the biggest favorite by far even bigger than the red socks over the Yankees with her selling them out so this to me is a is a pretty big sign\nThat the Dodgers are in excellent shape and uh if you have to oh on the Braves that's trouble and certainly if the brewers go up to all on the Rockies that's trouble but we'll see what ends up a tree inspiring\nAs a as the series play out again just an embarrassment of riches as we head into the weekend and we've got all the college football in the NFL Roberto what was your primary focus at a yesterday with all the sporting events going\nOn I watched a ... a ... a brewery Rockies game and then I took a nap when my daughter while I'm babysitting and then a woke up and watch the Dodgers ...\nThey ... is a very underrated actor yeah yeah a daddy daycare deed Eddie a\nGarcia what was your focus well I was I was dabbling in a little bit of everything and I have to ask Danny now my movies you've got things going on at the time so I've got to be on whatever's interesting me the most of the moment\nBut I've got my laptop next to me and if I have to go to the phone for a third option and I'll get the phone to and then I'll just kind of rude to whatever whatever thing is like the most interesting I'll put it on the big t._v.\nAnd I kind of switch things around is this multitasking going on for me but I was all in on Rocky's brewers until the end\nUh then um what was going back and forth between Dodgers and the Thursday Night Football game\nOr jobs dub work at their do what you got for me man I went down to a local watering hole when I was spoiled I mean that three big screen TVs got a little bit of everything so the baseball so the football and we got some creditors action in the middle screen as well it was a good night\nThere is is there any argument at all for sports fans that October is the best month or if you I mean it it right I mean\nI tried to take what you could argue otherwise maybe\nI I mean as much not isn't\nThere yet maybe you can do march because there is you know like with the March Madness going on there's a there's a lot of opportunity there\nAnd but I I just I don't even think it's close I think October if you're a sports fan is is honestly I mean I I've always thought that I Wish I could relocate a lot of the ... I feel like sports is not very balanced in terms of the calendar\nAnd then in October we have so much going on and then I Know this doing sports talk radio once the NBA Finals and the Stanley Cup finals are over\nThere is a long offseason were virtually nothing is going on from mid to late June until late August it's really just kind of a dead season because people still take off the summer substantially\nAnd there's this idea that people do watch sports as much in the summer which I don't think is true but maybe historically was true um and so as a result you just have the regular season of baseball and it's just hard to get psyched up about regular season baseball\nBecause frankly they it's ... I mean people watch their local team but even if you watch local team baseball if you lose okay you're onto the next story the next day it's hard to really get a large audience watching any game\nGoing to bring up my guy LA it's Taylor here in the next segment we're going to hang I'm going to ask him what he thinks about the rams a he's a huge ramps fad does he believe that the ram should be minus thirty five hundred\nTo to make the playoffs the biggest favor by far the overall favor for the super bowl what does he think about the patriots and or as we head into the weekend what are his favorite bats for college football and the NFL will get to all that\nAnd we're gonna have a good time I appreciate my ... your time with us we are as ... of course a big fans of gambling in general and the show I Apologize to everyone out there for giving you the cult last night I thought the colds\nWould keep a competitive they kept the first four games they played competitive they kept a competitive only a little bit at the end of the third quarter they score\nOr to get inside the number and then they gave up fourteen quick points that tip ball or intercepting their three tip ball interceptions last night\nWhere wide receivers or are in the case of Rob Gronkowski a tight in should've caught the ball they basically juggle that and through it right into the hands of the other team to for Brady and one for Andrew Luck and I thought that was the swing moment last game\nOr in a in in in many respects was uh was the inability of the receivers to hang on to the balls there regardless which side of the game you were on you're probably going to be in a lot of different sides on Saturday and Sunday as well\nWith football season means and excitement and a great time to wager on games you can get in on the action with my book he dot net my book dot net is the industry leading sports action website that offers real Vegas odds\nOn football baseball and all your favorite sporting events you could take a side the total or you can even bat the over under on how many fantasy points a player will score\nMy book he dot net let you play on line and win big used Provo code clay that the LA why when you register for your account and get a one hundred percent sign up bonus\nTo the game already kickoff don't sweat it my ... dot net has in game live action on every major league event even ... sports there's no better time to join my book you dot net than today go to my book he dot net to open an account and start winning\nUsed promote code clay when you register for your account and get a one hundred percent sign up bonus get in on the action visit ... dot net website today and used promote code clay\nThat C.

seven against Stanford and you've got Justin Herbert who was six six two hundred and thirty pounds\nAnd you run out of the shot gun when all you got to do is line them up against Stanford and just roll over in Europe thirty one seven and a ball games over I totally agree with you I mean I say it all the time just watching games quarterback sneak in this situation and teams just don't do it but you're right the patriots of successful ... obviously those are really good job\nUm you know of of calling that often it's for New England but they're one of the best but I thought it was the third touchdown when they went up Twenty one three I thought he took a pretty good hit there\nYeah and I think that's one of the reasons they would say why they don't do it is because the guys get hit but Brady has been I think he's probably the greatest quarterback sneaker of all time I mean these are incredibly great cornerback in general\nBut I don't even there's nobody else that immediately comes to mind who I think every time it's third and last in the yard or fours and lessen the yard oh brave he's going to sneak it and he's going to get it and to me is that the NFL is such a copycat league it's always surprised me that more people don't grab that aspect of what New England does\nBecause I think it's the best way to prolong drives when you get into that third down and short yard it's forcing shortage a lot of times in the NFL thirty one is even a passing down because it's so hard to run the ball against an NFL defence when the NFL defense and knows it's coming\nOut All right let's go into a into the uh the landscape overall the NFL this coming out this weekend you mentioned that jacks team there on the road against the chiefs which way do you play this from a gambling perspective\nA boy it's tough because the numbers exactly where it should be at three and you know I'm not going to be shocked at all but the thing lands all three you know I saw falls Kansas City this past week you know ... you know can hit a open water fallen from a boat\nAnd what other bad I mean that was for him to marry as Thomas down the sideline on Thursday on a Monday Night I mean that's just a difficult game that that that's a difficult lost that for them\nWhen it costs you I mean obviously you know I I back the over there so it cost both sides I mean you you get home with Denver and the yogurt yet that and you know if you're a Denver back or Europe double digits and fourth quarter so just a really tough last there's I don't know I think Kansas City I think teens are going to catch up with Kansas City\nYou know it's a theme that was three and oh and I mean I've been to where they were crossing it last year I Do think the homes with a better option now than Alex Smith I was totally wrong there and they've got a ton of weapons uh but Jacksonville on the other side I mean this decent is legitimate and I think that's gonna be the difference here so if I got back one way I still believe ... the best overall team and Blake borders is playing out of his mind\nI'd love a healthy winter for net I don't know if we're going to get that the entire season but I think I went back to school but it's still a difficult game\nJust because Kansas City has been so good options\nI think this is a tough game too and the line is ticked up to three and a half the battle of Texas between the cowboys and the Texans which way do you go this is mastered the Texans have to win it uh you just mentioned that you were on them last week minus one they were very fortunate to win should have been a tie ad wars or I Would think for the colds what do you think happens in the battle to access\n[laughter] um I think both of these coaches ultimately lose their job I'm Bill O'Brian upset last week if you don't win that game and indeed don't let him on the plane up Eighteen and second half against very average coal steam I'm I'm I'm really surprised where I'm not really surprised we're Dallas's right now because of lack of flame makers around Prescott and I think Prescott\nIs an average quarterback at best\nOn the other side I'm really surprised where Houston is because you know I thought Sean watching coming into your too and what we saw from him in year one with the Andre Hopkins one of the best wide receivers in the NFL 'em and you look at what they've got them\nOn the edges and in ... watts defensively I just thought this would be a team that would be really really good this year and maybe they're gonna hit their stride after getting out of India would win last week I think you since the play here I think Watson is going to get better and better and I just think Dallas is very average at best so you know if I could buy this\nThing down to three I think you're getting some value the Texans what's your favorite play in the NFL this week\nI'm just looking at over ...\nYou know and there's there's so much urgency with the Atlanta in Pittsburgh I find it hard for Apple's burger not to light up that ... cents at times\nAnd that's just an opportunity and I know without levy on ballots at different office altogether\nUm but you know you've got some emerging play makers um you know from ju ju to to you know obviously Antonio Brown I'm I just I think Pittsburgh's going to score some points I probably would lean Pittsburgh and then the in the afternoon ... Rosa look pretty good in week one that first starting in Seattle but on the road against San Francisco\n... still call it a hell of a game and the gay bath or you know didn't look bad at all I'm giving San Francisco an opportunity to upset the ... so I kind of like the forty niners\nLet's go to college football you know Alabama's dominant 'cause Knicks saving as mad at the students section for not coming out because Alabama's to nominate a when you look at college football I Would say there are a couple of games that really jumped out let's start with Notre Dame because Notre Dame I Know it tends to be a hugely over hype team\nBut if they get past Virginia attack this weekend in Blacksburg\nI think they have an incredibly good shot to be undefeated or in the mix the undefeated for the rest of the season what's gonna happen there are you with me about Notre Dame and the wrinkle they could throw into the college football playoff in general because they don't have to play a conference title game\nSo they could be the equivalent of a team that post the score and gets to sit back in the clubhouse in golf and wait and see what everybody else does with all the pressure on them\nYou know it looks genius now what Brian Kelly did going into the Wake Forest game and putting in book and there I mean the guys now pleading Seventy four percent of his passes seven touchdown no interceptions\nAnd their averaging two hundred more yards per game with and book under center than what they have a brand new when Bush so it looks like a night and day out into the defenses legitimate to got to go back and look at Notre Dame just kind of the history of the last couple of years they've lost four straight road games against ranked team\nAnd you know Virginia Tech Blacksburg is an electric atmosphere I don't know how much I trust one ride will is\nWe have ... Jackson was still you're starting quarterback I Would feel better I Know will is looked pretty good last week against Duke and that Seventeen point win but I still can't get the image of Old Dominion scoring forty nine points on this Virginia Tech deep and it's just a couple of weeks ago\nUm to me this is a difficult game because you know I'm a country and in public is all over Notre Dame here so I probably would take the points on a Saturday Night and Blacksburg but I don't feel right about it and I agree with you if Notre Dame wins this game I don't know where another losses and Notre Dame twelve and oh it would be impossible for the college football committed to keep them out\nOr going to talk with Joel flat and the final hour of the show he's down in Dallas and he's getting ready for Texas Oklahoma the red river shoot out what happens in Texas Oklahoma how do you play this one [noise]\nAh well Tom Herman is always good and these five so I mean just find a way to get it on on or against ranked opponents and Sam alley or a hundred and twenty eight straight attempts without a pick I mean that's been the difference quake\nWell thanks you go back to Texas we want to get some airlines still blown away they lost that game but they were turned into football over Eleanor has been eight different quarterback and on the other side they've been really physical defensively\nA second the big twelve and Russian defence only allowing a hundred and Fifteen yards per game they've got some some weapons will Jordan a free and you look at it colon jobs and I'm a big physical wide receivers that can take advantage of what seems to be a soft Oklahoma secondary I like Texas here I don't\nI don't know if they win the game clay this will be a huge win obviously for time or imminent with almost be a ... going to make up for that Marilyn off a Oklahoma's one twelve last Eighteen meetings with the last four been said about seven or less so I think I'll grab more than a touchdown here and I'll take X\nOkay this is basically a landmine game for LSU because as excited as LSU fans are they're five and no they are rolling into Gainesville if they lost this one and then they came back and they got waxed at home by Georgia there'd be a lot of people saying you know what this is pretty much the same team we thought it was\nOn the line has dropped down to less than a field goal LSU is favored I Love the under here how do you play LSU Florida\nOr you're right I mean this total is one of those if it was the equivalent of the total forty three forty three and a half right now which is like a thirty two total in the NFL chemical headsets here at or drunk kind of moved out of the way let\nDavid Randall do his thing defensively and Stevens mayor hasn't been bad as an office coordinator up but that would be a big problem for LSU and you go back to last week and they might have played their best game against Ole Miss another ... got the the quality wins over Miami\nIn Auburn but they dominated Ole Miss and Joe borough finally had that line you wanted to see as a quarterback going Eighteen or twenty five almost three hundred yards not turning the football over to actually\nRush for Ninety six yards five hundred and Seventy three total yards regardless you off and that was against a really bad old Mets fan\nBut I go headsets here and I look at Dan ... and what he was able to achieve going on the road start on\nYou know basically shutting down at Mississippi State off its fleet great branch is not his quarterback the future but he got enough in this spot in Gainesville and this is one of those weird situations where you're seeing a ton of public money come on one side and the undefeated LSU number five of the nation but the number continues to drop a little bit I think part of gets you out right when I'm here\nAll four of the last four games between LSU in Florida decided by seven or less I think it comes down to the wire but Florida only allowing an FCC low one hundred and forty passing yards per game I think they shut down job or a barrel finally makes those mistakes he's yet to throw a pick this year I think he throws multiple fixing this game and I think for to get C outright with [noise]\nLast question for you weren't talking to land Taylor go fall him at the lands Taylor on Twitter Ninety four or five jocks in Birmingham you can go listen to him a good buddy of mine for a long time what games do you like the most in college football\nOr Florida is one of those games I like it if I'm going to stick in the SEC and going back as bad as Joe warheads office has been with that puts driven I Know you've watched a lot of Mississippi staple ball over the last couple of years with Gerald is a great athlete who seem to really progress last year before that gruesome injury in the ... vote against Ole Miss\nThey had a little bit better play down the stretch against Clemson hell if they just stopped chased rice on that for downplay and then this is usually a big game but us he's not very good Notre Dame goes on the road against USC\nEarly production\nI didn't get Notre Dame gets passed Virginia Tech and I think they will like it was a good chance the Irish gets twelve and a and a twelve and Notre Dame team is going to be almost impossible to leave out of the college football playoff\nSo put that put a pit in this game it's an important one for the college football playoff race just particularly because Notre Dame has gotten past all the most difficult games and its schedule frankly if they can get past Virginia Tech on the road and Blacksburg this weekend alright I teach that I Want to play it for you Jay on Ramsey I think the best game and the NFL this coming weekend\nI'm genuinely curious to see what the jags defense can do it gets Patrick ... homes and that chiefs off its best game by far in my opinion in the NFL is jags on the road against the chiefs uh let me hear the audio jailing Ramsey run in his mouth talking about ... said basically that kick return or here's that audio\nIs good for what he does regime or you know you may all pro as a return specialists was give their right of return specialists or his ... year he wants to to ... as a return\nSpecialists retired special is two years I I'm a ... in my position as a corner or was it uh Provo as a corner [noise] um so it's not a receiver versus\nCorner match for like it was just either smart\nMove by him you know you go you go and get some clout he uh he going to get above going around there for a little bit um\nBut he he knows are\nJust like I feel like everybody knows me it's All right we're we're going to probably has the opportunity to mess up against each other but they won't be like that a majority of the day I buried by knows that he moves around everywhere\nI don't look at it is ... and I don't really get I don't I don't think there's really a mess of games to be honest with you\nIn jail and Ramsey say and he made it as a cake return or I don't think there's any doubt that he's intending to gig diary killed a little bit and to me this is a big prove it to be moment for Patrick\n... homes we got one on Monday Night but again I think that Monday Night game if you watched it\nAs good as the chiefs of war the Broncos took the air out of the ... the chief found a way to win helped in a large degree by that miss from case keen on down the right sideline did to marry as Thomas that should have been a touchdown to win the game for the Broncos sorry bronco fans but they took the air out of the game\nThat was the kind of game the Broncos wanted to play\nLet's keep the chiefs out of the thirties let's not let Patrick moments run all over the field and throw for six touchdowns against this or five touchdowns or for touchdowns\nDid she found a way to win but it was the Denver Broncos tile game\nWhat is Jacksonville going to be capable of going on the road because Kansas City right now is the best team in the AFC Jacksonville is one of the best teams in the AFC\nKansas City the momentum can come to a screeching halt like there's a decent chance they lose the jags this weekend I think there's a very good chance that go on the road and lose the patriots if they lost to in a row homes mania would significantly decline now what site is\nHey if my home's goes out follows up Monday Night football gets a win over the jags it's going to be an absolute fever pitch as he gets ready to go on the road against Brady and the patriots\nAnd if the chief could come out of those two games to be six no I don't think it's possible to get out or I don't think it's possible to be a doubt at all\nEven if they split that's a pretty good result but we'll see I Can't wait to see what's going to happen in this game I Love that Jay on Ramsey is starting to throw some elbows ear for those you just waking up and I'm Wondering about all the events that are going on in the world of sports we will discuss all the\nMajor league baseball playoffs as well as last night's game between the colds and the patriots what do we learn while also continue to get you ready for the weekend of college

game\nAnd Omar most watched game may well most watched show may well again be friday or because while we were on live last night in prime time\nWe had to go against the NFL game at least this time a today when we go on this apt to tomorrow evening there is not going to be an NFL game on going on at the same time as a so I Do think that's going to be significant biggest takeaway Eddie Garcia\n[noise] how about Andrew Luck I don't know if he's back or not but he's to me way ahead of schedule when I thought he would be I had some pretty big questions coming into the season as to you know where it was going to be physically after Michigan for here\nAnd I know that you could argue that some of his stance that he acquired and the patriots game came in kind of garbage time where you had to throw but\nI I don't know I I think he's ahead of schedule I again I don't know if he's fully back yet but I think the culture got to be happy with where is that right\nNow I agree I think any throw that he had that was less than twenty yards last night was totally incredibly locked in I mean he was on point some of the throws that he made\nWere insanely accurate now he wasn't really and it still isn't able it doesn't seem to me to be able to stretch the field and really on cork a Deep Throat but he's so good at reading the field and letting go with the ball he reminds me a little bit\nUh even though it it it's obviously the Peyton Manning was a lot older\nMen and got to where he could see the field so well that he was throwing before the receivers would come out of breaks because he knew exactly where the ball needed to go\nSo we could make up for the fact that he's still didn't have that velocity and the wake of his injury when he got out to to Denver\nIt was clear that his velocity was not what it had been in ... a year earlier years of the of his football playing career and I feel like that's the way that Andrew Luck is bringing himself back from his injury he's making throws that are a\nNecessary for him to throw for instance before the receivers come out of the break but he sees the field so well that he's able to do it and then inside of like ten and Fifteen yards he's got the dark you know he can throw it pretty hard there and make place we need to him if\nHis receivers could've caught the ball eat it thrown for easily for fifty last night and maybe even approaching five hundred yards I mean there were a lot of drops and a lot of yard is left on that field last night from a from his receivers and his top receivers roll out\nWe didn't have a we didn't have jak the oil we didn't have a T Y Hilton I mean I that's why I Would be a little bit nervous if I were a patriot Roberto your biggest takeaway patriots or\nYou know their their back and looking like they're going to be on their way again\nToo so you and your by it and completely the Patriot act and yeah the ... biggest takeaway last night one of the best nights of sports of the year\n... I watched that game and I'm putting myself in a New York giants hat and I got to be sick if I'm a giants fan watching sooner Michelle who's the thirty first pick and they use their number to pick on one Barclay and there doesn't seem to be much of a gap between those two guys man\nYeah that's the question in general but you know what would happen if the patriots had gotten say going Barclay he would look phenomenal and Sony Michel if you were at the giants would look like there's nothing going on there\nThat's functioning of how good the patriots are without judgment Daniels off ants at using all the weapons around them but look Sony Michel did look like a potential difference maker for the patriots on often and uh obviously it helps to have a difference maker like\nTom Brady

know there are substantially apart in this investigation but do we think Under Armour do we think Nike do we think of you know a ... everybody basically is trying to get into the basketball game\nYeah and he just says a bidding against itself or the twenty eighth best player\nYeah one of the players involved a mess Silvio issues that we haven't gotten all the evidence on on him he plays a Kansas he was originally when I go to Maryland\nA and he got he was proud asteroid receive ever really slept out the details but twenty gradually Under Armour to go play from Maryland and Under Armour school do you decide to come up with twenty grand to buy out that the basically and then get him to go to Kansas where they wanted them to go\nSo uh you know they're all involved ... look at this is it possible it's possible that a top hundred player is not taking money\nIt's possible that I hop hundred player in this country does not have is knocking throw money to play you ball has multiple shoe companies bidding ought to have a million people try to steer came out of what college to go with and the college coaches knowing it\nEither directly or just hey can you help me out here what do you think we can get done hair out and and they do have that's worth Pitino on the phone I'm supposed to get employers\nThere is possible that there are kids that are just being recruited it\nIs probable that is happening but it is possible so ... any of the schools\nAny of them or any of the players are following the NCAA rules the way the NCAA watts is Joe ... that I mean just this is the twenty eighth best player in the country is getting paid twenty five jeez look like high school to play summer ball to grand among the high school ball\nI forget it [laughter]\nSo ... what's the so if you if you think based on sitting at this trial and what's being said on your testimony and all the evidence that's coming out what you just said which is that\nBasically to its core the idea of amateur is among college athletics is a total sham there's no truth to it everybody's getting paid what happens next like what happens to college basketball\nFor me I'm probably like you I don't particularly care whether these guys are getting paid to play college basketball or not it doesn't impact my enjoyment if they have a nicer apartment or if they have a nicer car and they're playing college sports I've always thought that is one of the funniest aspect of this like\nWhy do I care what they do and the hours and when they're not enrolled at school you know on the court or on the football field or whatever else\nBut what's the actual impact that the NC double ... basically being shown to be an emperor with no clothes\nYeah I mean how 'bout I'd rather you remain poor for a couple\nMore yes ... Michigan I don't want\nYou to you and your family to have any money I Want you to be poor\nLike what that's what they're saying yeah because it'll it'll\nImpact my enjoyment of the game I'm okay with it you know kid gets tickled box good um let me tell you what's gonna happen nothing I think it's going to happen because the people that make the rules profit off of these rules\nI I Would think so I mean I don't know how you take this seriously especially if they lose this trial because they're basically trying to say you committed\nA federal offense of wire fraud ... or ... why five by defaulting the schools and by friday with schools you made a player ineligible so these guys basically paid Brian ... junior to go to Louisville and\nBy doing so they made him ineligible to play at Louisville and that's Louisville was fraud it because they hadn't ineligible player\nTo really strangled the I think legal argument I make\nWhen these guys are going we were helping Louisville yeah we've got some of the great player\nAnd they were paying them to they paid Thirteen hundred or something we all know all yet\nAnd look at all the other schools I mean they sitting there going\nUm you know Christian Dawkins is kind of middle man was working as an angle and brought it was kind of there is age it and he's bringing offers to Bryan ball and senior and he said look why go to Arizona it'll give you fifty thousand is what he said yes long ago to Oklahoma State they'll give you a hundred and fifty thousand\nAnd eight thousand dollar car eight thousand dollars for a car\nAnd a and a house some undisclosed amount or house those quote unquote okay ah I guess spouses in Stillwater but still a house I mean what the heck right a house or you want to go to a\nA Creighton there'll be a hundred thousand\nDollars I mean when I hear that crayton is buying players I'm like every single school in the country is buying players\nYeah well here's the deal Creighton has stepped it up you know they're the Big East now\nAnd I'm actually kind of proud of them they definitely acted like a high major\nRight like no more a little mid major crazy yeah All right we've got a hundred jeeze for ya but here's where they failed\nIt will also help you get a job a really good job in Omaha no no no there's no job that's where they were fair right the big schools are doing a job is giving you the cash so with a hundred grand acquaintance\nUh there was trying to think of the other ones that he he laid out\nA way he wanted us to 'cause what I Wonder is to wind up the shoe companies turn on each other or had they already turned on each other and start firing away at each other to try to protect themselves when in reality they're all in a big mutt pile\nWhile I think they're all shook a little short because all of a sudden there's a federal offense right maybe you know we'll see but I mean they're the defense of saying hey I like doing it Under Armour\nThey're trying to say Yuri trial or a bitch trailing trial by jury trial\nWhat do you what kind of vague what kind of reaction have you seen from the jurors in the courtroom as you watch this testimony or they gauge did they seem sympathetic I mean I Know it's hard to read body language go up and\nGoes because I was one of the lawyers are being boring but um it's not as if the if the jurors or I was there for jury selection they are not big fans they gotta throughout all the fans\nThat was a little weird they also have this kind of weird criteria where like if you disagreed with the NCAA couldn't provide a fair trial but if you agree with yes yeah and it's okay you're you're open mind like I don't think believing it and say ... as the middle ground\nAnd it seems one side of the other but anyway it's a New York jury very diverse you got a lot of people that\nOh you know aren't now this was the southern district of New York they do tons of fraud cases you know financial things all different stuff so there's a lot

remaining\nAccording to the odds makers on the entirety of Notre Dame schedule Joel ... what happens if Notre Dame Oklahoma clams and Alabama and Ohio State all five go undefeated\nI think this is a pretty easy question and and it's it's the ones that get left out\nThere saying ... the ... yeah I mean absolutely cause damage is going to get in because they're ... that was proven out last year and we know that they are historically in particular if they're on the view that that white clay there will be considered you know this is potentially one of the great teams ever in the history of the sport so they're going to go\nEven though their their resume will be\nPretty I Would say week\nBased on their schedule okay do you know just the difficulty of their schedule but they would have an LSU on there they would have an Auburn on there and they would have an insane most likely as she championship game it gets Georgia so their resume would be strong enough and and they would easily go\nAnd when he was a building one way you would feel the same way by the way of Georgia went Thirteen into and I eat out All right like know your way out so\nAn undefeated as champ whether it's Georgia or Alabama or go I think there was a what would certainly hold up fine Ohio state's resume is going to be as good as anybody if that's the case Oklahoma's resume would be as good as anybody if that's the case and Notre Dame\nWould be absolutely better than Clemson no doubt about it in particular was some of the ways that Clinton has struggled\nYeah you know sneaking by Texas and I'm\nSpeaking by Syracuse that they are the two thousand and fourteen version of of or to stay if you remember that you thought was great but just kept squeak by a really big ACC schedule and they've got their doors blown clean off by markets Mario to at the Oregon Ducks the semi final and the rose bowl\nSo that's what would happen and\nYou didn't bring up the one that would bring the most chaos\nLet me just throw this out you quite Travis\nUCF goes undefeated I think that the committee\nFrom a political standpoint is going to have to include them or they risk having this entire model blow up right before before their eyes because let me tell you what will happen\nThis will go to Congress if UCF does not get included as an undefeated in particular if there are viewed in a straight years 'cause they will argue that it is not equal access and that this whole model needs to get blown up\nThat's the one that all the powers that be are showed nervous about every time UCF plays\nThe power five commissioners are desperate for them to get deep because if they're undefeated at the end politically they might have to include them or risk to the entire playoff getting blown up by Congress it's going to be absolutely wild\nTell me why everybody out there who loves college football can't just agree on this playoff eight teams\nBall five major conference champs too wild cards and the current as into lord of the world you play first round playoff games on campus top force need to get to host and then you just roll everything else right into the same way that we concluded championship now\n[noise] I don't know how many times I've got to shoot this down I just don't I just don't know okay here we go are you ready clay yes\nFirst as soon as you have automatic births you one hundred percent ruin the non conference schedule so September college football now means nothing absolutely\nWell I disagree because you have two wildcard\nYeah but that's only policing importance on a select number of games and only in hindsight\nBut only in the head now like we don't know how big Washington Auburn is going to be in so we get to late November right like we don't know Miami LSU is really gonna matter until suddenly we look up in Miami ends up going to Lebanon one and they're playing against Clemson and we're like well Miami's eleven and one but they did lose to LSU\nAnd weak one I mean Miami could have easily turned into a nine and three eight and four team and Washington are Auburn could easily do the same too I feel like in retrospect we never have any clue there's always September tigers that turn into you know a papier-mache like we had with well state last year\nI disagree to some extent because we we understand how big those games are in real time now I mean we talk about that\nI'm certainly and and that might be the case moving forward but then there's also another um element to that which was which would be this\nThere would be absolutely no reason whatsoever whatsoever to play a difficult schedule and the non conference no reason\nBecause you would have full access to the championship by just wanting your conference so I just I don't like automatic birth I I think it would be a much better model of said you had to when you're conference to go rather than you and your conference and you for sure go 'cause if you did that and you just took the four best champions\nRight then all of a sudden those conference championship games are\nWildly important than you would essentially have a tent team playoff at that point and and those are quarter final games now all of a sudden last year's iron bowl is significant like wildly significant and and you're not minimizing or marginalizing any game on the schedule factor you're improving every single\nGame on the schedule and and the name of its imports plus if you go to AA you do get rid of conference championship games because that would be the opening week of the playoffs and and so how are we crowning champion sort of these leaks playing\nSame type of a schedule then all of a sudden you get into these fourteen few weeks so you're playing a conference games and the SEC and and the difference between schedule difficulties with in your conference are are wild you know\nAs far as my my little ...\nChampion that I I just feel like the automatic burst an eighth team sounds really easy but there's actually way more problems with it that people actually realize\nMy solution on a team is like SEC a team fourteen team or eight game fourteen team conference it's insane to me that for instance Florida just went to play at Mississippi State right Dan mole and went back to his old school\nHe will not return to play at Mississippi State now and I'm Bad at math as early in the morning until twenty thirty\nAre eight like that is twelve years it will take for Florida to return to play a road game at Mississippi State now Mississippi State will play at Florida some time in six years I don't know why the SEC doesn't just do this\nYou play three yearly rivals and then you play five rotating opponents if you did that\nYou would play every team home at home in a four year process and it would solve everything and even rotated through I mean it would make total sense but that's my that's my solution for the unbalanced scheduling is you play every team every\nOther year right it would solve it really rapidly it would eliminate all the controversy let's go back to the games that are going on this weekend\nYeah I think Notre Dame should be in trouble or is in trouble on the road against Virginia Tech\nUm I the only thing that I think is is racking Notre Dame is that one of their leaders one of their best players Alex or last year and and part of what is made them so successful that their physical ... of the football\nUh Williams came back from his suspension you played really well I think a hundred and sixty ours last week they've been explosive now the Aspen game\nDefensively with guys like Jerry Hillary I got to tell you I've been very impressed with their mother was fishing in Oregon Stanford they've been dominant on that side of the ball um I'm not all that worried remember now this is a high tech team but for whatever reason snuck back into the people\nThey had six hundred yards put on by all the ... year\nOld Dominion so\nI certainly think Notre Dame is going to be able to handle ... check check has been\nThey've been one of the more disappointing teams of the entire season to be quite honest with you what they had returning\nAnd at what I thought just went there was some upheaval with that program and I certainly think Notre Dame has the ability to go in there and and get a big win ... books uh uh inclusion into the line up has been one of the biggest things in college football because they all of a sudden would seem that had to write out really agree wins\nDo it seemed that score thirty eight forty five fifty three point\nAnd all of a sudden Notre Dame is dangerous and their schedule is eminently winnable and like I said if I were the are the real concern of Notre Dame because you champ will\nI'm just telling you will get left out if Notre Dame goes undefeated because they'll have a better resume so you better hope that Ohio State loses or ... or something along those lines\nJoel how nervous and were you when your boy Jim Harbaugh got down Seventeen nothing to northwestern and at any point during the broadcast that game did you think ... Travis is right\nUm I've never thought that actually\nIn my life [laughter]\nA\nBit um yeah the northwestern played so well early in that game and fish get looked like they were just totally sleepwalk totally sleepwalking um and", "show_name": "FOX Sports Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Newton", "day": "05"}
