the guy that they took at the top of the draft maybe this guy a he had kind of a head start coming into the NFL over everybody else reason I say that is Albert ...\nWho works for the Monday morning quarterback dot com he's fantastic he's been covering the NFL for years and years he was on the herd with colon cow or this week here on main heard on many of these Fox Sports radio affiliates and he brought up an interesting point that may change the way you think about Baker Mayfield moving forward\nI'll tell you this calling people on the fell right now I Believe that Lincoln Riley is one of the top five or ... soldiers on the planet anyway and the fact that he comes from that and the fact that he was able to play for like an Riley or just from the ... the quarterback coaching stamp on\nReally put them in a position of developed over the last three years at what interesting and not all of his translator or the NFL or what he learned oh all you're seeing\nThrough a very important qualities one is very accurate with the ball and sewage decision making for the most part was off the charts at Oklahoma if you have those two things coming into the leak that's a pretty good starting point\nSo let's just think about this then now that we know all that and now that we've gotten a little bit of sample size of Baker Mayfield\nAnd I understand it at a couple of turnovers and there were some uh a couple of bad throws may be in that game against Oakland and that's going to happen with a rookie quarterback but it now hearing Albert beer say that that Lincoln Riley is considered to be one of the top off five offensive mind in\nAll the football not just college not just the NFL all of football if Baker Mayfield came from\nThat maybe we\nDon't see that many typical drop offs of of what we normally see what the young quarterback you know maybe he is the real deal maybe the browns actually did get it right because think about it the browns probably should have won that game\nA road game a week ago Baker Mayfield first start he went blow for blow with their car\n... ... I mean that that was both team scored in the forties\nThere were some poor you know bad turnovers and I get it and and young quarterback and that's going to happen and it happens all the time and yet about guy sort of throw interceptions it happens that is a road game\nBut now that you actually take a step back I've been saying this from day one\nSo many things point to they got this right\nDisguised better than advertise meet one Heisman Trophy but I think people just expected\nUndersized Johnny Manziel they couldn't get the idea of the browns actually getting a pick right in their minds so they just kept referring to what they're used to know now we're that's that that's that's what we're used to that's the brown know like it's different\nYou know they are they aren't the kid in high school or or who used to cut farts during P. right they're not like that it's a different like they're not they're not that same kid anymore like they actually did get this right a couple of the best talent evaluated in the NFL have talked about it both like Johnny Manziel more than any other quarter back in the draft check\nSteps in on prime time no notice when the browns their first game in like two and a half years check\nGoes blow for blow on the road and again the browns probably should have won at Oakland with their car and the raiders check came from a college or the head coach there is considered one of the top five offensive mines in all of football check at what point do we not\nTake a step back and go yeah maybe we missed this devaluation maybe it's better than we thought eight seven seven\nNinety nine on Fox Jonah stocks Fox Sports radio eight seven seven nine nine six six three six nine or you can also get me on Twitter at the Jonas docks I Want to let you know we are brought to you by discover card\nBecome a new card member and discover card will match all the cash back you burn dollar for dollar at the end of your first year learn more discovered dot com slash match limitations apply going up next\nThere's um there's a team in the NFL that I legitimately feel bad for and I feel bad for their fans find out who I'm Talking about here on Fox Sports radio\nWhether you get us on Facebook on watch sports radio dot com\nOr you could just to see it on your radio\nImagined that working\nOf ... sports do you\nFox Sports radio\nBut neither here even if you're a big time basketball fan there might be a few facts about the game you don't know like did you know that the first ... actually peach baskets whether the war in basketball is bounce you'll get a cold one or the players can run as much as four miles Julia game we was another fact\nYou might not know that's actually really helpful if you need to buy a car true car also helps people get used cars that's right true car isn't just for buying new cars\nWere they're certified dealer networking nationwide image or a of nearly one million used cars you'll enjoy real pricing on actual inventory and he's simpler buying experience\nWhat do you buy new or use and withdrew car users can see what others paid so they know if they're getting a good deal before by there also more likely to enjoy a faster\nBuying experienced by connecting with true car certified dealers when you're ready to buy a new or used car checkout true car and enjoy more confident card by experience some features not available and all states\nAttention to this important message if you ever taken prescriptions like adult and are concerned about the side effects that high cost now there's a new natural smart to that's the closest thing to a real life limitless in fact\nIt's called limitless and he can help skyrocket your concentration and put your creative thinking and make you feel like a better version of yourself get and watch you go to work now\nTo get your free bottled limitless called eight hundred six seven to nine three four zero that's eight hundred six seven to nine three four zero called out eight hundred six Seventy two Ninety three forty\nRats when Michelin Man is on your side helping you see veterans rights they knew Michelin premium ... designed with explosives more flexibility ...

buddy\nReturns right returns you\nMean guys coming back yeah the engines that have left themselves and their teams shaking their heads about what the hell are you doing\nHere like I personally have Julian Edelman on my fantasy team and he came back and I'm In a PR league and I was in ... he gave you a Thirteen fourteen points I was good with that man from a flux position\nIf only he'd caught a couple of other ball and left like he gets a butter fingers getting back he didn't get the ...\nHe did um but mark Ingram yeah there's a lot on because he is back for the New Orleans saints ... what does that impact on that team who who does it affect the most and a good way or a bad way as he is back for the St on Monday Night\nWhat brings you back your sledgehammer between the tackles and Robin come air owners they're going to be a little bit saltier about it 'cause that's probably ten to twelve touches maybe Fifteen or on the right\nGames script that go the other way on you and America coming into the seat coming into this week you're looking at the highest fantasy point score among running backs right three touchdowns a week ago Drew Brees owners if you didn't watch the game you saw that final point total\nLike oh I'm sitting pretty and then you checked your fantasy team and you started throwing stuff and causing a problem so a for cause I think you're looking at the goal line stuff going away 'cause you want to make sure he's ready for the stretcher on because you were just talking about the falcons and there are bad luck starting to catch up with the AIDS looks like they're pushing Georgia playoff run\nAnd ah and what's interesting so Drew Brees has got the record that he's going to try and and get 'em and that's on Monday nights where he's going to try and pass Peyton Manning for the all time passing yards record so if you know a guy let me do this just fantasy psychology yeah get from somebody who is actually good at it unlike me\nIf you know a guy has got X amount of yards to break a record does that impact ... who you play on that team for that game specifically like is there like would you what\nTime I go to the to a a receiver um see better receiver got one spot to fill and it's a you know it's not a top name receiver and another game would you give it the edge to the guy who's got the quarterback going for the record just based on you know they're going to try and get that done in that game\nYeah you got you things you'd go for milestones and you also go for your over honors right those are the two games we play when you're going and try to decide between players we don't necessarily look at\nAt some of the the target counts can fluctuate right 'cause a lot of folks just look at straight target counts as opposed to what the game's script was they might have down Twenty one nothing after a quarter and all of a sudden there's Thirteen targets well they've gotta hang an asterisk on that one right 'cause the game to play out\nAs a normal flow if you're unless you're getting married every week then Thirteen as as a magic number but in this particular case for Drew Brees going up against Washington given up only eleven points or fantasy points per game two opposing\nOoh not to you but they are\nOh so that's you know you always have that Washington also coming off of by week so figure they come in with a decent script but you're still looking at Drew Brees he's going to break that mark certainly probably by the end of the first\nOr my car and Fox Sports radio is fantasy football insiders with this year on up is art disco fantasy you can watch 'em at swollen dome on Twitter ... and you can watch this uh on periscope during your friends we got hundreds showed up really man yeah we're really crazy is the hottest disco party uh this side of a\nOf the other studios in the building well I got some other ideas\nOf how to how to get this party ramped up but I don't well I thought I'd leave it surprised\nMe you know by you know guys we're not really great well I have I Walk in it's just passed\nLast as long as I get set up to join you each week yeah we get to see some entry yeah we do I get up and down the street here yeah a lot of 'em and and occasionally they walk into the studio but that's that is ...\nI'm now we you talked about you you look at you know over under Z and you look at milestones\nAnd over under that is through the roof and it makes a lot of sense seeing all the injuries and what you've seen from those defenses is Atlanta in Pittsburgh I talked about my my sympathy for the falcons I really do feel bad for them because they better just a bad run of luck in certain spots over the past couple of years\nWhat jumps out to you from ... fantasy perspective in this game Steelers falcons\nWhile we play 'em all but they the one difficult proposition is trying to figure out what devout freemans going to be this week coming back off the injury right he's going to be available\nHow much does that he'll off any extra production for seven cold and so now it pulls his sealing down and now you're looking at both guys is back and choose slash likes plays for your your running back physician because this one is going to be a\nA Thirteen to ... there's no chance in hell no you got to watch for starters already done for Atlanta\nMet right get finished so like we are ... you see of lofty in all ... like yeah you like yard is that is great gimme Calvin Ridley\nWhen the money's on the line that he had been great so far man phenomenal last three weeks to come up with more touchdown perceptions and Leo Joneses had in well over a year or at this point so he becomes the guy maybe take a little bit of a of a shot with Austin Hooper just\nSo we could yellow and we will
