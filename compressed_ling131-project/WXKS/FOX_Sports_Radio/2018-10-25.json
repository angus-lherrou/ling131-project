their runs have been scored\nFiasco and catastrophe are also\nWords you can use another adjective or how about let's go with nightmare inducing that says that two words I guess as to its nightmare those\nAre so what do the Dodgers do now my my theory is they need to visit the app store 'cause they're super app their computer the\nAlgorithms are off a little bit here they got a book they got to go to the app store get that bug fix performance improvement they need that it's not working probably out of whack and we know day Roberts is very robotic\nLittle field to the game here it's ... by

give up\nBut the Dodgers\nMailed it in the world with our Jake late and game too it was embarrassing they phoned it in those at bats and that's you do that again you start getting ready for concessions\nIf you do that again so it's on them and we'll we'll see how this plays out and they say they lose their just better than I was well you know when you go out with a little tough it's a little determination that those are not bad things can show some backbone that's not a terrible thing either yes\nOr so the amount of the show on Fox and meanwhile we have the penny let's get to it right now here we got one game one game only\n[noise] welcome players [laughter] welcome\nIt's time now [laughter]\nAs we age in the national football league it kicks off with a Thursday night [noise]\nFoot ball situation and yes it is on Fox you need to watch the Miami Dolphins that foreign three the Houston Texans at four and through the Texans should be for two and one at best they've got three of their wings were gifted\nVia incompetence by the other team but it's on Fox and yes Joe Buck on his way to LA you will stop in Houston which is actually good for him breaks up that long coast to coast flight against the jet stream so we'll stop and Houston and called the game on Fox tonight and every media critic will celebrate the hustle of\nJoe Buck traveling first class\nTo call a football game ... should win the Nobel Peace prize for that or what a tremendous acts of courage anyway [noise] I Can't because I care so the Texans opened up to seven and a half point favorite the line is still at seven and a half the public loves Houston and his game\nAlmost eighty percent betting on the Texans I get it I understand the logic behind that but\nI'm going to go sideways you I'm gonna take the Miami Dolphins a small play on the dolphins but a play nonetheless I I'll tell you why\n[noise] hey\nI'm uncomfortable with the Texans being favored by more than a touchdown considering their quarterback situation and the way the team has played most of the year I feel like that's an unrealistic number to reach and I get that Miami's defense blows the dolphins are they have been\nBetter on the road though than they've ever been home they have to figure out how to stop the run that's been a problem but you can make adjustments that does happen the dolphins actually average more yards for play then the Texans on off and put that in the files of hard to believe and B\nWhy do generally like home teams are you listening to me I usually pick the home teams on Thursday night we've seen that go sideways a little bit\nUh recently but the Sean watching belongs in a full body cast at this point he called me a clown all he wants but Texas is home favorites in the bill Brian era had been favored [noise]\nWhether it be by a little bit or a lot twenty five times they're two games above five hundred as the home favorite in the bill O'Brian here that's not very good\nThe dolphins defense has to clearly step up keep the game post she put eight men in the box you you focus on the running game you're forced to Sean watching is fragile delicate body to make plays call it Brock ... veins not to win the game but the cover the spread\nTexans Nineteen dolphins Thirteen and a penny back [noise]\nPenny agrees with your band do the dolphins alright pick that up I'll be watching [noise]\n'cause there's nothing else to watch [laughter] so I'm ... the hell else you know watch some random NBA game and I'm a terrible game was wow\nWe'll see you never know what will the Sean Watson make it through the game will he ended up in the injury ... no no that changes the whole thing you go to the backup quarterback and then we're like wow we bring in Steve this savior right on the ...\nNFL on Fox TV and college football on a fast one Thursday nights number Thirteen West Virginia hosts Baylor tomorrow\nYou have any new negatives that you want to throw the lives that you do you know who the backup quarterback for the Texans is\nThat's not sound Savage a no no no it is brain didn't we all\nJust shown watching his one twisted ankle or one ... away from Brandon with do you want brand and we didn't as a seven and a half point favorite if you're a gambler I Would say no\nTo say you're hate scam and you're not again we get all the say you're a you\nKnow I hate to say no I I don't have\nTo become legal the Supreme Court signed off on it\nYes yeah ah by the way you is not a negative that but you were talking the Dodgers didn't play my first month and a half sixteen and twenty five was the record that was the franchises worst start since year one in Los Angeles they were on pace for nearly a hundred last year and it made the world series\nThey were sixteen and twenty six may seventeenth from that point forward they were pretty much even with the red Sox in the standings\nSo they decided not to show up for the first month and a half and Justin Turner without\nMuch like your favorite and like no one no one who is it it's weird thing in baseball the culture of baseball people hold this against baseball teams that they don't have the British drug in basketball you see guys sandbagging your team same bag on the ground I guess he's record\nAnd they still end up winning like last year the Golden State warriors did not have a better record the Houston Rockets does that matter when they play in the in the play oh no jak acts\nLakers always topsy that at all\nSo my friends are ... who worked here for about two weeks and then he left or is it about two or three months or whatever but anyway so it was good guys with veteran a media guy and radio guy and all that stuff\nSo he sends me that as you said the Dodgers ... this is like you you must have sent this to him your shadow texting my friend said so and so ... is writing a book and he sends me mistakes he says the Dodgers are two losses away from going zero for their three back to back World Series opportunities\nIn the fifties seventies now here in the twenty Seventeen to twenty Eighteen and he said if the\nDodgers lose the world series they will be the loan losing his franchise in the world series history with fourteen World Series losses if they do not come back\nI think I mentioned it last night around the world series this would be losing fourteen out of the twenty in other words since Sandy Koufax retired they've won to write in fifty years\nAnd that is such a negative\nJust dealing with the facts here I mean how many somebody else has Thirteen losses in the world to\nBe so it has a messy pessimistic I Am so ah so opposite view I Am so positive over here and you're so now\nYou reject all my positive then valor yes Mr positive or negative over there it's very uncooperative as well as only put up with you I don't understand uncooperative yes\nNegative Nancy at least you actually show up on my house is going to say you can you hear somebody else to do the differences one Ralph's year he's like the Dodgers those final sixteen ounce ground Bob strike a low key and that's that's my man Ralph right there\nYeah well not everybody stays up normally 'til six am eastern I think that may have something to do with his not speaking for him but that may have something to do with it yeah\nWell again get some get some ... like you just like when you're standing in the dugout it's embarrassing when you're wearing mittens\nIn the world series you should get out of nowhere in less it's snowing and even then and trying to fix or were they officially license meant and yeah they had the Dodgers logo and oh well then they he had the support of major league baseball by a lot of people over in van eyes that can be buying Dodger MIT [laughter]\n\nSorry it's a it's great yeah now I have some movies that are up anyway\nSo when I called in the morning showing in Maine in the morning job I we talked a lot about Blair we were we were going over ... some

was down today and it was it was\nLooked like it was going to hit him in the ... and it it the ball to the ballpark so I I don't have a real problem with that but I I think in general like let's look at the thirty thousand foot view of this ... not that you have to really think about everybody's feelings\nNecessarily as being your your first and foremost concerned um but you got to have a feel for for what certain decisions made\nAnd Cody ... just one of the animals yes MVP Fenway Park his first ever World Series game and\nHe's down the line up and he's one of your core players you hold for the next five years and maybe even longer if a sign of long term what are you doing that to me is is a\nIs a bad tone the set and ... and part of it is ... you know if if the Dodgers don't win the world series you got a guy who who won the animals to guess MVP and yet he's going to enter the end of the off season wondering how is team feels about that that should happen\nAnd I think more over when when you do that it\nAlso gives a certain I I Believe level of of I don't want to say panic but but questioning among the rest of the other line up the players I always says clay players are really smart they are\nAnd and you've got to managers who were very smart players that are involved in the series\nAnd and when this started getting made to an excess of\n... extend and I'm not really blaming day Robert this is sort of the it's been a philosopher the Dodgers but when when a lot of decisions get made that that raise an eyebrow the players talk about it at the batting cage to talk about dinner they talk about it when they're\nJust chilling out the hotel or what whether shrunk the ballpark\nAnd and those are conversations that you really probably shouldn't be having an gave one of the world series you should just be thinking about wow this is incredible were in the world series where Raul line up out there and see if we are the best team in the world that's all you got to think about\nIs that it's it's sure this cat really been playing here or should he be batting this bottle and up and it it invites a level of\nCommentary that is in my judgment counterproductive and and I think at times the Dodgers have been a a\nHesitant team in the last couple of days that was it hasn't been all bad they had a lead last night which out for all the controversies traded playing pretty well ... well actually on both sides of the ball I think it's brought up the best of them in some respects so there are positives there but it just seems like it's a big ball once they they just haven't had it and\nAnd I and I wonder if if having things a bit more aligned for them over the last couple of days off ... standpoint personnel stay ... would have been a little more productive for them\nWere talking to Jon rosy live here and the guy go out kick studios where it's easy to say Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance guy go go to guy go dot com or ... eight hundred nine four seven auto\nThe only hardboard figuring out which way is easier uh one hard porn I think for people who are young like I think about this from the perspective of my kids were watching the world series last night\nAnd my ten year old says the ... the the Red Sox used to be bad in baseball right dad and I yeah yeah that's kind of a big part of baseball history in war is that the red Sox weren't very good there are a lot of people listening to us right now John ... worked twenty or younger maybe driving in with their parents to school\nOr they are ah you know on their way to college there was another ... gas whatever they're doing\nIn their lives if you are twenty or younger the red Sox are one of the most dominant franchises if not the most dominant franchise in baseball\nBig picture how stoning is it to you that the red Sox have gone from this Kirsten loser to basically the Yankees in the last Fifteen to Twenty years\nIt is remarkable and and it's it's funny how are you still will read stories about about New England fatalist them in the context of the red Sox and this is not true anymore\nThat's what's the where where the federalism\nAnd for what reason what'd you still have it ... like the those that oh you're you're just waiting for the for the next bad thing that happened oh you're not\nThat many cases nearly two thousands and and I think that I go back and this this twenty year span of of Boston sports and I I'll preface it by saying I was living there in college for the first\nFour years of this of this century so I\nYou're on your heart of the guy you could tell us where you went to school well\nThat's I I guess uh I went to school outside Boston was that are outside Boston or or near Boston um I I I'll say this that and that and that\nTwenty year span every single Boston team was won a championship\nAnd I and I will give the patriots or a degree of credit for this because it really they were the team that when they when the the the back to back titles are there earlier the or the the two consecutive or the titles or early in the the ... century\nYou you felt the mentality of the city start to change as crushing is two or three was for the red Sox in in in the postseason against the Yankees\n... it seem as though just the way the patriots played\nA team that had in their own way not as much of a winning tradition for a long time until the Brady bill ... era began of course it at the the one ... role parents with with what so\nBut it was the expectation that town start to change and now you're at a spot where I think it was just Fletcher who tweeted a is a writer for the orange guy register\nHe tweeted that his son wanted to write root for the Yankees because the Yankees were the team that it adds\nA longer drought in the house relatives of dogs we just\nGot like ... makes you laugh legwork up all the older guys that's this ridiculous but that's how it is right now so uh I think that a big part about it as Ben I'm the change in attitude a change in in in mentality and I think it's proven to just as with was with the cubs\nPurse we can talk a lot of there was a cursor dot the reality is good players good players and players that are playing for each other go a long way toward removing curses because then you're no longer thinking about a hundred years or eighty six years it's about my buddies and playing with my buddies and the ...\nThe the cowboy up team had that way about them the cubs ... way about them to break cures sixteen\nAnd ever since then it's been really unique grown competitive players that have done it for the red Sox in in ... or so seven Thirteen now this is ... what's what's unique about this team\nOr the best baseball players of the planet and he plays the game without any fear saying what bad and the left field same boat urge to re there's just there's a lot of confidence that has made history existed totally null and void\nAnd it ... it's pretty remarkable for me to watch that but over the last twenty or so\nYears away to put it into context if you are a forty years old which I almost or let's say you were born in Nineteen Seventy nine will just use me as an example if the red Sox win this World Series then in the last forty years effectively\nThere will have been five titles for the Yankees and for for the red Sox so I mean you know it's funny you know and then the last Yankee title obviously was two thousand nine a but it is intriguing in that respect to what to sit back All right let's go for the last question for you into LA\nThe Dodgers absolutely positively have to win at least two to even bring this series back right we all know that based on basic math they probably need to win all three to really have a a realistic chance of winning this series what happens in LA\nI I didn't find a way that went to a three and at least it forced back to Boston I think\nGame three to me has Dodger victory Rutte written all over it this is a case where you're coming back home the weather's going back in your favor or you've got your ... your best pitcher\nChange of venue change mentality everything says Dodger went in game three I think they will a team that they've been resilient they were down against the brewers are ... and the series' early and came back and won that one um they were down in the division right that we're down nine games in the early part of me\nBut this this is going to see just how unified they are and I think sometimes the\nThe the the the changing nature of the lineup get hurt that and and they hurt the confidence of players but this is just how far they are how much they're playing for each other I Believe they come back and the robbers is is a great managers got great field for his players\nAs it has at it that way over the air I Believe David at the ready to play the dodge one game three\nOutstanding stuff as always John rosy uh enjoyed that Michigan season will talk to you next week\nSo drink lots of a sudden he gave her to come in and then I look forward to talking about baseball football hero over the coming weeks\nPerfect that is John rosy J. O. N. MOS I follow him thinking for getting up early with us we'll be bringing in our update guy whose name as immediately escaping me I Apologize introduce yourself\nAkeley Brian family we actually met at the SEC football media days a couple of years ago wanted to mention that view is really enjoyed meeting you tie obviously remember very well [laughter]\nYou're a busy man a JD march Gina's provided the red Sox with a much needed spark again to the world series last night [noise]\nThis guy Mr seeing was out picking pieces of water up when the group of monkeys launch their attacks on Thursday it's believed the monkeys had armed themselves with bricks they collected earlier\nFrom a rundown building villagers have repeatedly complained aggressive monkeys in the area have made their lives hell but the animals are protected species so little can be done\nOr Mr seeing his brother told the times of India monkeys through more than twenty bricks at his brother on Thursday thrown for quite a hike the brics were enough to kill him\nThese rogue monkeys are the real culprits and must pay for it Mr ... family has lodged a formal complaint and named monkeys as the accused but police in this they cannot prosecute monkeys and have declared the debt an accident\nThey want the monkeys prosecuted that would be one hell of a trial can you imagine being in India covering the monkeys are on the witness stand there a chit when seeing a station officer at do get police station said how can we register the case against monkeys this will make us a laughing stock\nDeadly attacks by monkeys have been on the rise throughout the country and wildlife experts say they're usually to blame a back in two thousand seven the deputy mayor died after being attacked by a horde of wild monkeys um this is an unbelievable story so\nAn a or the story goes on and on the city has employed monkey catchers to round them up so they can be moved to the forest it's unacceptable to kill the monkeys because\nThey are considered God like by devout Hindus or they believed the monkey God Hogan and often feed them bananas and peanuts or so a rough break you think you've got an a rough day could be worse you could have been just out picking up sticks and you get killed by monkeys\nAre there is another tiger in the news quite Oh yes a rare white tiger mulder zookeeper to death inside the animals enclosure in southern Japan last Tuesday\nBut he seems by the way to happen all the time maybe don't go into the enclosure with the tigers I mean I feel like every month we have a tiger mall as we keep her to death and they're always like the tigers seems so nice yeah right\nYou wait till you hear the end of the story so police say that forty year old a cure for show was found bleeding from his neck in lying on the floor or last Monday evening inside the cage ed hero cause do a logical park in the southern in the southern part of Japan you officials say that he went inside the cage to clean the enclosure\nAnd was attacked while trying to move\nThe male tiger too it's night cage\nNow here's the crazy part this male tiger by the way he's recoup he was the data the tranquilizer before first responders and police arrived\nBut his family say they do not want the tiger to ... be put down the zoo says we planted not kill recoup and continue to keep it because the ... family asked us to do so\nWell I don't know about that I mean I think if ah you know like the tigers just behaving like a Tiger Woods having said that there is no way I Want to go into that tiger enclosure to feed him\nMaybe have a trap door at the top where you drop something in also this just hit me is it's not the greatest away to cover up of murder ever can you imagine not take it like if you wanted to get away with murder\nLike if all those people in Saudi Arabia who killed that journalist if instead of doing that and like chopping up his body if they had just claimed that he jumped into a tiger enclosure and they drop the tiger or they dropped the body and there would anybody question it\nWell I mean he uses zookeeper he was trying to clean now I understand what I'm saying if you had oh just in general\nAnd yet as your alibi you claim that he got attacked by the tiger or certainly if you worked at the zoo like wouldn't this be the great you're saying like with all the time\nIf Tony Soprano\nBut yesterday in the trunk took him out and then dropped them into a jaguar enclosure especially if it was a guy who already worked at the zoo yeah then you're never getting convicted of murder\nI'm just telling you if you work at a zoo and you'd think somebody might want you dead better watch your back and not just for the tiger they might throw you in the tiger enclosure and claim that tiger did it because people like me are going to be like of course the tiger ate him\nEven if the evidence isn't there think about it the greatest crime ever maybe just tossing it out there my

Campbell and Jean Smith the athletic director at Ohio State\nIs it well known out there that ... Campbell is a dream job is to take over as Ohio State coach he's from Ohio 'cause I would've thought if\nUrban Meyer is going to leave I would've thought that Ryan Day would slide right in just like we saw with Lincoln Riley and Oklahoma when Bob Stoops last\nThis is pretty wild so this is again you can bet on this now the odds are officially out there there seems to be a lot of possibility that urban Meyer is going to write off into the sunset and by the way\nThe wait at Ohio State looked against Purdue\nI'm not even convince at Ohio State is going to win out and be in position to play against Michigan for the big cities title\nI kinda think Maryland or Michigan State may well be to Ohio State to\nOhio State can't run the football they can't defend anybody and they got to have a couple of pretty tough games before they even get to Michigan\nIt's possible that when that Michigan game happens if Michigan has continued to win that even if Jim Harbaugh loses Michigan is still going to win the Big Ten east\nSo just put a pan and that it's a story worth paying attention to that there are now substantial gambling odds that urban\nMeyer is not going to be back next year and not only that urban Meyer is not going to be back next year but the Mac Campbell may be the coach to replace him\nFrom Iowa State we got people all over Iowa right now ramming their heads into the steering wheel cycle own fans out there saying my God clay we finally get a decent coach we finally start winning some games and now you're telling me he's the odds on favorite to leave us for Ohio State yeah I'm Sorry cycling\nFans that's what I'm telling ya so unfortunate but I'm just going\nBack to something\nThat's gonna really upset her but a Homer Simpson if urban Meyer retires and rides off in the sense that what I said was\nI just ... not that old and the guy somebody woke up how old is urban Meyer is like fifty three I mean he's not very old at all that's my guess over under urban Meyer is fifty three and he would still in theory compared to some of his contemporaries have a lot of years left of coaching\nUsually while Romney yeah okay it's pretty close so he's fifty four so wild to me that if he left Ohio State he would be done coaching that's why I said hey maybe look at us see I'm not sold on clay held and in the long term\nCould they potentially make a writer urban Meyer or if you Jackson can't get things solved down at the browns is it possible urban Meyer could go into Ohio I just don't think he's going to go back to ESPN it'd be a TV analyst first of all I didn't think he was that good at it secondly I think it's clear he doesn't really want to do that\nThis urban Meyer story is is intriguing and fascinating but the extent to which histories repeating itself and we're basically saying the same thing that happened at Florida now happening at Ohio State is is pretty pretty wild\nWe'll talk about that maybe a little bit with Dan Wetzel he's covered this urban Meyer story but more importantly he covered this college basketball story and if you are remotely interested in college athletics this case is massive because basically what it did is a codified in cw rules and said if\nYou pay players to go to the schools you are committing a federal crime and we'll go to prison\nPrior to this case\nMost people had just kinda thumbed their nose at NCWA rules and said well it's not like paying players is criminal behavior now a jury has agreed that if you pay players to go to a college it's criminal behavior and you could go to prison for years\nThis is a massive story we're going to talk with Dan Wetzel about it and the verdict came down all also ask him about urban Meyer all that to come next but first it's never a good book when you on TALK a long bulky dress shirt\nYou may think it makes you look casual\nBut more than likely it just ends up looking sloppy\nThat's why on TALK it makes shirts designed to be worn on talked a casual shirt that's not too long and not too short it's just right shirts designed so well GQ calls them\nPerfection unstuck it shirts or go to for any occasion from casual dressy and not only they look good they feel great impeccable craftsmanship and attention to detail make on suck it the only choice for the and talked to a man with more than fifty seizing options\nEvery guy can find the perfect shirt whether you have a six pack or haven't seen your abs since college log on to ... dot com and check out all the new fall arrivals\nUse the promo code clay for twenty percent off your entire first time purchase you can also visit on TALK it at one of their over forty retail locations throughout the country stop hiding your shirt with your pants and your pants with your shirt\nOn socket dot com your solution to perfecting casual used furlough code clay that the L.

different violations that came up and and plus the modeling\nAnd it was almost like if you know the ah Baton Rouge newspaper advocate reports so and so did this she'd be like oh my God huge story but because of just have like you know I have a Lance I think it just was like oh okay oh and then there's this and that was so whatever it was but\nUm I mean the NCAA have to stand down right on the fed said we're not giving any information you guys stay in your lane will you you know do not start investigating this word charge right now and the NCAA complied with that and that's not started investigating\nThought they could put\nIt could do like fifty cases right now and you've got under oath testimony wiretaps yeah great evidence\nWell in our enemy wonders why would the NC double a ever conducted another investigation if the FBI considers this to be a crime why wouldn't the NC double A. just hand off everything to the FBI\nYeah and I don't know if the if I don't think the FBI is going to want to I Hope they don't want to take this job I mean among other things to do here I mean\nIf the UN thing but I thought that the charges came out I mean here's a here's my other question you said that you don't think\nMost people have been you know like the the individual details there were so many of them about paying players you're right I have a theory that public opinion has shifted in a major way\nAnd that there is finally been so many of these violations that your average fan out there listening to me right now just assume that every major program is paying players or their families in some way and\nThey just don't care which is a big shift from the belief that was out there for decades which was oh my school's clean but that other school man they're dirty look at what they do to get players we would never do that\nI think everybody kind of assumes now\nThat all of these college programs are in the mud to gather and this idea of white hat black cat which is you know some guys I mean look or their guys coaches who are way beyond the rules probably and others that are much closer to not violating and everything else but by and large this is the age of way where everybody is dirty right\nShades of gray yeah uh you know it was about I don't know how many years ago now the Charles Robinson I Yahoo we decided like we've got sick of hearing like about it and said hey let's investigate everybody yeah and we went on a uh like I ... and where we did\nYou know or the Miami one was a big one but you know Oregon and Ohio State and Yukon basketball and I can't even remember all the way to start a peeled off like at on a row in about two years and that just to to to sports writers right yeah um\nWhen we took a lot of work it was hard but you know we just did it and it was in the essay like change there's rules is all chaotic\nChaotic and everyone's like oh my God there's all this ... ... they were like we're under duress and there's trouble it's like well we did was show going on you were always doing this now that's two sports writing now you've got the FBI jumps in on that\nAnd boom they got I mean you know we can't wiretap you obviously know should know should we be able to yeah um\nYou know and and bag but they could go even further now I mean this is the thing they're still for assistant coaches at Arizona Auburn\nUm Oklahoma State and us the former former assistant coaches who are standing trial who have to sit there right now and go gosh we might lose like I've got a good chance to lose and maybe I\nMaybe I Will they still has got CJ gas Noah eat is the quote unquote Adidas Batman who handed out money all over the country on behalf of Adidas he can he can move on to he could tell a million stories\nUm and then you just go off the line I mean they could roll everybody up and they can switch over to football\nYou can if you they want people will be making clean deals and you've got boom boom boom boom and you can just stack everybody up like every wall she\nI yeah I don't if they want to I wrote a column about today Ted this get U.S attorneys like the most powerful man in college athletics right now I mean he can determine everything which he and his boss of the side or going to expand this case right now I don't know if they will\nBut as much as the fans of college sports I think have shifted their attention if you read the quotes from the U.S attorney the Justice Department right now\nThey're like we're we've defended this ideal or that everybody loves the sports you know a ... ... it's like Nineteen fifty five or something some ... I Would get back in back of the debt and I think most of us like gosh you know roll your eyes like us\nSettled out it's not that big of a deal\nYou know and and and and I think the concept to like like\nBrian bowl and who have these guys are paid to play some or basketball in high school by shoe company\nAnd and my point it's always been if it did he just wants to give ten Fifteen twenty five I don't care how much they get their money for for someone to play some or basketball or dying Williams play basketball ... Williamson is one point seven million Instagram policies massively influential teenagers\nAnd Nike or Adidas wants to spot let them let the kid makes the money who cares like it it's not hurting anybody for guys it's a great summer job and\nWhat do you that's the reality I think with fans increasing like the FBI super conservative right now and so it's just like in the Justice Department is super conservative and it's like half an hour and a boss this up with some teeth to prison I mean they could pretty much go and get\nYou know a heck of a lot of coaches that you were names you do know throughout college athletics like that that's got to make a lot of people nervous\nWhy do you think so ... is rolled up in this you've written about the sneaker wars before he is probably a fair to say if Adidas was doing it now he was trying to do it Reebok was trying to do it why did Adidas end up the focal point as opposed to other companies\nVenus was the focal point because a guy I mean I hear your something stupid it's gotten Marty blazer caught a financial guy in Pittsburgh\nViolating a FCC rules of security in exchange the rest and not for\nThe call that's we love you help us but not as big of a deal and he got out of trouble like saying hey I'll give you the college basketball scandal and I mean talk about someone who violated real rules yeah and and he gets leading the due to prosecute God's\nFiling pretend rules like hurt anybody if a deal is paying a sixteen year old basketball player there are no victims\nBut yes he is you know so but they make this deal they want basketball so they go after\nThis case Mardi brought them this financial planner who brought them this middleman and they say set up a sting operation we two FBI agents working Under Cover for years on that\nAnd they got an e this is Jim ... on wiretaps and so that's why he just got wrapped up at night is not on the wire tap but they could create another wiretap\nSo you know that's really why it was this group but this is just one small group out of you know fifty such groups\nAnd do your your middle ... Williamson who is this are you going to become if he's not already you also said he's got a lot of Instagram followers and everything else this is the guy who's famous in social media\nAnd will become famous in real media as soon as he starts playing for Duke\nIs is somewhat similar to Cam Newton or because Cam Newton was under fire in a big way and I feel like most people just really don't care about die on Williams and and that's why I say I feel like public attitudes have shifted substantially on this story\nWhat do you think about die on Williams and Willie play for Duke is there anything that is going to happen to him he might be the overall number one draft pick in twenty Nineteen [laughter] [noise]\nI'm sure it probably play for it I Would be surprised that that that changed although there is a Cam Newton rule that got put in place where your father or some family member or\nActually just ask for it for you here while assume the role of being an agent and you can be suspended for that\n... cameras able to keep playing 'cause like hey you didn't know\nWhat his dad was asking for not even got just asking for they again they made the rules even more conservative in height boom here we are so I don't know what I ... I and it's a really good ball player he's not going to be ... or ... what if you watch ...\nHe's about two hundred and Seventy five pounds but can fly and dumb\nLike Michael Jordan practically at so easily fascinating player to watch and that's why so popular with kids because it's perfect olives I ended up last night as high school game it's on that chat\nWas eight seconds that he can do is incredible dog or Instagram that's why it's so many followers I think also people appreciate what science maybe a little different than Cam Newton but\nThis kid's has already created a brand like he's invaluable any hey buddy who can inspire almost two million teenage years a company wants to do business with cameras a good football player that schools are trying to get\nI think it's a little different like ... Williamson right now I taught the agents were calm during this\nWhen the trial he could sell an Instagram post with an advertisement muscle Melbourne Nike or whatever it is eight or eight\nI don't know if they're going to have these trials and I don't know if the U.S attorney's office in in the Justice Department in New York wants to expand that all people up just give please and and just and this\nQuickly or do they want to take please make these guys cooperating witnesses and expand and indict others because they're certainly could do that if they're this fired up about\nPeople paying college athletes well guess what there are a lot of people out there paying college athletes so they could expand it\nUh I don't know what goes on there the other thing of course the people I think missing they want the small stuff they're missing the big picture on this but what does the NCAA do they have not gotten investigating\nA minimal presence but the the court I think they wanted this thing just to go away um the ... the year the Justice Department told them to hold off until cold\nAh but then they can they can start investigating one called the cat and they put you know dozens of schools like you're getting them up or whatever the case was our small there was lots of evidence presented at trial there's a lot or that was it it just didn't fit\nThe the narrative of the cage or whatever they're a streamlined argument you're trying to make as a prosecutor or weren't allowed in as evidence from the judge because like even irrelevant\nBut there are coaches on wiretaps there are more bank records there are more a test them all you know sworn testimony do the FBI or so\nThe case to get really big and all sorts of places it's just that one really knows what's next but this was a huge victory for the government and and will be a if I Want to punish these people I just don't you have got a stomach go after fifty programs\n[noise] here's the final question for you I think a lot of times when people hear these cases they think oh those guys deserve their punishment here you've got a lot of guys I think who were just kind of regular Adidas employees it's not like they're making millions of dollars is not like they're close to being a CEO\nThese are middle management types who are these guys who have been convicted of crimes one of their lives like what did you pick up from them as this trial played out\nYeah I mean Christian doctrines young guy which is hot on and trying to get a career going he wanted to be a sports agent he's out there meeting requires and all that you know this is not a wealthy guy hadn't made a lot of money on it I'm sure you've got a moral code both in their forties\nI'm Adidas consultants and an executive branch you've gotta work to do this for twenty five years he worked in the marketing department he's making a hundred and thirty nine thousand dollars a year after twenty five years with the company\nIt's a lot of money it's a good living but\nIn Portland that's expensive city you know you're not you thought while when that it um he's got a family I mean he's almost fifty to look at him and be like you really were putting the skyway all three of these guys are not ... society I don't believe at any point any of them ever thought they were breaking the law\nNone of them the FBI presenting nothing about them like skimming money or stealing money\nOr or you know driving fancy cars or anything like that um they were just ... they were involved in a crazy business college athletics which is crazy because we hadn't seen rules make it crazy and try to stop capitalism for as long as these kids go there so\nI just felt bad for for something that I just you know that was it like hey let's deal is money are less hurt this person or they were just really doing chaotic jobs\nMan a follow Dan Wetzel this story far from over but certainly the government got a big win and it is messy for college basketball for college fans are this story far from over day and I appreciate the time outstanding stuff as always\nThanks very popular like that than what soldiers do follow him on Twitter like I said at the end what so if you enjoy this story go read his columns if you want more information on it maybe instead of enjoy it\nI think it's drastically under covered if you are a college sports fan uh and uh our three coming up next we'll get some gambling picks with my guy Todd bourbon he works on lock it in television show with me he'll be on with us in our number three all that and more plus will die back in the Dodgers Red Sox our three next on al\n...

those two time zones\nShould you dictate everything for the people who are the eighty percent instead of the twenty I don't know\nYou guys feel this you guys are on the west coast you don't I like being on the west coast for television if I moved I said the\nYesterday if I had to choose between being an east coast guy or a west coast guy I Would rather live on the west coast\nI liked the fact that you can watch Monday Night football and it's over at like eight thirty and you can still take your wife out to dinner like hey I got to watch this I got to watch this that this game and then when it's over I can still go out to dinner I liked when I was in LA and I would do a TV\nUm and we would finish like midnight on the west coast and it would be three am on the east coast and my Twitter feed was entirely silence there's like the people I fall in the west coast might still be awake at midnight but the entire east coast is asleep\nAnd so I look I I I'd like to living on the west coast but I think when you are in the east coast sports fan and oftentimes the schedule the west coast is predicated on valuing their time zone you just don't see it\nAnd I tried to be balanced and talked about teams on both coasts but it's hard to be on top of the NBA when the two best stories by far are the warriors and the Lakers and both those games are not going to be over until one am on the east\nCoast and I got to show that starts at six am on the east coast am I crazy or do you see this to energy\nNot not only do I see this I'm sure everybody on this on the show can relate because even though we live on the west coast here in Los Angeles we sleep east coast hours\nSo they don't even when they leave east coast hours you have an overnight shift right well what I mean by east coast ours is when it's nine pm here it might as well be midnight 'cause I got to be up in a couple of hours so I feel that pressure\nThat people feel on the east coast where when the game's going late late I'm praying and doesn't go into overtime or extra innings because that's too late for me I Need to get to bed\nRight no that makes some sense um but yeah we've got to be a real ours you yeah well yeah two parts\nI think it's gonna be a real issue for the NBA this year I I really do and I talked about this a little bit on the show I think a lot of people got used to at least being able to watch all abroad and I think a big part of why Braun became LeBron is obviously his talent\nBut I Do I Do think it's significant that all of his biggest games were taking place by and large in the east coast time zone\nSo eighty percent of your overall market is able to put your name on when they get home from work and kick back and put your feet up and look people on the west coast get home they put on LeBron and the second half and they get ready for washing staffing the warriors and everything else it's kind of surrounding that\nBut when you start those east coast basketball games at seven pm eastern I it's kind of awesome you\nKnow at six o'clock my time I can kick back I Know I get the whole game I Know I can watch it all but some of these games starting so late man I just I I think about because I Know it's been a long term conversation I Know baseball has been talking about this for a very very long time about what it does to grow the next generation of baseball fans\nAnd I think about that a little bit through the eyes of myself but so much of what I Do now that I'm a dad is my my viewpoint to a large extent has shifted when it comes to sports and I now watch most sporting events through the eyes of my kids\nLike I really wanted the titans to beat the chargers in London because I root for the titans\nBut I had all three of my kids they're now the youngest one it was great\nHe was on his he was on his mom's phone like he's four he has no idea what happened the game was over everybody's talking about it\nAnd one of his brother says hey Nash who won that game is like the titans on gay he had no idea you know I like that's a good way to be at this but like he thought the titans one he was happy he was in a great mood didn't impact them at all but my other two boys the ten year old and the eight year old I watch now through their eyes having been ten eight\nAnd so everything about sports I think about from their perspective\nAnd I wanted the titans the win for them right so they could be there and be like oh this was awesome you know went to London and the team on and it was great they're going to remember the awesome trip anyway but you watch it through their eyes more than you watch it through ah through my eyes and like last night when we're watching game too\nAnd my ten year old just falls asleep and he's interested right he's engaged in the game he wants to watch it and he's just out\nI Do think about that in a large extent and and what I mean it happens so often with ah with these games like these guys and my kids are big warrior stance particularly my eight year old never able to watch the warriors play\nWakes up the next morning gets on YouTube and watches the highlights of what Steph Curry did the night before I mean that's what he's doing literally in my house right now\nI went downstairs I've got the home studio I went downstairs kids are all up they're still on their London time too as well and my eight year old is sitting there with YouTube in front of him on his eye pad\nWatching the highlights of last night's Steph Curry game\nThere's never going to be able to stay up and watch Steph Curry live except for I sometimes let him stay up during the NBA playoffs or when there's a game on Saturday Night something like that I Do think that works against the sports leagues in the long run\nI really do and I understand the argument of hey we have to play this game at a certain hour to make sure that we fit in everybody on the west coast of gets home from work and they can sit down and watch it and everything else\nEighty percent of the sports audience is east coast or central time zone\nAnd I just I it's it's a challenge there is no doubt um and I don't know that there is a good solution but you Philly Danny gee I guarantee you if I opened up phone lines and I just took calls on this there are so many people out there who feel the same way as I Do my solution bills that will get what's your solution might solutions where I just told you to time zones\nHave it time zone on the east coast we have a time zone on the west coast there's only to the whole country is one hour difference\nYou can decide where to draw that line maybe right after taxes could be the Mississippi River if people want that to be the barrier everybody has one time zone I Would go with the central time zone for the entire east coast and I would go with the mountain time zone for the entire rest of the country\nAnd then all day we're only one hour different\nTell me why that is ingenious I don't understand obviously I have lots of crazy ideas but tell me by having one hour to separate the entire country wouldn't be phenomenal because then you could start the games oftentimes at six\nEastern time right and you could start the west coast games at nine eastern time and everybody would be able to watch everything tell me that I'm not making the world a better place with that idea tell me that I shouldn't be national sports are in charge of making the world a better place so everybody can watch every game\nBut I Do try and make the world a better place up next the dastardly beyond likable the thoroughly repellent Todd ferment he's on lock it on lock it in with me he's waking up with us early\nOn the west coast in Las Vegas and he will join us next we'll talk about college football and the NFL also see whether or not he buys the idea of the Dodgers still have a chance ah right now the Boston Red Sox I Believe our minus six hundred\nOr sorry I think I'll I'll give you the odds I just retweeted them uh the world series odds even though the red Sox are up to oh how prohibitive of a favorite or they will tell you the next and in the meantime if you've ever driven past\nThe snowy fit in your by I Ninety you've probably wandered\nWhose idea was to grow grapes there that man was ... and it took him more than twenty two thousand seedlings of grapes\nTo invent the Concord grapes a tough fruit that could thrive in cold winters it was either that\nOr moving to Florida and you can infer by the twenty two thousand attempts\nThat wasn't really an option for a man whose last name was bowl the world's tough as antioxidants Welch as tough as grapes\n[laughter]\nI Know you're the Dodgers look out of your\nTeam is down to games do you go to blame this one on\nAlex way Robards analytic micro managing biased Herschel ... when it comes to the world series [laughter] more radio [noise]\nEven if you're a big time basketball fan there might be a few facts about the game you don't know why did you know that the first hoops were actually peach basket\n[noise] do we get a a a downgrade in our pay if the if the Dodgers get swept ... have you checked your contract to see whether Fox Fox the dings us if they don't get more than four games\nYou know I have not but I mean I kind of joke going into it that I said the Dodgers Red Sox World Series gets back a fraction of the money that Fox probably needed from their World Cup contract after team usa lost the Trinidad so at least I'd like to see this thing go six or seven games so we have happier executives especially if you and I are picking winners on TV\nWell you're picking more winners than I Am I have an outlaw says well if you had the wit walk Los\n... came in for me last week while I was in London and posted the single worst performance for a week that has been posted by anybody including putting all of his money on ... state to win and they lost by like thirty or whatever the final score was there um when do you think I'll actually when a week\nYou know what I mean you you have a leader right now I mean as we come down in the final forty eight hours of shows obviously a huge weekend a college football\nAnd professional football determined that I mean I don't know clay do you have the intestinal fortitude to power through actually put together a winning weekend and get off the ... with the current on your head for that elusive first time if it doesn't happen this week I'm going to set the over under at one and a half victories for you by the end of two thousand Eighteen\nWow wow that's tough there's no doubt or a ... got a win what do you think it was so he's one in three now the Lakers are sitting at one and three what do you think the over under reasonably should be set for now having seen four games play would you adjust at all what the over under for the Lakers should be\nI don't think you change your outlook on this team at all to be honest I mean we've seen this before from the brawn James going into a new city trying to integrate a number of a history pieces last night was interesting and the fact that for public betters had been on the Lakers every single game through their first for\nThe last name was the first time professional betters were actually on the Lakers as well that number open two and a half ended up closing five five and a half and some spots team that's going to be fighting for positioning in that five to eight seed I don't think we're going to be talking about them getting home court\nOn the opening round in the playoffs for me who is typically bored by the first round of the NBA playoffs I Love nothing more than if we got to see the Lakers and the warriors go at it around one\n... that would be incredible what do you think about my idea of having to time zones in the country\nI think it's a good idea that you have three hours every day on radio to talk about these ideas\nRather than worrying us during our TV\nShow arrived to fight for pressure seconds and minutes to have my own air time but I Will agree with you that I think it's borderline ridiculous uh the people on the east coast don't have a chance to watch some of the west coast sporting events and I've always said the best move to watch sport\nIs to move out west if you can handle getting up early for college football and I am in the NFL at ten am on Sunday there is nothing better\nThan being able to watch all of the day sporting events go to bed at a reasonable hour and at the same time I've also wondered as far as the big sporting events I Know we'll talk about a plenty during the NBA playoff why the NBA camp near major league baseball schedule start earlier and allow people on the east coast to watch some of these west coast teams at a reasonable hour\nYeah you know it is interesting because having spent a lot of time on the west coast I think the west coast is vastly superior coast for a sports fan\nBecause like you just said you can go to bed at a deep an hour you can watch all the action a lotta times you can even go out to dinner after the games like let's say you want to stay up 'til ten thirty or eleven you could watch Monday Night football or which is what by like nine o'clock you can take your wife out to dinner and behold by ten thirty\nExactly it's a nice lecture to have and again this argument all the time and some of my close friends they actually believe in the mountain time zone as best because they get an extra hour for the early games and still have that are at the back end\nNo college kid betting the NFL and college football they might not love having to get up early to try and get their action and but thinking about what you do on like the east coast when games don't kick off till one o'clock on Sunday he had like three or four hours you're just trying to kill time until\nIt gets going sure you might try and sneak in a brunch and I know there are folks that go to church and take advantage of that but in reality hit the game's going early in the morning I actually love that he's learning games the kick off at\nSix thirty I say her perfect way to get Sundays going and ride that momentum all the way into Sunday Night Football\nNo I Love it too I Love the early start having been in London for that game I think it's a no brainer to star games or as early as you can All right let's go into the weekends like a let's start in the NFL what do you like the most right now in the NFL\nFor me it's actually a game between now you're below the Carolina Panthers and your Darkhorse MVP candidate Cam Newton against the Baltimore Ravens Baltimore had their hands full and then some last week against the scenes of it wasn't for a missed extra point by adjusting Tucker\nWe could be talking about the raven in control of the division one of the teams to watching the AFC I still think that's the same and this is the week they'll bounce back against the Carolina team who secondary has the major question mark\nThey need a run the football to be successful and those are two things that the ravens will be able to explain I like Baltimore quite a bit\nAh it's not the best for the number right now is Caroline open at one point favorite ravens to point shock but wouldn't be surprised if ultimately Baltimore closes around a three point favorite before we get to Sunday's kickoff\nHow do you play golf and Texans tonight the the Texans sitting right at that are interesting wine point of seven and a half they haven't really moved off that I don't think very much ... going back to the game for both teams Texans have one for in a row the Miami Dolphins trying to at least stay in the wild card races they wait for tannahill to come back or what happens\nAt pretty impressive for the taxes to right the ship I mean you could add them it tend to want to win the AFC South when they were mired in that losing ... slight favorites at a little bit better than even money so good value how'd you seen the force that is winning streak coming together\nWhen I look at Miami a short week ... while I think there is a major concerns with this dolphins off and said why and if you can't protect your quarterback that's not the recipe for success against the Texans I look at Miami's ability to get pressure on opposing quarterback and Cameron Wake becomes the X factor on the defensive side you had to keep the\nSean Watson in the pocket because once he gets to the edge is more than capable of making big place\nI hate to leave this kind of lumber with a home team I just don't have any confidence in Miami Dolphins being able to keep up they were exposed a little bit last week an at home by the lions and while there's been professional money actually coming in on the over here I think the ... of the team that has to do a lion's share of this going to get you there\nAre eight I think the best game in the NFL slate to me is actually going to be on one then you've got another week of waking up early you'll be able to watch this game and I don't mean because I think they're the two best teams I mean because I think there's a lot of injury surrounding this game the jak don't know what's going on with like poodles that quarterback\nThe eagles a lot of ... and going on internally with them to both these teams are three and four one team's going to hit the halfway point and feel like okay we weren't great but we're still alive the other one's going to be three and five and feel like they need to almost at the panic button and what happens in eagle jak\nIt's one of those things you'd go pick your poison I mean the jaguars for the first time in franchise history had failed to score in the first half of three straight football games I mean Blake ... has been an abject disaster aid turnovers and only two touchdowns over the last three weeks ultimately leading to his venturing in favor of Cody Kessler\nAnd then when I look at this jaguars defund secular league and allowing for twenty yards replace secondly you can totally ... second in the lead opponents first down per game however they're thirty first in takeaways in this day and age in the NFL in the office isn't doing its part and you can create short field it's a big problem\nYou mentioned the eagles I had no idea how they blew it to touchdown lead on the road in your backyard against the tide\nOr how they blew a Seventeen nothing lead last week and against Carolina\nDefensively to secondary again a question mark there are good against the run Carson when starting to figure it out but I can tell you the jaguars half the ... with his trip to London and there's been an appetite for the underdog for professional better every time this number gets the three and a half you're seeing some buyback on Jacksonville and wouldn't be surprised at the jak end up winning this came out right is modest shock modest\nGot we got five games going on a tonight in college football is going to surprise people I think five of them Baylor West Virginia probably the best of them although Appalachian State Georgia southern as well as Georgia Tech in Virginia Tech what do you like on the college football's late tonight\nWhen I look at the games and try and pick them of the marquee matchup so I think there's a little bit of wiggle room to go under the total an app state in Georgia southern this'll be again that goes a long way\nIn defining who ultimately emerges atop the sun belt or ... trying to deal with life after a program changing running back in jail and more who had an injury two weeks ago so they look a little bit different but it's fun to watch for folks that haven't seen either of those teams\nGeorgia Tech Virginia Tech or the underdog has fared extremely well in this rivalry and surprisingly enough even with extra time to prepare Virginia Tech hasn't done what you think they would\nAgainst this Georgia Tech option so I Would lean towards the rambling rack\nAnd a game you can see on Fox Sports one like you said probably the best one of the night I think the underdog has quite a bit of value here in Baylor plus Thirteen Annapolis fourteen depending on where you shop right now West Virginia exposed to get the physical opponent and Iowa State\nI just don't trust the mountaineers at this point we'll gr as really struggled holders and it's called them out west Virginia may win but if the minute capable of being a conference opponent by multiple scores\nWe've got a by the way our guy Petro spotted Degas a lot of you will listen to him on five Seventy a I'm Out in LA calling that game tonight obviously you're going with this every Tuesday what about this late in college football in general the biggest game I think by far Georgia Florida how do you see this one\nFor sure and we're a little bit of disagreement here on this game I'm not sure who wins the football game a ... professional money come in on the gators taking the number from seven\nTo six and a half I think we could see more fireworks in Jacksonville than the over under suggested fifty to both of these defenses in my opinion if showed a little bit of frailty against opposing ground attack Georgia they were ill equipped to handle LSU coming with pace in Tampa with Kirby Smart calling out his players for a lack of conditioning", "year": "2018", "show_name": "FOX Sports Radio", "city":
