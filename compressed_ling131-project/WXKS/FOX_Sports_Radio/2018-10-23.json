get to the super bowl you can hear all about the Packers and the chiefs and the super bowl but in the modern era\nAchieved don't they don't get\nNo final point on this there will be competition\nNow in my world Kansas City calls up Arizona said let's make a deal Arizona says okay done and then Patrick Peterson lines up for Kansas City 'cause it would be fun to see how that would play out\nA book Peterson he's a pretty good reputation I don't think he's got any kind of lingering injuries situation to worry about if not Kansas City who else would be involved in the Betty I'm Glad you asked a there would be a gaggle of teams including\nThe ... bird Steve Russell Kansas City is going to be battling Pittsburgh you'd think the patriots would be involved in that needle in a secondary Philadelphia the New Orleans saints Peter since from Louisiana College down there and all that that makes sense Carolina those are all obvious teams\nUh Houston although they're not relevant because they have a terrible coach but the Texans should be involved pretty much anybody who's a clause I contender in the NFL that has defensive shortcomings which is the entire enough\nThey'll just about should consider taking a flyer on Patrick Peterson that is the way to do it\nAbsolutely now meanwhile there was a\nNBA game on Monday Night involving the worst team in basketball the Los Angeles Lakers were laughing stock what's wrong with you a clip of the NBA or they are they there are the worst team in basketball\nOr they might not win again they have a chance to have the most imperfect season votes on their own three right now there's no signs they're about to win a game they gave up a game winning shot last night to Patty Mills\nIn San Antonio scored a hundred and forty three points to beat\nThe bronze and keep in mind that Tim Duncan Tony Parker Manu ... blue we're all held scoreless and somehow some way the San Antonio spurs still won that game I and\nAnd I love this because there are already starting to become a part of the scenes in LeBron land Luke Walton who you might think I'm kidding and exaggerating when I say Luke Walton those jobs on the line\nI ain't kidding I I'm not ... bronze going to blame somebody else he put this record with team together and he's going to find someone else to blame as the fall guy he will not take any responsibility that's how the brain operates he doesn't take any of the blame brings everybody else so Luke Walton\nAfter a shootout of an NBA game attract me that was a one forty three one forty two final San Antonio beat the Lakers Luke Walton is Beijing belly aching and crying about what listen to this\nI just can't anymore it's certainly something points in the paint the fifty something again they out shoot us and the Frisco I'm thirty eight for those\nOf what was the play was the play where I got a technical Salah ... what happened to the brawn James is on it the same thing\nThat James Harden and Chris ... shot thirty freak those on us the night before federal brown pulls up on a screen somebody trying to fight over same same thing they shot freak those on the same thing we are going Seventy points that night in the pain was tell just hurt plays this game played forty minutes tonight all he does is attacked around zero freak those tonight\nZero I Know they're young\nI get that but if we're going to play a certain way let's not reward people for flopping thirty feet from the whole on plays that have nothing to do with that possession they're just plop and just to keep the if they get a phone call and then not reward players that are physically go into the basket and getting hit it's not right\n[noise] I I completely agree with it in my lifetime [noise] there are two franchises that just don't\nGet any calls the Boston Celtics and the Los Angeles Lakers yeah I completely agree\nThat the officials should be the now ... there's a grand conspiracy the league office\nTo hold the Lakers back because there is one thing that the NBA ... is the Lakers with LeBron James to not be relevant I completely agree with the wall and the officials get their talking points before the game and they all say the same thing try to stick it to number twenty three in the purple and gold\nAnd it's working perfectly the officials evil plan and that sounded like a broken man to me\nIt's the third game of the year third game of the year and Luke Walton I'm Glad you're on our side than I Am I'm In looks about to lose his job here and and he he is having such a his effect over the fish in how dare them how dare them\n[laughter]\nIsn't that the losers ... like the top of the losers woman\n... you're paying the table\nIf you have the facts you pound the facts if you don't have the facts you blame the official [laughter] the Lakers are immediately doing that and how about LeBron James you Brian James had to say look brunch chimed in\nOn the Lakers off to the oh and three start and he said it's not tough course the reason why bronze said it's not\n... because he got a deal over at Warner Brothers to remake friday the thirteenth so he's not worried about\nBasketball that's just part time job his career at Warner Brothers is taking off so he's got that\nAll the brunch says I Know what I got myself into\nA that's a shot is and that's a shot at the entire franchise he knows what he got himself into he says it's a process I get it and it will be fine [laughter] what is your definition of fine what is your definition of fine\n[laughter] now last time the Lakers loss which is what we've lost every game he compared the Lakers too ah instant oatmeal he made an analogy of instant oatmeal uh LeBron also said I didn't come here thinking we were going to be blazing storms\nRight out of the gate is that an ... of the Portland TrailBlazers\nHe said it's a process\nI understand that to the lake I think the Lakers are doing great I think they've already ... as far as I'm concerned these are the real Lakers I think they've peaked I in fact they might have peaked too soon here with his own three wreck absolute\nShe's a ... I heard somebody earlier was complaining and say well a little brown doesn't like the fact the Laker fans or they're trying to compare him to Kobe Bryant doesn't care about that okay\nThat's that's that's talk radio nonsense 'cause little brown has been embraced by the Hollywood phony ... they love the Lakers the Hollywood crowd they can't get enough they want\nMore and more and more and more and more and more and more so it doesn't matter if a bunch of Kobe Bryant fan boys are bent out of shape and they're pissed off and they're burning\nWith rage over LeBron James it doesn't matter because LeBron James knows he's got every fake Hollywood executive in his back pocket\nMake no mistake right every one of those studio adults to go to these Laker games they love the ... and they they shoot smooth smooth smooth with his kiss they want to give them a bubble bath and they want to suck his toes is what they want to do okay\nSo he didn't care like your your fans you're the guy in in the three hundred section who's upset that well bronze not Kobe Bryant and miss to foul shots and what would have been the game when he shot at the end of the game but probably doesn't care about that that's not a dilemma for him because you know what he goes back to his mansion and he's like what's my new project over at the Warner Brothers lot what do I have\nTo worry about over there\nAre so I've been on a show on Fox will press on your on the Lakers so much ... what's that I'm Glad you're talking about the lake or something like oh I Do I'm having a lot of fun I I they keep going like this I Will talk about them all year\nEvery game I thought I was so when they start winning you on yeah wow they're under five hundred will they ever be above five hundred will they ever get up above five hundred I don't know but\nNot a guarantee\nBlame the box blame the boss will get to that and we'll do it next [noise]\nSeries bills off\nYour social media home they\nFollow us on Twitter during the October mad that this isn't easy anymore you get a win that\nSports radio\nNow they're here even if you're a big time basketball\nFan there might be a few facts about the game you don't know like did you know that the first hoops were actually peach baskets whether they warned basketball is bouncy within a cold one or the players can run as much as four miles during a game we with another fact\nYou might not know that's actually really helpful if you need to buy a car troop car also helps people get used cars that's right true car isn't just for buying new cars\nWere they're certified dealer networking nationwide image or a of nearly one million used cars you'll enjoy real pricing an actual inventory and he's simpler buying experience what do you buy new or use and withdrew car users can see what others paid so they know if they're getting a good deal before by\nIn my\nWhat you said you want your point was you want everyone to get a million dollars for doing nothing that was really\nHappy let's weekly plan because people around the building blocks well can you tell me to be honest I don't know [laughter]\nI Know well why don't you go yeah so now\nI don't know well no you got all through your motivations I mean you want to get\nSomething from the show you think that you're going to the benefit from the show you've admitted that in the past\nNow I'm Talking about them [laughter]\nAll right thank you I must move the magic radio box that's that's great let's go to we go to Japan we man is it's so there you go\nFrom Okinawa\nDo we know who this person is do we know the name here\nOh T.

basketball based on what happens in October that's not me but you got LeBron the Lakers going do and three\nYou got the Dodgers in the world series for the second straight year you've got the rams who are the best team in the NFL right now I Believe and\nYou've got the chargers who are also among the best teams in the NFL okay that's LA's resume right now is a sports town we won't talk about us see in UCLA but sometimes those schools can be really good this is not one of those times are I I Do think would chip Kelly at UCLA that uses\nThe LA is going to be on the upswing and that's going to be a fun team to watch it a couple of years however okay on the east coast\nWith the Boston right now get the red Sox and the world series and their record of dominance over the last five or six years you have got her last decade if you want to say you got the Celtics who are the presumptive favored in the NBA eastern ... and I think are going to be in the NBA Finals playing against the Golden State warriors what all the NBA season comes to a close\nYou've got the patriots who were in the midst of a Fifteen to twenty year dynasty which Brady at bell jak and you've got by the way they mentioned the LA kings or the Boston Bruins both of whom of one championships as well\nWhich is the ... better American sports tale I think the world series may go a long way towards determining it and frankly what it's done any body if we got a rams versus patriots world see I mean not Super Bowl\nAnd we got LA versus Boston again I don't think we're going to get Lakers Celtics but obviously the Lakers and the Celtics have been the big straw that starts to drink competition between those two sports styles\nSo I Do think this is an incredible an intriguing storyline to follow all of that taking place right now will get you to top pod bottom five as we always do we're going to talk with my guy Charles Davis up next at the at the twenty two you can find him a on Twitter\nAnd ah he had that incredible Cam Newton comeback against the eagles will ask him about the camp back as at war and also does he buy into the uh\nTo to pay up there is as a legitimate threat in the NFC South and\nMaybe more importantly what's up with the eagles as they have now fallen to three and four I Believe as we get ready for the midway point of the NFL season all that and more we will get like I said march layer it than our too and also in our three will talk to my guy Petro spotted Degas we got a loaded Tuesday for you I Am back\nFrom London after six days doing the show over there and I got to tell

only thing that matters is October\nAnd give and give make this an attractive place for a quarterback whether it's going to be young guy coming in which you'd have to handled differently or a veteran guy who can play who you know can can can can stand up to the heat and deal with the receivers who go and get the ... motion couple of weeks ago to remember we talked about that\nYeah not like you know there's only one you know voice that you're going to listen to the receivers by by by general rule not shrinking violet as we know but I Would not entertain that at all with the giants that's not my issue my issue is figuring how\nAm I going forward with it and I know they've kept saying I Believe in Ely trade deadlines coming up class October thirty I Do believe Eli has a new trade clause in his contract\nBut we've seen people with no trade clauses make it different decision when push comes to shove if indeed someone would be interested\nI I don't know it's going to be a very very interesting week in New York to put it mildly they've got so many questions answers we saw in the game last night the clock management down the stretch this decision here that decision they're passionate has got a rough week ahead of him as the head coach\nBut behind the scenes Dave Gettleman is the GM he and his staff have a lot of decisions to make along with ... were we what are we going to do going forward because what do they want and what are the one in six now\nYeah one of the one in six Washington comes in on a hot streak what happened because I don't think they make any move before this game class like they're not going to change quarterbacks or anything like that but what they do lose this game at home you know get the one in seven notes officially over\n... that is the guy they drafted but they may have been active all every game this year quarterback do you make a change do you do anything last year when they ... for that one game as dumb as move they may\nNot inventing him but I'm venturing him to try out to Gino Smith not David swept rookie in this case now if you're going to bench him and you're going to stay with your own team\nYou got to ... you can't you can't say we're going to ... that tells you nothing as well\nWe're talking to Charles Davis you got that game Redskins giants he's at the uh the twenty two\nYou mentioned the trade deadline coming up October thirtieth the jags are about to get onto a plane and fly where I just was for the last week to London to play against the eagles\nSuddenly this game between the jags in the eagles is essentially a field like must win for both of these teams they're both sitting at three and four their boats dealing with a great deal of off field noise\nParticularly I Would say for the jags who have now announced that Blake ... will be their starter in London what do you do if you're the jacks\n[noise] to me this team is not as far away from getting back to the playoffs as it may seem in the midst of this run you know the defense of struggling some yes but I think the officer put them in some really horrible spots along the way\nThe idea of the world is going to start in London was kind of a de ... start Cody Kessler yeah I Love Cody great kid but he's ... he's not the one that's pressing like borders I mean you're not making that change and now we're going to\nMove forward and try and make the playoffs the only way for them to do that if if indeed Blake is not their guy which you know all indications seemed to be headed towards that direction they've got to look around league and say okay who can we go get it straight deadline time [noise] I Know there have been reports that they're not going anywhere they're not doing anything\nI have a hard time believing they're not evaluating that and I know that people want to jump on the hey go to New York go get Eli you've got Tom Koppel and all that I don't know that that's where they go on trying to figure out where it is around the league is a veteran guy that might be available that could be better than what you have\nArizona Sam ... still sitting there on the bench now no one's crazy about the injury history and all but you're trying to salvage or season\n... it's just one name that I'm throwing clay I'm just saying that evaluation process has to happen for them if they decided to stand pat then they got to go all ... I don't think you stand pat and say well we'll see\nIf he plays poorly that's we're going to go to Kessler I don't think that that takes you to change the dynamics of your season\nWhat about teddy Bridgewater would you inquire I Know that the the saint of already trading for him and they made me think he's the heir apparent to Drew Brees but based on the way he drew was playing\nIt seems to me he still has a good two years left me thirty nine if Brady can play a forty one there's nothing that I've seen from Drew Brees right now that suggests oh this guy's ready to hang up the the cleats in right off into the sunset\nIf you make that decision and you're the saints and you can get you know a second round pick back or you can get a first round pick maybe is that a guy that would make sense for the ...\nI think I think you would definitely makes sense for the jak these type of guy that people rally around loved to play with he's you know he showed during the pre season you know and I noticed preseason him re engaging back in the saddle making plays [noise] yeah I I think it fits very well now from New Orleans I'd make them come with a big offer\nBecause I Know there's so much speculation now the case of hill is the heir apparent in New Orleans yeah I ... I think takes them hill is much more of a what we're seeing quarterback not\nThe heir apparent said to me teddy Bridgewater fits them way better\nAnd what they do how drew was played the game along the way\nThe scheme that Sean Payton has tastes um hill is your change up gadget quarterback\nI don't take that away from them I'm not crazy about all that but I get where they're going with it and it helps them but as far as fulltime I I Believe teddy Bridgewater it'd be much better fulltime option for them for the saints that's why you want to come and get him\nI'd make it be a good offer and if it's a really good offer that I Would consider because as you pointed out you probably have to maybe even three years before you ultimately have to make a change a quarterback with New Orleans because of the way it Drew Brees keeps himself in great shape you didn't get the attention TV twelve does with his workout program but Drew Brees is workout program is insane as well\nWe're talking to Charles Davis at the FD twenty two arguments achy into college football I Know you're paying attention to that too yeah is bam a good or bad for college football right now\nThey're good for college football this to me this is the U. Conn women's basketball debate that we went through a few years ago which I found absolutely ridiculous\nI did clay if everybody's all they're horrible for basketball was UCLA horrible when they want to eighty eight straight with John wouldn't actually gave it attention during a time that not a lot of people focused on college basketball people act like you know and the final four has always been around and existed in its current state where\nWe go crazy and stop all we do for three weeks\nThat not was not the case\nDynasties are very good for business I don't care if it's the Yankees I don't care if it's\nBoston Boston Celtics I don't care who it is wherever you name because when someone finally gets that dynasty it really means something I Know parity is the word Pete Rosa loved yeah you've got plenty of parity but you need team for people to shoot for\nTo come get and elevate play everywhere and I'll leave you with this I work ...\nI was around when the dream team was born in a lot of people know that Iraq to look back and say well we did that because we lost in Nineteen eighty eight member or mental yeah and we lost the gold medal ADA we got beat by the Russians we had to go get our our on our back\nThere they vote when you change policy in the Olympics that all the countries get to vote\nYou know the overwhelmingly\nThe vote was for the Americans to have their professionals play basketball than the positive vote you know why they knew that it would it would up the level of this you know up the level of play and you now have to change what you do in a country and get yourself better as well not to mention the attention that came with it\nThey knew that takes a beating for awhile and they absorb do how is it now internationally and basketball have you noticed how everything is changes the people jumped their game up\nWell everyone needs to do that and would ever leave we're talking about now\nBallmer is good for football I don't care what they say people have to come after all people have to raise their level and the SEC around the country the whole thing people want to talk about the bad that he must be crazy this is fantastic [noise]\nBamboo and Clemson again if they go at it how about ... raise their level and it's been a consistent team approaching that status right now I think it's good that you can tell by the passion of my voice on this one I don't know what I Do not like when people say it's horrible and they're over running it and this and that\nThen we're back to participation metals and ribbons and I don't like that either\nA made for that let me ask you this final question I you've watch college football for a long time I watch college football for a long time through eight games I think that Alabama is as good of a team as I have ever seen they have not been challenged it'll probably talk about this with you a little bit next week\nDo you think that somebody will step up I think you mentioned the phone booth getting a phone booth game with them at some point MBA up to elevate their game to make Alabama go into a fourth quarter and really have to fight itself in order to win a championship or do you think Alabama is just this much better that nobody's ever going to be able to even keep it close\nSomeone's going to keep it close it's just a matter of when it happens and for bad mistake I think there there would be best served if they have one of those in the regular season because otherwise you get into the playoffs\nAnd it's going to happen at some point remember when the ... was that was a rascal eighty to eighty three\nMember that team with Turner guild and in Irving fryer and and and and Remington and all that crew you remember they just rolled over every one and then they get that phone booth game and the national championship game with Miami remember that and they're coming here comes Bernie cos are and grew\nI said just a couple of weeks ago and I'm going to continue to say it I think the smart move if you are the giants is to address your situation this way who is the best player on that often for the next five years I think it does take one Barkley\nI Know that the falcons finally held and below a hundred yards from the line of scrimmage barely but when you look at what that guy can do at the backfield and you look at what he can do running the football I think the best off into weapon the giants have for the next five years is sake one Barclay\nDoesn't mean that I think go back and junior is not good it just means that\nThe most reliable inconsistent and I think the most uh uh you know probably psychologically a reliable office have talent they have is take one Barkley I don't think he's going to lose his mind I don't think he's going to propose doing that I don't think he's going to get into it on the sideline I don't have any concerns at all about sake one Barclay\nIf you believe as I Do that he's the best player\nOn that off into the next five years than I think if the giants were being smart they would acknowledge that Eli Manning thirty seven years old it's unlikely he's going to win another Super Bowl he's already won them to trade you lie before October thirtieth if somebody will trade for him\nWet Eli ride off into the sunset or go ahead and make the decision you know what will play out the thread with Eli Manning this year and then we're going to go straight into the draft and go get a young quarterback\nAnd then also before October thirtieth I Would try to get a first round pick pro del Beck and junior and get out of this twenty million plus contract that we assigned ourselves if where the giants now I understand they've gotta wins a decision making this is this is probably a little bit risky\nBut I don't think if you're the giants but you are likely to contend first Super Bowl for the next two years if you can find somebody to take that twenty million dollar headache of a contractor motel back him junior off of your shoulders I think is a smart move remember with a great story lines to pay attention to in the NFL\nThe best player on a Super Bowl winning team has never been a wide receiver they get a lot of attention\nBecause they play down the field provoke a lot of excitement\nOr the explosive wide receiver tends to be a diva he's outspoken often times of great media figure fans rally around them but ultimately quarterbacks make receivers receivers do not make quarterbacks and if you're going to have a new young\nQuarterback that you go out and draft\nTheoretically the giants may be in position to draft number one the first quarter back off the board next year\nMaybe there'll be competing with the raiders of John Gurdon for that I think you make the decision that the raiders made which is ... for a first round pick\nI Would move though Dell Beck and junior right now and you know what if I were the Tennessee Titans team like the titans if I were a team like the cowboys I don't necessarily think it's a bad move if you're in a mediocre to bad division\nLike the cowboys are cowboys during the NFC East giants were eliminated I don't think the Redskins and Alex Smith or that good\nJerry Jones sits there and says hey we get the nine and seven we get to host a playoff game we get into the big big dance I think we can get to nine and seven sitting at three and four if I'm it seemed like the Tennessee Titans sitting at three and four crappy wide receiver play\nAnd I've got it first round pick I'd give it up for Adele backup junior right now and I feel like I've got a quarterback who's good enough to win a playoff game\nI think it seemed like the titans would feel that I think certainly the cowboys would feel that that's a good trade to make and if I'm the giants I take that trait\nI really do a may be crazy to consider it given how good a deal back in June or is it wide receiver but again if you're going to go get a young quarterback and you think your best offensive weapon right now is say going Barkley I don't know\nIt makes sense to invest in long term keeping hotel backup junior I didn't like the twenty million dollar deal when inside I still don't like it\nTop five bottom five I'll tell you that the NFL weeks that in in the books who were the top five teams who are the bottom five teams ...\nAt the top of our two then we'll talk with mark

little anxious\nAbout that\nThat kids grandma raises this kid from cerebral palsy and brain damage\nRecruits only get Eighteen years in prison and she says I Am a little anxious that rake roots might send another hit man to try to kill that kid\n\nNow recruit says I've apologized to this woman for the loss of her daughter and taking responsibility for what happened I Love the opportunity to make things right with her and chancellor the kid\nI just want to be forgiven he will never have his mother and his wife right or wrong he still has the opportunity to have me in his life\n\nI Believe in forgiveness I don't think there is\nIn any way on the planet that if I was that mom I Would ever let re crude within ten feet or this kid within ten miles of this kid\nForgiveness can be between you and God doesn't have to be between me and you is what I Would be thinking if I were her\nYou kill my kid you try to kill my grandson\nAnd you want to have the goal to only go to jail for Eighteen years and say right or wrong he still has the opportunity to have me in his life\nGet outta here this is crazy\nBut interesting everybody in sports wants to get political everybody in sports wants to talk about every other case here you've got a first round NFL Draft pick only gets Eighteen years in prison for hiring a hit man to kill his girlfriend\nNearly kills pregnant kid pregnant prematurely deliver baby\nCerebral palsy and brain damage effectively snaps out two lives\nAnd he's out only had to serve Eighteen years in prison got to be honest with you a write\nIn for real league that has marinated for the past three years injustice and how much they care about the justice system and treating everybody equally\nI Want you to think about this not a damn player has set a damn word about recruits all we do in Eighteen years for what he did\nIt's almost like it's a lot easier to point outside the family than it is to point inside the family not an owner\nThat a player not anybody\nReally fancy right now to be against domestic violence oh that guy he punched this girl he should never play in the NFL again\nRake Ruth how does even get out of jail see one of the big stories here\nThat people don't want to focus on is it ain't black and white and black white yellow and black white brown and yellow doesn't matter what skin color you have matters how much green you got to only color that matters in America today the reason why re cruised only did Eighteen\nYears in prison is 'cause he's rich and there is a different method and standard of justice in this country when you have money than if you don't have money\nAnd everybody out there who's kneeling everybody out there protesting the justice system they miss the biggest and most important fact about color in this country and it's great and there's hardly anybody out there talking about this but I Want you to think about\nWhy in the world\nRe cruised could kill his pregnant girlfriend and nearly kill the baby to avoid paying child support\nAgain I've worked in the criminal justice system there are lots of people who go to jail even for murder that when you look at the overall fact pattern you look at it and you say okay I could see how this could happen to guys get drunk they get in a bar fight somebody hits a guy in the head falls down your debt\nThat happens all fifty states there are people serving time in prison right now for murder or manslaughter or a version of murder because they got into a bar fight they were both drunk one guy hit another guy and they fell and they hit their head and they died\nThat happens all the time in this country it's an involuntary unintentional murder and some of those people will do longer than Eighteen years in prison because they don't have the right lawyer is they get the wrong da ... jury if things don't work in their favor\nAnd then you have a guy here to me this is the very definition of first degree murder if you hire a hit man to kill somebody that's the very definition of pre meditation\nAnd you do it to avoid child support payments and you're a multi millionaire that's just pure evil be honest with you\nAnd then that kids born and you have the goal when you come out of prison\nTo say\nTo say about this right or wrong he still has the opportunity to have me in his life and it happened and if I'm your\nChild's guardian not letting recruits anywhere near that and this is the woman's quote to the Charlotte Observer\nRe would never come back here and do anything but that doesn't mean he wouldn't send someone so I Am a little anxious that grandma's at St raising that baby that has cerebral palsy and has brain damage\nAnd if she's a little anxious at all I'm Sorry the justice system has failed that she's that she's getting any anxiety at all recruits should have spent the rest of his life in prison the fact that he's getting out is a stain on the American justice system\nI'm Clay Travis will get the top five bottom five at the top of our three I got so fired up when I read that story this morning\nAnd the fact that it's hardly going to get any attention all the time gets spent NFL national anthem

between most grave and I'm ... and the raiders for whatever reason jak Del Rio they don't most grave\nAnd they go to a different coordinator and now he's got another different coordinator this year under grew in\nAnd I'm always it always blows me away when you're a quarterback who's playing it dies level is ever played it and you don't like the all the word bitter for whatever reason philosophically you don't match or you know he's not a guy that you want to go hang out and have a beer with what your quarterback who's playing exceptionally well\nI don't understand why you would upset the apple cart I so you know it's it's hard enough to kind of giving all that down and a lot of people will tell you and and different ... will tell you man you got to be in and all that between you know a year and a half to three years before you really understand that just what your life but what you don't like\nSituational eating what I don't like in the red zone what I don't like in short yard as I hate this throw against this coverage whatever it is\nAnd the only way you figure that out is by making mistakes and all kinds of woman I knew the plays I Love to run I knew the things that gave me trouble I knew the things that they want to call them the huddle it was like God shots you know oh shoot I don't want to run this like I hate this play\nBut you know that stuff but it takes time to figure that out you got to run it and you got it right and every situation on every place in the football field before you really get a bill and you know he said two different Gordon Arizona two years right\nOh yeah I mean looked at the raiders are a mess I mean I don't think there's any doubt about that now they do have three ... pick so I guess if you're a raiders fan you can sit around and say come may we're going to win that Iraq because it's hard not to win the draft if you end up with that many picks but it is pretty wild\nYou had the uh the lions I think the lions may be the team that's under the radar more than just about any other team out there in a in the NFL right now if you look at their wins actually had some pretty good wins right they dominance patriots\nThey got a a a really pretty pretty good when a against uh I Know it's you know ... and everything else but to go on the road and when like that the NFC North is wide open are the lions for real and your mind sitting at three and three\nYeah well you I mean look at it like you said they they dominated the patriots and Tom Brady they dominated for the first three quarters the dominant in the Green Bay Packers Aaron Rodgers\nAnd then they go into Miami and they eat and they get a good went in there and they dominate line of scrimmage ... there are really on you look at them just overall all three levels their defense can play 'em they're issue hasn't been playing good defense it's been\nWe've gotten increased on one or two plays a game where we didn't have the right run fits we didn't have the right connection between say these in between you know between our linebackers and defensive line\nAnd you know we got gas in those situations but it's just one or two plays a game for Detroit um and you know here's a guy in math the Stafford who's an elite level quarterback I mean this guy is he's got all kinds of our town and he's really smart he understands the office but they have never cared\nAbout having balance for him they never cared about running a bowl they have never cared about the play action games for him and I think he threw it I mean in a in a game or you know they they home thirty plus points I think it through like twenty two times\nI'm all I mean a tone apply action stuff they ran a spot over two hundred yards rushing meant that the value of being able to do that for ... Patricia ... is ... and for wrap your Stafford is huge\nAnd one of the interesting things coming out there by week that Matt Patricia was thought about it like I Know I'm Still learning this football team I'm running my guys I'm learning what they do well what they don't do well or or you know on Sundays and and how can I put them in a position very patriot a patriot as skippy will\nAllow them to put them in a position to win as opposed to putting them in positions of failure so I mean they're still learning their their football team um I I just find it fascinating way to manage people and managing football team\nAnd I'm with you and I think they're flying under the radar I think they're better ... than you know there are three wins would tell you\nWhat is going to happen or as you look going forward with the giants now a Monday Night football last night giants lose to the falcons falcons still kind of hanging on the periphery maybe they could dream of getting in a wildcard spot a mat Ryan's having a very good season the\nGiants of fall into one in six we just saw a ... coup portrayed it if you are David Gettleman right now in your phone rings would you trade a Dell back um junior ... first round pick what would you do and I know you always got to be decided and everything else what do you think's going to happen there\nWell I Would I Would trade or do they go to Jean yeah I mean I like a year later\nHope it works out for you I just I don't see the value\nIn paying making the most dependent players and football which are the wide receivers hey we all depend on each other but the most dependent players and football I'm your highest paid guys I just I I Will never understand that kind of philosophical approach\nTo the football I'm so would I trade him absolutely I Would trade him um he lie man and you know as much as he compiled in\nThat game as many great throws you made it still ones that he missed that just make you scratch your head the ones where he just doesn't pull the trigger the ones that he's just laid on\nThat or you're this like how can you be missed that the you know the flat route to oh do back um junior into it where he doesn't wear doesn't throw it I think as a fourth down it's wide open it's a first reading your progression\nHe's decided not to throw the ball I like stuff like that is what blows you away I'm with the way he lies plan right now but what I Try to do yeah because I think I again I think receivers or are you in a game where everybody's depending on everybody else to do their job they're the most ... ended\nPlayers and an ... yesterday right no sideline antics deserve because he compiled fantasy numbers in the last he's okay lose and as long as he gets his numbers like those are those are issues that wouldn't sit well with me but that's me\nDo you do if you're Jacksonville you got your going on the road it's actually a really good early London game I just came back from watching the chargers tightened I'm going to wake up early like a lot of people listening to us right now on Sunday and make sure that I'm watching the eagles jags cause I Do think there's a lot of story line\nThe associated with that game what do you do if you're the jags with ...\nI mean I don't know how you like he's been the guy in a journal machines as you walk in the league so why did you think all of a sudden it was not going to be a gentle machine I mean that's\nThat's been his history and so um you got on to me he's not your guy he hasn't been your guy um you know when you were winning last\nYear shoot there was a game a I called the Jacksonville game against the rams last year the game before that they had played viewers and one I Believe the Steelers and in the fourth quarter\nThey ran it he didn't throw the ball and and the thing that I think and I didn't get Nineteen total tabs but they ran at Nineteen ... times and the fourth quarter\nLike hey you know what we're going to manage our own quarterback you don't get to play the perfect game plan for Jackson though is to run it every time like the hundred percent of the time and without or net being there I just don't know how you can continue to roll that guy out there because he's proven\nThat if that's the game plan or you have to put it on his shoulders to push the ball down the field um he's going to throw into the wrong color Jersey\nSince it's a great stat that you mentioned since he came into the league\nBlake portals has ten more turnovers than anybody else in the NFL\nI mean that's a pretty unbelievable stat ten more he's ... he's obviously thrown a lot of interceptions is there a trade that you could make at this point I mean would you make a trade for another quarterback\nObviously he's starting on the road in London is there a move could you go after teddy Bridgewater would you consider trying to get to you like your got Tom Coughlin down in Jacksonville do you get on the phone there and consider trying to make a move uh with the giants is there anything you can do because I look as as bad as board all this\nI don't think the jak skin hand the reins decoding Kessler and expect to have any kind of our ability to compete in the AFC South\nNow you're going to have you know you're going to have to start making phone calls and seeing that there's quarterback like you said at teddy Bridgewater uh if if the giants are interested in Ely although\nYou know out of the frying pan fry or with you I I'm you know you're in the same boat you can't down the line of scrimmage and and um you know and run the football\nAnd make sure that you can just manage it I mean he's got he's got dynamic tight and it's dynamic wide receiver indicted ... a couple of dynamic wide receivers you got\nYou know got catcher a running back on the back really apply to catch it and make people medicine do spectacular things you're going to Jacksonville without\nThat complementary it without the complimentary players are I mean how's that going to work for you or you're going to get tired of people and see if\nYou can get yourself ready Bridgewater somebody of that nature but um I tell you what you're in a year to you know a tough position right now having put your money into ... I'm thinking is going to play the same as he did last year and you're going to have the the same formula you did last year certainly that's not working\nRed Sox have been really really good so I Would rate Boston as one I think everybody out there would have to say no one in two right now in the American sporting consciousness is Boston in LA I think it's just a question of which one is one in which one is too so I'm going Boston ... to LA to what say you Danny gee\nIt sounded like you were running in the Boston Marathon there for a second I my my kids are up early after\nAll the all the trip back all their time ... grew up a time clocks are off so everybody woke up in my house at like four AM\nAnd so um you know ten am a London time where he'd been in the last several days so I was downstairs mediating disputes in my house I get the home studio here and it is absolutely pandemonium in my house no the kids are usually not up when I'm doing my show ever\nAnd so downstairs right now it's pandemonium I had to get upstairs at the last minute to make sure that we haven't had a you know World War three erupt among the kids so I so that's where I was I'm actually going to agree with you on this one and\nNot be a Homer LA is coming on strong but because of the dominance of the patriots it's gotta be Boston at this moment\nAll right what about you were ... Boston or LA I also agree with you guys do say Boston right now because of the pay Ralph yeah Ralph urban who would you go with it is it Boston on on a walk off here\nYeah I mean pretty much and it's just it's ... it's hard to recall oh you're a super super sports town because ultimately it's not that big a deal on her [noise]\nYeah it may not be that big of a deal it terms of albertson's Ralph your trip and it's a big deal to a lot of people and ...\nYou go to Hollywood you walk down the street people don't care if\nYou're talking about the whole or is this your own yeah you're talking about tourists I'm Talking about natives and people that have lived here a long time sports connected us any ...\nBoston people care you go anywhere in LA they don't\nIt's true that there are a morning while you in Southern California that doesn't mean they don't care\nSaved the debate said that if they were going to have a major debate about this tomorrow I promise and put it put a pit in it we will open the show tomorrow in the wake of World Series game on for a year in New York for your Boston versus LA sports stakes\nSo everybody out there right now you can put a pit in and I guarantee we'll get to it um what about you a job which would you say\nI kinda think LA especially moving forward I mean they got to franchises and all the major sports MBA and there'll be a NFL and to him a less teams but I I think it's LA\nIt is it is I think it like kind of an intriguing subplot\nOf this Dodgers and red socks series a Dodger by themselves look it's been thirty year since they want a title it's it's crazy for old school baseball guy out there\nTo be like yeah the red Sox we know how good they are I mean the the Red Sox becoming the most dominant one of the most dominant franchises in baseball and it also becoming a massive you know kind of fan favorite in terms of their impact I mean they are Fifteen year old kids growing up now who have no idea why the curse of the man but you know ever matter what you got for me\nDay G A quick question I'm asking for a friend clay he's it irresponsible to skip rent and get tickets for game three showdown at Chavez Ravine instead\nWhat are they costing the cheap I was just on the game time apple on my phone the cheapest pair of nose bleeds right now one thousand five hundred and Seventy eight\nYeah that's too much I Would wait and see what happens in game one and two as well um before because I mean that could impact of the overall price but and that's that's one of those crazy things I mean I ... to me you have to be insanely wealthy in order to pay those kind of prices and and I don't think it's even fair when you say fifty hundred bucks or whatever it is to get in\nFifteen hundred bucks is not equal to everybody there's tons of people out in LA making you know hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars a year that Fifteen hundred dollars is nothing probably the biggest fans out there are making forty K.\nAnd that's like I mean you know ... whatever the math is on that that's a huge percentage of your overall so it was like three\nPercent of the money that you'll make it an entire year wild that's why I always say when pricing you're pricing tickets if not how much ticket costs to how much the ticket cost as a percentage of your income Fifteen hundred dollars is wild I'm All right we'll be joined by Petro spotted I guess in our three I Will begin our three by giving\nYou the top five teams and the top a bottom five teams in the NFL as we do every single Tuesday in the wake up a week seven get your pen to paper out top five bottom five next an al ... on Fox Sports radio\nHow kick their coverage with ...

me the jags have to decide what they're going to do with like ...\nBlake morals right now if they made the decision to over reward and I understand the difficulty of this I understand the difficulty of making a decision when it comes to your starting quarterback when you are looking at a\nPretty good performance is right he was not good against the bills in that first playoff game against Iraq Taylor but he was pretty pretty good right against the Steelers\nAnd then what if they have been a little bit more aggressive the jags might have been in the super bowl last year\nInstead they come back they think oh we're going to be great they beat the patriots everybody's talking about how great the jags look and then they falling apart they lose the titans they lose to\nAh the cowboys get

but based on how much money you have invested with Blake ... I'm not sure really what you can do going forward but I think even the most hardcore Blake Bartels fan out there would have to say at this point amazing stat since ... says come into the league\nHe has got ten more turnovers than any other player in the NFL he's got an eighty evil eye manning has got Seventy\nThat's a pretty crazy difference in terms of what ... has been about has been about so to me for the for the or jags they have a big decision to make their the other big decision that I think has to be made in the NFL in the wake of what we saw happen last night Monday Night football is what are the giants do\nI told you what I Would do if I was Dave get them when they're GM I Would try and trade or do back um junior just like the raiders did get a first round pick for him and I would try and figure out a way to move you lie and get something for I mean really\nIf you can't then I Would let you go at the end of the year and I would go back into the draft take your quarterback and tried to follow the rams a decision making process the other thing is who are the teams out there that potentially it'd be willing to give up a number one overall pick fro del backup junior it's unlikely that they would trade him within the division\nBut reports of war that the eagles were willing to give a second round pick for I'm Ari Cooper\nIf the eagles are willing to give a second round pick for I'm already Cooper wouldn't they be willing to give a first round pick for oh Dale back him junior now I don't think the giants would trade them in division because then you have to play 'em twice a year and that seems like a disaster if you're the giants particularly if he has a lot of success with Carson wins which I think you would\nSo I think you have to move across the country and start to ask a question okay the cowboys were clearly in desperate need of wide receivers who else is in desperate need of wide receivers the team that immediately jumps to mind for me honestly the titans\nThe titans are awful it wide receiver right now in the wake of the delay any Walker injury a tight in they can stretch the field they have no ability with their current wide receiving corps\nIf you believe in markets more Yoda would you be willing to give up a first round pick for Dell back him junior to add to that team in an AFC South that certainly seems winnable\nI don't think that's an awful decision I really don't I think I Would do backup junior makes that titans defense a lot more difficult to defend now with the giants do it I don't know\nBut I think if you're Dave ghetto and you're looking at a one in six team with twenty million dollars tied up in a hotel back um junior over the next couple of years aging quarterback and Eli Manning foundation of your team I think should be said on Barclay given the fact that he's younger and that he's been incredible out of the gate\nThat to me is a decision that has to has to be asked as we come up on the trading deadline of October thirtieth and the NFL how many different teams could make moves who's willing to do it\nIs somebody willing to give you a ... first round pick for Dell back um junior at the answer's yes I Do I Do it if I'm the giants All right we're going to be joined by Petro spotted Degas we will dive into World Series\nDodgers game on against the Boston Red Sox tonight also LeBron oh and three ... is our LA sports correspondent we'll ask him how the city of angels is responding to all of these stories and more\nUh I Am quite Travis appreciate you spending your Tuesday Morning with us as we break down everything in the world of sports and beyond I got to tell you using chew true car you can easily find the car you want with troop price from true car you can avoid the confusion you encounter on line by getting a great price you can count on\nBefore you ever visited dealership the troop price includes all dealer fees and accessories true car will show you what other people in your area paid for the car you want now you know with a fair price is so you can feel confident\nAnd you're certified dealers notice\nSo they said they're true price competitively so they can weigh in your business over three million cars had been sold the true car users by the troops are certified your network\nThere over Fifteen thousand troops are certified dealers nationwide trigger a user save an average of over three grand off the M.

if a guy came up with the ball out of the pile every once in a while the ref would just give it to them so they would really try to take it away from you and the pile they try all kinds of things you know I raking spreading a\nPunching a ball punching but the worst thing that ever happened to me was this guy linebacker from San Diego state he didn't punch me in the testicles but he kinda copped by testicles in a more a gentle way\nWhich was much more upsetting than the punching\nAnd you know I got up screaming and yelling and yelling at the raft and yelling at the guy and screaming in the locker room like I it's I'm Still not over it that was Nineteen Ninety eight\nAnd ... that came to an unrelated incident\nThat first of all is an unbelievable\nDiabolical move because the growing punch you kinda are used to that while you're ready for it yeah they're growing caress no protection from that\n[noise] no and I was much more likely to give up the football to protect myself from\nThat [laughter] I was any of\nThe violence they had coming their way and in that same game ... beer ... be a meal uh took my left apple\nI've seen that yeah that's tough that's great you you have some level to give now I have plenty unable to give I Wish [laughter] what\nBy the way should like so that you had that ... Rondo spits on him and then it looks like he punches him um what should the NBA do there like I that the whole suspension that they came out of that like I think three games to games one game everything else like I kinda\nThought it was awesome because it's so much more entertaining like I understand that you can't regularly have that happen because I I also think in hockey it's stupid ... multi million dollar athletes punch each other because you can have like a Kermit Washington situation or sorry Rudy Tom John of itch gets hit you know like somebody severely injured\nAnd that's probably a bad precedent to set off any kind of entertaining to watch\nWell yeah and entertaining to talk about as well and I mean it's clear that\nInstigated by the Lakers and a lot of people are giving brand an anger them a lot of respect\nFor being a skinny guy who was willing to mix it up and I I guess that's cool uh he pushed harden hard and walks away ah Chris Paul gets involved with Ron do raw do spit in a very slick way\nOn Chris Paul and my thing is like hey if you want to get in a fight with a guy that's a good way to do it\nIf you spit in someone's face you must want to fight and rhino did I'm Glad he threw that laugh because it's like okay I'm going to spit on you and nominate punch it because that's that's how much I hate you so that made sense to me as well if you want to get in a fight spin on a guy and it looked like raised on Ronda was in the mood for the feud\nThe Lakers are oh in three how many games in a row would they have to lose for you to consider it to be a big deal\nI mean I I don't think it's a I don't think this is a pivot for Braun toward trying to win championships I mean he's a great player at the highest level of the of the globe in basketball but he's not a young person anymore in the sport\nAnd this came doesn't play defense they're not very good\nAnd the spurs was a winnable game for them the spurs aren't that good they're supposed to beat the spurs and in the west there's going to be a lot of competition for a playoff spots on these games count just the same as the games and in February so it's not a good look I I don't think that\nThey need to win championships for this to be a success this is about clicks and stories and adulation and praise for the king I don't think it's about championships those go through the bay area but\nI also\nThink that it's bad if you can't make the playoffs or your struggle you're struggling to make the playoffs because the Lakers need to at least\nBe relevant with wins and losses under liberal on because they don't want that to be the story they just want the bronze existence to be the story and it doesn't have to be a championship existence but the problem is if you don't wait any games you can't even go to the playoffs\nAll right ah quickly on and then I'm going to go to college football to ask you a couple of college football questions but the rams and the chargers do you think that both of these teams in ten years will still be in LA\nA great question yeah I think they have to contractually they're building that behemoth in Inglewood andme Africa the house on both forever at least for the near future I I don't know the future of the chargers or the owner passed away the other day uh\nTheir spot also Greek American who started in Stockton with nothing obviously they've\nBeen criticized a whole lot for their move and I don't really know what the I'm gay marriage there certainly isn't a lot of buzz about them in town with how good the team is and I think it's the same with the rams but\nBut more show I mean people are talking much more about the rams and they have much better foot hold right now the San Diego fingers credit confounding but\nWe'll see what happens when the playoffs and this team continues to to be in the area it's not like they're not a likeable ... may have a lot of good players a\nLot of people to root for Philip Rivers as a joy to watch you know and he's been doing it at a high level for a long time so I I drink time will tell like Bob Marley says but they're certainly on the bottom of the rock they're right there with the clippers\nAll right so let's go to college football you said you're going to ... a a red eye you're going to fly out to Morgantown or Thursday\nNight Baylor West Virginia big twelve\nOr you've been to Oregon town I'll watch for games it seems like the un un Morgantown West Virginia get along\nWell so what can happen in in college football to me Alabama is like on a different level and then you've got a lot of teams that if everything went perfectly maybe they could give Alabama a game\nWhen you look at the big twelve who you think right now is going to be in the big twelve and the championship game do you think and and agree that the pack twelve is basically out of the running how would you assess the overall picture right now\nYeah we're out the big twelve might be out too I mean obviously it's Oklahoma Texas maybe West Virginia\nBecause we'll Greer is so good at I think they have a good thing going but Notre Dame is existence as you point out all the time\nAnd the FCC being what they are and not being gained it all by the committee for having a different schedule but everybody else a much more favorable one\nAnd obviously we all know how great Alabama is the interest is kind of for second place this year but I I think the big twelve by get left out too I Love Michigan stream absolutely adore their defects", "show_name": "FOX Sports Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Newton",
