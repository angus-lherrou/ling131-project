well\n\nI'll come back here to guide would run Wilson talking with George Chris out in Georgetown about is a boost Bruce let me ask you this Chris over the years the new growth now just a new growth on the ends still the same linked it it's always been still putting out a lot of new growth\nOut on the air got it right there are completely bear and then you get up to the Arab you know it's like out there\nRight a couple of things can happen you know nutrient deficiency is the first of all to remember this evergreens lose their needles on the inside it's a natural thing that they do and if you look at ... for instance they'll get a white pine they only had needles from\nThis year's growth sometimes last year but that's it and they lose everything to the inside the good thing about spruce trees for the most part is that they'll keep their needles about three or four years back so they look for all the way back into the to the plant itself\nSo a lot of times you know you don't notice it but occasionally they will lose those needles all the way out to the new growth\nIt's typically not a good thing it's usually a sign that for some reason whatever may be the plant may be under some stress\nIt could be um [noise] could be dealing with um might issues ah which can cause the Beatles to kind of model and then they drop off early\nUm you know those types of things can happen if the new growth looks good very flush very good coming out good that's a good sign that means that the tree is you know it is is doing okay\nIt's just that for some reason you're losing those inter needles now what you may want to do is\nTake some of the ... any needles that are still left on some of those branches to inside take some of those off and take 'em to a local garden center left somebody look at the needles themselves sometimes they can detect whether it's a might issue maybe a nutrient deficiency whatever it may be\nBut that's a possibility now if you get into individual branch is\nStarting to die on the plants which we are seeing a blues Bruce now it's a it's a needle disease it causes those ... the old branch to fall off or turned brown and then eventually you wind up having to cut it off I Hope you don't get into that but that's going around out there right now so you know it's several things but the the bottom line is is\nWe've got to take a look at some of those old needles to take a look and try to determine what's causing those to drop\nSo if you can get samples to somebody to let them look at him that's going to be your best bet\nAnd take a couple of pictures of the blues cruise overall up close you know look to the new growth overall picture and didn't take those needles so local garden center left somebody look at that for you to try to determine what maybe going are are you able to water those when you were in a dry situation\nWell you know we've got a train that share a I have a ... but I never water go\nYeah yeah I get that the war on the right that is what I'm going to\nDo it over all the other one that was always a quarter to put our then right\nIt's in yep inspected inspected trunk make sure you don't see anything on the trunk um other than that I Can't you know without seeing the trio itself I Can't give you any other suggestions\nOr without seeing it and that's going to be the bottom line trying to get an I looked at those needles to try to figure out what's going on how much new growth has put out and and go from there how are they just said Fifteen twenty feet\nYeah they are quite\nIf if nobody can come up with an answer just showing the needles you may want to invest\nIn a fee to have a certified or has come to the site and take a look at it as sort of you know that's the best what you want to make sure you don't lose and that may be the best thing for you to to get somebody out there right on the site to take a look at him determine what else may be done to help switch back around\nAnd again yeah hey don't\nWell I Would ... Beatles I said look at the trunk for any other issues that may be out there but might\nCould be an issue could be I'm just saying could be a which can cause someone who's in her needles to drop off more so than others\nUm if the plants are under stress it'll drop those needles more so than others like I say they naturally shed those anyway\nBut for some reason that one's doing it more than the other one which means that there's something else going on with the tree might issue ... disease issue stretches you whatever may be but somebody's going to take a look at those old needles and try to determine what that may be\nYeah I probably won't get all made up the ah Branford 'cause you're all wrong it\nLook around there yeah look around the base of maybe you can pick up some around the base maybe even sacrifice one of the small tips of the brands who has the sons of needles on it\nOr that you can take along with you as well so am I could take a look at that too but somebody's got to see something to try to determine but again they naturally shut does leave those needles anyway but typically not that to the tip not to spruce\nAnd some reasons for some reason it's been stressed might disease drought heat whenever may be\nA book that's cause it to do that more than than it normally should do that\nIf I'm In the fertilizer trees what would I Do\nUm you know you could you could use a Ross route feeder that would inject us a water soluble fertilizer into the to root system\nYou could even take something and drill holes around the drip line of the tree and and the poor little ten ten ten or twelve twelve twelve and they're very lightly and those holes that kind of feed that way you can even top dress underneath the the us Bruce for that but again that's not necessarily the answer\nYou know it's a disease or whatever that's the first thing you want to go after ... you know otherwise a tree maybe doing great with a new growth and had plenty of nutrients and not need to be fed we need to find out what the other reasons are\nOkay okay All right well that's what I'll do the fact that\nI Will if you do find out let me know because I certainly like to hear back from ... to see what the what finds out but again\nRemember in this time of the year you'll see evergreen starting to shed needles on the inside it's natural that happens and boy sometimes pines can scare the heck out of you because they lose everything right up to this year's growth or can\nAnd when they do that especially white pine Austrian playing with those longer needles they get that gold and yellow and you know you're in an all those needles or yellow on the inside ... turn on the inside um the spruce turning you know you know that scares the heck out to be when you see that\nBut realizing that they do this naturally as long as this to the inside of them not to the tips usually pretty good shape but on spruce when it comes all the way the ... like that when you say they usually keep three or four years grow so you don't notice as much else Bruce cause they lose needles way back on the inside", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Ron Wilson", "city": "Newton", "day": "20"}
