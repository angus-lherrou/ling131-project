away right on through the month of October to Ohio we go by good morning\nHello Yes sir Yes sir Yes sir\nRight um I've got a couple of tips on its time getting time to plan garlic for the fall\nYes and\nUm [noise] we we grew come for sale you know at a farm and stuff but what we do is a ... a\nSpace throws eight inches apart okay and then ... the individual clothes six inches apart [noise] and and then what we do\nIs um one [noise] um well\nOne fear planted and we start to get cooler weather and the you know you're getting close the harder for us and stuff like that is what we do is we put about six inches a straw over the top\nAnd what that does is it eliminates almost all the way they can process and it keeps the you know keeps the quotes from from ... to the ground and stuff like that\nSure so so [noise] she noticed that they'll start to grow a little bit in the fall after you planted\nYes that can happen because like I've already planted mine at home than if it comes up\nHere's me what the straw that well if it comes up it'll help that the um you know if the tips fern and actually they burn a little bit because it's federal warmer fall um it it won't affect\nThem especially the heart next wearing\nIt ... it and then in the spring when that comes up you may be have to go through and poll who leads right once once but\nUh it it really works well and it would work well for the for the home gardeners\nSo it gives you a double protection I obviously keeps it from freezing and thawing and heating of the ground over the winter so little winter affection\nAnd then as you get into the spring and summer season to keep some the temperature is a little more regulated in the soil keeps us a little bit more more should there for you and keep the weeds down as well and you're going to get a few see Dr Bob is going to be in the in the straw\nThat that's probably what you see popping up here and there you pull those up yeah you're you're good to go and that carries your right to the season that when you're growing a garlic and you're doing it in Ohio I'm mostly all hard next election [noise]\nWhat's that I'm Sorry\nI usually grow mostly hard next elections or do you do a variety\nNo we've we've got the excuse me we we get down to the heart next week grow for Romanian read your German white German hearty or the music and we just had a you know better luck with those\n... ... and then the advantage of those as you get the scrapes right and there's\nA lot you know there were people in the area that uh would use those pickle them and what we do is we free or something\nWe just cut them when they're young and and you can freeze them and then use them to pay a you know anything that\nYou would use garlic with mild flavor they have so we pretty much did at one time we grew silver rose but there just wasn't as much a demand for your\n... to become a\nYou're a coal Mary I'm usage there has been phenomenal and I I wasn't aware that you could just cut us off and freeze them\nYeah you can ... and they don't keep I mean we have some uh from ... from actually we usually have a year I mean you can just kind of ... well yeah yeah yeah and they're they're they work well\nSo as a as a commercial garlic grower you're finding that it's growing and for the capes has become a fairly a major part of what you're doing this for growing garlic\nWell we did we I mean we weren't that you know it was just the my friend of mine and maybe we grew four or five thousand of of of the ... a federal law had his\nFarm right so it's more of you know but uh but yes we had a we would cut this capes and the uh [noise] uh we had a there was a um a\nKorean women and Chinese women especially that would wait every year for [noise] because like I say they would pick on them and and and then we ... I say we frozen and\nThat was good and it was just really a simple projects I mean we didn't you know his Washington and uh we put them in a gallon of court a gallon plastic bag and froze\nInteresting if folks aren't able to get out and some reason they do they bypassed they were unable to plant garlic in the fall it still can be planted in the springtime if you jump on an early enough yes\nYou could do that they're probably the ball sizes and going to be as as big a and the advantage\nThe fall planning is like a if you're planning now first of October to [noise] maybe even into November it depends um just just you know so it's not the soil isn't too muddy and that's the main thing but ah with that to draw as you said it really\nMakes it easy to harvest because we could actually with a straw keeping the ... the ball size stays pretty consistent and then we could just hand pull the ball\n[laughter] well that have happened trying to dig 'em right\nYou know with with the straw and like it like he said the weeds were small we could you know a few episodes coming up or something like that but we just go through and and handful\nSure now any fertilizer you you the amends a soils at all or ... well\nWe did we use we had a we had access to come and or you know from the new or the fields but yeah you can for you can use in any type of a fertilizer organic if he if that's what a ... pretty much it and used phrase than anything like that mhm\nThat's where we had we had access to come and order which was good toy [noise] you know as we rotate it feels we would do\nThat you can't be some good Kevin door yeah yeah for good natural feeding yeah they are there\nAny type of a natural you know any type of fertilizer you can do that I Do that and put something in the fall when plants here in the soil\nGet old soil fall amendments no doubt about Bob great tips appreciate it", "show_name": "Ron Wilson", "year": "2018", "city": "Newton", "day": "13"}
