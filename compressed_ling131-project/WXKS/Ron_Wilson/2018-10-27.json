understand\nThe Durango kid daddy Gleason our producer does an outstanding job now I'm going to answer the phone to the ... going into the phone phone lines are open an eight hundred eight to three to five five anyway uh we had a a several emails this week\nAnd it always happens we have someone on a we're talking about a book a good book that's out there uh will be a good couldn't catch the name of the author of the book where I go find it a just a reminder for the folks that they couldn't remembers called garden renovation transforming your yard into the garden of your dreams and it's by Bobby Schwartz\nHer website is Bee Gees thumb a Bee Gees thumb dot com as and Bobby's Green Zone dot com and you could buy it on her website you can also buy that Amazon and places like that as well but again it was called garden renovation and this was a\nIt's a really cool book because what she does that's especially as a landscape designer\nGoes into homes that have existing landscapes and it's a tough thing to do I mean I was was a diner designer for several years in going into a house it was brand new with a clean pilot was so much easier than going into a house in adding existing landscape and trying to work with it I'm saving plants now you know you you would just easier\nUm but she likes to just the opposite she likes to go on with an existing landscape work with it and then try to achieve your goals I'm your designed the types of gardens that you'd like to have with the old landscape is already there and change things around and it's a really cool book says she has a lot of pictures of what she said I think all\nOf the almost three hundred pictures about Saddam or weren't hers all the rest were but she just she addresses literally everything in your yard sidewalks porches decks sheds\nFences screen plant things outdoor rooms she dressed as a mall and great pictures and a great easy read but it's a it's a wonderful book and um and that's why we had a wrong but against called garden renovation transform your yard into the garden of your dreams\nHer website is be jeep thumb dot com eight hundred a two three eight to five five Gemini ... good morning\nWanting Ron How are you good sort of yourself oh Julia Child [laughter] too early to tell a what's a good product to use a plane ticket they bring endorsed although if you're trying to keep the bugs out two things\nAnd I look at I'm Glad you brought that up because it was a little tip we wanted to share today two things I look at it as far as protecting the one is I Try to do everything I can outside before I even bring him inside and try to knock off as much as we can\nHosing them off with a strong stream of water really takes a lot of bugs off your plants and I'll typically do insecticide all soap\nAs the last spray before I bring it back inside now you can also do a systemic insecticide if you wish\nAnd you can do that before you bring it inside as well so it's you know it sprinkled into the soil water in so that's something you can do before you bring in it and when you go to your local garden center they'll have a systemic ... insecticide specifically\nFormulated for indoor plants and then must say for indoor plants and that's out there a bond I'd has the right thing for them has a\nA N n insecticide all soap I think is your real key to I'm taking care of bugs once you get them inside the house to fold insecticide also so organic all natural so that's a good thing and the thing about insecticide also presented you got to remember in only kills what you spray it on\nSo if there's nobody there doesn't kill anything so you have to you know if you see the brown break you get the insecticides soap out your your spray everything it kills what you spray it on so between the all that systemic insecticide this up inside the plant and your insecticide also during the outside of the plant\nReally does a nice job keeping under control one last thing I suggest to gym\nFor smaller plants that are maybe eight inch pots are smaller\nIf you can get them into the kitchen sink or a utility tub if about every three weeks or so you take those in turn them on their side and just really rent some off with lukewarm water\nAgain I go back to bike spraying plants off when you're outside that knocks might soften it knocks aphids often make so much a lotta things off and put some right down the drain\nWithout using any insects as inside sons as insecticides that also systemic insecticide in the soil insecticide also a me memorials available some folks like to use that as well but I liked insecticide also\nAnd then renting them off every three or four or five weeks you do all that stuff you pretty well can keep it under control and I always keep a um one or two things either an old shower curtain around because you can lay down on the floor which plants in the middle of and spray 'em if you need to protect the floor\nYou know also use those um pans than you use that you put on your car if you like draining the oil and that that looks like a huge cookie sheet\nReally work really nice to and then you put it on that you don't get it on anything else so those are my three things for keeping bugs under control once you get 'em in the house\nOne more question surfing they sure are ... just said as stumped removed and how soon can we crashed there
