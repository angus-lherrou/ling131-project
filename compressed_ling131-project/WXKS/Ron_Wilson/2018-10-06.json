going to talk about planting new trees\nWe want to talk about maintaining the trees that are already there keeping those over trees healthy but right now to go back to the gardening phone lines David loved one good morning\nRon How are you good CERN yourself\nNot too bad do it and I um [noise] ...\nKhan out over the years and I basically just have three wouldn't dancer kind of open the front and the cop a\nBut they do their job pretty good there and a half way sorry location but my question remains a is what one of the ban is kind of done until it gets it fully ready to go\nI always knew to use it I got the other two Byron Scott to cook them and then the bend it's already completed asking this looks like it keeps shrinking on strike or shrink and my question is should I put that in ... gets your bag it keep it so I don't know if the ... the weather in the rain will just keep up with an end to the soil that's already underneath it\nWell it does that under still could decomposing okay\nSo it continues to break down so it never stops so it's always raining down so like if you had that pile there eventually it goes all the way down until there's nothing left and it's the decomposing pretty much worked its way into the soil\nOkay so I could get that into into some kind of bag or bucket\nWell but even in the bag or bucket it's still going to decompose so you know yes you know that that way we should keep it in the bucket but it's still it's still going to shrink down a little bit I think the thing to remember is\nYou know that's what we're that if you look out you know an old free falls down and get this done playing there the tree trunk claim they're eventually as a decompose is it all goes away and you don't see it anymore it's done in the soil and the and that's what you're saying if you have raised planter beds and you do a\nSixty Seventy percent topsoil and in forty thirty percent organic matter as that break down to the top soil those beds always shrank in volume and you always have to come back and keep growing them up because that's the organic matter is it breaks down so\nSo yeah if you want to put them in something uh you know like a buckets her bags or something like that would would be fine absolutely\nLike a back after this break down it didn't really like mold or anything like that\nWell it could if it doesn't can't breathe well you know he put it in the ... and it can't breathe well as a matter of fact sometimes you look at Baghdad compost they'll punch ... and they're just to allow it to breathe a little bit otherwise you can't hold and actually get a little bit nasty and they're sometimes\nYeah you're right that 'cause I just wanted to soil that's already laying on route so it's just it's all and like you said is it in there yeah is it rains or the wind blows the course obviously that's kind of reaching it out of there too well good yeah great what you do store years in anything or\nYou just use it up as they try to try to use it up as you need it and of course as you get in the\nFall season you know top dressing soil amendments you know adding to the garden or whatever you know this is a great time per soil amendments and all that and that's where composting really comes in handy this you know you're you're ready to go compost this time of the year\n[noise] well I don't really have like a garden but I Do have some ... ... a couple a annual bad things go crazy and there but I guess I could uh aren't going around on my bushes in that kinda stuff\nIt as a top dressing use it as a mulch or you know when and if your if your neighbors aren't using compost and you seem to have a little bit of extra a list of gold and most people would would you know pay to get back out of compost\nYeah in a nightmare now your listeners\nOne last question I I can get a coffee and a um\nYou really can't put too much coffee you know obviously I'm not a it's not a coffee or anything but a is that they've got a good amendment\nOver you know what coffee grounds are can really fire up a compost pile I think you know coffee grounds can be added anywhere but put 'em in the compost and they compost pile that\nStuff is so great to help fire that compost pile up it's it's crazy so yeah use them in their Kenya over use it [noise] I Would say there is a point we probably could have a little bit too much but I don't I Would take a lot to get to that point\nOut here and great show and all our catch yourself\nRight day good talking to you or are very ... by and we're going to Virginia and talk with and good morning\n[noise] how long it will send you a possible yellow jacket issues\nI think [noise] it just struck you learn um [noise] it's like for in an arched roof area of the second floor balcony four feet up from that door mhm\nIsn't taken the arch and killer about to ensure that we've never seen anything go in and out of it we didn't see it go and it's not for why strike and a cold shape\nWell they can be but there are the ones that do that that's smaller round shape as well now you don't see anything come in and out of it at this stage\nWe haven't\nUm you know just to ... you know thing of it is once you start getting into cold weather you get a good frost or whatever that starts to knock all of 'em out and eventually of course that thing is going to decompose over the wintertime away trying to get the spring for the most part which was really heavily protected will break down and fall apart\nAnd I stopped in the winter would I Would I be able to knock down",
