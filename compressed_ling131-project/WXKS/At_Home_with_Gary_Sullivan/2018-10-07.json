me an email at ... dot com and if you remember where that school was a little bit follow up on it\nIf it's a state sponsored taxpayer subsidized school there's no way they should be doing something

it's obstruction of justice impatient with the house I'd be willing to go back to weigh in with\nTheir with their job or what the bill quite do claim that he tried to do call me to not investigate duff wouldn't be more\nReal said that he tried to drugs drug justice to stop calling me know you look you and I agree he didn't do that but those are the grounds they'll say obstruction of justice I think they will in fact to impeach him and I think the Senate would we would find him not guilty so nothing would happen\nBut that's the whole thing and it's a great question because the the voters of

E. D. there's different qualities and different types and different lighting so we're going to get that all straightened up we of carbon best story used with GE Lighting and Carmen welcome that open with Gary Sullivan\nHey good morning Gary how are you doing fantastic how about you I'm\nDoing great it's a great weekend so let's talk lighting because man we've been through quite a change over the last Twenty years\nUh that's we have we are the incandescent lighting and used to be you go into a store and you know you knew what you're going to buy and then we went to a whole CFL thing and a lot of people are just just hated that lightning and now we're in the L. E. D. lightning so\nJunior junior kind of just talk about an overview of lighting in general ... kind of dig deeper [noise]\nWell it's a great time to be talking about lighting October is\nEnergy action month converting incandescent are halogen to Eli is the right time to be thinking about it especially as they are getting shorter and I took any longer\nBut really has changed with almost come full circle Gary in terms of like bald performance and we had CFL we can have the energy savings and long life kind of sacrifice that\nLike quality or that slow warm up more that flickering whatever it is basically allowed us to do is to get basically the same performance that we had with incandescent ... in terms of a bright light dental comes on instantly what great color\nWithout having to sacrifice and other things that we had with CFL you get the long life and the energy saving\nMan I'll tell you Eli the lighting is super energy efficient as\nIt is if you look at a sixty watt incandescent bulb now more than Ninety percent of the energy that was coming out of that Bob was heat\nMhm Mm that lady\nIs using eighty five percent less energy it to the same brightness so you're getting an eight hundred looming equivalent sixty one lightbulb mhm\nUsing less than ten ... instead of our traditional sixty ... so it's a much better from an efficiency standpoint huh option than a traditional incandescent off\nNo when I go to the store to buy LCD bulbs and I'm sure everybody's got one or two ... made the entire switch I get in there and I see flood lights I see\nYou know what is um you know like a sixty one old fashioned bowl and I see different price ranges there's different qualities of Eli ... correct\n[noise] there is like with anything in a home improvement store or in a mass merchandising store or there is differences in terms of performance there's differences in terms of quality\nThat you're looking at Eli Wallach brightness they don't want to necessarily at\nThe water's edge ... because really what we're trying to replace when we're looking at a sixty what all is looming right does sixty wipe all this going to produce about a hundred women in the first four as I thought that has around\n... author lumens the second they might want to look for his life so there's different tiers of LA days are good summer last ten thousand hours on the last Fifteen thousand hours which would be three hours per day use Gary equivalent of having that bought last for Thirteen Years she did something different on your Sunday Morning instead of\nJust like all like the last one I ... it was like thirty thousand hours yeah isn't that amazing that it was fantastic ... that's perfect for me [laughter]\nThen the third thing the thing that ... has kind of opened up for us as on one hand we can replicate incandescent so they're looking for the software in light of incandescent bulbs LA they can provide that but not everybody\nAn incandescent like light or maybe a different room is your house you want to create a different food or different effect and that's the LAT has opened up so now Gary one of the more popular trends right now is vintage lighting\nLoan yeah dial where you see the like old ...\nExactly right from an efficiency standpoint those bombs are terrible and they're using more\nElectricity but not providing a whole lot of like MIT now has given you the opportunity to get that same look that came warm candlelight glow mhm but using a fraction of the electricity so you're using\nFive lot instead of ...\nPerfect person and you're getting\nA long life so this is an opportunity for even on some of those styles that you don't necessarily want to replicate what you had with incandescent ... also switched to LA day and get those benefits\nWell just taken everybody back from when they went to shop for their first L. E. D. bulbs they were confused about lumens they were confused about energy savings they were\nConfused about the lighting and then different people started talking to including me start talking about Kelvin units\nRight up to seven thousand the lights blue and super bright and I made a mistake myself buying the wrong brightness of ball but\nThe reason I wanted to have young Carmen is genie lighting his finally got it together in terms of changing the whole lighting industry back to where it was where you've got you didn't know\nThat the mood or the light of that ball which is you know like a softer why the bedroom like you made it simple and I love it [laughter]\nWell for most people spending hours thinking about writing is not what they want to spend their time on\nComing a PHD in life balls is not really where they want to spend their time or energy or effort went down into basically simplify it\nNow we've talked with consumers we know that people use light differently in different rooms of their home we also know that there's a lot of numbers and things on the package of that I frankly get pretty confusing so he could provide\nThat down to three different types of light there's relax which is a more warm comfortable type of light similar to incandescent you might want to use and\nThat room our family room places or kind of want to unwind okay there's refresh which is\nIf you want to do it and I might add a little bit of a scribe eight and three minutes late white and all of that right now huh it get off of that\nSo just regular table salt in a a a learning Arabic\nThat tent regular cable so I can say that just a show at the bad\nExcellent Victoria thank you\nYou're welcome and I have always a pleasure to show\nThank you very much call anytime soon ... by by by All right there you go I knew somebody you know\nI I don't\nKnow about pressing machines but Victoria did and she knew how to clean them so I thought you do everything you know sir I Do not know everything John welcome [laughter]\nGood morning I was just turning radio station I heard your show thank you a ... a lot of like ask a question about a light up [noise]\nI'd make eight light that reflect the light out of work that are out of ... out there may be a threat to life for showcases yes why couldn't they make a reading I\nThat's reflects light downward store you can read are you the though Condes flights like one of the the ... oh [noise] oh I'm Seventy one so I think I Need more light but my eyes are okay but you can't get a good reading like\nI'll tell you what do when you when you listen to Carmen and he was talking about different lighting shut out and getting\nIt on the back into the part of Congress\nOK I'm One of the things that I I Do is from personal experience All right so I too was always in search of a good reading light and I'm\nA CFLs are horrible for reading a incandescents yes they're not bad uh especially the old soft white were good\nWhen he talks about the L E D he talked about three different types of lighting and you can get really involved in nearby even talking about the brightness of the light is the measurement is cola Kelvin\nUnit [noise] the higher the job and unit the brighter in CRISPR the light is\nSo in the skills from one to seven thousand so if you had a light that was say five thousand or six thousand Kelvin units it would be a really white almost bluish white Christmas light\nIt which is excellent for reading GE rather than getting into this whole Kelvin units because nobody's going to do the research to really learn what I just talked about it they got different categories of lighting from relax to it's called relax refresh in reveal\nIn the reveal is the one you're looking for in that is a higher Kelvin unit light it is it is it is super Christ and it's for real close work or reading\nBut does it reflect light doesn't reflect light I Want her to reach you put into a regular oil and the light goes up\nThrough the shape to the to the sailing [noise] well look I always look for like ... like eating lamport reflects light yeah colliding but only downward\nI I don't think it reflects light downward but this light is brilliant it's brilliant light I I I Would encourage you to give it a try I don't know what that reflects downward I Know it would be great if they could\nIf they can reverse eating lap mhm every direction you know to to the area they put a coating on top to wherever reflect the light\nI remember the old fashioned incandescent it had a little silver kept to it [noise]\nIt reflected them but I've not seen one and only do like that but again if you're searching and try and different lighting John I Would uh I Would encourage you to find a GE reveal I think you'll find it really crispy light and a do it doesn't reflect down I think it's going to be [noise]\nA brilliant in terms of being able to uh see the details and help you with reading so that would be the tips that I Would offer you\nWrite from there we go to Alex Alex welcome\nEvery morning on Sunday Morning on the way that I really appreciate your your editor thank you [noise]\n[noise] um

I don't know that's a challenge isn't it I don't know if I'm qualified even the answer that Chris because when you got a flat roof any puncture as a potential problem do you know what kind of flat roof you got on there did you put on there yeah\nIt's a modified that I'm In\nOkay the north but to me yeah okay okay yeah ah I'll be honest\n'cause I I don't even want to take a stab at it I Would\nHave to do a little research myself on that one I don't know if I got an answer right away even to a point we're talking to a a a flat roof is similar to the person that would installed that what what kind of options have you received a disappoint you said you had a couple of options and one was a little less expensive\nUm [noise] well it it just depends on the the the\nQuality of the room for that you ask do you have a handy man they're like yeah we can put it right on top of that little you know ... Koch all the way around it but everything I've read on the Internet shows that eventually\nSo how do you really should fail it okay keep gone the other\nThe other is are you can do it it just has to go in under the under lame and and then um there's ways to make the post um have I got a thing that goes around them obviously that's\nA Butte water where you're like a ... exactly that that keep the water from India trading um and then the others are floating back you could do a floating docks structure on cutting basically on top of the\nOkay 'cause I'm ready for me or that one I'm familiar with the first to 'em and and I yeah\nSo when you first asked me I said I'm not an expert in doing it in the first thing I was thinking was your first option and that is where you puncture at UCLA there is a modified roofing cement that will seal that but anything\nLike that will fail I mean it might give you ten years maybe Fifteen a but it'll fail\nA eventually and so you know if you stay on top of it that's fine but it's gonna eventually fail the boot I'm I Am familiar with that and they use that concept really on quite a few\nDifferent roofing apparatus is I'm probably the most popular is like a bent pipe that goes through a roof be at flat or a even shingle roof\nThey use that booth concept where it's actually applied underneath\nAnd the puncture is you know the the ceiling that actually takes place by this booth and slides over it I Would say that's going to be of those two because I'm not familiar with the third one of that particular uh choices I Would do the more with the boot\nI'm it's going to last longer and you're not really\nUm you know punching through it you are to a degree you're building around it\nRight [noise] so okay well thanks I asked ... saying All right

I\nMentioned on painting the cabinet or been more does have as I said in interior\nA out kid water base enamel which is um is very good and they have a matching primer it's called advance\nAnd advance comes in a ... comes in a sat and finished comes in the semi glossed it even comes in a high gloss finish and ah it has a matching primer a perfect for used on cabinet tree or I Can't\nTell you over the years and I've done this for a long time over the years when there is a painting issue\n[noise] a very very I I don't know if I've ever seen it\nAnd that is that the paint was bad\nI'm sure it happens but every pain manufacture every paint batches May Day keeps samples of its uh tested in case of consumer has problems with the with the ... and then they go back on the paint company and the pain company you'll say\nUsually your preparation or there's moisture involve or whatever the problem is and\nI guess if it comes to push comes to shove they test the batch that they have on file and\nYou know like I said I don't think I ran into\nWhere the paint was bad it was always the applicators and it was always\nThe preparation or there was water getting behind the substrate a but if you do the preparation and you can just about paint anything alright eight hundred eight two three eight to five by that's our phone number you can join us we're talking about your home and John welcome\nTo and Gary yes or find\nA a some kind of bounce off you got a mobile home here and I tore out the bath tub and I'm putting a shower stall and its place and um and all the ... is in right now\nAnd one of the shower up to the army chief or a blast a drain you familiar with those\nTell me what the name is again it's so cheap I'm a drain that that goes into the bottom of the shower stall\nCame with a Ninety degree brass\nPipe straight and the BBC comes up on all okay into it and he put a new frame washer and they're right any tightened down our case so it's like a compression fitting exactly and it's about an\nInch long and and here's here's my dilemma um when I tour out the bath tub there was a great big hole underneath the original Plame was put in for the tub\nAnd that's where all the mice were coming in and so I boxed all that and so now you basically you have to have a boxer with farming\nOr going out to the septic system and then the shower sits on top of a on top of that\nAnd when I put the shower base in I can I'll never be able to get to the pie trap again it will be buried in that box and I can't afford to have a weekend and and so\nThe BBC's been tested no leaks that's all well it up really nice my concern that in the brain washer and and so the question I have four years this\nOne I put that Neil ... gas could actually go out to wash them\nIf I put some silicone seal on that gasket as well and then fly to down into the drain and it goes around the b._b._c. and then I tightened than not on top of it um ... when that silicone dried I should never have a leak there is what I'm thinking\nBecause if I get a week on ever going to know I have a leak because I Can't get it on the shower base\nUh once I put it in ha ha ha I wanted your thoughts on on that makes sense um\nTell me about the ... like the clear nylon plastic or is it rubber rice\nRobert Robert it's round about an inch about an inch tall [noise] um and it it when you put it into the [noise] the drain so he got their compression nut and it's supposed to\nAnd basically compressed that um but the b._b._c. can move a little bit and I live in a little bit I'm I'm afraid that seal is going to break 'em and then I'm going to get a leak and it's just going to be all over the water she's going to go down to the box I built into actually run out\nTime is that the end of the world I mean can you is that a cesspool if that happened\nI got to tear the ah the quality that momentarily blanket on okay\n'cause it's kind of showers kind of in a metal okay and I'm I'm a ...\nIt was like yeah take up the whole sharp pain or anything like that\nIf I could take up the whole shower pan but once I put the top half of the show so it's a full size to ... at the bottom half and he got when I when I put that on and I don't recall in those two together like the manufacturers said it was supposed to [noise] I'm never going to get it out\n[noise] so you got to come from underneath I thought I'm\nGoing to have to come from underneath the mobile home if I ever have a week but the challenges that probably never going to know if I have a week\nAnd right right right yeah right and then it might come back so one of the problems I have\nWith the silicone and maybe I don't know your answer to this is I don't know if the silicone will compromise ...\nOkay I'm In I don't know I Would have to look into that if I put ... ... is there a way to double up to ... you\nKnow it's it's it's all designed to to work together as one drain unit you know so it's about an eighth of an inch thick you know the pre war that this about an inch tall so it slide down it grips quite a bit\nI I'm also trying to think of all the times they've done plumbing whether those ... are ever failed it's usually the pipe that failed okay I'm In quite honestly a lot of times taking those washers off a re used them\nUm\nSo I guess if I were you um first of all I I really think of it fails and you hit a lake and you didn't know it and the it rots out and everything\nI Know we don't want to do it but it's probably not the end of the world is repair bullets you know not like space shuttle here [laughter] I mean you can get it and you can you can repair it\nI'd be comfortable with the ... washer um I don't think I Would use the silicone unless I was released certain\nThat that wasn't going to compromise or the ... yeah and I'm not going to we'll compromise some types of products like that\nYeah and I I I'm I'm not certain that it won't to you and that's why I thought I'd give you call and you know if it fails five years from now that's one thing if it fails a week from now after I get the whole thing put together that would be kind of disappointed\nI Would need a pretty more should be good for a while\nOkay I'll give it a shot [noise] All right good luck to you John I think he blessing\nAnd the coupon code is Gary and that sale runs this week so take advantage of that and let's get back to the phones we have Helen Helen welcome\nGarry alone for taking my call you bet\nUm we bought from South of the ... to put in our maintenance building uh-huh [noise] and um it it will go in the office and the bathroom [noise]\nBut when my reading they stop directions hair and gas join a health care needs to be between sixty five and eighty five year round for the life of the product and that's just not going to happen [laughter] maintenance building\nThen that's probably the wrong profit I guess\nYeah I guess we should get that get back in ...\nYeah because it's gonna happen it's going to affect that it eats of I don't know which do you have is it to connect do word has kind of like a song and it has the the east of there\nAnd his team Howard the whole that whole black yeah at the ... whatever that is\nWell obviously there and he said that they\nPut on there is compromised woman you gets below sixty five degrees so if you're not going to have it that that's not something you want to use\n[noise] ... you know when you go to Florida and went to like hardwood floor in your house uh-huh um you have to keep stop at sixty five or about how we don't\nKnow okay no no\nHardwood floors I I mean they're all kind of different there's all different kinds of it he says there's obviously a reason to manufacture does not want the issues\nThat I Dream temperatures because they know what's going to fail\nYeah OK ... Daniel I had another question\nAll right we'll see what\nI'm running out shale like pulling the advertisements out your house right ... yeah I never heard you to talk about that\nYeah in fact we even had a gym for runners shield on back in the summertime uh really but yeah um so it's a lot of paint it much much more than a pain\nTo and this is um [noise]\nIt's got many benefits it's\nI'm very very durable it's much thicker than paint it also has some\nEnergy saving properties it's got a um it's got ceramic coding in it which bounce back you know solar heat game um\nGood football over a looming fighting perfect fighting about that was put on a fixed mhm [noise] but it's you know if something wrong with that rent Tina that want\nOkay well again and how long ago was that\nProbably plenty yes certainly that's pretty good and money tied yeah that's pretty good [noise] so that's really bad but\nThat's really your options so aluminum siding whether you go with the rider shield or you go with paint\n'em is is probably one of the best substrates to put a coating dog because it's it's stable it's not absorbing moisture I Would say that goes on with her second crack it's like absorbs moisture so it's very stable\nSocial preparation again the key runner she'll do that the rhino shield is just heavier duty than a pain it's like I said it's a coating it has reflected properties\nGoing to last I mean not paint lasted really good so bad you know I mean that's certainly an option for you or the rhino she'll be probably one and done I I'm going to say it say lifetime warranty I could be wrong on that I can\nForget the word to use but I Know it's a long time it's at least twenty five years\nUm but I it's perfect for ... it's perfect for aluminum or vinyl siding great okay I'll I'll be looking that up then yeah given won't care what it's going to be in\nYour decision OK satellites are begging my call you're quite welcome Ellen thanks to care Bye bye\nYeah that has um [noise] what\nTell you what if you got to even uh I I kept talking about the signing but even if you're a\nDoing the runner shield over would\nAgain it's it's a more flexible sicker coating than some of your pain so drew believes there\nJim welcome a yes or\nThe comment on the guy but in the shower base in or the child was uh-huh I put up these the hard work off underneath there on a box you Bill uh-huh so um [noise] it doesn't change the water would have a lake first of all make sure it's up to the shower doesn't really\nHave somebody wrote a bunch of water while he's on to their native ... not going to bail it gets ... and\nI agree and and then when he so instead of being ... completely what was that a piece of artwork walk on the bottom ... does grip\nAnd he's going to have to go on to their to ship it's dripping\nRight you'll see he'll see on the ground below that it's ... and that\nThat's not a viable option you can use that will troll ball that search finding ball uh-huh and my my will not eat through that you can cap slate that whole grain system\nWorks out well and to ensure the ever does have to get into that dream bidding\nSpray it and kept lawn or a coating like you'd use on a garage door ... overhead is your long base and all stick\nTo that seat and let it dry\nAnd then in ... food thing was that they're not at all with some insulation properties to to correct yeah I I didn't remember what part of the country why did I get I forget I it's on my screen but I didn't have the the bomb on work and any time you know for sure [noise]\nI Know I ...

I was trying to white at all wow what kind of glue is it\nNot real sure but I bought the\n... so the Google bond is probably what you use that did nothing\nAnd it's clear and and now I just cannot get that you know that's here Phil ... the in shape\nYeah boy I use ... and I'm really scared that clear shield whatever we use on there we also run the risk of making that cloudy\nExactly you know like I\nUsed to use something like ...\nI think that would just damage the plastic I think you're right you know and that that would be a good solver to remove it easily but not gonna work for a minute I'm\nThe only the only other thing I could think of and I hate to see go run and buy a bottle ten dollar increase of remover but you hear me talk about a political ... remover back and and that's that's not going to hurt the plastic\nUm it's word he used to live I don't know if it's going to remove a boxy though\nA lot really short boxy is what's on there because you know how it works it's more or less like to choose a right and and I can't even though I had a huge that on another part of the helmet it it's\nHard for me to think that that got on there and weighing down because it's just that it is not liquid early age\nYeah [noise] so did you use the glue or no\nYeah I did but unfortunately I I just can't recall ... very well in America you know that that little tiny too but that clear glue that what it was\nYeah so they're so like a super glue right exactly yeah yeah so that's I Know acrylic and there is a super glue remover\nUm but again I don't know what that's going to do that plastic shield you'd almost have to try it down at the bottom to see if it's going to do that shield\nI I think quite honestly I mean I don't know what kind of glue used but I Would bet that's\nIt because the ... that is really really thin and runs and in fact some folks make a sign of acrylic that as a gel which is a lot more manageable um but there is a two ... of equal size as the super glue\nThat is super glue remover\nAnd um you know that would be something I Would try uh did you say you tried the nature of alcohol\nTry rubbing alcohol\nAnd then I tried the good stuff and then I tried the hobbies all but yeah and I thought that would cut it for sure I I'm not sure what the scary because okay it's\nIt's it's you know it gets on usable now that when it gets spread write anything I Do is is worth\nA shot OK okay ships okay where am I going to get stuff you're talking\nAll right so if you have any good natured alcohol on your house try that if you have any nail polish

blue remover\nOr you can get it at a hardware store and I think I feel pretty certain ... it's going to do what the finger nail polish did is going to liquefy but then it's going to smear ads you\nAll

stores\nUm it's a sticky substance um\nBut that that would be a possible option I don't know of any spray\n'em there's no way to really put any wire barrier like hard work lots in there I don't suspect it'd be pretty yeah yeah\nSo if you're looking for a quote chemicals spray something along those lines you might just Google a product called tangled foot it comes to talking cartridge\nOkay All right All right good enough yeah if you actually read member of money\nAnd uh I don't even know if it's made anymore used to be a pretty popular product but I'm from an environmental standpoint I don't know if it's out there anymore she might check that out chicken to the next break right to ah Wisconsin we go in amber\nWelcome yes my\nName is ... and I love your show um I have a\nProblem I have a little bit and let me play ... and ... with a heart transplant and we recently moved to a trailer that would donate it yeah I\nAnd we sat on about a month a year\nAnd we have leaks in real and and pretty sure that there might be some more on the Internet and not happening\nNation in the insulation mhm\nI have ten dollars kind of hit that lady I'm Wondering if you think that we're trying to remodel trailer with a pen and now it or what we should\nBut I think the first thing you need to do is you need to confirm whether there's black mold and there are a dangerous molded than they have to be black a dangerous mold or\nNot um and you can do that to buy um\nInexpensively amber it's um it's a five minute mold test it you can get 'em it ace hardware it's almost like a pregnancy test kid it's a little plastic device in a swab\nAnd you don't have to swab the mold you can just swab around the tops of doors you some of the you know there's usually dust on door frames um swab that\nAnd inserts that into\nUm into this test kid is it'll tell you if it's dangerous mold or it's not dangerous moment if it's dangerous mold\nThen you really got to consider whether it's even worse remodeling that um because that could be not only just in the insulation that could be on the\nUm backs of the uh panels of the walls\nIn other words that trailer may not be able to hold has value to take care of that\nA particular you know the issue so the first thing I Would do amber is is test for mold and then kind of make the decision from there as far as the league you know whenever you have water introduced to a house\nAnd you have organic material there is a good chance you mold and may not be black mold or the dangerous times more but you would have mould\nOr you would have maybe a common variety a mold that wouldn't be so dangerous but I I'm thinking you got some big issues with the roof leaking and you've been sick and you've got um\nUm you know you're able to observe that there's some mold and the insulation of patching the roof I don't know how old the trailer is I don't know what the problem is somebody they have to take a look at it and see what it would take to get that straightened out but I I'm going to venture to guess that the answer is\nI'm no it's it's probably not going to be money well spent in that trailer", "year": "2018", "show_name": "At Home with
