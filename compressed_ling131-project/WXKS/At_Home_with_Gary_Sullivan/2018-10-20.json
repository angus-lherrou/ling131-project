consulate in Istanbul, Turkey the White House is weighing reaction\nAnd better and greater and\nLarger reach of people so that uh we all learned of from each other and that's one of the great things are doing this show I I Walk with every week and what the ... too so\nUh let people know how they can become part of our a little group of weekend warrior so's uh a bill welcome\nUh yeah 'cause I I have um a stretch crack developed in a basement wall a cement block wall and um it's bulged out a little bit not too big and then not falling down or anything and I've had some contractors and to look at it and I'm getting\nSome different types of advice\nOne wants to put five spring loaded I beams against a wall on the inside this to push it back but no excavation or clean out also there is some dampness on the bottom blocks along the basement floor the bottom blocks have dampness on them ... and a\nOne wants to just push against the wall but not do anything about they drain outside or you know not excavate or may not that drains the other one wants to bust out the cement floor inside and put a inside draining some pomp and the other one's two other ones\nAnd the right way to fix this problem problem came from the outside you fix on the outside and they said excavate that wall clean out jet claim they I'm drained that'll take care of the damage is at the bottom and then a\nA resale the wall back so with gravel and then if you have to put a beam inside\nPitch to straighten out the wall which is pretty slight I'm there I Am with different advice\nWell yeah well [noise]\nHard hard to answer but I'm going to give you an overall first of all when you keep saying clean out the drains is their pipes around that foundation drained pipes around that foundation that are crushed Claude gr what's going on what are they keep talking\nI mean at the foundation has been a widower now we want to dig it up okay but well\nHere you know wall says eggs in Ben's unless there's a reason and that reason is always water\nOkay that's your number one enemy so water is an issue water is an issue on the outside and water is an issue underneath that floor I think what you're getting is you're getting partial answers but if you're really looking\nAt a complete fix I Would say you got to do almost all the above\nI'm the first thing you want to do is we don't know if those pipes are crushed we don't know if there's pipes there we don't know if they're plugged but we know the first two blocks or wet so what we do know is the water table was higher than the floor\nAnd now that may be during big monsoon rains but we know that that water table rises up saturate says blocks incomes in the way you correct that is you cut the floor you put in drainage pipes you catch the water as it comes up you rather to some bump\nYou pump it away from the house you've solved the problem that's\nHow you saw the Fort problem that's one of the problems\nNow if you don't solve that problem really the best way to explain it builds if that water keeps going up and down and up and down I'm Talking about the water table up and down and up and down those foot or start settling in that wall begins to bow\nAnd I think that's what's happened so the first thing I Do is you know cut the floor put in the underground pipes you run into some well in a mood the waterway that's part of the fix that's not the whole fix because the outside\nThere needs to be some excavation being done you need to run some pipes around that you need to catch the water the phone from the sky and neither Ponting around that foundation and you need to move that water away from the house\nSo then you're correcting the water around the foundation you correct in the water underneath the foundation you were then controlling all the water around that foundation\nThen you can address the wall now there's multiple ways we can stabilize that wall um I don't know about this spring beams but there's beams any type of support to stabilize the wall\nIs going to need to be done there is also one company that actually uses carbon fibre doesn't pull the wool back\nBut this carbon fibers applied over to the block which then stabilizes that wall\nStrengthens at wall and we've also eliminated the source that is making that wall bowl so you say it's a slight bow all we want to do is we'll make sure it doesn't do any more and we've done that by correcting the water problem\nAnd we've corrected that by putting a carbon fiber of with a block which is stabilized at Wal we implant back but we stabilized\nNow they ah we never get water innovation and we just get damaged I found a box\nYou know there's no water coming in yet only right and\nI think that they knew the answer yet yeah\nBut they uh uh you don't think just jetting out those excavating and getting out those are outside drains has gone into\nIf that's the problem you told me you weren't even sure there was drains under there\nYeah there are because they have some pipes that run up um vertically okay all around the corners of the house they ran these uh plastic pipes okay well I'll tell you why wouldn't they found him for a gravel so how they felt those pipes full of gravel\nOkay and what was the purpose of that I have no idea okay that's how it was also\nI just told you how did you know completely waterproof and stabilize wall yes there are side things you can do I just can't promise that's going to work\nYou know I always talk about killer jeeze and the killer genes or this is what causes waters show up or I just what causes water above which sounds simple but it's what causes it it's groundwater\nGrading and gutters\nCutters get clogged water spills on foundation dumps about putting water right on that foundation that can cause it\nBad grading other words the ... slopes towards the house instead of away from the house that can cause it groundwater that's bonding around the foundation that can cause you correct all those you make correct the problem\nYeah we have good grading nation everyone that's come here says oh you got good\nDraining away from the house you know\nHow to answer this way bill not to confuse you further I kind of show you the\nWhole system\nThat eliminates the problem\nThat if a company does that they're going to do a lifetime warranty on it it's going to be more expensive than the others but you're done can you do the jetting out ... Ken\nWill solve the problem it might it might\nDo it finally long term if I were to do one first to see what the result how it would you do the inside\nCat with some pump or the outside excavation with clean out first\n[noise] if I if you can tell me where that water is coming either coming up through the floor whether it's coming through the war I can answer that\nI got ya\nSee that's one kind of going falling back that whole thing that's why it's a system\nTo say they're coming from the floor down yesterday right\nThat's exactly right that's exactly right and if it's coming from up above that gets in your whole type thing and the grading thing that I was talking about the down spouse\n[noise] alright got a break we'll continue your at home with Gary Solomon\nFor your home is Jessica clicking away that guarantee television online dot com he's at home when Gary element [noise]\n\n\nOdors\nFrom mold mildew household cleaners get trapped in our homes in fact the EPA says the air we breathe in our home is five times more polluted than outdoor air get an easy breeds ventilation system like I did\nIt exchanges the air my home safe clean healthy air all day long easy breeds reduces allergy and asthma triggers to\nCheck it out letter E. letters e breed dot com recall eight six six eight to two Seventy three twenty eight easy breeds\nMy favorite product to clean kitchen kept missing the woodwork in my home is bill ... furniture polish middle ... most crime dirt scratches an old wax from wood and restores it it'll even removed ... and water rings mill psych also makes a great leather clean air my favorite stainless steel cleaner\nThis weekend only by two twelve ounce bottles of the same product for early Nineteen Ninety five stock up on the cinnamon raspberry holiday oil to twelve ounce bottles for only Nineteen Ninety five through Monday Night order at ... dot com\nWhen I have a repair project I always read from my role of gorilla tape see gorilla tape is three times stronger for a whole that last I like it because they have the double think it heats of Soviet them grip to smooth or rough and uneven surfaces gorilla tape has a tough reinforced backing but you can still ... by hand\nAccording to a study published in the journal scientific reports this could indicate Alaska may have been a superhighway for dinosaurs between Asia and western North America\n[noise]\nFox News on the hand like thousands of migrants trying to enter the U.S illegally is a lot of them all in Mexico border are being arrested holding facility has no room to detain them\nThey will be given assignments and they'll have to come to a court appearance\nRegarding their asylum request and they will be released to the public and asked to come to this court dates and this is the catch and release and action right now this is a loophole that the president in so many others in Washington have talked about needs to be fixed\nNo winner last night of the mega millions lottery the jackpot jak ... that hit one point six billion the jackpot they're storing these days and so when your chances of winning but that's on purpose lottery officials now if the jackpot hire more people will play conscious Carmen Robert this is Fox News [noise]\nI used to pace of job ... only to sort through tons of resumes tend to find a few candidates for ... my hair salon that old process was not smart and I went to the appropriate technologies camps resume for me to find the right people and actively invite them to find the wagon qualified candidates fast\nSmart ... three to number one by employees in the U.
