and\nAnd the department of energy has a map on their website that shows you what the our values should be for the attic area\nAnd for the walls of your home\nIn fact if you go up to a place that sells insulation that energy map is right on the bags of insulation so you can do that too so let's just say it's an hour forty two and the insulation is maybe in our three per inch of sickness you can do some quick math and\nI can figure it's going to be around sixteen inches of insulation somewhere in that area and if you get up there and you're measuring you've got five inches of inflation\nYou you know you get your work cut out for you\nSo can you put insulation on top of insulation for the most part yes the only way you wouldn't want to do is if you had a vapor barrier that was a on top of the inflation which I Hope you don't have usually vapor barriers facing down towards the living area of the house it\nLet's say you had five six inches you know you've got to add another ten twelve inches on top of that and you can put batting down an faced batting or you can blow insulation and then you could blow a silo since ... and you could blow fiberglass insulation you don't want to cover up the soft advance\nIf he had old wiring up there you don't want to cover that up in fact you shouldn't insulate over it at all ever never\nIf you have older candlelight you want to make sure that they're protected you don't want to insulate over them\nBut for the most part not a difficult job if you wanted to late\nBachelor that's fine bats are not quite know the you know they're still going to be a gap between the would up in the ad I think that the Joyce the presses there's going to be a little seem there where's your blowing it in and it's kind of film and all that area\nBut just adding insulation real good idea to get it up to speed the LA Times your department of energy will tell you okay for new constructions are this is remodeled should be our this but you know somewhere in between if you're just sitting up there for five inches of insulation you you got some work to do\nAnd also when you get up there just to kind of take a look it's crazy what you're finding your attic\nFind mold on the underside of the roof maybe some rotted would maybe you get them oyster issue\nMaybe there's dead birds in there maybe there was some critters that we're living in their nests was made in the inflation\nSo that's telling you you got a problem you've got a breach somewhere in the top of that house it needs to be repaired\nAnd maybe that old insulation needs to be removed at that point\nBut a lot of times it's outside it's out of mind\nAnd that's not always a good option so when it comes as we say to start keeping the cold air out that's a real good place to start is the ad against elation and just get up there and take a look and see what's going if you're not capable of getting up to get somebody to get up there and take a look at it or do an energy audit\nAnd address those issues eight hundred ... two three eight to five five that's our number Mike welcome\nSir how you doing doing great\nRight now I'm a ... a cabin down in that field at Santa Fe river uh-huh I've got a guy will too but I kinda like at that rate foment relation uh-huh but you hear what he wanted to do it for her to write a while\nAnd the crowd things underneath it it got on the side of the mountains though\nThe lord and it won't be dumped it up in the attic he wants to pray at the top of the roof of metal roofing\nOver two by four that are on that yet Mars Arnold ... over the vertical raptor for just didn't they wrote out some kind of ventilation now certainly inflation up doing it in groups filling in it [noise] mhm but I have no way to get that phone to stay up there and then do the\nDominant group that does raise the top of the roof okay ... prior to the root\nMhm mhm so there's not going to be any venting in that in that room corrected we're just going to encapsulate that whole attic area correct\nThat lady and I don't need to do any um property and selling of it that way\nThat is correct so what you're talking about is actually pretty trendy my kids started probably Fifteen Years ago yeah you're a trendy guy can tell\n[laughter] oh well the guy I'm not going there\nI'm not going there so uh [laughter] to answer your question yeah about Fifteen Years ago a company called ice ... started this process of whole house in ...\nAnd and it really is it makes an entire insulated Ava low to the house from the roof all the way down to the side walls it doesn't require suffered venting it doesn't require roofing a roof venting because basically that attic area becomes a conditioned area now\nSo if you had air conditioning or heating that becomes a conditioned area so it's\nKind of all in one in terms of the house very very cost effective very very energy efficient\nVery quiet in that house now the challenge because there's nothing that's ever

hour drive systems and I'll tell you what I'm five hours a day and was shot\nAnd and I bought a used that wall more was using that way over three hours and hours on it uh-huh and yeah he uses very good quality\nOil or the oil that interacts says to use in it mhm I I'm all day long that engine doesn't use any oil whatsoever\nYou know human it sounded odd\nTo me again I didn't read the operations manual but I asked him if both said that and he said yes\nUm but I don't know I don't know I don't know of an engine that burns up in eight hours well you know I mean it might be ... but I don't know if it's going to need additional oil\nYeah I I think I'm the reason why ... Iraq as that is as that hey what are some who are\nThere now what he has to do explain to people in ... installing it oh can work around that but again it all goes back to the quality of oil well oil you use a better up armored sure going to get\nYeah some of the holidays or you know even longer lights than they were certainly Twenty years ago\nThose general wreck engines are so well bill uh-huh have oil cooler\nI have a two so under\n... ... is the man it has a oil will around it has a an extra\nOil filter on it and uh like I said I I ... I ... a day and it's a Seventy two inch long more\nSure well your agenda wreck fan that's for sure one of the things I said Jim and I think you will agree obviously you love your general reckon I get that\nA color doesn't really make junkie the kind of why so no no no you're not going to go wrong either way the biggest thing you can do regardless of what standby generator you get is gets a maintenance agreement and get that thing taking care of and\nYou know tip top shape ready to go because when you needed you need it now oh yeah and and then you don't want to say on caches skip that last well you know check up\nAnd now the thing and fire and but\nI just have him shore and he tells the installation people sure um you know that there's a gap in areas that can be home\nYeah and quite honestly I think that's why a lot of people by the so I'd be curious to and I'll look into it also ah it seems um eight hours is just a little that is a little troubling to me\nTo any other good thing is because why they use natural gas propane sense it's not liquid fuel\nEngine oil stays absolutely plain because there's no liquid ... that are going to run down and so on her wall ... shop the walls or that's what causes usage because of the oil and then you start using oil so I'm\nAll right well very good thank you for your input certainly appreciated alright eight hundred day two three eight\nTo five five would kind of get in our homes ready for winter we talked a little bit about insulation we've talked a little bit about I'm a generators as you just heard standby genders we talked a little bit about ventilation\nYou know there's all kinds of places we go from here that's for sure when it talks about to get in your home ready for\nA winter I guess one thing we got to really do is take a look at that entry door take a look at the back door take a look at the side door next to the garage let's see what kind of shape that is let's see if we can stand in your living room or your for your and just look up between the gym and the ... day like\nDo you feel a little breeze\nDeal look down at the bottom of the door can you feel a little drift there because those are the vulnerable areas that allow cold air into your home now there's ways to do a little test to see if there is there a filtration I talked about the thermal camera but one way you can do this is a cool little trick\nYeah we took it's dark at night and send your better half or friends outside and you stay inside\nAnd you get a little light and you go along the top of the door down the side of the door down the bottom of the door and your friend outside his\nPiece chalk\nAnd wherever you see the light penetration they just put a little you know X mark that they're ... they're seeing the light of you can see the light you're definitely getting cold air rushing into your home so if you get out there and you got a whole bunch of a\nCheck marks or the whole thing you could see like a you know you got to make some adjustments with that weather stripping in a lot of times weather stripping just after eight ten years it just gets old it gets brittle\nSome of the stick on foam weather stripping ... I I Know it's easy and I am all about easy but a lot of cases after about three or four years those babies are done\nI talk about a ah he company\nI use it like for generations if they've been ripping off people a ... they wouldn't be in business for four generations\nBut having not inspected good idea [noise] how 'bout um changing the filter do you do that regularly you should um and I'm going to be very general here but changing that silver every Ninety Days\nIs where you should be you know one of those big foreign inch pleaded filled her show those good six months you get a little fifty nine cent far because once you're thirty days but most of the pleaded once you can get Ninety Days\n[noise]\nSo changing that you don't need necessarily a HVAC company to do that that's something you can do you keep your calendar on your phone or if you keep a paper counter put it down on that date Ninety Days to change that\nSilver but having it professionally inspected and a lot of people just want to I'm\nJust check it and make sure it's good in a lot of people want to know what to say they have really good specials because if there is something they would like to sell your furnace\nIf you've got a good reputable HVAC person and they're running a special for I don't know Seventy eighty fifty I don't know you pick the price of oil inspecting clean your furnace okay and then they come and then they said well Mr Gleason\nYou're his changing it is correct and you need a new furnace or this is done you need a new furnace\nI'm not saying everybody's a crook all I'm saying is\nCareful be careful yeah exactly so a lot of times they'll actually have camera inspections and they'll show you the crack and then you'll say okay maybe you'll get to ... maybe you will and I don't know it's up to you but don't make a panic\nDecision if you see the correct that go ahead price set out for me\nIf you're in a situation where it's really really cold in January you got to make a panic decision right that's where you kind of want to get this out of the wing now\nAnd if you're not comfortable with the person telling you that it does not hurt to get to quotes because there's a lot going on and the furnaces there's a lot of choices to make\nAnd when we have ah let's say under pressure it I'm not just talking about pressure from the from the technician I'm Talking about pressure from the weather we don't really do the research that we need to do\nA lot of times you know what what branch should I buy you know what\nThe real important thing is the technician you're using the company or use and I said there's a few weeks ago or whether it's a roofing company ... company if you're dealing from a company has been around a while\nHas a great reputation they're not going to carry junk\nBecause they're going to warrant that for a long time\nAnd they're going to be there for you so finding that good technician that's what you want to do\nSo anyway just getting nothing inspected getting it done or\nThe key and please if you get a carbon monoxide detector in that house\nSmoke alarm in the house you could say that\nAbout year round but it's really important in the wintertime if you're not having that furnished checked in the chimney inspected potentially there's things that can go wrong and you know we'll hear about the news\nHouses get closed up and then this family had a carbon monoxide problem and\nYou know somebody passes away somebody's ... the whole family is very sick you you want to get that didn't care and in one of the things it's interesting over the years I've done different stories in carbon monoxide if you feel like the whole family's got the flu but when the kids go to school they feel fine\nAnd you don't have a carbon monoxide detector they may not have the flu they may have mild carbon monoxide\n'cause that's what it's like you can smell it you can't see it but the effects of the human body is flu like symptoms interesting\nYeah so uh I you know this one lady I talked to their family had a criminal excited problem when the kids went to score went to an overnight one of their friends' house\nKids weren't sick lady when she went to work she was sick\nShe got home she be watching TV she they have a headache just feel lousy wake up\nThe horrible good work feel good huh and what it was the the the pipe that go into the chimney was closed and didn't\nHave an inspection and as soon as we're going right into the home so make sure you get a carbon monoxide detector that's very very important ah John welcome\nTo morning how are you doing good right like for show you a\nCouple of questions here on a on our\nGrounds a tile floor or the or the or the ground in the middle or what is the best way to it's it's almost like a wide is

that but uh you can use different um like a grand a gold they make a ground stone cleaner it's going to take some scrub and\nYou can use a Mr cleans scouring um sponge or that a plane and then the secret is to get that um get that sealed\nAnd that's the key getting killed so\nI mean in the path of clean it but it just seemed like material that I purchased um you know didn't clean it like a more gun you there yes you could always tell but it was wide are over there\nWell I'll tell you what I just clean some ground uh with some um granted\nGo route cleaner and then I feel that with a sealer and we're just talking to my wife and I were just talking about this this morning and it's amazing how it has not come back\nBecause the water ruse tells the moisture penetration into the ground so it

Ninety five percent of homes\nLeaky duct work and another misconception that's out there and then you know you might hear someone say well I have a new ... minute desperate can kill late yeah\nWell it's just because you put two pieces of anything together and it's prone to having you know points have leakage\nNow you may not know this in fact I Know you don't know this but was Seventeen years old my job was to run Duckworth uh-huh and I don't think duck works installed like this anymore because what I used to have to do and I had to do it right\nThat when we put those two foot pieces together we'd have to run little heck said screws\nAnd make sure those duck works were connected I'm not so sure that's done anywhere anymore\n[noise] [noise] yeah I mean there's there are and different approaches to the installation of growers and that the getting of the the ... and certain states across the country have codes now that require that for me the old when it's installed tell them when\nYou were saying that Ninety five percent figure of duck works leaky in the United states first thought I had this sounds like we need new duct work at our home so we need newer technology duck works that probably help huh\nIt would be OK Harris he'll help yeah\nIt's going to go there too because well you know you're not going to run a business of Ninety five percent of the um the leaky a duck work if we changed it you you got you got fifty years to get your ghetto that is true All right so I'm ... so it's a good bet that every one that's listening\nThey're not getting the efficiency of it\nIt's they're not getting that heated there to the places they want so what is zero seal\nThe deal is a technology that was developed about Twenty years ago or by the department of energy acts really uh-huh yup down at the UC Berkeley lab mhm um and it was it was developed to help make the duct system more efficient at the best way to put it\nTo seal up the tiny holes and cracks are that are are typical into an adopted system mhm and it also at the at the long term uh you know almost permanent type solutions once you do this technology\nA sealed up the duct work and it's guaranteed for ten years but it's been a stress test it to last up to forty or so in those cases\nAre as long as you're gonna be in your home right right so it's kind of a line or well kind of I I some people\nTo simplify it look at it like kind of like six of flat in a way okay but and to be real precise about it it doesn't actually coat the duct work when it does is it finds\nThose holes okay like they have a balloon pop a hole in it you're gonna have air escaping out of that whole right kind of pressure on different ... uh\nOur technology is able to find those holes and then he'll I'm from the outside in the negative ... exactly that's exactly right\nYeah because ... ...\n... is that right now that okay All right yeah so ah so I have this done to my home and I I don't know when it was but I'm going to say\n[noise] Thirteen Years ago now and and I notice the difference immediately so for home\nOr first of all you got to find a deal with it in stone that I'm assuming that you go to air sold dot com\n... dot com and there is located are there are okay\nSo I called is called me up to that I say I want you to check my ...\nMhm thanks a A R assistant itself will check to see how leaky the duck for again so we do a before and after type comparison when they hook up the machine [laughter] they can run a test to see where they\nCharge you ... you know nobody can blower door to us for a house\nIt's a it's kind of like what's called the duct blaster tests that are similar okay I'm ... different dealers approach it differently or you know what they may or may not charge for that\nBut there's other ways Gary I mean you I can walk around my house you can walk around your house\nAnd just use your eyes to look for signs of duck linkage it's really\nIt's really pretty easy to find a you know I talked to my my mom and my sister about it and that they were able to just walk around and find evidence that oh gosh I could have what kind of evidence they find well uh one of the easiest of course you mentioned it right when we began this this segment here in it\nAnd a lot of people think it's normal for that that far room to be colder than the rest of\nThe how old is normal it's Ninety five percent which [laughter] ... right right but um but if your ducked\nI think that's our most of them were white people have got\nPeople every fan that definitely has been\nThere for made in

either there so let's make sure gets to where it's supposed to be you know if I'm buying a new furnace and they're probably going to be a lot of people buying new furnaces during the next ...\nYou know I mean we turn those like just you know the blowers battered I mean you couldn't just I'm not trying to be a Debbie Downer here but people find out that I found out last year my furnace was bad just about this time and it's kind of like ugh but when you're working with an H ... guy I'm\nKen he checked the duck worker getting can because like if I'm buying a high efficiency foreigners and I got crummy duck work\n... ... you know can he helped me at all\nHe sure can and there are so many different ways to check for evidence of how you're working you know performing how and how healthy in the ... there are simple tools and things that a lot of contractors Carrie it's called a smoke prefer okay\nYeah all it is ... exactly what it sounds like it's a little too but that will blow smoke and find air current for example he put your hand up to ... you're talking about that ... ... right right\nYou see smoke coming out on the air shouldn't be anything blowing right right you turn on that smell pepper ... you see that it's blowing either sucking it in or pushing it out\nThat's not a good thing and that's one yeah and in for a red\nOr as I say that I asked this question so you don't have to have the big blow tests that I had no you do not eating not so they shoot a ... camera on a wall and also you got a big old red line going right through the middle you were like what's\nThat all the ... it's like he per man right behind the wall and you get in the heat and cool and like you\nGot to register behind the wall and that's not helping anybody\nThat's right that's exactly right\nSo in all HVAC guys carry those for the most\nPart yeah and more and more these days ... and but as a homeowner I Would ... and I would ask how are you going to help me make sure that the Clinton is going to work with here what are you doing to address my doctor work because I Know how important it is a daddy Clinton\nAnd we also know Ninety five percent of the people have leaky duct cells so we already know you're not getting your value when you buy the new economical\nYeah what else carry the Atlanta that a lot of the equipment manufacturers now ...\nIn their consumer literature there now including warnings about the importance of it that break right and they're saying there are things that can do if they are causing Terry cause the fish and the drain sugar sure you ask about your duct work sure\nThey got phone calls and said hey this Ninety seven percent foreigners has not lowered my eating bill one bit yet that the why that but yeah sure you're right All right so if you are buying a furnaces getting installed talk about talk to you technician really\nAbout the thermal imaging some walls and make sure I don't have the leakage because otherwise you're not going\nIt's the value of that I'm highly efficient of furniture you're living in an older man you got a coup spots throughout the again\nGet a hold of any ... thermal imaging thing go to ... dot com in or you can find somebody that's a\nSkill to installing this particular thing and you say the paper that's usually in around the three years yeah on average yeah that that's often so look wrap up give me some benefits of if you're perfect duct work and you know nice\nNice uh efficient furnace and I have ever see on the ...\nAll right Gary I can do this one in my sleep look good I was thinking to myself that might be an unfair question grow up with a well known now or a\nKind of bond because there's really there's really no other product in our industry that can do all of the things that that can do um plenty that can be one of our two of the things that when you break it down for a year ago\nOr if you're a homeowner who has arrows deal done on your desk work and the things are going to notice they're going to be more even temperatures throughout your house none of those hot and cold spot cool\nAnd you're also going to notice a difference and the humidity you're

their\nAlright let's get to a rich welcome\nGarry love your show thank you\nWe have a a theater fence that we put a twelve years ago and when we put it up we painted and now we're at the point where it needs to be re saying\nOkay my only question is does it matter what kind of thing we originally put on a twelve years ago\nBoil versus warm now that I'm\nGoing to guess that's pretty pretty much a mute point at this point to probably the biggest thing you need to worry about is just ah making sure it's a really clean and that you get the pores of the would kind of opened up\nUm that can be done fairly easily I'm using an oxygen needed bleach and scrubbing that down rich and then use the would ...\nThat really opens up the wood fibers at that point no matter what you use for the use acrylic\nOr whether you use a oil base um it'll get it'll it'll penetrate the the wood deeper which means it's going to last longer right but uh if you had an oil based on who the only time you know there's always\nThere's always a disclaimer right and the only thing I could think of that would require you not to do that there is some products out there in fact one time would is one of the brand names is it is neither an oil\nBase Nora water base it's actually a liquid solid in other words for it doesn't dry it cures by the UV rays of the sun um in you know it's like Ninety dollars a gallon that lasts like seven years it's good stuff but if that was on that fence I Would tell you to stick with it\nUh but if it's just an oil in like a ton of moral base or even ... base or or water base at this point I think just get in and oxygen a bleacher would break ground or you'll be absolutely fine\nOkay great one other question how do how do I convinced my grandchildren standing offenses fun\nWill that my friend is is I I don't know but I'm all about that first you got to know how old are they\nAre they're eleven twelve in that area so they're old\nEnough okay well maybe money [laughter] they ... they had to start operating like us at that point and writer at night I think you've had by by maybe a spray or\nMaybe it's a prayer would be cheaper than paying the grandkids it'd probably be a little bit better job just saying I don't know you don't know if you're hanging with the grandkids right yup All right good man good man\nAll right it's eight hundred eighty two three eight\nTo five five that's our phone number you can grab a line as we talk a little bit about home improvement remodeling repair again it's eight hundred eight two three eight to five five lines are open so\nHave added Terry welcome [noise] hello yes\nMy ... now you talked about that one thing all at the bottom and then the one that didn't have the smaller one some place [noise] your problem\nWhat job with the mode\nWhere sometimes it goes down and sometimes it does come K. and I checked outside let their band at all and I had to replace that may not want to try what you had to All right\nSo um so the flush is not not working around it's not removing all the way so right usually when the waste is not thoroughly removed it's because the amount of water\nThat is coming from the closet to the bowl is not coming with enough or a velocity there's not enough of it that's number one the other thing is\nThe the bent pipe set you checked up top actually kinda come into a bowl of the toilet to takes water and air man and sometimes that little vent becomes um calcified mhm in narrowed opening so you don't get an affair to make that happen so\nAh let's work on the vacuum first\n[noise] um and and you know so we got a fifty fifty shot hear Teri ... a bottle of C L are\nAnd that that get back here than the burden on to have a bird thanks ... makes all kinds of noise has

wake up in the morning flush away\nOkay yeah I remember that but I can remember I had a little book care that I write everything down there who said that ...\nSo that that's that's the one chance the other one is the water that's transferred from the closet to the bowl is transferred through little holes underneath the rim of the poor last\nPlane dog ... you know about that because it might have went out to stand a bank problem and my cousin told me that signed down here and clean the mind and but that one one like up there that are real real oh darn\nWell let's hope that uh let's see all our
