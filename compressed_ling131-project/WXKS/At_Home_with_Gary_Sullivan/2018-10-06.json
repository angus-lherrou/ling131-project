All right um\nAnd they don't they don't give me a really hard time about it just require an incredible amount of documentation but what I'm calling you about is have you heard a lot of people\nVoicing concern that the ... ... it's the cellulose in the woods teary Rachel that would actually rush not on the surface ... from the inside out I mean you could aboard finally kicks in and does as you can put your foot through\nYeah um I just want to make sure this is this is not a composite ... no it's okay it's but yeah I've had a a few calls but I Can't say that I've had a lot of calls a bit more\nAbout the composite than than I have the pressure treated would look the whole industry as a whole and I'm sure you realize this and found this out\nAnd you're researching it wasn't just one company as the entire\nIndustry when they went from cc a treated wood to the AC cute too then other formulations\nThere were issues there were issues with the AC you\nI'm with the um rusting of the\nActual Joyce hangers an actual nails and screws exact and then they went into these other ones and the the the different types I mean everybody's using different formulations and they weren't but but I Can't say that it is a massive problem at least that is touched me\nWell I can see from my standpoint it's actually I Can't call it a massive problem it's a ... so aggravating because as I replace boards it's so hard that you know you see an individual board\nAnd my deck is probably dying ten twenty percent at a time\nYeah well it's a massive problem if it's happening to you I mean well\nYeah but I my decision has to be whether I keep fiction replace the Borgias they go bad or tear the whole thing up spending a huge amount of money to put something else though so anyway I just was concerned if you've heard that\nI had a few calls and I have heard of it and when I said massive I mean I'm not getting calls every week about it\nUm and but what it is out there\nUm yeah I get it then I get the whole you know do I do I bite the bullet now or do I just keep letting it ... me and just do it a little bit of time I totally understand that\nThe only thing I wouldn't I'd like to share with your listeners is is that one of the documentation things on these boards it's not the stamp the stamp on the board\nThat only tells them where the lumber may Russia's right but the sticker on the end that little stapled on usually a plastic stick or the or if they're going to put down their boards pull a couple of those officers stick them in an envelope right save them\nBecause that's the that's the crucial part of proving or your ... processed\nAnd ... and how it was process that exactly what interests us and who saves those labels huh\nYeah well actually I actually was fortunate that one feeling up some of my bed boards I found a couple of those into joining early say my ...\nAnd I hear ya I don't think I Would have saved them and I actually write in you know even to this day Jim I'll just taken a step further because we just try to educate people the best we can um ... we went through a process just so three or four years ago\nWhere in processing they started this thing called ground contact\nNon ground contact pressure treated wood and I stated on here numerous times you can have a deck that's twelve feet up in the air and if you cut trees around it and wet leaves fall on it it's the same as ground contact\nAnd ... do you want to use the ground contact pressure greeted would all the time in my book and now after four years we're starting to see\nSome of the big box stores the lumber yours figured is a long time ago a boat you know it's all about price and the big box stores and they now some of 'em are just carrying just the ground contact thank God\nBecause she says makes perfect sense yeah exactly well I don't know if\nYou want to hear a court version of this but if any of your folks have been to Stockholm, Sweden uh-huh this they discovered the ship was ... was discovered in the Nineteen nineties or late eighties\nAnd it was a ship built by the king of sweet or warship be went down to the architects office after they get laid the kill for this thing and he said wait a minute you've only got one guy on the ship I Want to go into\nThe architect should know your your majesty we can only do one guy on that because that's the way the ship design that hey I'm the king I Want to go back so\nYou know he's the king [laughter] so they built a trip to ... actually launched the ship bands played one over it drifted out into the harbor in a little breeze came up and they ship flipped upside down and went to the bottom\nAnd they discovered it a couple of hundred years later the building museum so that was it's in a museum in Stockholm harbor was a result of this is the sweet gum usually been lumber people their whole life\nAre probably the foremost uh in this whole idea would preservation mhm and those are the guys they're the best stuff already on what happens to cellulose would have made some Kurdish but I imagine the discoveries they've made probably which kind of leading the industry today\nAnd we'll keep us posed to a gym\nOn um

to go way would be my guess\nUm the ...\nIs is what will remove that um but now is it's so massive that you couldn't do that\n[noise] well I you know I Wish I could do it again you know I could I just didn't know if it was a safe thing to do after it had been sealed twice already and said\nWell ... is kind of cutting through the sealer uh-huh\nSo I don't know where they do in the whole area with design leaner just\nWork out who they spotted you know where that's where it gently with those ...\nAnd then what did they do with the similar\nThey failed everything they read everything not just

in Cincinnati, Ohio and I I had a child ranch with glass while I like to cook last thought Lyndon and the base let her have put in and water sometimes come through the edges of the existing lead and so\nI think last block Linda's advertise with mortar and silicon between the class blah and I and also on the install and I wonder what your car car\nWell um I still kind of like\nThe the mortar but you're not going to go wrong with the silicone either I mean I don't think there's a right or wrong way the problem if you're if you're trying to get to the solution on which way to go because of water infiltration\nThe real thing too because water will infiltrate through mortar it's not going to infiltrate true silicone but if there's enough water you create other pressures or other problems because of the pressure with silicon so\nI Would say either or their ... but really concentrate on how we can eliminate the water issue to begin with\nRight okay so maybe wait a glass lock and until we had to talk about that water\nYeah so do you know what is cause cause in the water upon their\nI knew we our neighbors had change made and their water diversion context literally when that we're having rain and share share of water running down there he'll hide\nBound to a concrete and actually we have the country and it gets down gravel a gravel walkway that but that right up to our house and where the windows are so there's\nYou know there's a tiny an inch or two of water that contain water cascading down right it's true yes so we need to do with like some I'm perfect strangers\nYeah probably a friend who trained underneath that grill but walk would work mostly if you have fall to move the water\nOkay um and how would we get a recommendation for a local kind of thing what do you think\nUm you know what it's been a long time since I kind of dug into it to be honest with you I only have one for you to report I landed on the one that you know I'm sure that I think since I glass block was probably one of the larger ones\nUm but I really haven't delved into it to be wrong recommend somebody\nOkay All right thanks very already take care thank you Bye bye yeah\nGood yeah that's a shame a good question though because really again we always go back to that it really is all about the ... water control I'm certainly you can put a mortar glass block habits you'll probably\nYou know unless you have a really big big time problem not gonna you know water will uh be repelled silicone too but it you got to take care of that water problem or both of them will eventually it'll cause a problem water either get in or you have a problem with the quest block\nEight hundred eight to three to five five that's the phone number if you'd like to join us let's get to Bruce\nBruce welcome sir\nYou had a question for you um read to in our house here in the Cleveland area and that got a marble um\nWindow sills and the previous owners had gotten to all over ... and I was wondering what would be a safe way to remove that came from this marble eyes were kind of products like\nIs it just bladders Bruce ... are\nPretty ... from a court a paint job cutting and\nWell I'm so you know if it's a latex paint I Do not know\nThat okay I'm I'm going to give you the so to find out if it's latex or oil base you can take some rubbing alcohol in in Rob the paint with a rubbing alcohol if it's if it's oil base it will get shiny if it's latex it'll get sticky and gummy\nIf it's latex you can use a product like Google on or product called ... and then it is for removing latex paint and we kind of exactly what you have splatter marks brush strokes whatever\nUm but it's not going to work on oil base so folks listening to me if you have you know latex paint splatter on a ... year thing floor you can use the goo gun or the hopes to remove that pain [noise] um if so that's that's how you would remove but also a paint stripper that I talked about\nEarlier Bruce that is totally non caustic\nUm you could use a pain stripper they're called blue bear um you could just brush it on and\nThen the next morning come back and literally just wipe it away\nOkay yeah we're we're a where would you get the mood\nThere you get on line so their website is called\nFriend mar F. R. A. N. M. A.
