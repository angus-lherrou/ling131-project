in your home if you're missing some weather stripping or some of that threshold is damage so that's another thing you definitely want to check as the temperature gets a little bit chillier our number is eight hundred eighty two three eight to five five and of course we're talking about your homes Steve welcome\nThis are just fine [noise]\nI don't like about twenty five years old [noise] but [noise] you're happy out around the corner that hey man\nRight right and it's about ... one of the show they're I guess some crack it runs ... mortar rounds door [noise] [noise]\nOkay so this is running from the garage door to the utility door yeah OK in is this crackdown just along a mortar line or is it correct through the brick and\nAt an angle to or what just a borderline\nJust them orderly and how big is that correct 'cause they're mortar that's actually ...\n[noise] I had a guy come over to the rich should do more [noise] more back right back after about two years story in [noise] [noise] [noise]\nMhm well a you know ... his intentions were correct\nUm I don't know about the execution of it so you know ... when a mortar out a is a you know that's what you're going to have to do 'em that crack is fairly sizable fits quarter in ... there are certainly talking you can put in there Steve\nA but ideally he did it the right way chilling out that mortar grinding net mortar out and then putting mortar back in now having said that there's a couple things that uh would fail if it wasn't done properly first of all this year has been extremely hot\nAnd then he did it on a really hot day and he didn't really hydrate that joint\nAny put in mortar or the moisture would wick from the patching mortar\nOut of the patch and it wouldn't nearly be as strong as it should be in it would cause it to fail that's number one number two you also need to put some sort of a\nConcrete uh masonry and he served in with that mortar patch a mortar doesn't stick welder mortar concrete doesn't stick while the country so that I'm a that additive to it will help it bond\nUm there is a product called zip it mortar which is a patching material that already has the adhesives in it a huge ... without you hydrate the joint if it's really hot in you do exactly what your buddy did I'm\nNow having said that so those are are things that can go wrong and execution\nThe other thing is is maybe there's some movement there on that one pillar where that brick is it's weird that it would crack in that same joint usually if it's a settling problem the crack is diagonal it would go through the brick and mortar\nIt wouldn't run the mortar straight line it would stair step they go a little bit then go up the uh the vertical joint and then we'd go to the horizontal jury and vertical and horizontal\nGoing at it it it's going\nAnd so there's probably a little bit of stress on there and maybe the patch wasn't done as well as it should of you know I hate that [laughter] I hate to fault him I but but I don't know what else could be\nUm [noise] I don't think it's any shuttling rich that is [noise]\nYeah I don't think it's settling either if it's a straight line there might be some stress on it but I don't think it's settling because it would definitely stair step if if it was settling\nOkay so what was that or it's called zip it zip it and mortar comes in all three pound it looks like freezer beggars\nRight it's all the products all all in their rate just add water and you need the bag and you're ready to go\nOkay alright different right All right good enough thanks take

president CEO cofounder and third generation of granted expert she's with granite gold and Lenny welcome that home with Gary Sylvan\nHey Gary how are you doing I'm doing great I'm doing great before we get into protecting granted I just had a caller and he was talking about some grand a gold products and he had a question I couldn't answer ... since you're the man them when they asked you\nPerfect Iraq All right if he bought a house just kinda moved in and were there apparently there's labs are granted that he has a theme and this theme\nIs a kind of like a v it's wider tub then goes down to nothing but it's deep you get a finger nail in it how do you see all that or does it have to actually be repaired but granted dust\nWell with the with the seems you know that's done by the fabrication station company and okay and some are some are better than others and if it was filled all the way and sometimes when you do put the puck seeing their it'll settle a little bit\nUm [noise] the best way to fill it is within a pop the resident but I definitely suggests using either to fabricate or Henri told and restoration guy to come out and fill it\nUm do you like a clear up a coffee rather than to to fill it so it's not like fingernails ... with this should be flushed with the stone\nSure so there's no granted dust being uses just in a box e clear ... put in there\n[noise] yeah we you know my family\nYou know we have a fabric each company right around forty forty years so we've been dealing with a lot and we actually we first do that she met install we actually\nUse a pigments to match the color of stone ha ha ha we we we use it a poppy resident too for that seat okay and sometimes when you just need to feel like\nA pet or you know create crime itself you can you see the clear rather than for it\nAnd I told them I thought it'd be going to be require an expert but one of the things you said you got to find a good one now do you do that [laughter]\nI Know it it it is tough and uh we work with a lot of granite fabric haters and a restoration specialists stuff and we can always help event that so if you reach out to the grand nickleby can kind of help you know where you're at the ones that we work with\nVery good thanks thanks now what we wanted to do was avert disaster [laughter] yeah ... and\nYou regret it go dot com is a great I'm a resource um where you can find a lot of information and how to take your granted but ah one of the first things is do you have to take care granted what should we do to take care of granite\nEspecially\nWith granted it's a natural dust samples stone so its Mother Nature it's fight it a journal and it's harder still successful the stain on so one of the most important thing about natural stone is to seal it\nOn the other big factor there is not to use any ordinary household cleaners because it'll take a sealer off and it will do the surface and in some cases can damage the stone by at you as well\nMhm [noise] so you got some great great products just walked me through and then I wanted to get even courts countertops because those are kind of gaining popularity also on a day to day basis um you know depending you know the caller makes a lot of difference in terms of\nAt least that's what I found a way in terms of cleaning it some just show a little bit more than others\nKind of walk me through what I should do a you know daily weekly basis with my parents to counter tops\nAnd like you said every granted is different in terms of intensity across to be a symbol can stay in easier than others usually the darker colored granted are um you don't feel as often but you do deal with like\nFingerprints and water spots on those types of materials so it just cleaning often is a is where you where you start to like our daily clear\nThat through your routine cleaning and just spray and white paper towels real easy to do 'em when come to the ceiling everybody always says I'll do it once a year\nTo be on the with management type a stone you have how often you hear that you you don't have a lot of big you know like us Italians we have big dinners and\nYou're always getting always is also stuff that makes me larger\n[laughter] right so a lot of a lot of those type of thing so we definitely want to feel more often and I always suggest just doing a water test a port to three inches in diameter from the water on their let it sit that water shall we beat on the surface if it leaves flat or darken the stone\nThat you know you need a seal it um but the other thing too is you can you can never over seal your granted so if you're like I'm just going to feel because I Want to and just by stealing it it also helps the cleaning process it's much easier and then we also have the polish and the policy is you know it's still out factor it's\nIt is it's move to make the um and it resists the ... you know it helps with those water spots and fingerprints for sticking to the surface if he polish regularly\nWell what are you a grand nickel polish in my house Lenny I get points\n[laughter] and I needed to many points as I can get as right\nWell and don't forget to is the same time we're trying to be you know think about the consumer ... and so we do have the creative shined which is that you would want to get that clean and polish in one shot and a deck indefinitely speed up you're you're getting your points\nAnd he heads actually we need points Lenny we need points now ceiling it really is not a big process this is easy\nYeah feeling is a\nYou know we have a water ... that's easy for the consumers do themselves they don't have to wear any special gloves masks or anything it's a neutral ph and um\nIt's always good working sections when you seal stone because if you spray it on the entire countertop\nMe come back and try to wipe it down it's going to try it on the surface before you work at an event that happens especially with darker stone you get this like have on top of the
