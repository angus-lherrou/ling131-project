just keep getting older you know what it will never stop it'll never to exactly let's talk\nA little bit about would we had a call yesterday in fact I recommended your product it was a I think one you and I talked about many times and that was a ... column I can't remember how old the house was whether there was a new one or old one but\nShe had some of the wood that was rotted and there were suddenly cocked underneath it so it was hold water and it was a disaster\nAnd said you know what do I do can I just cannot patch it and then went yeah yeah you can can you take us through that project I mean is that something a lot of us can tackle\nYeah yeah that's about all the ... or ... columns and whether there's our callers order ... columns\n... there's a there's definitely ... here so I'm ... and we're factor chicken pox the products that are ideal for making those repairs\nUm would start to bed or the ... starts to rock\nUm air rather than having her entire column which you ... years are the products are called liquid water and the parks are\nTo patch up those bases and it's a real simple process um Eddie Hall or can can use these products I'm there to ... you then in our liquid would product\nIs a penetrating the pox you work harder and so\nWhere the word start school go bad and it gets a rotted in hockey and saw right um would you do your brush away to lose crumbling material goods that that would rock creates\nAnd then you want to saturate all that are ... are using that liquid with product and go liquid would will penetrate in a deep into the wood fibers and ultimately it solidifies and heart and all that stuff that serial hired all back together [noise]\nUm and mix a monolithic repair heartening all that would\nSo I'm so structurally it strong\nYeah absolutely absolutely the liquid would have the trust of strength training over five thousand PSI so there's a load bearing type repair products you're sitting in just a just a a ban be it's gonna be a last until you sell the house or something that's going to last\nFor generations to come in to that just a quick quick cover up a product\nAnd then you'll take your would've pox and smoothed out at a point\nThere so you want to saturate those rotted areas with that liquid water and then uh you actually acquire would've ... well that liquid would still what ... ... ... ... ... is another two part of ... but rather to be a liquor or like a party or solar ...\nAnd they use that to patch and replace the missing sections of ... so you can go in and rebuild\nOr anything that's missing and they can do barrel checks crack split in the woods or you can rebuild entire\nYou know chunks of missing material that you need to so there's really no limitation to the to the scope or payer that you can make up stuff\nLike that so yeah that was actually one of her concerns and I'm sure you hear this all the time and you know with a column she was getting ready to just dig all this out and she was in me whether there would be a good idea or with her column fall down basically\nAnd I'm going well you know if you don't want to go all out right away I mean we\nYou know and then I went and explained kind of how the liquid would works and boy that is that the ticket for the for the call because you just can't do that with any product\nOh right right yeah there's a lot of a component products on the market that uh like I said there there are ... there are there are a quick cover up type product or they're or they're meant for interior used or something like that so\nYou know when you're when you're making that type of repair you definitely want to make sure that you're using something structural unstable or something like a two part solid a proxy liquid ... type sort of ... you\nKnow you folks at every turn him good news about these products I Know because for years or for a few years that I've been talking about that I became aware of and I know you're really involved in the

I'm a little testy to write an essay on your way in a fun way ... can't keep up with me today Mike welcome\nYes this is my family I'm from Alabama and on one of three point nine AM thank you\nAnd the question I my father well I'm a care I my son okay\nAnd he's eighty six years old and I live with him and he asked trouble [laughter] I'm open to that you know clean up after yourself in any way to lean\nOn\nHe's calling me right now but I have a leaking toilet when he landed over it takes\n... around the bottom on the base so so I'm On the floor\nYeah so um what's going on there is a that toilet is not stabilized on the floor or is a little bit um worn so that that toilet that sits\nAnd just to kind of give you a one a woman and how that world is you've got a four inch pipe the sewer line that's coming up and you got a ...\nAnd you have a wax ring the wax ring then seals at the bottom of the toilet and two bowls anchor the ... down to the floor of which go through the uh little plans and secured what's happened is all the way it's been shifted under the front either\nThose boats have become loose they've broken probably just became loose\nAnd that seal is become compromised so when we're flushing that that flush of the water in the toilet bowl\nIs since the toilet is not sealed to the a pipe properly you're getting a little spill out on the sides so what\nYou need to do is you need to shut off the water you need to you're going to take that floor off the flinch I'm In the ... again you can't get a puppy nice scrape off that wax ring and then I Want you to get what they call a perfect seal it's a little bit easier to make disrepair with this Mike\nIn a perfect sealed in ... on the ... much more durable than the wax ring even though there is a ... case in rubber I'm In you'll tighten it up real good your ... on the floor of the toilet to the floor and I think you're going to eliminate your\nProblem All right my friend thank you much for the call I appreciate good luck with that in Charles welcome\nGary with us or a or a problem All right I had some holes in my garage was then I got those patch just fine [noise]\nThe problem is there's a ... on the war ... looked strike it down with a ... like a quote unquote a plaster tight that's kinda runny and rock\nOkay and I'm Wondering how can I replicated back [laughter]\nMillion dollar question Charles I'm so there's all different kinds of techniques for that all different people have different techniques and even if you try to duplicate the same technique it's difficult\nOld 'cause we all have our own kind of artistic touch do it so some people do um uh they'll use brush around brushed they'll the opposite for texture others\nWill have a half moon or half around type trial limos [laughter] or ... or ... what do you mean by dripped\nUh it it kind of done like in a vertical fashion and it looks like we're just gonna be when they put it on the wall\nOkay well that's probably your tip 'em that's probably what they've done they probably took topping ... I Can't really visualize what the design would look like ... I mean I'm so um my guess is they would take topping compound and a drill was the big mix or on the end of it\nAnd they would\n... the ... of that topping compound and then probably take a like a wall paper and brush a in literally do what you just said kind of drifted or whatever\nThinking yeah yeah I think in there's real low answer to it Charles I tell people to try to imagine how that person put that on get a big piece of cardboard and try to replicate it you come close you probably won't be perfect but you'll come close but it sounds like if you're talking about\nBut you know a dripping or a a rain type of finish on there I Would use you know the topping compound diluted\nA you know just maybe just a little bit sicker than paint and just kinda all use the word slap it on with a wide uh wallpaper and brush\nThat what you're saying chopping compound would that be like using a ... a pre mixing it yeah\nYeah yeah just use a regular um yeah pre mixed a I called top in Columbia South it just makes more water and to get more Ramy\n... show okay that sounds like the shows you All right good luck thank you take care Bye bye [noise] all\nRight well we're fixing up all kinds of things if you'd like to join us loved the heavy it's eight hundred eight two three eight to five five earlier in the show today somebody called and said man I loved that middle seat furniture polish one of my favorite products to it cleans aimed restores\nWoodwork wood furniture and perfect for kitchen cabinets it removes the grind the dirt scratches the old wax from the woods and then restore says by the way it's also great for removing\nThe heat brings in water rings that we get on the kitchen table it's middle sick\nAnd it's ... am I.

only probably six different sizes\nOf blind if it's snow again you just can't quite get it down you only got to go down to the next you know the next size will will get the job done for you\nWell the one that I've had the most trouble with is um screening closure and it's a it's a flat and it has a\n... once you go into the group ... there's a slight recession the intellect side mhm it's like a ...\nI'm familiar with the flats blowing too and in fact I just got done some uh this summer I have a big screened in porch and those panels all have the flats blind and um I trying to think how I chose this point I think I hit some at the house\nI'm In the one I head of the first one was\nTo be the other side's fit in just fine I put it in with a roller and I don't know if if if I if I didn't measure so I don't know I had one at home that was too big and I use the next phase damage it worked fine but I I get the challenge\nUh but I think if you can measure that actual opening a you address the the issue but I I get it on that flight buying that can be a challenge [laughter]\nAll right thanks much down a couple of tips too if you're going to work on that um you know doing the show for thirty one years you kind of forget some of the tips you passed along in a screening tip this time of year is a great screening tip here's the deal I'm you know the time changes next week right and so it's gonna be\nDarker in the evening and we're going to get in a lot of parts of the country more the dreary time of year\nYou would be amazed at how much light is blocked by screens in your windows got fools screens in your windows I'll bet you it's going to block a third of the light that's coming in your house may be more\nAnd if you get a good full day papa new screens out you know if you think we're pretty much finished with opening up the windows pop that screen out take a look at the screen screen that the fiberglass screen it lifespan of that's ten to twelve years\nAnd they kind of gets thread bear and now the fall is a great time to go ahead and do your re screening get it done on the big flat surface reach screen the screens allow more light in the wintertime and then you'll be ready\nTo go in the springtime when they go back in ... and didn't know which one goes into\nA witch a window\nStart with the one the window closest to the kitchen sink and that's number one you just take a little sharply input number one right at the top of the frame and then go clockwise around your house\nNumber but replacing\nThat a a screen now is a great time of year to do just that and this blind that you're pushing that rubber I used a membrane into the group the whole\nScreen intact there's\n... tools looks like a big pizza cutter but then there's this line get this ... mind mice no we've got that wrong ... line mouse and it I'm\nJust check it out the hardware store as from what they look at you like you're crazy doesn't look like a pizza cutter ads of about a half circle flat and the blind rolls over to rollers and it's much easier process of pushing that's blind into the groove so good time of year to tackle that particular project\nEight hundred eighty two three eight to

of liquid soap and set that up there'll be attracted to that oh okay and um that are all attracted to that and they'll meet their demise and that'll help but they like everything else are looking for food\nAnd that's where they're going to get trapped in your little trap that you're creating but what they're living on the sends a little gross or they're living on the bacteria in the scum that's in the drains alright so\nI I say often everything we use anymore is Jill we got ... ... ... ... everything's jailed for and that sticky so like me I use a gel a shaving cream I'm shaving in Washington dumped going down the drain but that\nGel even though it goes down the drain it starts slowly a coating the top of that trap or the top of the pipe inside portion of the pipe and that a gel combine with\nFlaky skin some risk yours is the bacteria in these little guys start finding it and they start feeding on that and so there is a product\nUm that is the silliest it's actually a like a culture bacteria that creates enzymes that eats that bacteria [laughter]\nOkay so we're live lead to a point were cleaning the inside of our pipes\nOkayed that particular product it's also used to a ... claw blockages and things like the current pipe but he uses a maintenance product gets called drain right at her four ounces of water I think it's a forget whether it's a chord of water but\nWhat I'll do
