wiring is already there you know additional wires yeah it was all everything else has wireless so it's basically it's a ten or Fifteen minutes a project and you turn off the break or by the way so\nGood point very good very good so you turn out to brag are literally I made sure we put one up and it was it was no more than ten minutes and I'm you know you have a nice little diagrams you know for the screws need to come out and you just sliding in\nBlack wearing a black why or why are why our ground to ground screwed\nYour business him absolutely and he downloaded the Q and a half which is a very powerful user friendly half download that and you connect your light using the app to your local route or in the house and that and then after that basically your light than is connected to the cloud and you're ready to go it's a very easy process okay so\nSeriously it is that easy and say I mean it really really is that easy and you got a flood\nLight so via the old flood light you can just simply ...\nIf you get a foot light over your patio or your your garage or your driveway or corner of your house you basically just remove the flight and then you installed a new and we have what's called a quick connect plate\nWhich is a a plate that you mount a first allows you to wire that played up you're not actually holding the light and you're right it's just a just a disk that you actually wire up\nAnd went that once that's mounted you take up\nThe light and you just snap it in the place and you're good to go\nSouth really ... like the maximus foot light is easier to mount than a flood like you buy the big ...\nReally is because of the quote cannot play am absolutely who really really is\nAll right now the fun part okay you said you download the app so this camera in light functions on the app on your phone\nRight so you know there's a very user friendly app that you can see all of your cameras on your lights are on your your smartphone with your apple user Android doesn't matter um you know the first thing that happens is even when you're not looking at your phone if someone comes to your door you get a notification at someone's at your door\nSo I'm at work do you get alert I'm In the ... in fact last night we were having dinner the one fellow that was with us 'cause well somebody's at my door and it was very cool and so it notify makes the sound or ...\nWhatever the notification you have it vibrates or the noise would however you set it up in your phone and then you can actually click on it and if you click on it then it actually takes you right to that camera alive and you're seeing the person real time and you can actually talk to them real time that you can talk to them have a conversation\nIf you'd like or you can you can press you can dial nine one one you can actually pressing alarm if there are a burglar alarm that can be ...\nSo if you don't know who this person is and they're not dropping off a package or maybe they're taking a package [laughter] um\nYou can take action absolutely yeah on the spot and and no matter what if you if you answer the door or not or if you go to the live feed the the video will be recorded and sent to the cloud for per download and viewing later so\nSo if mom and dad say no kids in the house while we're gone [laughter] you can see if there's kids coming out and see a lot ... usually not every child likes our products to leave or lots of stories last couple of years\nJust sell them this coach light with camera or are these prevalent or do you are the only ones that have like ... are usually cameras free standing or\nYeah so there's a there'd be an issue again and as a consumer I think you know you have to decide you search the mark and see what works for you the best but in terms of the porch light a application you know we're really the only ones that carry on a porch lights solution\nAnd we offer that the poor side does come and different um different styles indifferent finishes 'cause we try and accommodate you know the the lights in the design of your house I'm so we don't really have any competitors in that space there there's some knock offs that are trying to mimic what we're doing but really there you know as it relates to porch lights we've you know really know competitors\nThe flight there is another option or two out there um but again I I think we've got the best solution if you compare the the products are in the market with ours I I I Believe\nIn our customers tell us as all the time they replaced their existing product with ours and how much happier they are what the product [noise] what would be the difference is that the quality of the camera\nAnd the quality of the cameras detection range I mean our detection range is Seventy feet um detection on the camera it's a hundred and two hundred Seventy degrees around the camera to detection range definitely I'm I'm you know one of the differences the quality of the camera\nYou know we use you know not to get to technical but\nBecause of our application and our software and the from where the products we actually use less resources so um we're not as resource um heavy so our products for work a lot of times when social services week\nOr the wife I signals not as strong as as you know others products requires so um you know just generally speaking we have a very good customer satisfaction\nThe app is definitely a difference if you compare our app with other animals so I'm really yeah I mean we do some nails are so that means is when you're looking at your videos you know you don't have to actually play a video to see what's on the video we show you the thumb nails for all the videos\nAnd you can sort by camera and sorted by by day and time I'm it's just it's again there's so many features in our app that customers really like and we we hear that you know quite often [noise]\nNow on the coach light with the camera that camera is I mean you talk about the angle and you talk about the distance but its position of bull\nToo yeah so it's a it's in a ball basically um both the the flood lights and the coach later the other a porch lights\nWe put the camera in a in a in a ball that can be when you first installed a product\nYou want to aim that cameras you get the optimal a field of view so you want to cover your porch or or cover your driveway you basically look at your apple you're aiming that camera and then you have a lock and rainy and lock that camera and the place in the ... men and typically it just stays there then\nWhen you're watching a when you're watching the um the either the life feet are you watching the video later you can ... you can actually ... so\nYou're able to go in pretty close to a to whatever you're looking at through the camera you can get pretty close it fusing them in with the pension is great\nGreat so I'm Daniel let's open up the phone lines if someone has a question about the maximus lighting or whether they have

operates LED lights with cameras coach lights with the cameras to play back mark when we went to a break you said something about adding ten seconds\nBefore before what before you see the right so what happens is the the cameras are always recording in memory or in buffer so when we're when we do have motion a sense and we ... and the video clip up to the cloud we put that ten seconds onto the front of the video so nothing's missed\nSo if a if a driver or FedEx or UPS drivers dropping off a package you actually when you watch the video you actually watch the driver walk up to your house and

eight hundred eight two three eight to five five in Diane welcome\nMhm how can we help me yes\nWell I just had a question for the cattle and talking about the ... with a camera uh-huh now what happens if somebody perfectly comes out there in damages or cover that is that possible for them to cover it so they can't do anything\nWell sure I mean if they if they cover the camera that I mean obviously it's going to block the sure the um the viewing of the camera the you know the good news about the cameras are very and conspicuous I mean you don't even really realize there's a camera on the light\nI guess that's also another good thing for that ten second buffer though right yeah you because you've got to walk up you've got to get the camera they've already got John camera and on video so\nYeah there is also one other small feature we actually have a status light it's a little um indicator light\nThat used to tell you you know different colors blue it means it's on line but if you really want to be you know incognito you can actually turn that laid off in the app so that little blue light is not on and the person does not see that when they woke up to your door so\nBut very good question to die and you're thinking\nThere's not alarm that goes off on your phone it how many were actually not a light off the wall fate so to speak\nNo you would just get your normal notification greeting someone's at your door and of course once that happens I mean there is a panic button on your app that does sound the alarm so some some someone does damage to the delight or covers it up you can push the panic button the light flashes and the alarm goes off on the light itself\nI think you're right not All right Diane thank you so it is smart in order to bring what you already said hundred eight to three\nTo five five we're talking about smart security lights by maximus lighting fascinating Randy welcome\nI uh I have a question we choose to run around America will trigger a tree or ...\n... yes I mean the um you know if you have the porch lights is the on your front door um I mean it's designed to pick up motion within say ten Fifteen feet your porch area\nBut you can set in the app you can set the zones that you actually want to be active or hot that would actually trigger the the motion sensor\nI'm so yes you will pick it up you and you can do to there's another feature that I didn't mention earlier I mentioned it now is that um if you see the dogs that are in your yard\nKnow used to look out your window you can see them um you can go into the app anytime even whether the the motions been triggered or not and you can do just uh you can hit the record button live she can do record on demand\nSo if you're something going on in your yard it's in the field of view of the camera no matter what it is um if you want to start recording you just hit the record button and historic recording that activity\nOr any I\nI just curious 'cause we had racial like our law turned off every ten minutes though they're turning around the house\nAnd go wandering if they are the way that the jets offense on it\nThey're absolutely there's two things one is you can you can control this zones are literally would just show you a grid of the field of view of the camera and you can actually you can highlight the areas in that grid that you want to be a sensitive for to to the actual activate the motion and the camera\nAnd beyond that you can actually turn to the bar you can slide the sensitivity up or down so you I call it tuning so once you installed a product you can kinda tune you know which alert you want to get the ones that matter and again we've built all that features into the product in the app very cool and then\nSee that's man you gotta think everything don't you I'm fascinated by by the questions again it's eight hundred eight to three to five five she'll a welcome\n[noise] hello yes\nI was wondering like how do you have an a generator that are run by a car or any solar panels or any how roof tiles or anything like that\nWell they're selling the security lightning but that's something you could add to your home but these things are are they go ahead I'll be quiet [laughter] okay so let me well I\nDon't I mean I don't think of the chair\nOkay well ... actually today marks\nReady to go with your ... question he he may I think he's got an answer\nYeah so one one feature we do have um that's important is that we ... we do send the alert to your smartphone when your cameras on line or off line\nSo if the power goes out on your home no matter where you are there'll be a mess he just sent to your phone that says that the the cameras off line so at least you know that it's off line for some reason which is usually it's easier either their wife buys out\nOkay or the power's out we don't offer um any type of supplemental power at this time we get that question it's something that we're learning that I'm interested but we don't we just pointed does need power to to operate\nInterests you yeah all kinds of issues there [laughter] that's wonderful though [laughter] All right um I just had a thought and just the just ran out of my brain so we'll go to Tom\nYou can pick out a podcast angel again we we got that on our website scary solve it online dot com but one of the questions I have for you is we we hit somebody actually concerned about that also is and again did they have any video of this happening at all\nNow yeah\nBut I'm the max and on this particular product is ... ... this maximus lighting that wouldn't be a problem though\nRight we're gonna we're gonna one of the videos is to send him to the cloud we actually I'm at ten seconds before the motion sensor goes off we we bolted onto the front of the video\nSo you would get the person coming up to the door and see them in the video before the damage whites keep in mind though are cameras integrated into the light fixture is not a like a lot of other products are separate cameras you can easily spot right this is actually it is to a ball that's on the bottom of the light fixture that\nMost of the time you don't even know what to their yeah it looks like a ... coach would know that the camera's there unless you're really looking forward so that if you did you have that extra ten seconds which is awesome ... were catch him don't worry we're going to catch him yeah\nI second follow up on that answer possibility that vehicle like going online they won't share possibly go on building a vehicle or you can\nI can ... we we watched a little bit the first stole a car and insurance to keep them tying ... mile vehicle to\nWell I mean we can we are re integrated though with a with Google Home an election which is now in your vehicle so I suppose that bridge could could be done yeah I bet your first time I've heard that question\nIt's a good one that's a great college that one day [laughter] yeah sure [laughter] yeah but then the Google it certainly could be ... up their litter sure\nI'm In a good thing to have it love at great\nThank you very good thanks angel appreciated and again these are available at Costco it's available at home depot got smart listeners I'm telling you what\nRight there and they were actually the promises and other stores to I Know there's not not every store willows but ... I Believe in five or six hundred stores okay I'll take care of the product to so okay can they order online course yet if you Google the maximus smart security ladder maximus came up a light\nYou'll find all the different ... platforms that you can buy the product okay I think I Know the answer to this one Andy welcome\nHey my question was you touched on the lights earlier but [noise] our our in the camera I got a ... actually just hit the light switch as they're walking out the door [noise] am I going to lose the functionality of the camera\nYeah so you know a lot of the uh your porch lights are on a switch we recommend that you actually a wire around that said that the camera cannot be turned off I mean you get an education that the ... the cameras off line\nBut um we recommend that you actually eliminate the switch so that the powers never uh never turned off and then just programming is on your app\nTo do whatever you want to do and you can turn the alerts off too so let's say you're back door and you go in and out of your backdoor all day you can actually go into the app and turn the alerts off you know during the day if you don't want to get those you know while you're home sure\nBut we recommend the optimal way to use the product is just not have the power be able to turned off All right All right\nVery good thank you up by the way we got one line open we got just a few more minutes with mark if you want to grab it real quick it's eight hundred eight two three eight to five five eight ... two three eight to five five\nUh where's is going\nI mean I'm sitting

response to the death of journalist ... ... says the Washington Post columnist died inside its consulate in Istanbul, Turkey during a fistfight Senate Republican Rand Paul of Kentucky coal Saudi Arabia's reasoning insulting to any one with intelligence\nAgo holy taught about a hundred and twenty five ... seven hundred and fifty that started analyzing everything from the pope to the bases and so forth I'm In the in the south in South Carolina or it was All right uh shutting\nOver several things um [noise] the house was capsule aided\nAnd they put to a good size humidifiers underneath that it was about to London for a thousand square\nFeet on that for uh-huh and when I was analyzing shutting everything down isolated that they made a fires or they were using the equivalent\nOf a hundred and thirty three dollars a month well\nAnd my question we could go further into it if if you please but my real question is simple and easy is do you have to run the suckers twenty four seven because I'm a if you don't you know I can cut it a hundred\nProbably why they are and then um\nMy poop I can come to\nYour right right well that's a great question a demon of fires are very expensive to operate a lot of people don't realize that even a little tiny portable ones yeah was misled\nI was ... when the pest control company when it was done that it would have your house so playing you know ... than it is you know\nIt died in Ninety five degrees outside you can set up I don't eat there and enjoy yourself\nYou know but um I was\nTold that the money saved from that insulating factor would be more than it would cost to run the date humidifiers and it's actually had virtually no effect that I can notice on any of the heating or cooling\nYeah I'm so one is running twenty four hours a day what is the humidity level inside your home\nThe humidity level and shot to my home ah has traditionally and continued to be a little high ...\nOr even in areas like from one side to the other you know how they said today humidifiers ah is the extremity on the kitchen side I'm\nA little higher extra extremity on the master bedroom sat on the opposite as a little higher\nDo you have any idea what the percentage is the the percentages I mean is it below fifty as it above fifty or\nIt's below fifty but I'm a I've had some pushing and went to this because even though I'm a figures guy the humidity humidity is not one of my\nThings but uh I think I've heard figures in the thirties or around forty you know\nWell in all honesty were really where you want to be as in the winter time if you can kick it around thirty five forty that's fine but I think it's a stretch if you can keep it below fifty in the summer I think you're doing great\nOkay well my concern is underneath the house and there was a mode and every time we had to have a treat it rang\nWheel and it was probably run in Seventy percent then\nAnd and so once it was traded the um the humidity has been unbelievably low underneath a house\nOr what they do they put the plastic on the ground and help yeah yeah they totally ... so you have lemonade at all that water vapor\nWhile you're talking like a Fifteen thousand dollar deal right right and I know exactly how much ... joined I really Eighteen negotiate if you work on it\nRight but your question is do I need to use those humid fires all the time basically how\nCould I possibly maybe once a month a run for about three days\n[noise] uh I Can't answer that because I don't know how much in flux of humidity is you've changed the environment by using vapor barriers and different things like this I tell you what I Would do\nJust totally locked and you know yeah I mean I Am free all your van shipping closed off and everything right\nSo what I Would do is I Would go in I Would buy a little like weather station it's about the size of a book\nYou can put that up in your bedroom or your hallway or wherever you want and then the sensor\nYou just place that down into the crawl space area it's going to give you the temperature and it's going to give you the humidity and you're gonna watch it\nAnd you know maybe there is times you can turn that off if it's really really hot really humid I'd just be real curious to know and I don't think you have to answer yet what that humidity level is is there a you miss that on the humidifier\nI think underneath a house in the home to this but I think I heard figures like Eighteen or something like that you know Eighteen what on the humidity or reading or whatever\nOh it's way too low yeah you don't ever needed that low\nYeah well I was told by another pass guy that it might or pure hardwood floors you know if if you if it's too much\nAgain I think you wanted a fifty percent in the summertime below forty percent in the wintertime I Will get a sense are down there and a weather station so I could just manually monitor monitor it\nBy one of those from lows sure sure\nAnd then you can see what's going on and if you got it off for three days and all of a sudden that humidity level starts creeping up to fifty five sixty percent you turn it on you drive down to maybe I don't know forty five percent questionnaire\nUnless I'm abusing your time or\nThe pope hop it's a it's a um one and a half horse\nAnd that's eight and me and about a hundred and thirty dollars a month right and I was told by ... or ... that what's the temperature of the water hit sixty five and below chemicals added or a moot point because it doesn't react to the\nPhones that may be I I don't know that okay like that that that makes sense since\nIt's logical for me that that that does make sense so at that point why have the filter or why the bumped going\nJim we got to go but monitor that humidity no there's no sense in running the humidifier if you don't need it now however you got to remember when you got 'em going full blast where are you right around fifty percent so you turn them off I\nGot to think it's probably going to go up a little bit but the cooler it is outside and you got a big cold front come through Florence when it gets cooler it's usually less humid and maybe it's something that you can deactivate I'm at that point then monitor where your humanity level is\nAll right thanks so much for the call I appreciate your welcome to join us our phone number's eight hundred eighty two three

long history\n[noise] yes scary most likely to develop back in Nineteen fourteen by Hungarian immigrant mhm Zoltan ... he was a master cabinet maker owners know products of his farm creations and that's when most furniture caution cleaner was developed\nAnd really that's what makes you know sex so unique is that it's a cleaner and polish it'll take that grief in grandmother's kitchen cabinets and restore the would do its natural luster like you said especially on the handle your gang you get the grease on your hand you're opening cabinet doors you get that build up in most ethical clean

house\nAnd they were carrying out the shelling and on the whole big huge beer out of the feeling\n[laughter] and it was just stuffed in there\nThey way I was sitting out there and they happen in a a ... and ... and they had a chilling\nYeah scare the heck out of them my bet huh\nI sure did I thought I tell you that [laughter]\nYeah ... that's some you're not really expecting probably insulation though huh I don't know I was there but [laughter] she had told me that there you go I Do is an interesting story to tell you very good thank you much okay Bye bye\nAppreciate it by by you know there's a lot of stories and then we'll get back to some insulation questions again eight hundred eight two three and a question on Facebook for you you got a question of Facebook Daniel has a question on Facebook not me but uh\nThe listener Louis there was the question\nExcuse me I had to take a drink of water there well you know stage Fred will get you every time\nA yes as my garage has to drains one on each side in both cases the water drains also cars in every direction but to the drains or anything and he can do it\nSo the floor is not slope properly that's interesting\nIs there anything else you can do now I don't know you got to get the slope the water's got to get to the dream\nSo I guess one of the things you could do is you could put a thin layer of\nConcrete or a concrete resurfacing product around the rest of the garage floor to elevated so that in fact it does slope towards the grain but that'd be a challenge you're either going to add or you're going to remove so also grinding some of the floor could create some slope\nAnd get the water to the drain\nIt also might be better Daniel really just to put up hurting brain around that area and you can use that during\nWell that's interesting I used to you know ... they're not always Trump properly I had before I'd put nature stone on my garage floor\nI always said this giant puddle and it was just you know ... very much for drained in fact at one time I was going to install drain there just move the water out but my wife who's right next to her car\nAnd I'm so or temp she a car was wintertime and she had drug some snow into their garages puddle form she's stepping in it but when we had the nature stone installed we actually leveled out the floor\nAnd then put the nature stood on top of that was from Robert fissure by the way very good thank you Robert All right ah let's get Peter on in the Peter welcome\nOh thank you very much for taking my call you up here in Massachusetts where when closed enclosed porch with\nA and we decided to close them create an office and will be ... to get right now just all framed in seal but it's a concrete or should we caught panning on topic right on the concrete or should we at a sub or a little bit of insulation and make more warmer\nWell you you could do that that would be probably um your best bet to get it off the concrete of there's a product called dry core\nAnd a dry core Peter is\nUm maybe sixteen inch squares of wood that hip polypropylene feet that may be extended a three eighths of an inch and their tongues in groups so you can literally\nSo this whole floor together and it's elevated right and that's good too because um that concrete could get cold and then if it's heated you could get sweating and so given that whole thing off the floor is a real good idea\nThat's sort of thing that the the the concrete slab is slightly golden retriever to bring the water away from the direct so I saw a contract was going to sort of a cut out to buy or whatever is working so it kinda evens out a little bit so okay we want to cook or somewhere other than the right to erect\nYou're headed right direction there's also a product so that was called dry core there's also a a panning for carpet\nUm in fact I got it for limits and they got it for carpet to different products it's called DNA mix and even though he mixes a insulating pad that his\n... like ... on it or little feed on it and so again it's elevated so if there's any moisture sweating you know it it can evaporate out the sides\nOkay BMX so that it might be that or during this up\nAll right good thank you Bye bye yeah those are two good product threat situation no question about it or a judge Judy welcome you're at home with Gary Sullivan Gary hello\nI'm near we're talking about ... insulating the crowds faith and I've got a different kind of question for you [laughter]\nI had a couple of guys and there might have to have two years ago in neighboring replacing outside ... for me this way and the one guy he said he was really impressed with what the cross [laughter]\nBut I didn't go under I could see everything that I'm going to have because there is a light bulb down there and it it it insulated I could see an area where I'm Talking about underneath the you know the joy the floor and the paper facing is on the outside\nBut it's all covered over with\nTar paper ... ... ... is that grade up all\nWell no I don't think it would be um how sick is that insulation Millwood it's not over three inches thick as\nI couldn't tell I like now without carrying the tar paper\nThat cross face it a giant they can be okay\nThere is more than a foot if they were putting a basement under house ran into Iraq there's more than a foot crash rock on the floor plastic wall had been painted feel with some things and three sites and they have the ground soaps away from it\nAnyway so it sounds like you've got a really good situation but you're just a little concerned about the wallpaper or tar paper right right it is feeding and here's what I Would say about this you ever hear the phrase don't fix it if it's not broken absolutely happily than it
