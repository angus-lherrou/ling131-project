I'm what I'm Wondering is this a it'll be up\nTo have the guy that does the Dallas I'm a I'm Sorry does the gutters I Am at a run down to the ground for me I Know I have to put a forum quite grown and I can run it around the the show's over to the existing\nSystem underground but my question is is\nHow do I need to go uh when I dig around the side of the house the court that pipe in the ground\nOr you want to get you know probably where you're at you don't have to go below the ... probably Eighteen to twenty interest\n[noise] yeah it will be up against the foundational so\nI'd say kind of twenty inches and you want to have slow to make sure that water doesn't stand in that pipe right so you want to have gotten so\nYup yup Yup I I I saw that you can't stop it I don't feel as though\nYou know shorter faster I think I might be able to do this but uh yeah that's a great help that's what I call the ... but so I'm certainly important I Want to go far enough for ... straight up and\nYeah and and again with that slope you're not going to have a problem if you're twenty inches the\nGet a good gravel base on there and uh and you're good to go [noise]\nVery good thank you much for the call appreciate it [noise] All right um well let me tell you about a [noise]\nWhat's going to go on in the next hour I think you'll find it interesting [noise] we're going to have our friends in from ... pumps and we're going to talk about uh what kind of backup pumps you want on your home you want to water for you wanted to battery operated [noise] so that's going to be\nWhat we're going to chat about and I know there's always some controversy about that so I like the battery 'cause it's just I like the water because it does it will get a straight from our friends from lower that's all up next [noise]\nAt the bottom of the next hour I should say will continue if you're on the whole sit tight we'll get your questions answered you're at home [noise] with theory so [noise]\nHelp for your

station\n\n[noise] stances\nOn Fox News ... developing story out of Pittsburgh this morning reports of an active shooter near the tree of light synagogue in that city squirrel hill neighborhood\n[noise] well that was my question right [laughter] I thought about putting up a foil face Styrofoam mhm [noise] and I wonder should I put current stripped to have an air barrier editors applied directly to the wall\nI Would prefer you just to put I Would prefer you just to put insulation that would be open cell when you're below grade and let's work on controlling the humidity level but let's create a buffer\nUm for the temperature differential yeah that was my so kind of what I'm saying we're yeah if you if you've got a can of Pepsi on a hot day we're going to put a hug you all that okay right but if you if you start\nGetting a little too creative and we we did for years we used to um I remember building\nAnd we will put insulation with a paper face on there and rapid plastic then what would happen is the insulation it'd be wet because the water vapor becoming through the walls\nAnd that's where a lot of the water vapor come through the concrete walls right and it was hit that water vapor or that ... there would be no we're forced to go so the compensation would be created behind a wall and then we had all kinds of problems too\nThat fern script would leave an air space ship it would for more stricter ... would\nBut you could still have enough where maybe that air could get in there and still creek condensation because it wouldn't be Snuggie against that wall act out of that too\nYeah so you know I mean if it were me what I Would do is I Would see where my humidity is I Would really work hard I'm controlling that my guess is that humidifier probably isn't too isn't big enough\nYou're still running really high humidity counting there are some phone panels that are open cellphone panels or get some really construction and he's in a blue those things right on the wall I'd put a hugging on those walls or work on controlling my humidity level in the basement\nOkay I can see that there you go thank you very much All right\nTake care in Mumbai alright twelve minutes after the top that they are taking your calls regarding little home improvement and Greg welcome\nGarry Yes sir I just want to give you give a little plug here forever or are they came out to my uh my out there this week and we stole the multi step system okay\nAnd they did I just want to get they get they did a bang up job and get it done in five days\nWhile it's nice not worry and in it\nAnd it's a lifetime warning\nThoroughly well Greg you bring up a good point we're talking to people from all over the country and they they may not having ever drying their\nArea but what Greg said is a mouthful and now the multi step system\nMany times Greg we get calls on this show and they want to know if they should address the outside they should dress in such address the Walsh addressed the floor yeah and they're really the only way you're actually ever going to totally eliminate the problem is address it all\nThose outside and then\nAnd then that's why they can offer a lifetime warranty and there's many companies you know in other parts of the country that kind of go by that same philosophy hits a project you do not want a piecemeal\nYeah well you don't want them to come back and read it have to redo your any water problems that come back\nRight and if you just do one part of it quite honestly the other parts could get worse I always say to people okay if you do that where the water go where's the problem going to be in the ... so we stopped it here and it's like putting your finger in a dyke\nThat's right [laughter] this charge out from your from your point yeah you're courting drain\nSure sure well I'm Glad you had a great experience Greg thank you very much for the call appreciate Gary thanks very\nAll right take care of excellent then that that is a ... you know it's nice that he called um but it's also nice to be able to kind of point out the fact of why it works because they know many people\nYou know he does suffer ... leaky basement and that's a challenge but you know it starts outside or you know you you got a check to make sure leaves rally gunner you gotta check make sure the greetings right you gotta\nMake sure that the down Spencer taken all that water away kind of work on all of those things I get that those things you can control but if you worked on all that\nAnd you still have that problem ... got a problem and it's just not that crack in the wall you can ...\n... where is that pressure so anyway that's nice Greg thank you much a day walk them\nHey I heard the lady call in about the uh the fracturing block windows\nLittle tiny chips ... glass popping\nThe I've seen that before All right and I know what it is and and in that case to be a big route will look fine except for one small hairline crack at the bottom okay All right so what's happening I'm at least in the case that I saw those may be true that that person's house\nUm if we're here in Ohio or Kentucky Andy I got the soil they he's All right all summer summer\nJust that ... creating stress\nRight so if there's any if there's any have especially if that say uh if if that window is close\nTo ground level or even if it's not even if it's a walkout basement for example if there's if there's any step fracturing blocks on Asian or only vertical fracturing in a port foundation near that when\nThere's got to be rotational stress on the glass right and we'll start shipping from the outside but you'll start seeing ships in the middle especially if the silicone or it he said that they use to join the blocks together\nThese weren't around out well as crowded so is ... ... ... even between the block yeah that's what she said\nOkay so in that case you have no flexibility what so throwing rocks or you can see that this fractures coming to the games\nBecause all that stress is getting a transfer through their right and you'll see pops coming out of the mental because when you when you crack the edge you're also creating a sub surface fracture in the surface of the center of the glass okay\nYou know it'll eventually fall out you know you're you're right on target David in fact one of the things that kept and I said I I personally have never had that experience I said called glass block company they probably have and that experience and uh that solution okay I\n... is there was this to fall for you you don't crowd each block um the the the more flexible last walk when it was actually have a silicone it's almost like a car but surely not into he says\nThat run also functions as a call between the blocks today so it has a little bit of gift to it all takes the rotation and and not crack okay break or allow ships to form on the inside when do before you start seeing him on the outside and the other part of it is on that\nOne of those install as a single piece wants to spend silicon stalled as a single piece sugar center and then sell the opening a with with the expandable so a lot like\nThe great stuff ... not enough but not the triple expanding alright alright blow out the window right ...\nYeah so low experiencing but but solid phone and then you do want that crowd said trimmed back slow actually work you've got Trump back on it boom\nTo them and maybe three quarters steps and then we're out on both sides mhm so then you've got your ground and then if you do have a ground he's been that route will fracture\n[noise] okay okay and so and he won't blow out the window right so okay I I just I ... the part I missed\nWas the chip on the side of the block that creates a surface crack\nWhich causes the chipping in the center of the block that's the part I couldn't forget I knew it had to do with this you know the stress the twist and all that but the center of the block had me a had me messed up a little there Dave Dave thank you very much for your explanation very thorough and I appreciate the call will continue urine home with Gary Solis\nHome improvement hours easy is calling one eight

we go thirty three minutes after the top of their you're homeless Gary Sylvan all morning I've been\nTelling ya we gotta talk about backup pumps and I know many of you get a little bit but\nNot confused but you you're in for information on which way I should go because there's battery backups there's water driven back up\nAnd then there's also the quality issue of different back up so I have mark on the brink or in he is director of marketing with those all are punk company and the mark thanks for joining me appreciate it great to be here Gary as always it's probably been a busy year for you because it's been a wet year all across the United states\nYes it has more sure has been up across the board pretty steadily throughout the year and um [noise] you know fortunately we're we're in a every market around the U.S and we'd been able to serve our customers are where you know bumps of have run and and had been needed to be replaced\nI guess you guys kind of watch the weather a little ... where do we enjoy the weather\nI don't I you know we're going to be more than half hour to\nGo right I Am but you do just do it almost have to but the dollar\nIs a unique company I'm based in Louisville, Kentucky right yeah right\nSo we have over four hundred people in Louisville, Kentucky I'm over three hundred people in our plant there working day in day in day out I'm very proud of what they do make an a quality product um got over a hundred\nOr support personnel as well that uh provide products for customer support and everything we need to do to build a quality product in and support that product\nI'm sitting here with my little phone and that did that even has to do with some pumps though a because everything seems to be managed by our phones these days I was it a a a little gathering about four weeks ago in a beautiful home and\nBefore we got to his home he was setting the lighting he was setting the temperature was opening blind she was doing everything on his boat he had music on when we arrived and the lights were\nOn and which is really cool but with some pubs using how the world is the phone get involved there but really it's a great safety feature\nYeah so our focus on on that smart home technology in through apps and computers right now is around our battery backup system mhm um we have an ability um through why in the house\nUh through a a controller or a gateway on our system that allows 'em the user to receive\nNotifications I'm actually be able to run a prompt us that backup sure some pomp and case rains are coming I'm set up parameters I'll make sure the batteries charge make sure the powers on\nUm really for that peace of mind you know earlier in the Bahamas and you've got a rainstorm come and I'm I'm you know you you could actually test that backup palm for peace of mind to know that it's going to run it that primary palm\nBecause there is a worry about that especially if you're pumped as real active and you're in Cleveland, Ohio in Europe vacation or you're away on work it it'd be kinda settling to just see if it's functionally\nRight I think ... you know something to kind of a basic principle is on that primary stomp Tom I'm One is it's an electrical mechanical\nRight now and then there was an ours are eventually going to fail and you and you've got the whole power issue ... man I Know you were talking about and I was listening on the land talking about power and generators and things like that right right um is that uh\nUp at the power goes out the primary some pomp stopped going around everywhere battery backup can help you out\nI should know this but I don't is there any state in the unit is code\nTo have a backup [noise] uh that mandatory yet it that's a good question I I'm not sure it in an dated um there's been some things going back and forth in the industry of eventually I'd renegade Jew right right and and insurance companies and things\nYeah there's got to be a lot of push to have that done right but you folks a list there's always say we don't need the government to tell us everything well let me tell you a a backup pump is really critical especially if you have a lower level\nThat's finished yeah no no doubt I'm so just for the listeners that don't know what a battery backup or sometime system is that it works as a backup obviously to your primary some pomp which we've talked about [noise]\nUh it comes with a a a a a a a actually a a a backup stumped pomp and then I'll get back to in a minute comes with a can't can come with a battery you can acquire a battery along with it\nComes with a controller controls in charges helps charge the battery and then on what we call our active systems comes with a gateway that allows you to communicate through your phone company there and and and why is\nAll pumps aren't the same true trimming new ... where's the difference I mean everything has a way we can cut this out for price but then that becomes it's acutely see all\nRight so we're proud of um about three or four years ago we used to a a kind of resell\nOur backup some pomp and every word at which point for the marine industry well we went to the drawing board or engineering and manufacturing teams did a great job where we actually manufacture are are true battery backups ... now\nStrictly for ... strictly for ... wells I'm not for other applications and um that ... a lot of things but just kind of cut to the chase that pump will produce or performs at the same level as a primary ... well\nOkay because I Know for a fact that a lot of battery backups lot of brands pumped about half the rate of a regular primary pumped correct right okay and that ranch there in what your battery backup called notes got a nice name\nYeah so it's the model ... we're not active okay I'm that actually comes in in what we're talking about there is a comes into different versions that comes into an active or not an act of active is the ... option which we talked about\nAnd mark I know you're um some homes or rolls sold through plumbers right that's the network and\nI think you know some people may just turned in say Gary ... how can some poems
