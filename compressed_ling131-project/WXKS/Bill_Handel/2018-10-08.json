the accident that you that you had this being taken care of okay so All right now what\nSo my question the other part of my insurance is paying for this young thirty there\nHi okay well then that's your insurance yeah the other party should be responsible for anything reasonable your damages or your damages\nAnd there is a and if the damages run that you'd eat forty five days for example to repair your car they just pay for it that's what happened to me I'll get my car had to effectively be replaced and it's just a beamer three quarters of the parties had to come in from Germany\nOn a ship and so it was almost two and a half months and do you know the other side just cough it up now I had to pay for and I put it on my credit card after thirty days\nAfter I don't want to do what I mean I don't think you have a choice I don't think you have a choice as the other side is going to ... send the check out until the repairs finished\nWhat my question is like pushing white cat my inner part of the well being just like what am I ... well I mean\nBecause you're the party you know because they have because they have nothing to do with it filed lean why the other it's do they have nothing to do other insurance company that's paying you\nHad nothing to do with your insurance company not aware of what's happening is that your insurance company is fronting the money and the other side is going to pay and by the way your contract with the ... companies that will front the money up to thirty days\nRight right yeah so now there's no place you can go but the good so you have to write a check or put it on your credit card but the good news is or the other side will pay for it if it's reasonable as I got two and a half months to repair my car\nUh yeah it took that long and in a State Farm insurance which the other drivers\nInsurance companies they didn't quibble didn't quibble I mean there are adjuster when I saw what was going on understood and uh just wrote the check and let me tell you it was not cheap ah repairing\nA a beamer which is why I'm probably going to give up my beamer odd because I just I mean everything costs a fortune on that car I mean crazy\nJohn Hi

there I you have a lease correct\nYes you're right it is there anything in the least that gives the owner of the property the right to deny new owners from coming in for example they have to well\nThey have to okay you know then you're fine then this guy's crazy than if he went in and lock the door okay then I couldn't get out oh man do you have a lawsuit against these people are\nCalled

... there's no question the hundred of them any right to do that you should have gotten ... you should have gotten ... should have gotten a lawyer the minute you were locked out the minute he said no\nThat moment in the late nope I don't think so uh\nSo I mean there's going to be some argument as to uh you wave your rights you should have come in sooner so it's going to be the the issue is

choices are technically you have to pay the full ranch and then the a\nLandlord I has the ability has legal rights then do walk through and assuming there's no damages then right she was seven hundred and fifty dollar check let me tell you people normally do they use that deposit towards their last month's rent\nAnd even though technically uh the landlord can force you to pay the rent\nThe the problem is that he has to offset the seven hundred and fifty dollars that he has so it really becomes a wash and so just see what happens try or just call him and just tell the landlord cannot use the uh the deposit towards the last month's rent\nAnd if the places and reasonable shape it should be OK depending on what a bastard the landlord has arisen\nAlright alright alright there you go see some

have a track like about a million dollars that's good news thanks yeah [laughter] that's what I'm looking out for my money my grandmother and my ...\nMy grandmother now think about it at home that they want to put me and my brother on at the ...\nWho was that what your parents and they're still alive yeah okay and it's uh I'm assuming it's a remarkable tries to your normal everyday trust that they can change things around correct yeah OK\nWhile they're doing their they cover lawyers that my grandmother's home and a lawyer said that you know you have if they ever have to go through the home that the government because they have so much money you're comeback she's getting paid for it because she's on Medicare the thing that that government could come and try and take the money\nNo I mean she is she had been is uh she had been a fishery of uh the ... of the narrowest\nVeterans with regard to my parents if something were to happen to my parents and they were going to a home in ... less than that they can do some type of paperwork that can stop that from happening\nI Would be there if it would be in your vocal trust where you're at [laughter]\nWhere are your parents no longer have any control at all to trust is set up and then it's over that's done they just don't own it which means that they don't have assets for the government to grab but because they do go\nOn I think not Medicare uh and I you know I don't know what the rules of Medicare but they're not going to let you go on the government Dole and pay for for example a\nHome or to live for folks women with a million dollars in the bank that's just not going to happen now and go yeah lawyers say that's going to cost Fifteen thousand dollars to do that to what changed to make a a a ... trust\nThat make it so that they didn't give me the name\nBut I Know that's great anybody's charge you Fifteen thousand dollars of that is crazy you know what yeah you'd be crazy for that time to find yeah go trying to find another way are okay you got from on your website ah yeah you got tons of them handling ... trust in a state lawyers times they're not going to charge Fifteen thousand dollars and if they do I'm getting twelve thousand of that\nThat's why I'm looking out for my money\nGood for you good for you ... a little stiff basically taking a trust and making it ate irrevocably trust a that's not a very big deal at all\nHas to be high asked me\nHow you doing yeah yes ma'am what can I Do for you\nKill part question for you I keep it short I am looking for them and um I guess the new thing now is my cat after paying rent also monthly\nWages are you know they want to wait like your cats have to pay rent monthly they want\nTo charge 'em you know there's a deposit\nOh yeah of course yes I Know plus the thirty five ... a ... thirty five per cat forty five ... dog car I'm not an okay\nUm my question is my cats are certified servers animals now I'm In I'm embarrassed to say it won't get into that but the animal ... um [noise] I can I waive the\nOther side that's a good question at work yeah well you're not going to be able to pull it off with two cats I promise you that\nEven if I got the paper\nAh yeah yeah well what if you have five cats and they're all service animals no ... you probably could get away with one\nEye and I'm sure you're stuck and then I don't know if they can still charge you a for the cats are you willing yeah that I Do know that I don't know I bought for you arguing the service animal business then are you um\nYou would have no chance they can charge whatever the hell they want pet fees you can charge extra so right the bottom line is that you for one service animal and it's now this is this an emotional service animal or is it a is it a an emotional support or is it a straight out service animal\nI Know no respect for him it's emotional\nSomewhere yeah because they are very few seeing eye cats don't they\n[laughter] yeah yeah yeah they're not that they're\nNow I understand right ah I why if someone wants to ask me about a seeing eye chicken and it wasn't a wasn't the same I should probably not\nSo the quick answer is\nI have no idea if a money can be charged but if H I Can't it would be under those circumstances and therein lies where the rules are changing rather dramatically because there is a big difference we know train service animal in this emotional support crap\nYou know like they do on airlines peacocks and ferrets and whatever they can you can call any animal as service\nAnimals and or or you can call it in one ...

yeah good luck alright I'll tell you what happened\n[noise] um I had a car that I bought from a dealership in two years into the lead they sent me a written a letter and also emails wanting to buy my car back and they said they'd give me up to a hundred and ten percent of the appraised value my car no matter if I bought there or not\nAnd then when I went in front of them on it and they appraise the car and we had our temperature was an excellent condition\n... we'll give you the deal and will give you a ... percent but you've got about what our cars but in their printed advertising and my email to specify especially [noise] definitely says this away rates are paired up are you up to a hundred percent of current market value for your vehicle [noise]\nIn fact we're so interested that we will buy your vehicle back even if you don't buy our\nShowcase so now the issue is the value and you you got him on that All right there's no question that this was what they said a beer out is up to a hundred and ten percent that's for one or one aspect and connected to that is\nWhat is the value of the car or that they're saying it's not that much or did they say they're just not ... not buying the car back no matter what\nIt is in their ... by the ... say they did the appraisal on the car so I went ahead it appraised by car max and then I came to them and they were the original company to show me the car two years old right\nInto they not recognizing the ... the appraisal or they're saying we don't care\nFor their racial came higher than ... oh my God okay so so so they put they put it up to me and brought it up to me and then and then I said well what about a hundred percent and the guy ... I don't know nothing about that she brought the manager out I gave him the document\nAnd email and he goes OK well we'll give you a hundred percent because your card I mean you're a carpet showed initially it was ten thousand miles under ... should have been particularly on at least that time\nAnd he goes it will give you the deal that you need about what our cars and I and I go out for highlighted another thing I go but it says you by micro no matter what buyers are not actually as well and they they just\nStumbled on themselves\nOkay let me let me ask this uh and that is a why wouldn't you buy one of their cars or just in I understand there are a bunch of jerks but if they're willing to give you a hundred and ten ... percent legitimately and they give you a reasonable deal on one of their cars why would you jump on it or even though they watch the lying scum\nOkay I bought two new cars within a week of each other when I bought the my Chrysler I bought one from across the street from a to a dealership from them out of that in my truck I drive thirty five thousand miles a year in my car sits on the garage [laughter] so I'm sitting there going you know I'm spending over five hundred\nOr you then are you are so are you not going to buy a car then you're just not interested in buying a car period I Would just trying to get out of the week\nHuh okay uh and they offered you they're going to buy your car back uh and and they're releasing it too right\nYeah yeah they're listening to you yeah yeah I'm just trying to think they are in breach just one of the damages a and that here's\nHere's where I figured out the debt because it's been a year and I've gone through\nAll right now I got it okay all I have it uh you could sell the car or to anybody else at or whatever the value is and the difference is they're responsible for the ten percent\nOkay well the problem was with a hundred and ten percent I Would only had to chop up three hundred bucks on a been out of the league at that point I couldn't sell it for what that hundred ten percent would have been\nWithout you know picking a bigger [laughter] so I've kept the car and I just put it in on a leash so ah what I mean we only on the hook for just ... eleven payments and car insurance and vehicle registration which comes to fifty six hundred dollars\nAnd they would have been like ... and they were going to let you out of that and you're but you're not going to replace the car correct\nRight oh okay ah but you [noise] wow yeah I'm just trying to think of a of a clever way of doing this without hiring a lawyer and that's the problem and what the damages are and how you figure out\nA God ... ah the difference is we can try figuring out the damages in small claims court but the problem is going to be that you're on the hook for ah the leash you have to say I wasn't going to buy another car\nAnd the judge is going to say really uh therefore but you could have and you didn't have to and you turned it in and you took the deal\nAre saying they'll pay you a hundred and ten percent\nI so it's a little bit complicated but whatever your damages are uh you can try to take it to small claims court I but that's the only way to go I can think of and just trying to figure out your damages and frankly as I was going through the entire scenario and uh the formula I didn't understand it worth it so ah that works out now isn't it\nThe ... when it comes to math beyond like fifty plus fifty\nOr a hundred and why to buy two I have a hard time see how that works Tammy\nHi Tammy yes good morning yes ma'am\nMy question is I Am one of four owners ... on a property and I have them pay the property taxes\nFor several years I have a recourse can I put a link that property\nYou already on the property you're one of four owners nope when you get what you can do is sue the other ones for their pro rather share\nOkay that's it how much and so in terms of taxes when you say several years all over the course of those years or how much you pay in taxes", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Bill Handel", "city": "Newton", "day": "08"}
