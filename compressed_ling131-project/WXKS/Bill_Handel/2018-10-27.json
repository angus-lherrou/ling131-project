that conversation can't we are because I did we talk about your boyfriend now or soon to be husband you're not responsible a perfect but you have to be a little careful when you marry someone who has financial issues\nWhat I feel I Am by ... so I guess it could and expect\nOh that's another thing suing the VA Willie oh that's for for malpractice then you're in a different world entirely but I always say the same thing called contact a medical malpractice attorney to make sure that I Know what I'm Talking about which I rarely do All right go for it\nSam Hi Sam Europe [noise] yes [noise] [laughter] hello Sam yes yes they were going to do for you Sam ... lives ruining how are you sir\nI could do a couple of years ago I found that was quite as my wife she is she's like ... ... and I'm from the need for them to me\nThat is of course I Do five out here on calls later yes go ahead\nAnyway I have a car loan um didn't begin bankruptcy and if I call them did he take the kind of way\nYou know not if you don't know if it's a car loan you probably don't have a enough equity in the car where probably the car is worth less than the amount of money that's owed a how much money do you still on the car\nOn how much\nYou owe three thousand dollars on the car and how much is it worth\nAs maybe he will Fifteen hungry\nI Know you don't worry about it now you just keep on paying it no one's going to touch you can go bankrupt all you want oh okay I don't worry about it that that part is\n[noise] yeah and that's usually the case is assets are deal I dealt with with the bankruptcy court so you file for bankruptcy and the court looks at how much money you old versus what you have\nAnd then if it's a liquidation just splits up the assets but cars are almost never ever put into a bankruptcy unless you've got a Bentley or a Rolls Royce\nA that is a paid out that's been paid for but other than that what you have is there is exemptions where you're allowed to have a personal car and usually whenever there's alone I as in his case you owe more money let's say you buy a car for twenty thousand dollars\nOn and so you you you go ahead and arrange a payment schedule I'm you finance the carnival the second you drive off a lot it's Fifteen thousand dollars is value and you still owe twenty and that's the case all the way down so no cars are pretty\nMuch a left out of it so I wouldn't worry too much about that I hello Mike at your answer her yeah go ahead\nYeah of course you're all okay okay okay that's that's all a show itself is is because a lot by a ball and then they

court for them to pull the long hair and all that\nOh of course that they are in a judge show show about a a limitation or the oh\nMike Mike Mike I'm going to stop you right there because you're you're going way way beyond what what the show was about uh you have a bankruptcy issue yeah but just ended up selling your dismissal issue you need a civil attorney to look at it because you may have a case of legal malpractice\nThere was some statute issues obviously the judge had some issues uh with the statute asking you to file an amended complain it didn't happen on time there was a dismissal yeah you are definitely going to have to contact a as civil attorney on that just go to the website 'cause I Know the story was going to go on forever and frankly I don't understand Ninety percent

lost their lives when men spewing anti Semitic comments open fire to synagogue six other people were injured including for police officers the suspect other us\nIt would be unfair I understand\nBut I think they can charge anything above that now you could be that the only charge ten cents\nA and that's the way it goes I don't know what the law reads I mean you can look up a law that's easy I just look at the statue where they changed it just read the damn thing you know just go on the Internet and go you know ten cents a bad law mandatory bag payment whatever a search word you want\nBut I based on if they're using the law that says the stores can only charge ten cents\nAnd they must charge ten cents then all they can do is charged fence but my guess is that there is a ten cent charge in the stores can charge way beyond that\nWow yeah so\nThe answer you bring your own Dan bear hug you when you go to the story I don't know what I'm saying I always bring their own recycle bands okay there's your answer\nOr what a big legal issue on that one isn't there oh hey can I sue them yes yes I'll give you some lawyers a good lawyer six hundred bucks an hour or what does my lawyer charge a whenever I Need legal work to keep in mind uh my expertise is\nIt's a limited as most lawyers are limited in their expertise in mind is insanely limited to a third party reproductive\nLaws you know I I watch my lawyer charging I just had an issue with a a lawyer headed I needed some a business documents a six and a quarter an hour six hundred and twenty five dollars an hour and by the way that's not off base either for a good lawyers\nSummer seven hundred appeals lawyers can be nine hundred thousand dollars in our senior ... senior partners in a law firm you can run nine hundred thousand bucks an hour\nSo when you have to pay for a lawyer and a good lawyer you have to look at whether you have a good case or not\nAnd that's why I Love law it's the principal thing I Want to follow suit okay go go for it you know you'll enjoy yourself and then the judge says you're absolutely right thank you the other side can't do it anymore and you're out Fifteen thousand dollars\nA Israel Israel\nI Am here yes or what can I Do for you\nAll right I'll bet you for ten years um you know and I was a pretty conservative denomination a long story short my wife had an affair ah the nomination did not air whose fault it was if you're not able to lead the outcome God or lead your own house\nCan't live album God so I was removed from ministry wow kept my ordination\nUh for two years I was I'm working back and forth your email thought about getting in ... after a finally here's later I was given my termination notice however they backed candidate a day before my ten year\nWhere I Would have been backed into my tension play a lot of my church lots I wipe it off I tension there might just rude\nAlright well first of all I did what denomination is\nA a Methodist I'm Sorry free method is yeah you know I deal with that is have you considered becoming let's say a Muslim or a Jew\n[laughter] oh actually I met you ought to use I should just go that route\nOh you ... you know what I Love that because you know what the uh you know what people called messianic Jew so people that believe in Christ with that\nChristians that's all we call them they're not messianic Jews just saying just throwing that out I always had a pleasure talking about that uh where you can do ah I think you can go for your pension because uh that road knocking you off one day a is retaliatory and it's\nPrinted tear a predatory I mean that is I mean they're just a bunch of bastards they really are to do that boy I tell ya they sure have that Christian outlook on life don't they\nAre and yeah Oh absolutely\nAnd now the issue of uh their belief you just can't hold your own house in order you can't leave you certainly can't a lead a house of God a which is also a complete ... if your wife leaves you and a has an affair it's somehow it's your fault I Love that\nMan that's another reason why he decided just switching ah religions Israel I mean this this is a tough way to go it really is\nNo no I'm I'm thinking like that just I don't like the people I I like God is not the people from my chair\nAlright is uh do you have a possibility of getting in another a person is your ah another church\nCan't how do you say that actually I was just approached by one of the new leaders that just stepped up and and one of the higher positions and they asked if I were so interested and I kind of wondered if if uh if I did do that if they would have to take off the fact that they terminated me and kind of kept me on fourteen years\nNow that the other issue is as you talk to or the new folks that you are I'm considering going back to the church or at least having a a a a church ... what do they call that a person who use a congregation\nCongregation that's the word yeah having your own congregation you want to say can I please be credited or with the two years so my pension kicks in and have a ... not only are we in statement but credit\nFor the two years and if I were if if I were them or or ... I Would ah I'd give it to you in a heartbeat because it's so unfair to what happened to you\nI mean it really is I mean on the face of it just said you know the fact that you have a a good attitude about this if it were me I Would have towards the church [laughter]\nAnyway so uh the issue is yes I think you have a legal a right to go after the pension based on their actions but if you can only do that with a new congregation and the higher ups on the church willing to do that you're home free Israel you don't care matter of fact you don't have damages\nThat is true er and I really appreciate that thank you so much\nAll right take care of me not to join that church if I ever convert a I'm not going to be a free Methodist\nI'll be paid Methodist [noise] I think so was that that works for sure [noise] okay this is a handle on the law [noise]\n\nAre you considering a safe or gun safe to secure your valuables and firearms if so before you spend any money on any typical running all male safe check out the amazing handcrafted\nRhino iron works shapes had rhino safe dotcom see for yourself why rhino safe customers are so passionate about their antique industrial style safes and if you're a gun owner you'll love the convenience of the swing outgoing wreck rhino has a huge dealer network great pricing warranty in customer service so go to rhino\nSafe dot com today that's rhino safe dot com\nNothing small about your [noise] your passion your hours your reputation all huge\nTheir partnership even bigger [noise]\nWhat else not technology advisors you'll get the ... and one on one partnership to help your business ground because with a reliable down PCs with an uncle or processors you can focus on what matters most getting business down\nA seventh heaven die down to speak with an advisor to seven seven by down [noise]\nThis is Michael ... than here with Mike stole from health markets helping folks find the right Medicare coverage that news reports say that the rates might be going down\nThe government protects the costs of Medicare plants will decrease this year so you have to ask yourself are you getting the best right help markets offers a free service with access to thousands of Medicare plans nationwide to help folks maximize their benefits and\nSay honey what is it people need to keep in mind enrollment in the right plan is not automatic with so many Medicare options that can be confusing my advice don't go at it won't get unbiased help to find a plan that may cost less\nAnd cover more with lower copayments more choices like dental and vision and the freedom to choose your doctors with the enrollment deadline only weeks away it's important to act now our health markets Medicare assistance as freight\nThanks my this is Michael methods for health markets\nFor your free Medicare assistance coal eight hundred seven for one twenty nine thirty that's eight hundred seven for one twenty nine thirty eight hundred seven for one twenty nine thirty\nOr reusing them more music\nDownloads a free I hard with us today\nAre you supposed to ... send me tons of residents just to find a few people who are right for my job at old process was not smart then I went to a zipper\nTechnology cameras forms find the right\nPeople and actively invites them to apply so I get qualified candidates smart\nRecruiters written number one by employees in the U.S right now for ... dot com slash free that different groups dot com slash free zip recruiting way to hire based on trust rating hiring side to the radio\nFor more information about contests on Boston sauce twelve hundred go to the top twelve hundred Boston dot com slash rules\nNow a year in rock spotlight Nineteen sixty nine\n\n\nJanuary of sixty nine greed is Clearwater revival is married to be in line for the last time was ... in London and if the during his New York versus September sixty eight page renamed the band Led Zeppelin and their debut which goes both us and you can\nIt's huge when somebody says hey man that jumping homey apply for I got it by name is Dale ...

Regina welcome my question\nIs the you know of an attorney that would take my case on contingency basis um my father died I got sixty three hundred my brothers that should've been over a hundred thousand and they're telling me the only way I'm\nWhy does you only get sixty three hundred\nBecause she took the money I guess\nOkay so you have to sue the she was a a trustee was it a trust there wasn't a will it will All right and uh she was a I guess the executor\nShe was not appointed she disappointed herself\nSo how did she get access to the money\nI guess he corrected her with the cold or you're the\nAll right well I I don't know I had to pass on Christie okay that's the problem is that she's going to argue that was my dad wanted me to have the money otherwise you wouldn't have put my name in their high end when the we'll just we'll specifically talk about the bank account\nYeah I'm going to have it you know whatever's left in there was supposed to go to me\nAll right but ... what is ever left there and they ... and it was specifically mentioning that bank account\n[noise] you know what I was told because you know again I I wasn't raised with them my brother's everything but my brother almost dies so he couldn't be in charge\nYou know I think you're going to have a hard time I mean you can easily go to the website handle on law dot com and we have trust in a state lawyers but it's a it's not going to be easy you know how long ago did this happen\nRegina my father down how long ago how many how many years ago did this happen to know he just died okay so the money how do you know the money has been taken\nBecause the bank told me that the accounting and close she closed in February that when I got\nAnd how do you know over a hundred thousand dollars now to kill\nMy brother shot before he almost died he within a bus accident and so\nMy all right well you it's good to be tough getting someone to do it on a contingency but ah you ... your brother said he saw it and how did he see it\nOn my father wanted him to be in charge he came around the\nWheel with the whole specifically says the money goes to you\nYeah All right well he tried dry I talked to attorney\nOr because there was an up there and now the trick is over a hundred thousand dollars you could take it a contingency\nThat one is a problem because if the money's gone uh and and she doesn't have any money or where do you go see where his lawyer yet that where's the winner gets paid\nYeah so there has to me and she spent the money ah Regina what do you do\nYeah if I was trying to get someone to try to maybe help make somebody said if you go to and file it they can make myself um how do you say the ...\nAn executive or I don't know that's not so easy to do but it doesn't matter what can happen is all the accounts are frozen once you file your score to freeze the account but it's certainly worth talking to a trust trust interstate lawyer I go to the website to do that because there's a lot of pieces on this one for sure\nSunny hello sunny\nAround though [noise] five in the morning they really didn't know the the crowd at grad school to let that a young lawyer the LA itself okay that I it and I do\nIn Georgia well I here's the problem you're probably going to need a warrior in Georgia and there are\nA the law schools generally do have clinics where they do help people who don't have any money\nOr it's these pro bono odd organizations ah we're a law students get to work under a lawyer and get some a practice but you're going to need that you're going to find that out in Georgia sunny\nDay that uh that that's how they're doing the\nVacation in Georgia you have to call a lawyer in Georgia called the law schools in Georgia and find out if they have any clinics\nOkay Conan no\nYeah call every law school you can get your hands on and Georgia and then you may also want to just find out all organizations that that do pro bono work sunny or are you are you are you broke\n[laughter] that helps All right what kind of civil case do you have\nA ... that are out there and my mom or a bill\nAnd uh this lawyer is spreading or ... or it was a ... a lot of a combination if they know her father Sauer\nFair thought if I Want to see that I gave them they ah they they're that they're ... and I asked them what to do it if they sent their ...\nAnd pay a fine ... for the death for that but the average guy but\nOkay I Know this makes sense on ... you can get the death certificate and two seconds that's that's a public records yeah you're going to need a you're probably gonna need some kind of a clinic no lawyer is going to take this on contingency and clearly you're not going to be able to pay hundreds of dollars an hour\nSo called de la schools you want to look under pro bono a legal help in Georgia All right\nOkay All right All right All right you know good luck to\nYou know it's er just occurred to me that some law schools do have ... [noise]\nAnd actually the lawyers and oversee those clinics are generally pretty good uh those lawyers are ah what they do is they get paid about twenty eight thousand dollars a year to oversee the clinics and uh they couldn't jobs a probably\nA so pencils on a street corner if it weren't for ah those clinics nicely said handle I'm sure I'm going to get one or two calls and say come on bill really\nIs and I will say do you have any pencils for sale [laughter] All right Tom Europe welcome\nOh [laughter] okay I'm gonna get right to it [laughter] okay I worked for an employer for about three years I left that implement about a year and a half ago and during the three years I worked for them I worked a considerable amount of overtime a during last six months I worked in an average of eighty hours per\nWe are because it's verbal it has no force at all well\nFirst of all I have is we are all these are the same for me to keep it yeah first of all you can tell you I never said OK okay\nHe's ... he's willing to throw you out if he's willing to say you have to this weekend to pop off and get out of there than trust me he's going to lie about any verbal agreement any agreement you ever make its been writing he signs it\nOkay All right a verbal agreement you know the rules at this point verbal agreements mean zero and that goes back hundreds and hundreds of years to common law and common law incidentally the law started not\nAs human rights or contractual right at all it's a real estate property and the and it came out of that which is why in terms of common law that is ancient English law which show a lot of our laws dry from\nUh it says that in real property no verbal contracts everything has to be written this goes back five hundred six hundred eight hundred years\nA steamy hello Stevie okay\nI get you know yeah if you're on a ... if you're honest uh what do you call it phone speaker phone get off\n[laughter] All right I'm okay this is the bottom line I'm going to just continue my insurance was Kaiser\nOkay and what I wanted to find out let's say my own insurance or just me working out riding my bicycle staying healthy is the federal government going to say when I Do my taxes are they going to impose a penalty on\nMe sure because under Obamacare you have to have insurance and if you don't you uh there was a penalty you give up your I help ensure typically Kaiser I'm a member of Kaiser why would you do that ...\nOkay so so really the reason I'm going to do it is because I have Kaiser so go to another so by BP oh yeah\nI mean I I don't understand why you know the first step is why would you give up health insurance because anybody who can afford it is out of his mind not habit and second of all yes this at this point it is no law that you must either having insurance plan or you pay a penalty questionable\nOkay simple and I heard the penalty is based on your income\nI have no idea okay you have no idea\nYeah I'm assuming it's now it's two hundred and five hundred then it goes up to ... or you know two thousand I have no idea if you can have the penalty subsidize that would be hilarious that would be all areas or because they do subsidize your insurance if you don't have the money but do they subsidized a penalty if you don't have the money that probably not\nOkay yeah so so I'm white now which legislation\nNo it's not in legislation there is nothing in legislation\nBut the Republicans or try to appeal you\nKnow they're ... yeah but they pass a law and there's not even been a war that you introduce right now\nSo this could take this one new sugar take you\nCould take years by enemy neighbor passed but get yourself insurance you know please\nTell apparently yes ma'am what can I Do for you\nUm get by with a heart had a partnership with the people that are that are nine years and we were down ... years ago\nAnd we had originally filed bankruptcy bankruptcy it before so I was able to file on it but my partner filed bankruptcy on the stand up and they don't come back after\nA while or what kind of ... first of all let's talk about the business was in a while", "show_name": "Bill Handel", "year": "2018", "city": "Newton", "day": "27"}
