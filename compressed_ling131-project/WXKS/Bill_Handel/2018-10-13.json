had a phone call a ... that there was a sixty one year old man that had just passed the bar and was looking for cases and so you're trying to connect a sixty one year old with taking elder abuse case ... no game um who will take and I assume on contingency or take a a lien against a household\nLie about an hour a hundred hundred an hour now does it matter as a matter that a lawyer has absolutely no experience and doesn't even know how to spell elder law\nI don't you don't care for the lawyer has knowing Marion son I think\nAt the bar I'll do our work\nWhat do you mean you'll do all the work you're going to do all these ...\nLegal back you know I Love to do it my hobby\nDidn't want to do that than I Do is this for you of course then why don't you wait a second then why don't you represent

probably a less competent than you are my dear\nBut he had a choir behind the room\nSo why you can represent yourself I I live so why do you think someone who has\nEsquire behind their name is going to somehow when the case and by the way it was a case\nDismissed about what was the case dismissed\nNo I think that maybe the guy they're going for about an hour ... ...\nHow did you lose Mary how ...

because they are best choir behind their name\nWell it's better than the lunar well it's not better than you alone I'm telling you you are more invested in this you have more experience in this then that lawyer does oh you want to press just because someone has Esquire behind their name\nThat means not saying well\nMaybe means something but uh not a whole lot so anyway it's fascinating how people are impressed with lawyers are never get that\nAll right I every\nThere you go higher ivory welcome to handling law we're going to do for you\n[noise] Hi I'm I took out a two year warranty contract with the term my company and [noise] and and that was in two thousand six inches of Seventeen I started noticing that my would wish tripping on the corner of my house yeah and I don't know what\nThey were turned my findings I called the representative that initially treated my own and stone made for a couple of months\nI finally called the the main office and explain to them what was happening and that might throw a porch where to lose in my own [noise] they sent their representative out exterminated again and then another aspects and told me that I now have\nSubterranean termites so he says you can get an extended on the mind you I was still under the contract of the ... but yet seen what what's going on underneath my house and he had written which I didn't notice what repair excluded\nOr what do you mean in a way where you didn't notice say so you didn't read the document\nUm we were talking that don't matter but you didn't read the document [noise] no I didn't know okay oh I didn't know\nAll right so you now subterranean a termites I guess that were treated eyes so they did treat but it said would repair excluded and okay what's okay\nSo at this point I accepted another imitation from another company to come into an expectation that with in\nJuly now mind you march is when both termites were treated again the other companies finding where I had major infestation of both I contacted the state of California pest control\nAnd they had no record whatsoever it that this company had ever been to my own tree so they told me\nWhy would they why would they have a record of it [noise]\nBecause I might as well ... why would the state of California keep her record of a charter my company going to your house\nBecause by law they're supposed to submit a WD old form notify them\nReally okay I didn't know that so they have to be All right so I have to do it within ten days wow I didn't know that okay so every time they treat they have to let the state no we just treated a home here's the address right right by all the news ...\nSo they told me there in violation and that's an internal thing so I ended up filing a complaint with the state of California in the meantime the owner of the company wanted to give me seven hundred and fifty\nLet me you know I was going on forever okay this is taking way too long so the bottom line is there in violation internally\nOr you can sue them for all the damage or based on the damage subsequent to they're coming in and trading and then you can argue that they had not had they had they treated correctly all the additional damage wouldn't have been done I don't think they can defend even\nBased on the fact that they were violation of the law that's probably the violation of that\nUh that ordinance that statute it would be ...\nDo you got a small claims to that's it and now when you say you bought an additional warranty was that from the tour my company or ... or a third provider no from the

up [noise]\nUh yeah I have a right that's the question that they're going to have a right to ... to ... or ... or or their perspective and Corey\nOkay I I'm All right you're you're saying uh before me asking you to fill out a W to form\nOr or you know I got on a previous W to form for a previous job\nA ... a previous ... to form a\nFor trade from previous jobs yeah\nNo doubt that doesn't have the right to do that or because effectively what he's doing is asking for your salary\nAnd it's against the law to ask what your salary was\nIt's funny because it's out of his business how much money you earned it the previous in employment\nSo no cars you know you don't have a right to say I need to see your previous W to form doesn't work that was\n... by rep\nYeah there's a particular law that says you cannot ask for or how much money someone has made previously\nAnd there and don't\nGet you to form a previous double your true form says exactly that also even if it wasn't the lie just saying you can't do that you say no\nWhat are you doing yeah how about the color underwear I'm wearing a so uh no I don't think that works or John Hi John you're up\nTo eight that hey rent but not all amount um they pay you know that I did that because they're claiming that there are no damage to their\nCurrent so you're talking about the so you're talking about they moved out right John\nAre in the memory now okay\nAnd what you're saying is that the damages are going to be greater than this you know or the rent is greater than security deposit correct\nOr do they pay their rent that I did that they\nThey do that all the time All right so what's your question [laughter]\nSo my question I I brought it up to them and they are claiming that I'm Around me and I called and emailed them\nOkay what is going on right okay here is here's your your your choices\nAnd I'm going to tell you just suck it up and here's why I technically they have to pay you the rent there is no question about it and the security deposit is a separate issue and the security deposit is about protecting you from damage\nA particularly protecting you from damage or to the property so I\nAssuming that there is no damage or even if there is damage what happens is they are of course saying where to put the security positive towards the last one threat and you're saying no you can't do that so\nYou have the right to sue them but but you have to offset the amount of money you have a security deposit as against three so it becomes a wash\n\nSo so what are you gonna do you're going to sue for a wash and\nThen the issue is if there are damages beyond that then of course you sue them in small claims court\nSo then you so then you sue venue suit then you have a small claims shoe\nBut other than that no we had that before but don't they all the money yes but you have to offset so now what why even bother\nSteve hello Steve I Want to you\nSir yeah you know for some reason uh I I've been listening to the show or

grand\nAll right so you pay that and you're what you're saying you could negotiate it yourself and you don't think they did much right\nYeah All right so they have any recourse oh yeah you consume in small claims court saying they didn't do anything they just let it lap\nAnd you come away I requested documentation that me\nAnd it will be will soon as you file a lawsuit in small claims to work for your seven thousand dollars oh trust me they are going to come up with documentation because you're saying they did nothing and they're saying oh you don't deserve any money back because we did

beat me do it well said\nMy man identity [noise] if you're young lady yes ma'am I'm can you hear me\nUm I had been working for a school district and so Cal for sixteen years um I'm part time actually it's really part time and they've done that for this reason\nI'm getting ready to retire when I had taken um days off for being sick in the whole sixteen years generally taken a few and put 'em on the sick days [laughter] but um mostly I've accumulated I'm thinking that I could\nWe're trained them at the end either take a pay out or um take time off prior to my retirement and looking into it we're getting ready to retire this year um I have over three hundred and twenty five hours accumulated and I can't take any of it\nAnd why can't you take any of it\nThey have because I Am part time work less than twenty hours\nOn it so what's your question\nDo I have any recourse at all\nI didn't know if if the policy of the school board\nAnd the policy in which you hired is that people were under twenty or twenty five hours a week or month whatever it is or not entitled to take their sick pay\nAt the end of it uh then there's nothing you can do that's their policy and some school boards some companies allow people to take sick days my police departments for example usually do\nSo uh you got cops that retiring literally a year's worth of sick leave that they pull out early and then there are companies and uh they're our enemies that say no for example uh my my company in the center for surrogate parenting\nIts use it or lose it same thing uh I worked for this radio station it's they use it or lose it\nAnd they said the only recourse I could have is if I had because I'm part in front of a government job that was over twenty hours what I mean whatever the policy is yeah that could cause it stays with me I get it\nWhenever the policy is you have to live within the policy and it is perfectly legal to have a ... says use it or lose it yeah as which I Do and not only do I have it in my company uh but I also live under it\nYeah yeah well yeah you're screwed you know I ... so there is no case here\nAh you know Nick [noise] rebellious or ah\nI'm renting their clients and uh they
