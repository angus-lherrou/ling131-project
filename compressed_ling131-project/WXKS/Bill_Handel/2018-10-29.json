well we can have that conversation can we are because I did we talk about your boyfriend now or soon to be husband you're not responsible a perfect but you have to be a little careful when you marry someone who has financial issues\nA William it's um it's a statute issue and I I I I feel bad for you I really do\nWhat I feel it and buy me a so I guess I could and expect\nOh that's another thing suing the VA will you oh that's for for malpractice then you're in a different world entirely but I always say the same thing called contact a medical malpractice attorney to make sure that I Know what I'm Talking about which I rarely do All right go for it\nSam Hi Sam Europe [noise] yes [noise] yes hello Sam ... yes yes they were going to do for you Sam ... morning how are you sir\nI could do a couple of years ago I say I'm going to watch because my wife she is she's like Wrigley gum running and I'm from the need for the ... and me\nFor saying you know five out here on calls later yes go ahead\nAnyway I have a car loan um didn't begin in bankruptcy and if I call them did he take it a kind of way\nYou're not if you don't know if it's a car loan you probably don't have a enough\nEquity in the car where it probably the car is worth less than the amount of money that's owed on how much money do still on the car\nWith how much\nYou're three thousand dollars on the car and how much is it worth\nAs maybe he will Fifteen hungry\nI Know you don't worry about it now you just keep on paying it no one's going to touch you can go bankrupt all you want [noise] oh okay I don't worry about it that that\nPart is [noise] yeah and that's usually the case\nIs I assets are deal I dealt with with the bankruptcy court so you file for bankruptcy and the court looks at how much money you old versus what you have\nAnd then if it's a liquidation splits up the assets but cars are almost never ever put into a bankruptcy unless you've got a Bentley or a Rolls Royce\nA that is a paid out that's been paid for but other than that what you have users exemptions where you're allowed to have a personal car and usually whenever there's alone I as in his case\nYou owe more money let's say you buy a car for twenty thousand dollars\nOn and so you you you go ahead and arrange a payment schedule I'm you finance the car well the second you drive off the lot it's Fifteen thousand dollars is value and you still owe twenty and that's the case all the way down so no cars are pretty much a left out of it so I wouldn't worry too much about that\nI hold on like you know yeah\nOh yeah yeah yeah I have a question of all I okay other cats will have to take that for\nA show it to us because a lot of the ...\nThe the problem is that the I ... a ... a a\n... do you think that that sort of a patient\nRight

first of all a\nVery Mike Mike Mike I'm going to stop you right there because you're you're going way way beyond a what what the show was about uh you have a bankruptcy issue but just ended up selling your dismissal issue you need a civil attorney to look at it because you may have a case of legal malpractice\nThere is some statute issues obviously the judge had some issues uh with the statute asking you to file an amended complain it didn't happen on time there was a dismissal yeah you are definitely going to have to contact a civil attorney on that just go to the website 'cause I Know the

should I get that are needed help me with this man\nWell it depends on how serious your medical issue is\nWhat I think that dollar\nI considered talking to an attorney Betty okay\nThere's enough money there that you want at least talk to a personal injury attorney and is not one of those things where uh years of medical bills and here's another thousand dollars a\nFirst of all I think you're going

stores can charge way beyond that yeah\nSo where are you ... the answer you bring your own Dan bear hug you when you go to the store and they were always bring their own recycle bags\n\nOkay there's your answer or what a big legal issue on that one isn't there oh hey can I sue them yes yes I'll give you some lawyers a good lawyer six hundred bucks an hour\nOr what does my lawyer charge a whenever I Need legal work to keep in mind died\nMy expertise is\nIs limited as most lawyers are limited in their expertise and mine is in St Louis and limited to a third party reproductive\nLaws you know a a which my lawyer charge you know it just had an issue with a a lawyer headed\nAnd needed some a business documents are six and a quarter an hour\nSix hundred and twenty five dollars an hour and by the way that's not off base either for a good lawyers summers seven hundred appeals lawyers can be nine hundred thousand dollars an hour senior ... senior partners in a law firm you can run nine hundred thousand\nBucks an hour so when you have to pay for a lawyer and a good lawyer you have to look at whether you have a good case or not\nAnd that's why I Love law it's the principal thing I Want to file a lawsuit okay go go for it you know you'll enjoy yourself and then the judge says you're absolutely right thank you the other side can't do it anymore and you're out Fifteen thousand dollars\nA Israel Israel\nI Am here yes or we're going to do for you\nAll right I'll bet you for ten years um\nYou know and I was a pretty good they are to the nomination a long story short my wife had an affair ah the nomination did not air fault it was if you're not able to lead the album God or lead your own house Kelly the album God so I was removed from ministry wow kept my ordination\nUh for two years I was I'm working backing or your email thought about getting in reinstate it as a pastor a finally here's later I was given my termination notice however they backed candidate a day before my ten year where I Would have been backed into my tensions are a lot of my church lost my wife and off like that in\nA dorm I'd get through\nAll right well first of all I did what denomination is a a Methodist\nI'm Sorry free method is yeah you know I deal with that is have you considered becoming would say a Muslim or a Jew\n[laughter] oh actually I met you ought to use I should just go that route\nYou know what I Love that because you know what the uh you know what people called messianic Jew so people that believe in Christ what that\nChristians that's what we call them they're not messianic Jews just saying just throwing that out I always had a pleasure talking about that uh where you can do ah I think you can go for your pension\nBecause uh that road knocking you off one day a is retaliatory and his credit tear a predatory I mean that is I mean they're just a bunch of bastards they really are to do that well yeah they sure have that Christian outlook on life don't they\nAh and yeah absolutely\nAnd now the issue of uh their belief that you can hold your own house in order you can't leave you certainly can't a lead a house of God a which is also a complete ... if your wife leaves you and a has an affair it's somehow it's your fault I Love that\nMan that's another reason why he sort of just switching ah religions Israel I mean this this is a tough way to go it really is\nNo no I'm I'm thinking about it that just to I don't like the people I I like God they're stopping people from my chair\nAlright is a possibility of getting in another a person is your ah another church\nAnd it's funny you say that actually I was just approached by one of the new leaders that just stepped up and and one of the higher positions and they asked if I were so interested and I kinda wondered if if if I did do that if they would have to take all the fact that they terminated me and kind of kept me on fourteen years\nNow that the other issue is as you talk to uh the new folks that you are I'm considering going back to the church or at least having a a a a church or what what do they call that a person is used a congregation\nCongregation that's the word yeah having your own congregation you want to say can I please be credited or with the two years so my pension kicks in and have a ... not only are we in statement but credit for the two years and if I were if if I were them\nOr or ... I Would ah I'd give it to you in a heartbeat because it's so unfair to what happened to you\nI mean it really is I mean on the face of it just said you know the fact that you have a a good attitude about this if it were me I Would have towards the church\n[laughter] anyway so uh the issue is yes I think you have a legal a right to go after the pension based on their actions but if you can only do that with a new congregation and the higher ups on the church willing to do that you're home free Israel you don't care\nMatter of fact you don't have damages\nThat is true and I really appreciate that thank you so much\nAll right take care of me not to join that church if I ever convert a I'm not going to be a free Methodist\nI'll be paid Methodist [noise] I think so was that were that works

welcome my question\nIs the you know of an attorney that would take my case on contingency basis um my father died I got sixty three hundred my brother's should have been over a hundred thousand and they're telling me the only way I'm\nWhy does you only get sixty three hundred because she took the money I guess\nOkay so you have to sue the she was a a trustee was it a trust there wasn't a will\nIt will All right and uh she was a I guess the executor\nShe was not appointed she disappointed herself\nSo how did she get access to the money\nI guess he crafted her with the code or you're the all right well I I don't know\nI it depends on what the okay that's the problem is that she's going to argue that was my dad wanted me to have the money otherwise you wouldn't have put my name and their high end when the will ... will specifically talk about the bank account\nOr the or are you going to have it you know whatever's left in there was supposed to go to me\nAll right but that one has ever left there and they talk and it was specifically mentioning that bank account\n[noise] you know what I was told because you know again I I wasn't raised with them my brother's everything but my brother almost dies so he couldn't be in\nRegina I think you're going to have a hard time I mean you can easily go to the website handle on law dot com and we have trust in a state lawyers but it's a it's not going to be easy you know how long ago did this happen Regina\nMy father down how long ago how many how many years ago did this happen to know he just died okay so the money how do you know the money has been taken\nBecause the bank told me that the account had been close she closed in February when I got\nAnd how do you know it was over a hundred thousand dollars not a candidate\nMy brother shot before he almost died he was in a bus accident and so\nMy alright well you it's good to be tough getting someone to do it on a contingency but ah you your brother said he saw it and how did he see it\nOn my father wanted him to be in charge he took him around the\nWheel with the ... specifically says the money goes to you\nYeah All right well he tried dry talked to an attorney or because there was an up there and now the trick is over a hundred thousand dollars going to take it a contingency that one of the problem because of the money's all gone uh and and she doesn't have any money or where do you go she wears a lawyer yet that where's where's your pate\nYeah so there has to me and she spent the money or\nDid you know what do you do yeah if I was trying to get someone to try to maybe help make is somebody that you go to and file it they can make make myself um how do you say the ...\nAn executive or I don't know that's not so easy to do it doesn't matter what can happen is all the accounts are frozen once you file your scores to freeze the account but it's certainly worth talking to attract trust in a state lawyer I go to the website to do that because there's a lot of pieces on this one for sure\nSunny hello sunny\nRandall five in the morning they didn't know the the crowd at grad school to let that or you don't value the LA itself okay that I didn't do\nIn Georgia well I here's the problem you're probably going to need a warrior in Georgia and there are\nA the law schools generally do have clinics where they do help people who don't have any money\nOr it's a these pro bono odd organizations ah we're a law students get to work under a lawyer and get some a practice but you're going to need that you're going to find that out in Georgia sunny\n... data and that that's how they\nBecame in Georgia you have to call a lawyer in Georgia called the law schools in Georgia and find out if they have any clinics\nOkay called and no\nYeah call every law school you can get your hands on and Georgia and then you may also want to just find out all organizations that that do pro bono work sunny or are you are you bro are you broke\n[laughter] that helps All right what kind of civil case do you have\nA ... that are out there my mom or a bill\nAnd on this lowering its brand or ... or he was a it was a a low carbon and they say you know her voted out of them\nAnd then I thought I felt when the that I gave them they ah they they're that they're ... and I asked them what to do it if they sent their ... and hey\nI got ... put it down for that but go bad about it\nOkay I Know this makes sense to you can you can get the death certificate and two seconds that's that's a public records yeah you're going to need a you're probably going to need some kind of a clinic no lawyer is going to take this on contingency and clearly you're not going to be able to pay hundreds of dollars an hour\nSo called the law schools you want to look under pro bono a legal help in Georgia All right okay All right All right All right\nGood luck to you know it's er just occurred to me that some law schools do have ... [noise]\nAnd actually the lawyers and oversee those clinics are generally pretty good ah those lawyers are ah what they do is they get paid about twenty eight thousand dollars a year to oversee the clinics and uh they couldn't jobs a probably\nA so pencils on a street corner if it weren't for ah those clinics nicely said handle I'm sure I'm going to get one or two calls and say come on bill really is\nAnd I will say do you have any pencils for sale [laughter]\nAll right Tom Europe welcome\nBecause it's verbal it has no force at all\nFirst of all you have all these are the same with me to keep it yeah first of all I can tell you I never said\nOK okay he's alive he's willing to throw you out to be willing to say you have to this weekend a pop off and get out of there than trust me he's going to lie about any verbal agreement any agreement you ever make its been writing he signs it\nOkay All right a verbal agreement you know the rules at this point verbal agreements mean zero and that goes back hundreds and hundreds of years to common law\nAnd common law incidentally the law started not as human rights or contractual right at all it's a real estate property and the and it came out of that which is why in terms of common law that is ancient English law which a lot of our laws derived from\nA it says that in real property no verbal contracts everything has to be written this goes back five hundred six hundred eight hundred years\nA steamy hello Stevie okay I get you know yeah if you're on a up you're on a ah what do you call it phone speaker phone get off\n[laughter] All right I'm OK bottom line I'm going to just continue my insurance was Kaiser okay and what I wanted to find out let's say my own insurance or just me working out riding my bicycle staying healthy is the federal government going to say when I Do my taxes are they going to impose a penalty\nOn me sure because under Obamacare you have to have insurance and if you don't you uh there was a penalty why would you give up your help ensure vaguely Kaiser I'm a member of Kaiser why would you do that ...\nOkay so so really what I'm the reason I'm going to do it is because guys are\nSo go to another so by BP oh yeah\nI mean I I don't understand why you know the first step is why would you give up health insurance because anybody who can afford it is out of his mind not habit and second of all yes this at this point it is the law that you must either having insurance plan or you pay a penalty in ...\nOkay simple and I heard the penalty is based on your income\nI have no idea okay you have no idea\nYeah I'm assuming it's now it's two hundred and five hundred then it goes up to a you know two thousand I have no idea if you can have the penalty subsidize that would be hilarious that would\nBe all areas or because they do subsidize your insurance if you don't have the money but do they subsidize the penalty if you don't have the money that probably not\nOkay yeah so so I'm like no legislation\nNo it's not in legislation there is nothing in legislation\nBut the Republicans are trying to appeal you\nKnow they're ... yeah but they pass a law and there's not even been a war that you introduce right now\nSo this could take this ... can take\nIt was going to take years but China may neighbor pass but get yourself insurance you know please\nHello Pam yes ma'am what can I Do for you\nUm yes I had a partnership with the fact that uh we got a nine year we have to go\nAnd we had originally from bankruptcy bankruptcy if you're born with a label on it but my partner\nFile bankrupt and still come back after\nA well what kind of bit first of all let's talk about the business was it a wealthier corporation\nPartnership\nA and yet they can't come after you are as a one of the partners is that you've already filed for bankruptcy you can't you cannot go bankrupt on it\nThey've been ah I think what seven years since you file for bankruptcy\nIt happened quite\nAll right well theoretically they could go but one that seven years is over you can re file I mean you're never going to have any credit again Pam that's a given but you can no re file and you could refinance at any time\nSo it doesn't matter if they're suing you doesn't matter if they have a judgment it doesn't matter any ... anywhere in the process all the legal process or you can stop it cold once you file for personal bankruptcy it's over for anything that you would be responsible for what kind of business by the way we talk about him\nIt was it was right the box that wet during the ...\nAnd why did he go under not an ... there there weren't enough customers a or a\nRobbery I got my parents had to close down after nine years\nYou've got ... what kind of neighborhood where are you in that was so crazy\nTerrible Marino valley huh wow why\nIt got really bad after nine years and we get that the shut it down but I was in the pressure that like my partner filed a business that that would have taken care of it\nNo because you have a partnership and go what happens is I you know I don't even if a partnership can file bankruptcy 'cause everybody's into your individually responsible for it right so effectively it's a it's the two of you know I don't even think it's a business it's a straight partnership where you're just personally liable\nWhy do why wouldn't you do an LCD or a corporation\nI don't know yeah I Do I Do yeah\nOh she said it you know I'm a dumb ass so I didn't have to say it although I'm going to repeat it\nDorsey Hi Dorothy yes yes [noise]\nAh yeah for a long time ago me and my girlfriend and her mother we bought a house and we all fine\nAnd it's been a wave that's ramification that ... that would go with my daughter turned Eighteen 'cause we have real government of which she turned it you know go go down and make them sell the house when I went down to the courthouse money wouldn't even own a house so I was wondering\nIf uh any kind of way I could find out that I did sign on at home\nWell okay it's a I I don't quite understand that you signed on the house when you took a ownership of that house how did you get the house\n[noise] [noise] no we all went out together thriller well put money\nDown okay and then a Yahoo assuming than you are when I'm Alone\nI Know we didn't get along together we just put money\nThough for use by ... by you are you outright just bought a house everybody putting an X number of dollars there was no mortgage on it right\nNow we didn't find out about it but um I Do remember signing up put it like maybe it was on dog didn't we find that it's only for like maybe seven hundred dollar\nYou put seven hundred dollars down on the house yeah how do you own a house with seven hundred dollars down\nNo no no don't go in his corner to downpayment\nHow much was the entire downpayment\nOh not that I don't remember what we find ourselves I think it was all like twenty nine thousand doing it that was like five minutes\nOr

four hours local law enforcement would be around it\nYeah [laughter] of course not uh although I like returning those phone calls\nBut they're they're just they're just fun to return now normally\nA

probably be the FCC I guess\nWho is in charge of that and why they put in a complaint and then they put you on the list because they've got two hundred and thirty million of those to deal with\nAnd I don't think I'm exaggerating either now I returned phone calls I got one the other day uh it wasn't even a robocall it was well robo call them a sense of the dialing but I got a live person who I said I I'm with the IRS\nAnd do we have a A N and we are not a ... and do you have to pay and nice and you have to pay right now and I went really\nA yet and we'll take a will take out a check over the phone I Will certainly take a credit card and my favorite one is we'll take a ... card or apple cart that's my absolute favorite because you know the government takes apple cart apple to or I chose anyway\n[laughter] excuse me show what I did is\nI said really a IRS when he goes absolutely go once you give me the number of lean because what are you talking about I said there's no such thing as an Irish document that you're holding onto it doesn't have a\nFinal number on it so why don't you give me the final number oh we're not allowed to do that really and so\nI just had a ball with this guy and of course hung up on him and I hate the fact that he called me the bottom line when everybody ever make that kind of a a a threat you just hang up on him and he's going to a place\nRight after you get your time\nOkay All right yeah it's just what robocalls we're not just read that fully half of the calls that you weren't going to get are now going to be robo calls that are now out there it's gotten to that crazy in my case it will be virtually all of the calls because no one ever calls\nI just I don't get people to call me because I don't call them and it's just whole thing about how I hate people may have me and so it's virtually a hundred percent and they're getting so good I got a call the other day and I were talking about robocalls side I mean it was I was stunned\n'cause I I you know if you\nYou can easily tell what a robocall is if you even begin to look\nAt it and thinking you're in your mind normally where you think is is is going is this a robocall once you even asked that question you understand that it is so I got a call and it was one of those I knew my name\nIs Mr handle and this is a call\nMr handle and no one was on the other end except some computer\nAmish are handled my name is whatever for a collection agency and then our hero clunkers you go and the woman says oh excuse me I just dropped my had peace sorry about that uh oh here we go I have my hippies back on again it was a robocall they got me they got\nMe I did not know for the next ten Fifteen seconds until I said hello hello and they now have programs where they go she was me I didn't hear you\nAnd then I started screaming you stupid rich and I'm ... by the way that was the least of what I was calling a ... of course they don't have a program to answer that I but it was great fun out robo calls but no the bottom line is if the IRS never makes a phone call\nCollections agencies will and you simply say you stop it you do we do this by mail you're done talking to me they'll call you again and you've heard me say a million times used a magic word harassment\nAlso you can say I've been a which I Love is I'm recording this phone call I just want to let you know you staying on

legal advice where I gladly Joe you you have absolutely no Casey alright\nHenry Iraq welcomed the handling the law Yes sir bill my wife went for a better cure a that's usually where they get pedicures you know is on your feet just wanted to tell you that OK okay\nGo any any way later that night her she got extreme pain into the big toe\n[noise] and I'm\nIn the morning she couldn't even walk so she couldn't go to work [noise] so we went to emergency and the other part of her marijuana but it was in fact\nThe pedicure [noise] so we gave her medication antibiotic straight pay off your feet for the next couple of days so she she got to know could go to work the next day it didn't it didn't and it got worse so we had to go back to the ... the\nPay their mother copayments and then\nThey cut another part of her mail and they said go through your doctor so the next day seeing her doctor to doctor said I Can't do it I mean just send you to pressure work so she was off work for four days\nAccording to the specialist or following week again she missed like six seven days by car we seen the specialist it got worse they had to remove all male and she couldn't go to work again\nSo she roughing myth or two weeks of work because of the one creditor do we have a case\nWell yes you do the problem is there's certainly no lawyer in the world going to pick it up and read\nA missing two weeks of work or because of bad pedicure and you have an infection and they ripped off a nail a I mean that's nothing there\nAnd so what you have is a small claims I don't even know I don't think that the uh small claims I was going to hear small claims a a a matter of effectively a a medical issue negligence too where you were a ... where she was medically hurt you can try\nAnd saying here's what happened uh I've gotten the infection of course if I were the person on the other side of that I find being sued and I run the nails are shopping about eight wasn't me you got the impression that someplace\nElse so I it's one of those than adults\nWhat kind of insurance you think now people have\nA while the other thing that we thought of going back to the show on and and telling them that we're considering to sue and what they make any restitution\nOkay that's fine you can do that although I don't again I don't know how much money you're going to get so here you're damages the the work that was last what two weeks how much how much is your wife went make Henry\nUh she works part time so maybe I don't know maybe a thousand dollars in the last two weeks\nShe works part time and make five hundred bucks a week All right let's go what did she do she worked for a school district\nOkay fair enough so she's not a thousand bucks so there's that and then whatever the co pay is on your insurance there is that\nUh so you can try I can guarantee you that uh the nail salon I don't know what kind of insurance and has a probably it only\nHas liability insurance for the building if someone falls down a and breaks a leg that kind of thing I don't think they have insurance for the other thing but yeah when I Would do is just go there and say hey you know I'm Out a couple of thousand dollars here and when you want to do you want me to to you and see what they say\nI'm assuming that the owner is Vietnamese right now I Want a shocker a Vietnamese nail salon especially here in Southern California\nI shouldn't they carry insurance for\nYeah I Would think so and although I don't even know what kind of ... what kind of liability insurance you have for nails\nI'm ... yeah they sure but so what assuming I'm willing to bet they don't Henry\nOkay so you're I think your ideas as good as any show up there and say I'm going to sue you maybe it'll give it to you in trade you got three thousand dollars worth of pedicures there's a lot of pedicures you know that a lot of pedicures\nJerry Jerry welcome to handle on the law\nOut there I'm going through a divorce oh I'm I'm Still waiting for the first court great but we can go to court for the mediator\nNow so why attorney and me a letter wanted me to go to their office and they want me to bring in my national record I kept her up and they want me to answer the question under oh I like the position I obligated to go\nThere yes if you're ... you're obligated to go to a deposition and uh you have to bring a lawyer Jerry you can't do this on your own\nBut I I don't I don't like the United states is over with\nYeah so far request said you know what you have not been mandated to a desk or a deposition yet\nBecause it's just a letter saying we'd like to pose you okay ah no I mean they have to actually eat uh send you a legal document saying we are going to be deposed back and forth that's the way I understand it I don't do a divorce law but I don't think it's just by letter\nI because you know you say no now the court could order it but again it has to be a court order it has to be under a the guise of a court order in other words has to be a legal document which letter is not Jerry\n... and it came from or a hurting\nDie you know yeah but it's just a letter\nBut I'm thinking well I'm Sorry\nI'm not going to do not have to let us not if it's just a letter you're obligated you when you but you need a ... year but they're going to do those huge I mean they're going to depose you and I'm\nNot the
