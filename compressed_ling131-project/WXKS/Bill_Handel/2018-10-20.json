doubt there but let me tell you which way the law goes on this even if you can prove discrimination and your boss can prove there was any other reason uh in addition to that ... that firing flies also eliminating the position completely gives them a lot\nOf a just a tremendous amount of power for example I Know the company\nThat had a and it's a company that is that it's in the spotlight I mean people know about this company\nAnd there was an issue uh\nAn African American who was working there and I was and it was very obvious that this is the one African American that was their out of two

you can fire someone for any reason\nLet's say you're employed and you're the best one in the division by far proof here is a you know what I learned when a fire you today I'm your boss or just don't

times\nThey never called back where it got a chance to talk I was holding trying to get a supervisor the board of directors or wanting to try to go to one of their meeting but when they put out flyers saying when a meeting with the but they never put down the time\nSo I didn't know was eight o'clock in the morning or eight o'clock at night when it hit that put the window when\n...\n... they said the CDC in ours um rent we were having a window precursor to zero outlying [noise] so but I went to the board meeting got very very nasty personal a wiki away yet maybe in Rio back [laughter] um [noise] so that's where I Am [laughter]\nAll right and what are they are they finding new now or is it just screaming at you\nKnow the finding me a hundred dollars a month or so of course makes

windows in in those locations\n[noise] not dying\nAlright so this is new well I it's\n... they have the right to say no or are they have the right to say if you put one in ... that in violation of the CBC in ours or they can say ...\nAnd you take it out until you are an getting here's your fine and uh we're gonna keep on charging however they made it untenable for you to on the other side is that you wanted to put it in ... they made it impossible for you to even\nUh even make an application and there it is in there and that by the way there's the court case\nOkay uh you have to ... ... what I Would do is have a conversation with the attorney that represents the board every every board of directors a H every actually has an attorney who represents a that represents them and have a conversation and say hey you know the board made it impossible to management company when you call me back\nDo it but it was but it has nothing to do with you the problem is you're probably you're probably going to need a lawyer\nOr to get you out of it it will be dismissed I mean there's no question you're you don't have liability here\nAre based on what you said because you didn't know oh you're innocent he just came out and do this you don't know what he paid for which credit card you have no idea now they brought in the company but it's a superior court action or you know at this point I I Would contact a lawyer\nOr that's representing the or the company that's suing and and just and send them a letter first of all say he was going on and just say hey I I had nothing to do with this\nNothing and lay it out\nAnd just say I I really appreciate if you were dismissed this because I shouldn't be a defendant right it's one of those where you will win but you have to go to court dismissed and if the lawyer actually gives a damn interviews you as an instant is an innocent party here\nAnd you truly are\nThen there should be a dismissal just because he's a decent\nGuy right sometimes not but that's worth a shot just trying to do I know there's\nNot going to go there's nothing to counter sue nothing to counter to on a because even if you are not liable I in the end there is not a frivolous lawsuit or he did work on your house the allegation if you were caught up in this is legit it's a legitimate allegation and may not be true\nBut it is an allegation is not as if he just grab your neighbor and started suing your neighbor and there's no connection so but you do not counters too but at first I just asked to get out of the damn thing and then and then you probably have to be a lawyer especially if it's an enormous amount of money\nOkay well I watch it then I write in a ... the attorney but I also have to file every bond\nYes you do yes you do ... days you have to follow the response and you need some help with that or be out of\nThat that that would attorney I could just you might\nYou can do that yourself you write well actually I go to a

is almost to the store\nOr it's lovely okay so what's your question\nThough his response of uh my original Dennis response is is just one of those things that happen\nAround now does that first of all I don't even understand why a dentist would push for a bridge today when they're dental implant ...\nI mean all you have to do I have a bad do you put it in a dental implant so you don't have to do a bridge which I mean I have a bridge but it was put in the decades ago before implants where you've been around so I I have no choice or by I mean the guy is from what you said this is pure malpractice\nNow you need a you have to go to another Dennis it'll say yeah this is crazy and then as soon as that happens or you get to take them for malpractice problem is how much is dental malpractice works\nUh but now you start going and doing all kinds of research first\nStep get another Dennis get a second opinion to say this is crazy this is not just one of those things that happened this is malpractice on its face and then you go from there and then you start talking to medical malpractice people are and there's plenty to specialize in dental malpractice\nAnd I'm not really interested in doing\nWell you can get a job right now and get it straightened out and send them a bill I mean you can assume anyway and if it's under ten thousand dollars or you go ahead and

want with it but uh I'm done and\nAnd could go back to the state somehow\nTheoretically they could but uh they're not going to they're not going to sue ... they're not going to sue the state or its they're going to walk away from it\nSuch a thank you very much\nOkay yeah I mean I mean could they go after the state of course for breach of contract or do you say does the money but then it gets interesting because I I guess theoretically the trustee would have to negotiate\nWith the time share company to pay it off and get a get rid of it because you've got the time share company could sue the estate because he still owes the money dead or not and\nUh but that would stop or the estate from being distributed\nBecause there has to be enough money put into that\nTo cover the cost of a the time share I mean it becomes a mess so timeshare companies normally just walk away or that said you try to get him to walk away anyway but I mean the bottom line is you're crazy to get into a timeshare\nThat's for starters especially now with tied shares cars are no longer you know on her own the property it used to be you'd say you at a time share you buy one week writer two weeks or you would own two parts to let's say one fifty seconds\nOf the property there already is there is a deed you own property\nNow they just give you points you all nothing what you own is a contract in perpetuity\nWhere they have the right to raise maintenance fees every year every three years or whatever the contract says forever\n\nAnd inevitably does anybody actually use time shares once in awhile I run across someone that yeah loves the time share and yet thought it was the greatest deal but that's one out of all\nFifty maybe All right any any going on over ... sure\nUm my wife and I owe broke our ... our landlord lived in um New York long story short ... hundred dollar of aren't very the bond it because I'm an older when done one of my little local decided to leave 'em\nMouthwash bottle on the counter and uh apparently lab or what they call a chemical burn a little ring from the mouthwash bottle\nUm um my my my argument is you know they're the ... bought on the counter that left a little ring there you know our that our that our fault\nYeah you what's your what's your argument that's wear and tear effectively\nThat's where Paris and under what an outside the use of the dollar the counter was in order to Melbourne yeah okay fair enough so what's your question Mike was keeping Fifteen hundred dollar kind of running down All right what's your question um how do I get my cookie or a book that you are doing the right to\nIt yeah I think so based on what you said because if he's the one that put it in a counter that if ah it it's\nNot susceptible or it is susceptible to a ring around the counter 'em up based on mouthwash I mean you you're the one that just described it perfectly hey what do you expect there won't be a bottle of mouthwash\nOn the counter what ... what did you expect you're the one that put in the wrong material\nAnd are there are a yeah I don't know if you know this but if you go to one of the marvel yards these rock ... yards or counter a manufactures but encounters there is specifically a anti mouthwash counters that you know that\nNo no I didn't hear their end there weren't is anti mouthwash counters\nI just made that up so [laughter] uh\nSo it seems to me that the argument is normal wear and tear the tenant is never responsible for normal wearing chair and you're going to argue that what you did just put a bounce watch a bottle in their shots like everybody else does and that's your problem and you're still in the small claims court for the Fifteen hundred dollars not that complicated and if I'm a judge I'm going to give it to you\nVery good aren't trying yeah\nNow do you think it'd be easier to go after him or to go after the mop watch company\nOh please ... ... you\nWant to go after Proctor and gamble okay do me a paper and the dinner mouthwash is so acidic it goes through counters and see what their lawyers are going to say\nI realized how stupid that's out of\nWhat actually well you're absolutely right I
