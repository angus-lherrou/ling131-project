the morning she couldn't even walk so she couldn't go to work [noise] so we went to emergency and they have to cook part of her male off credit was infected\nWith a pedicure [noise] so\nWe gave her medication antibiotics pay pay off your feet for the next couple of days so she she got to know could go to work the next day it didn't it didn't ... it got worse so we had to go back to the ... the pay there are other\nCo payment and uh\nThen they cut another part of her mail and they said go through your doctor show the next day so you know her doctor to doctor said I Can't do it our need to send you to Russia where so she was off work for four days\nInto the specialist over following week again she missed like six seven days by a car we seen this pressure it got worse they had to remove all now\nAnd she couldn't go to work again so she roughly ... ah two weeks of work because of the one creditor do we advocate\nWell yes you do the problem is there's certainly no lawyer in the world's going to pick it up and read\nA missing two weeks of work or because of bad pedicure and you have an infection and they ripped off a nail a I mean that's nothing there\nAnd so what you have is a small claims I don't even know I don't think that the uh small claims that he's going to hear a small claims a a a matter of effectively a a medical issue negligence too where you were a method where she was medically hurt you can try\nAnd saying here's what happened uh I've gotten the infection of course if I were the person on the other side of that I find being sued and I run the nails will a shopping negotiate wasn't me that the infection someplace\nElse so I it's one of those than also what kind of insurance you think now people have\nA while the other thing that we thought of of of going back to the salon and and telling them that we're considering to sue and what they make any restitution okay that's fine you can do that\nAlthough I don't again I don't know how much money you're going to get so here you're damages the the work that was last what two weeks how much how much is your wife went make Henry\nUh she works part time so maybe I don't know maybe a thousand dollars in the last two weeks\nShe works part time and make five hundred bucks a week All right that's what does she do she works for a school district\nOkay fair enough so ah she's not a thousand bucks so there's that and then whatever the co pay is on your insurance there is that\nUh so you can try I can guarantee you that the nail salon I don't know what kind of insurance and has a probably it only has liability insurance for the building if someone falls down I Am breaks a leg that kind of thing I don't think they have\nSure thing but yeah what we do is just go there and say hey you know I'm Out a couple of thousand dollars here and when you want to do you want me to to you and see what they say I'm assuming that the owner is Vietnamese right now I Want a shocker a Vietnamese nail salon especially here in Southern California I\nShoot they carry insurance for\nYeah I Would think so and although I don't even know what kind of mean ... what kind of liability insurance you have for nails\nI'm ... yeah they sure but so what assuming I'm willing to bet they don't Henry okay so you're I think your ideas as good as any\nShow up there and say I'm going to sue you maybe we'll give it to you in trade you get two thousand dollars worth of a pedicures there's a lot of pedicures you know that a lot of pedicures\nJerry Jerry welcome to handle on the law\nOut there are more

understand it I don't do a divorce law but I don't think it's just by letter\nI because you can always say no now the court could order it but again it has to be a court order it has to be under a the guise of a court order in other words has to be a legal document which letter is not Jerry\n... and it's ... it's it's from her attorney\nDie you know yeah but it's just a letter\nI mean I'm thinking
