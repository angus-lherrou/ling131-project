{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WXKS", "content": "From the Iraq showing Nineteen thousand nine hundred\nOkay way to say I view oh hold on a you a cancellation of debt for Nineteen thousand nine hundred dollars correct so you're you know so you're dealing with the IRS that's you're not dealing with the original credit card company you're dealing with the IRS someone ten Ninety nine you for Nineteen thousand dollars is that correct\nYeah okay so the IRS is now saying you are\nOr you're forgiven this much debt and die and they got a judgment against you correct no they didn't do they sue you or they just wrote it off\nMe a original credit card company\nI owe Fifteen ... did they write it off I don't know if they did ... were you ever sued\nOr no but there was a judgment so\nThat means you were that means you were sued okay All right and so uh you got a judgment against you in a ... it's a little complicated because ah they forgive me ...\nLet me tell you the whole story okay\nFor you you can follow it a little bit better the original that fifty nine hundred I received a judgment the Ira I mean the credit card company after giving up years later\nThe IRS yeah no I understand since the Irish or ten Ninety nine on your behalf because with\nAn ... for the amount that they fed I ah\nYou said Nineteen thousand dollars\nThe original that fifty nine hundred I think are like that they are or at a copy of my credit report showed fifty nine hundred\nAnd it doesn't matter I don't it doesn't matter I don't care that\nReduced the IRS and reduce their mind being filed than nine hundred back the fifty nine hundred I paid the debt off\nSo um where my question is trying the credit card company and white at the debt from fifty nine and Ninety nine do I have a record\nBecause because no because you didn't pay the tax on the Ninety nine you ended up accepting the ten Ninety nine was for the fifty nine hundred dollars that was originally Andy fault the point is there are no they they knew that there are no date but but the reduced to to get you\nKnow not them the Ira is that right but that's the only thing you have is the IRS they already have a judgment they'd given up their collecting on the judgment\nSo a credit card company has no records\nNow it's only been there done that you just done\nEven though the un white the fifty nine hundred ...\nDoes it matter they and they inflated the fifty nine hundred on the ten Ninety nine Ninety not on the judgment they issued a ten Ninety nine for Nineteen thousand you got that reduced to the original fifty nine hundred dollar where are your damages\nOf the question is that the credit card company and ... the original amount\nYes they did four times over yes there is no recourse against them\nOnly because you have not been damaged\nIf you go out and dollars when I send you a bill for a hundred thousand dollars and then you end up paying be two thousand dollars I expect it and I accept that well uh I I've been damaged Ninety eight thousand dollars you know having you paint you sound isn't\nO O\nTalk we went through that over and over and over again I Would have been I Would inflated twenty five thousand dollars\nJust because the patient since you got to take me for an idiot yeah they do I guess people take me for a complete moron bill\nLet me explain how this works I got it let me
