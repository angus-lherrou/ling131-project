and demand that they subpoenaed under oath Rod Rosenstein ... well I don't know why there would be any hesitation\nConsidering that he is up to his eyeballs and everything the firing of combing the

the twenty Fifth Amendment what else do we need to get a subpoena for somebody\nWell hopefully I I Want I Would not encourage giving out anybody's phone number and you're great at holding people

member of Congress feels the heat and understands how important this is\nBut the other part of that is is Gemini or trying to work today uh to\nTo stress the importance of why transparency and and the

handle on law we're going to do for you\n[noise] [noise] Hi I'm I took out a two year warranty contract with the term my company and [noise] and and that was in two thousand six inches of Seventeen I started noticing that my would wish tripping on the corner of my house\nAnd I don't know what they were turned my findings I called the representative that initially treated my own and his tone made for a couple of months I finally called the the main\nOffice and explain to them what was happening and that my front porch where to lose in my own [noise] they ... their representative out\nExterminated again and did another aspects and told me that I now have\nSubterranean termites so he says you can get an extended on the mind you I was still under the contract of the ... but yet seen what what's going on underneath my house and he had written which I didn't notice what repair excluded\nOr what do you mean in a way where you didn't notice say so you didn't read the

they did treat but it said would repair excluded and okay with oh hey\nSo at this point I accepted another imitation from another company to come into and expect said that was in\nJuly now mine chew marches when both termites were treated again the other company findings where I had major infestation of both I contacted the state of California pest control\nAnd they had no record whatsoever it that this company had ever been to my own tree so they told me\nWhy would they why would they have a record of it [noise] because\nWhy would the state of California keep her record of a chore my

I didn't know that okay so every time they treat they have to let the state no we just treated a home here's the address right right by all the news ...\nSo they told me there in violation and that's an internal thing so I ended up filing a complaint with the state of California in the meantime the owner of the company wanted to give me seven hundred and fifty\nLet me you know I was going on forever okay this is taking way too long so the bottom line is there any violation internally\nOr you can sue them for all the damage or based on the damage subsequent to\nThey're coming in and treating and then you can argue that they had not had they had they treated correctly all the additional damage wouldn't have been done I don't think they can defend even based on the fact that they were violation of the law that's probably the violation of that\nUh that ordinance that statute it would be ...\nYou got a small claims to that's it and now when you say you bought an additional warranty was that from the tour my company or or a third provider no from the same\nTurtle okay you're you're you're in pretty good shape a you have to go and you have to go out get another term my

Becker questioned the record in however however what worked up to ... or ... or or prospective employee\nOkay I ... that you're you're saying uh before me asking you to fill out a W to farm where are you going to get on a previous W to form for a previous job\n... previous ... to form a\nFor three months previous jobs you know don't know but that doesn't have the right to do that because effectively what he's doing is asking for your salary and it's against the law to ask what your salary watch it because it's one of his business how much money you earned it the previous\nIn employment\nTono 'cause you you don't have a right to say I need to see your previous W to form doesn't work that was\n... ... ...\nYeah there's a bigger law that says you cannot ask for a how much money someone has made previously\nAdler and don't\nTell you to form a previous W to foreign says exactly that also even if it wasn't a ... just saying you can't do that you say no\nWhat are you doing yeah how about the color underwear I'm wearing a show uh no I don't think uh that show works a John Hi John you're up\nTo eight that hate rent but not on our um they pay you know that either that they\nCan they're claiming that there are no damage to their\nCurrent so you're talking about who you're talking about they moved out right John\nThey are in the heart of memory now okay\nAnd what you're saying is that the damages are going to be greater than this or the rent is greater than security deposit correct\nOr do they have the right to ponder that they\nThey do that all the time All right so what's your question [laughter]\nSo my question I I brought it up to them and they are claiming that Iraq you know what I mean I called and emailed them\nWell okay now what is going on right okay here is here's your your your choices and I'm going to tell you just suck it up and here's why I technically they have to pay you the ranch there's no question about it and the security deposit is a separate issue\nAnd the security deposit is about\nProtecting you from damage\nA particularly protect you from damage or to the property so I assuming that there is no damage or even if there is damage what happens is they are of course thing where you put the security budget towards the last month's rent and you're saying no you can't do that so\nYou have the right to sue them but but you have to offset the amount of money you have a security deposit as against three so\nIt comes to wash so right so what are you gonna do you're going to sue for a wash\nAnd then the issue is if there are damages beyond that then of course you sue them and small claims court\n[laughter] then you then you so then you sue venue so then you have a small claims shoe\nBut other than that no way we had that before but don't they all the money yes but you have to offset so now what\nWhy even bother Steve hello Steve I Want to you\nSir I've yet to you for some reason uh I I've been listening to the

you could've negotiated yourself and you don't think they did much right yeah All right so they have any recourse oh yeah you consume small claims court saying they didn't do anything they just let it lapse and you come away I requested\nDocumentation that\nMe and they will they will soon as you file a lawsuit in small claims that I work for your seven thousand dollars oh trust me they're going to come up with documentation because you're saying they did nothing and they're saying or you don't deserve any money back because we did something in your question is okay let's see it\nAnd if they didn't do anything I mean uh their letters negotiations but if they they did or didn't do as you said I Can't imagine you're not going to get your seven thousand dollars back\nOkay small claims court but yeah the right absolutely why did you get into it turns during the first place because I was an idiot guys very well see I die you beat me to it well said\nMy man identity\n[noise] because you're young lady yes ma'am I'm can you hear me\n[noise] um I had been working for a school district and so Cal for sixteen years um I'm part time actually it's really part time and they've done that for this reason\nI'm getting ready to retire when I have taken 'em days off for being sick and the whole sixteen years generally I think in a few and put 'em on the book the sick days but um mostly I've accumulated I'm thinking that I could\nTreat them at the end either take a pay out or um take time off prior to my retirement in looking into it we're getting ready to retire this year I have over three hundred and twenty five hours accumulated and I can't take any of it\nAnd why can't you take any of it\nAnd they say because I Am part time work less than twenty hours\nOn it so what's your question\nDo I have any recourse at all\nI didn't know if if the policy of the school board\nThe policy in which you hired is that people were under twenty or twenty five hours a week or month whatever it is or not entitled to take their sick pay at the end of it\nUh then there's nothing you can do that's their policy and some school boards some companies allow people to take sick days I police departments for example usually do\nSo uh you got cops that retiring literally a year's worth of sick leave that they pull out early and then there are companies and uh they're our enemies that saying oh for example uh my my company the center for surrogate parenting\nIts use it or lose it same thing uh I work for this radio station it use it or lose it\nAnd they said the only recourse I have is if I had 'cause I'm hard hit by a different um government job was over twenty hours right\nWell I mean whenever the policy is yeah then that could cause it stays with me I got\nYa okay but it's whenever the policy is you have to live within the policy and it is perfectly legal to have a policy that says use it or lose it\nYeah as which I Do and not only do I have it in my company uh but I also live under it\nYeah yeah well yeah you're screwed you know congratulations so there is no case here\nAh you know Nick bill or or um renting their clients and uh they got a new\nProperty management company and so are they all the rules and all that good stuff I'm supposed to find her the part of the complex that we're going to be responsible for climbing bills were found negligent and whatever plumbing issues are\nBuilding kind of notorious for having horrible plumbing ... found that interesting [noise] um\n[noise] if this turns into like a big problem in the future or something I could take a landlord with small claims court about\nMaybe a fight or the first thing you're going to argue is you're not responsible negligent or what does that mean I don't know is it what can you do that would cause the plumbing issue rather than block up a toilet for example or or ah I don't even know other than that\nBlock up a sink or a toilet or what pipes undoing a soldering on ah just unraveling so I don't quite get it and that did you sign the agreement with a new\nCompany know how to find that's too bad and you say no thank you I'm not saying I'm not accepting this\nCloud of leasing agreement or a seem to be a contract or anything it's just like grain to the rules\nAre changing the rules that you say I don't agree to it now if the lord says you're agreeing to it you've agreed to it\nOkay All right and so I don't know if they're asking for individual owners or they are going through the uh the joy board iffy oh I'm Sorry\nOn nature away if they were just gonna apartment complex\nYou say no you say no we're not willing and then they can evict you a ... year in rent control they can and if they uh uh if a a big victory here's the problem though if there is a plumbing issue inside your apartment\nReduced the IRS then reduce their from Nineteen thousand\nNine hundred back the fifty nine hundred I paid the debt off so I'm square my question is since the credit card company employed at the debt from fifty nine at Nineteen nine do I have a record\nYou know because because no because you didn't pay the tax on the Ninety nine you ended up accepting the ten Ninety nine was for the fifty nine hundred dollars it was originally and default the point is there were no they they knew that there are no ... but they reduced to to get you\nKnow not them the Ira is that\nRight but that's the only thing you have is the IRS they already have a judge would they'd given up they're not collecting on the judgment\nSo a credit card company has no records\nNot only it's only or they're doing a statute is done\nEven though the way the fifty nine hundred\nDoes matter lanes they inflated the fifty nine hundred on the ten Ninety nine not not on the judgment they issued a ten Ninety nine for Nineteen thousand you got that reduced to the original fifty nine hundred dollar wherever your damages\nThe question is spent the credit card company and\nPlayed at the original amount yes they did four times over yes there is no recourse against them\nOnly because you have not been damaged\nIf you want me out in dollars when I send you a bill for a hundred thousand dollars and then you end up paying be two thousand dollars I expected and I accept that well uh I'm I've been damaged Ninety eight thousand dollars no habit you paint you sound isn't\nO O\nTalk we went through it over and over and over again I Would have been I Would do to twenty five thousand dollars\nJust 'cause the patients issue good God ... yeah they do I guess people like me

I I get a burglary a bum\nAbout that than each other or whatever like that so uh she clearly I has been devastated there's an emotional issue here\nBut how much is that work is pretty speculative and the jury would have to determine that assuming that it goes to a jury okay or the other issue is the contract that she signed and there it is we're not responsible if someone breaks in ... well she signed it however\nShe well she was buried her son and then the argument is goes wait a minute no one in their right mind they don't know what the hell they're signing\nIt so she didn't have the mental capacity at that time or the emotional capacity to know what you assigning there so I Would argue that right so ah the point is and what isn't worth it that way so the rain is out there ah she'd never going to replace the ring itself\nCorrect uh so I what what its money what would you want\nI think part of it is that I could or twice a week or just look and you know I understand the\nPoint I that no cameras or any kind of I guess really good security and she says I could look at me over the\nHead you know they could but it's a good order showed up are okay you know India if

the cremation\nWhat does this day that I was probably the longest probably king you know\nYeah it's probably the county ah it's not the state doesn't remade the county does All right so yeah I Know your brother is not responsible just someone is trying to get\nSome money that's all and it's just yeah it's a crock a you're not responsible for anybody's funeral expenses at all ever unless it as a child or unless it is a I think where you have ordered it and say okay I'm taking the body out\nBut the ... no not not not after that All right Jennifer Hi Jennifer well yes well\nWe uh we feel like someone who has the power of attorney or a family member\nIt but the thing that family member I man says they're not using her money for themselves and how'd you how'd you how'd you know that\nBecause
