the law marginal legal advice Mike Mike you're up welcome to handling the long run Yes sir I'm trying to\nFigure out how to get someone to live up to the other false advertising\n[laughter] yeah good luck alright I switch Kelly what happened\n[noise] um I had a car that I bought from a dealership and it two years in the middle east they sent me a a written a letter and also emails wanting to buy my car back and they said they'd give me up to a hundred and ten percent of the appraised value my car no matter if I bought there or not\nAnd then when I went in front of them on it and they appraise the car and we out of the hundred ten percent of the car was an excellent condition\n... we'll give you the deal and will give you a hundred percent but you've got about what our cars but in their printed advertising and my emails especially especially [noise] definitely says this away rates that are paired up are you up to a hundred percent of current market value for your vehicle [noise]\nIn fact we're so interested that we will buy your vehicle back even if you don't buy our\nShowcase so now the issue is the value and you you got him on that All right there's no question that this is what they said ah they're out is up to a hundred and ten percent that's for one or one aspect and connected to that is\nWhat is the value of the car or that they're saying it's not that much or they say they're just not ... not buying the car back no matter what\nIt is in their ... by the ... say they did the appraisal on the car so I went ahead it appraised by car ... and then I came to them and they were the original ... deals to show me the car two years early\nRight in are they not recognizing the ... the appraisal or they're just saying we don't care\nWhat Rachel came higher than ... oh my God okay so\nSo so they put they put it up to me and brought it up to me and then and then I said well what about a hundred percent and the guy will I don't know nothing about that she brought the manager out I gave him the document and email\nAnd he goes okay we'll get we'll give you a hundred percent because your card I mean you're a carpet showing initially it was ten thousand miles under ... should have been particularly on at least that time\nAnd he goes it will give you the deal that but you need to buy one our cars and I and I go out to highlight it and I think I'd go but it says you're by my count them at about five years or not and he says well ... and they they just stumbled on themselves\nAnd get mad or anything yeah okay let me let me ask\nThis uh and that is a why wouldn't you buy one of their cars or just in I understand there are a bunch of jerks but if they're willing to give you a hundred and ten per ... percent legitimately and they give you a reasonable deal on one of their cars why wouldn't you jump on it or even though they're much lying scum\nOkay I bought two new cars within a week of each other when I bought my Chrysler I bought one from across the street from a ... a dealership from them out of that in my truck I drive thirty five thousand dollars a year in my car sits on the garage so I'm sitting there going you know I'm spending over five hundred\nOr you then are you are so are you not going to buy a car then you're just not interested in buying a car period I Would just try to get out of the week\nOkay uh and they offered that yeah they're going to buy your car back uh and and they're releasing it\nToo right yeah yeah they're listening to you yeah yeah\nI'm just trying to think they are in breach just one of the damages a and that\nWe're I figured out the death because it's been a year and I've gone through\nAll right no I got it okay I have a a you could sell the car or to anybody else at or whatever the value is and the difference is they're responsible for the ten percent okay\nWell the problem was with a hundred and ten percent I Would only had to chop up three hundred bucks on I've been out of the least at that point I couldn't sell it for what that hundred ten percent would have been\nWithout you know picking up here [laughter] so I've kept the car and I just put it in on the lease so uh what I mean we only on the hook for just is eleven payments and car insurance and vehicle registration which is comes to fifty six hundred dollars\nAnd they would have been to like ... and they were going to let you out of that and you're but you're not going to replace the car correct right\nOh okay ah but you [noise] wow yeah I'm just trying to think of a of a clever way of doing this without hiring a lawyer that's the problem I mean what's the damages are and how you figure out\nA God ... or the difference is we can try figuring out the damages in small claims court but the problem is going to be that you're on the hook for uh the lease you have to say I wasn't going to buy another car\nAnd the judge is going to say really uh therefore but you could have and you didn't have to and you turned it in and you took the deal\nAre saying they'll pay you a hundred and ten percent\nI so it's a little bit complicated but whatever your damages are uh you can try to take it to small claims court I but that's the only way to go I can think of and just trying to figure out your damages and frankly as I was going through the entire scenario and uh the formula I didn't understand it worth it so ah that works out now isn't it\nThe ... when it comes to math beyond like fifty plus fifty or a hundred divided by two I have a hard time see how that works Jamie Hi Tammy\nYes good morning yes ma'am\nMy question is I Am one of four owners ... on a property and I have them pay the property taxes for several years I have a recourse can I put a link\nThat property you already on the property you're one of four owners nope when you get what you can do as soon as the other ones for their pro radish share\nOkay\nThat's it how much and so in terms of taxes when you see several years all over the course of those years
