when I asked a bath [noise] so I called the management company about Fifteen times they never called back when I got a chance to talk I was holding trying to get a supervisor the board of directors are going to try to go to one of their meeting\nBut and they put out flyers saying when the meeting would be but they never put out of the time\nSo I didn't know who is eight o'clock in the morning or eight o'clock at night [noise] so what I heard that clip the window when ...\n... they said the CDC in ours um rent we were having a window precursor to zero outlying [noise] so but I went to the board meeting got very very nasty personal a wiki yelling at me and I go back [laughter]\nUm so that's where I Am [laughter]\nAll right and what are they are they finding new now or is it just screaming at you\nKnow finding me a hundred dollars a month or ... or your costs Seventy five\nAnd they expect you to take the window out I'm assuming\nThat demanding I'd take the window out or else they would keep finding\nAlright has anybody else in the building up put windows in in those locations\n[noise] not that you know alright so this is new well I it's\n... they have the right to say no or a they have the right to say if you put one in ... that in violation of the CBC in ours or they can say ...\nAnd you take it out until you are an getting here's your fine and uh we're gonna keep on charging however they made it untenable for you to on the other side is that you wanted to put it in ... they made it impossible for you to even\nUh even make an application and there it is in there and that by the way that there's the court case\nOkay uh you have to ... ... what I Would do is have a conversation with the attorney that represents the board every every board of directors a H every actually has an attorney who represents a that represents them and have a conversation and say hey you know the board made it impossible the management company when you call me back\nAre based on what you said because you didn't know who you're innocent he just came out and do this you don't know what he paid for which credit cards you have no idea now they brought in the company but it's a superior court action or you know at this point I I Would contact a lawyer\nOr that's representing the company that's suing and and just and send them a letter first of all say he was going on and just say hey I I had nothing to do with this\nNothing and lay it out and just say I I really appreciate if you were dismissed this because I shouldn't be a defendant\nRight it's one of those where you will win but you have to go to court to dismiss ... lawyer actually gives a damn interviews you as an instant is an innocent party here and you truly are then there should be a dismissal just because he's a decent\nGuy right sometimes not but that's worth a shot just trying to do I know there's not going to\nGo there's nothing to counter to nothing to counter to on a because even if you are not liable I in the end there is not a frivolous lawsuit I he did work on your house the allegation if you were caught up in this is legit it's a legitimate allegation I may not be true\nBut it is an allegation it's not as if he just grab your neighbor and started suing your neighbor and there's no connection so but you do not counters too but at first I just asked to get out of the damn thing and then and then you probably get your lawyer especially if it's an enormous amount of money\nOkay well I watch it then I write in a alerts the attorney but I also have to file every bond\nYes you do yes

preparation for bridge is you're going down the to write\nTo cheat on each side yes I have one that I've\nBeen in excruciating pain for three and a half weeks he thought it was settled down it didn't I've been on I'd be ... eight hundred milligrams you know twenty four hours a day for almost a month now and sent me to an end to on this\nYesterday and uh he says that I'm going to need to root canal grounded to jump too much for the pope is almost to the store\nOr that's lovely okay so what's your question\nSo his response as a my original Dennis responses is just one of those things happen\nYou know know first of all I don't even understand why dentist would push for a bridge today with their dental implant\nI mean all you have to do I have a bad do you put it in a dental implant so you don't\nTo do a bridge which I mean I have a bridge but it was put in decades ago before implants where you've been around so I I have no choice but I mean the guy is from what you said this is pure malpractice\nNow you need a you have to go to another Dennis it'll say yeah this is crazy and then as soon as that happens or you get to take them for malpractice problem is how much his dental malpractice works\nUh but now you start going and doing all kinds of research first step get another Dennis get a second opinion to say this is crazy this is not just one of those things that happened this is malpractice on its face and then you go from there and then you start talking to\nMedical malpractice people are in there's plenty to specialize in dental malpractice\nAnd I'm not really interested in doing\nYour fingers right now than get it straightened out and send them a bill I mean you can assume anyway and if it's under ten thousand dollars or you go ahead and there was no

that's a liability\nGotcha that that's what it is so no you can just simply say uh you know whoever the trustee is say please do not transfer the property to my name I have no interest in being an

I I think it's too easy to argue you're a liar on this one mark because you don't have to have the ... not that you are\nOkay I'm not at all to saying you're a liar although you do sound like one a but it's just it's just too easy to uh attack you on this one so are you defeat you obviously you jolly collection easy to go pounds ... pounds sand on this one tell them just to you and then you have to defend yourself it'll be a small claims soup probably\nAnd then you have to worry about your credit being being John ... even a disputed has your credit already been attacked\nRight yeah\nIt probably will our credit yeah probably will you gonna mess on your hands and there's no there's no good way out of this\nWhat my friend I mean the money to settle it\nWell then maybe you want to pay the other hand it was just negotiate with them negotiate say ... I'll give you half the money now\nI have and but the thing is I I mean at the money more than anybody I'd rather give him the money or\nCurrent well then you negotiate it on a payment you tell them to go pound sand or you look at your credit you got your choices none of them very good unfortunately I'm not a good place to me sometimes and I often\nSay this is a everybody looks to the law as an answer and quite often the laws very sloppy that it's not very clean ah for example what's what's clean about the ... have you committed a crime yes or no right it's\nVery clean the jury determines yes or the judge determined here's a statute\nYes thirty five miles per hour is law you went thirty six or thirty seven boom you violated see that's clean stuff I loaned you a thousand dollars you don't pay me there it is now dogs barking next door because they're too loud\nAnd I want a restraining order what does that mean what is too loud it's just a sloppy\nWay of of dealing with things and this is one of those where the ... answer this is just there's nothing clean about it there really isn't so all I can say is I'm Glad it's him and glad it's not\nMe there you go silver lining every moment okay\nOr Alexander Hi Alexander\nAir gifts or what can I Do for you\nOr I had a debt owed to a credit card company fifty nine hundred dollars or judgment was ... years later that judgment disappeared and I received a cat's always shut up that from the rats showing Nineteen thousand nine hundred\nOkay when I say I view oh hold on are you a cancellation\nOf debt for Nineteen thousand nine hundred dollars correct so you're so you're dealing with the IRS that's you're not dealing with the original credit card company you're dealing with the IRS someone ten Ninety nine you for Nineteen thousand dollars is that correct\nYeah okay so the IRS is now saying you are or you're forgiven this much\nDebt and die and they got a judgment against you correct no they didn't they sue you or they just wrote it off\nA original credit card company\nI owe Fifteen ... did they write it off I don't know if they did ... were you ever sued or no but there was a judgment so that means you were that means you were sued okay All right\nAnd so uh you got a judgment against you in a ... it's a little complicated because ah they forgiveness of deadly\nLet me tell you the whole story okay if you can follow it a little bit better the original that fifty nine hundred I received a judgment the Ira I mean the credit card company after giving up years later the IRS\nYeah no I understand the IRS a ten Ninety nine on your behalf because lip\nAnd moved on to the amount that they fed I ah\nYou said Nineteen thousand dollars\nThe original bet fifty nine hundred I think are are they are or at a copy of my credit report showed fifty nine hundred\nAnd it doesn't matter I don't it doesn't matter I don't care that\nReduced the IRS then reduce their from my being filed than nine hundred back the fifty nine hundred I paid the debt off so um where my question is trying the credit card company and white at the debt from fifty nine\nAnd Ninety nine do I have a record\nBecause because no because you didn't pay the tax on the Ninety nine you ended up accepting the ten Ninety nine was for the fifty nine hundred dollars that was originally in default the point is there are no they they are there are no date book but they reduced to to get you\nKnow not them the Ira is\nThat right but that's the only thing you have is the IRS they already have a judgment they'd given up their collecting on the judgment\nSo a credit card company has no record\nNow it's only been there done that you just done\nEven though the un like the fifty nine hundred ...\nDoes it matter they and they inflated the fifty nine hundred on the ten Ninety\nNine\nNot not on the judgment they issued a ten Ninety nine for Nineteen thousand you got that reduced to the original fifty nine hundred dollar where are your damages\nThe question is that the credit card company and the way that the original amount\nYes they did four times over yes there is no recourse against them\nOnly because you have not been damaged\nIf you don't mean to cut out in dollars when I send you a bill for a hundred thousand dollars and then you end up paying be two thousand dollars I expect it and I accept that well uh I I've

was at work and I felt like this on my right side the next day I went to my doctor who immediately sent me to the hospital upon the hot water table walk and sign all ... I was made it into the hospital\nOver the course of the next six days I had a CAT scan ... MRIs\nAnd a spinal tap that they're the six day those doctors not determine what what's wrong with me throughout those six days or can can you were basically paralyzed on the right side of my body after six days this is charged me not knowing what was going literally thing\nTake two Advil call me on for days so we went to go get a second opinion the second doctor said he needed the the ... from the first doctor was also a nurse narrow certainly by the way so we went to go get those are more hours but I I felt like I was having a stroke my right side\nWere slurring or my more to his arm my rights that are based on ... I went to a different hospital [noise]\nWithin two hours they were able to tell me that did not have a stroke that I had to bring a cancerous brain tumor\nImmediately started doing work I had a biopsy they told me I was diagnosed with the question is if I could have gotten out earlier that tumor or not to put pressure on my brain I Would not have been a Sable\nI'm OK not so am I okay I got it uh so let me throw some questions that you uh during the course of those six days had the doctors a discovery or that you had this brain tumor\nOh I'm Sorry\nI yeah I Know the doctors and not discover it but they're so over six days to the brain tumor grow and cause\nPressure Yes sir over six days the tumor grew Yes sir and how do you know\nBecause I ... I was able to walk into the hospital so I'm I'm a walk normally ... six days later that was put in such pressure on my brain dark and there was on my brain down mhm that I could not walk I could\nNot pay and I was moving I'm assuming well my guess is ah you left your ah neurosurgery ... surgery residency a little bit earlier so you weren't you didn't get board\nCertified um do you have a doctor that will say two things number one I had they taken out the tumor six days before I you would never have had these problems and you would be fine you wouldn't had slurring you wouldn't matter problem there wouldn't be pressure\nI don't know why I'm calling you I mean I talk to my\n... well being in colleges it'll be a it'll be a neurosurgeon who's ... going to make that call and you're gonna have to have that doctors say that and willing to testify to that so that's one issue how let's say the second issue I any permanent brain damage any permanent injury neurological injury\nNot that I Know it's\nOkay so what you have is you hear your damages six days of slurring and six days of ... walking around or not walking around thinking you had a stroke okay what what does that work six days of that what do you say\nI was not able to work\nI mean you must do you miss six days at work I understand there's some damage as they are not arguing that aren't damages I'm what I'm saying is what do you think that's worth\nI honestly have no\nIdea I don't either so I I I think even though there could very well have been malpractice I\nEat then there may be an argument that there wasn't we looked and or a doctor could have easily miss that I that's the other defense that uh the first group of doctors said but you're making a lot of medical assumptions here\nThat ah you I don't have the legal right to make that you're going to need some very heavy duty second opinions and it's going to get very wonky and very technical and you can bet the insurance company is going to defend this thing like crazy\nAnd you're going to need a top notch medical malpractice surgeon\nWho's payoff will be six days\nOf you walking around like you were slurring and losing six days of work you see the problem\nRight but that's continued to this day\nThat's what I asked is do you have any long term problem as as a result of what happens and having missed the tumor for six days is that was caused the long term problems\nYeah okay and you know that for a fact\nDoctors have told you that yes I mean I'm Still going through chemotherapy I'm not arguing that you would have gone through chemotherapy anyway correct All right\nSo six days is all the difference in the world you'd be jumping you'd be doing a judge jumping jacks she'd be flying around and you'd be fine if they had discovered the tumor six days before\nYeah okay I Believe so I well doctor\nAnd a ... where where was your residency in neurosurgery let's go sue because we have to put you on the stand and uh we have to uh absolutely a
