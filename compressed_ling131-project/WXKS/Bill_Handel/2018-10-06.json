America because of the next\nOh you have to extend your rental car because of the accident that you that you had this being taken care of okay so All right now what\nSo my question is the part of my insurance is paying for this young thirty there\nHi okay well then that's your insurance yeah the other party should be responsible for anything reasonable your damages or your damages\nAnd there is a and if the damages run that you'd eat forty five days for example to repair your car they just pay for it but that's what happened to me I'll get my car had to effectively be replaced and since it's a beamer three quarters of the parties had to come in from Germany on a ship\nAnd so it was almost two and a half months in do you know the other side just cough it up now I had to pay for and I put it on my credit card after thirty days I don't want to do that I don't think you have a choice I don't think you have a choice because the other side is going to send the check out until the repairs finished\nWhat my question is like pushing white cat my prior to compare how well being just like what am I ... well\nBecause you're the party you know because they have because they have nothing to do with the file a lean why the other it's do they have nothing to do the other insurance company that's paying you\nHad nothing to do with your insurance company not aware of what's happening is that your insurance company is fronting the money and the other side is going to pay and by the way your contract with the ... companies that will front the money up to thirty days\nRight right yeah so now there is no place you can go\nBut the good days so you have to write a check or put it on your credit card but the good news is or the other side will pay for it if it's reasonable as I got two and a half months to repair my car uh yeah it took that long and then uh I think with State Farm insurance which the other drivers are insurance companies they didn't quibble\nDidn't quibble I mean there are adjuster went out saw what was going on understood and just wrote the check\nAnd let me tell you it was not cheap ah repairing a a beamer\nWhich is why I'm probably going to give up my neighbor ah

wrote a contract they gave me ten thousand dollars down\nMaybe the balance you know within thirty days or you lose your deposit he wanted to verify that I had the right to kill my interest because it was like a four Plex and a strip mall\nOkay and and uh he called the owner which he should have done the owners say oh no you can't tell you this is the answer is I own the property\nYou know get to me on hold on hold on that's that's a bunch of BS you can't sell your interests to someone else is there I you have a lease correct\nYes you're right and it is there anything in the least that gives the owner of the property the right to deny new owners from coming in for example they have to well\nThey have to okay you know then you're fine then this guy's crazy then if he went in and lock the door okay then I couldn't get out oh man do you have a lawsuit against these people are all but\nI I called the cops when they said it was beautiful it couldn't do anything\nYeah it is going to cut costs won't do anything ... this this is a civil matter uh you needed a ... ...\n... my dilemma built this was in two thousand and fourteen when they lock me out\nHow long were you how long how long were you locked out ... sandals to someone else so and so who who sold who owns the restaurant now\nThe owner lives in Nevada you your own\nHe pretty I understand but who owns the restaurant\nSome

should should have gotten a lawyer the minute you were locked out the minute he said no\nThat moment in the late no I don't think so uh\nSo I mean there's going to be some argument as to uh you wave your rights you should have come in sooner so it's going to be the the issue is going to be damages a and you're going to argue two years' worth of loss of income and then it's a I I don't understand

damages than right she was seven hundred and fifty dollar check let me tell you people normally do they use that deposit towards their last month's rent\nAnd even though technically uh the landlord can force you to pay the rent\nThe the problem is that he has to offset the seven hundred and fifty dollars that he has so it really becomes a wash and so just see what happens try or just call him and just tell a landlord cannot use\nThe uh the deposit towards the last month's rent and if the places and reasonable shape you should be OK depending on what a bastard a landlord has arisen\nAlright

would probably work for all of it do they have a duty to\n... to raise or to lower services I don't think so and so I Would argue all we have to do is make reasonable accommodations\nLike a box or a step ladder for him to step on and then running back and forth so he's not going to be able to run back and forth but here's the course we did what we could unless the law says they absolutely have to accommodate\nAnybody with da da\nDa da to this college I don't know if it's public college probably not and for example public schools here are people who have disabilities or they have to be accommodated for example the kids in a wheelchair or the school\nGoing to put ramps in and it gets pretty pricey so um we're um\nI I Can't wait for this one I really can't\nBut my favorite my favorite

a phone calls\nAnd okay Gus oh no I'm a Mars yeah let's do that hello Mars yeah\nHi uh my parents have attract like about a million dollars that's good news thanks yeah [laughter] that's what I'm looking out for my money my grandmother and my ... my grandmother now think about it at home so they want to put me and my brother on at the ...\nWho was that what your parents and they're still alive yeah\nOK and it so I'm assuming it's a remarkable trust your normal everyday trust that they can change things around correct\nYeah OK while they're doing their they cover lawyers that my grandmother's home and a lawyer said that you know if you have if they ever have to go through the home that the government because they have so much money you're comeback she's getting paid for it because she's on Medicare they're saying that the government could come and try and take the money\nNo unless she is she a bent is a Shia beneficiary of uh the ... of the narrowest\nVeterans with regards to my parents if something were to happen to my parents and they were going to go home ... ... yeah let's say that they can do some type of paperwork that can stop that from happening\nI Would be there or if it would be in your vocal trust\nWhere you're [laughter]\nWhere are your parents no longer have any control at all to trust is set up and then it's over that's done they just don't own it which means that they don't have assets for the government to grab but because they do go on I think not Medicare uh and I you know I don't know what the rules of Medicare but they're not going to let you go on the government Dole\nAnd pay for for example a home\nOr to live for folks living with a million dollars in the bank that's just not going to happen now with it [laughter] oh yeah well you say that's going to cost Fifteen thousand dollars to do that to what to change it to make a a a ... trust\nThat make it so that they didn't give me the name but I Know that's great anybody's charge Fifteen thousand or so that is crazy\nYou know what yeah you'd be crazy for that time to find yeah go trying to find another way are okay you got from on your website ah yeah you got tons of them handling ... trust in a state lawyers times they're not going to charge Fifteen thousand dollars and if they do I'm getting twelve thousand of that\nThat's why I'm looking out for my money\nGood for you good for you ... a little stiff basically taking a trust and making any irrevocably trust a that's not a very big deal at all\nHas to be high asked me how you doing yeah yes ma'am what can I Do for you\nKill part question for you I keep it short I am looking to move and um I guess the new thing now is my cats after paying rent also monthly\nWaves are you may want to wait like your cats have to pay rent monthly they want\nTo charge 'em you know there's a deposit\nOh yeah of course yes I Know plus the thirty five a ... thirty five per cat forty five ... dog car I'm not an okay\nUm my question is my cats are certified servers animals now I'm In I'm embarrassed to say well get into that but the animal ... um [noise] I can I waive the\nOther side that's a good question and work yeah well you're not going to be able to pull it off with two cats I promise you that\nEven if I got the paper ah yeah yeah well what if you have five cats and they're all service animals or are you probably could get away with one\nEye and I'm sure you're stuck and then I don't know if they can still charge you a for the cats are ... you know yeah that I don't know I don't know if I bought\nFor you arguing the service animal business then are you um\nYou would have no chance they can charge whatever the hell they want pet fees you can charge extra so like the bottom line is that you for one service animal and ... it's now this is this an emotional service animal or is it a is it a an emotional support or is it a straight out service animal\nAh no no respect for the most and all\nThe time oh yeah because they are very few seeing eye cats don't they\nRight [laughter] yeah yeah yeah they're not that\nNow I understand right I Want someone when she asked me about a seeing eye chicken\nAnd it wasn't a wasn't the same I should probably not\nSo the quick answer is\nI have no idea if a money can be charged but if it I Can't it would be under the circumstances and therein lies where the rules are changing rather dramatically because there's a big difference we know train service animal in this emotional support crap\nYou know like they do on airlines peacocks and ferrets and whatever
