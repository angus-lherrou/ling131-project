already out spinning a narrative perhaps not quite as clearly as they have or as a and full throated a fashion that they have in the past I think that's mostly because\nThe anti gun anti Second

create more problems the Democratic party right now that's the only reason I think\nYou are honestly not seeing more shrill\nAh anti gun commentary in the media while you're not seeing more people

talk about birthright citizenship then we'll get an all the rest of it\n[noise] Paul Ryan said something today that I thought it was quite interesting being the constitutional scholars ideas and here's what he said about birthright citizenship and the president by the way the president didn't bring it up\nI heard one of the miscreants on on cable say the president brings this stuff up the divide than they first of all he was asked about it he didn't bring it up secondly it's not about dividing the nation it's about upholding the constitution okay\nNobody really knows how birthright citizenship was instituted we've investigated this\nIt started in the sixties bureaucratic like the old ins started doing it that way as the bureaucracy does this all the time there's been no law passed that conveys birthright citizenship on to illegal aliens\nThere's been no Supreme Court decision that definitively confirmed birthright citizenship onto illegal alien children\nNobody's a hundred percent certain how this came to be\n\nBut everybody seems to be a hundred percent certain that the president can't fix it so the executive branch unilaterally somehow somewhere in the bureaucracy decided to interpret this\nAs it's being interpreted today nobody knows exactly who exactly what office but there it is and so when the president is asked\nAbout it and says how did you find out about this yeah we're working on an executive no you can't change the constitution by executive order well does the constitution confer birthright citizenship on the children of illegal aliens\nOf course it doesn't which all explaining a minute but here's\nThe current speaker of the house Paul Ryan who is silent for months\nBut now he feels compelled to speak out go ahead\nWell you obviously cannot do that um you cannot in birthright citizenship with an executive order we didn't\nLike it when Obama tried changing immigration laws the executive action and obviously as conservatives um you know we believe in and and the constitution [noise] you know the conservative I'm a believer in following the plain text of the constitution and I think in this case the fourteenth amendment ... pretty clear [laughter] um and that would involve a very very laying the constitutional process\nThe ignorance on this subject like so many others is unbelievable the speaker

bureaucracy began\nNot even interpreting the constitution Jess conveying citizenship on the children of\nIllegal aliens there's absolutely no historical basis for this there's no constitutional basis for this there's no statutory basis for this\n[noise] my buddy Andy McCarthy wrote a brilliant piece of National Review is they just want to do and he said well the fourteenth amendment has been codified was in Nineteen fifty two I think he said well that doesn't really in my humble opinion address the issue\nCato find the constitution as a way of describing an aspect of the statute is really\nPretty a pretty frequent practice it doesn't really lend anything to the interpretation but we know what the authors of the fourteenth amendment meant because they told us we have no real Supreme Court decision\nAre conveying a citizenship on the children of illegal aliens\nAnd then we have Paul Ryan let's play cuts six again Mr boosts and Paul Ryan saying that you can't change the constitution with an executive order who is changing the constitution it's the executive branch the president of the United states who is the executive branch taking back the authority to interpret and enforce the fourteenth amendment go ahead\nWell you obviously cannot do that you cannot in birthright citizenship with an executive order we didn't [noise] like it when Obama tried changing immigration laws the executive action and obviously\n... who's changing immigration laws you know I brought as a guest\nHere Daniel Harlow which was an expert in this area as he is in many incredibly intelligent he write so very conservative review a and a Daniel Harlow what is Speaker Ryan even talking about\nOh great to be with you mark and first of all condolences on the last year patriot dead he's a he's in a better place thank you\nUm you know this is constitutional it constitutionally illiterate I cannot relate to what these people are saying let's put this in plain English here basically they're saying mark I could break into your home kicked down the door drop a kid there\nAnd hit the right to live there for the remainder of his life and there's not a darn thing you could do about it even henceforth that's what they're basically saying it's nothing to do with the president there arguing we can't even do this through Congress\nOr the reality is\nThat even if we agree to the notion of birthright citizenship that there is a legal mandate a floor requiring\nA Congress and the executive branch to issue a citizenship to any child of any legal immigrant under any circumstance as the court didn't want kids are a very activist decision but let's agree to that\nThere is no way you could extrapolate that to people who came here without consent the key words are consent and sovereignty nothing ever supersede that nobody could unilaterally assert jurisdiction\nAnd uh make it that there's nothing we can do to stop this and I think mark more broadly speaking what the disturbing trend we're seeing is that throughout the last number of decades past administrations have actually use the executive power to subvert sovereignty\nIt looks like Trump is doing a lot of things executive Lee but the details matter and what he's doing is actually pursuing the law and as you mentioned there is nothing in statute requiring this and it all actually happened by accident through laziness and lack of enforcement\nExplain that because people are under the impression including the current speaker of the house who's taken an oath to uphold the constitution and some of these fools on TV who pretend they're experts\nThey seem to think that the fourteenth amendment says what they say it says now were originally this and that includes ... lists and you look at the language as intended as written at the time and they tell us exactly\nWhat they meant and nowhere do they mean affirmatively giving citizenship to children of illegal aliens\nI think this is where some of our colleagues go awry ... doesn't mean Amelia Delia style liberalism right on even if it didn't say and subject to the jurisdiction thereof if it's just that anyone born in the U.S is a citizen I got news for them\nFor a hundred and Thirty years there's an uninterrupted stream of case law including cases written by the one Kim all arc justice Horace Gray saying that if you come here without consent\nAnd you do not have legal status it is in the most literal and physical sense as if you were standing outside of our boundaries in terms of access\nTo the courts in terms of rights in terms of everything so literally you are not on our soil and and that is that a lot so when Congress nearly cut and paste the text of the fourteenth amendment in Nineteen fifty two they could've never fathom such an egregious argument\nThat someone who is in Nineteen fifty to the constitution was not interpreted as giving citizenship to the children of illegal aliens\nExactly it's like saying proved to me that the fourteenth amendment didn't mean to\nMandate gay marriage well I mean no one would have thought that and and and that's the thing here what are the best I could see from my research is that for most of our history we didn't have too many illegal aliens in the early part of the twentieth century it was in the sixties and seventies and eighties it started to grow\nAnd there was never an active decision what happened was because most people are born here who are born here are obviously legitimate citizens and we believe in birthright citizenship for illegal immigrants hospitals\n\n\nHard rockers used to\n\n\nFrom somebody coming up [noise]\nOkay what are you wearing right now ... that's right and when people normally where\nExactly ... cricket is one

changed\nInterpretation of the Constitution's fourteenth amendment\nTo apply to the children of\nIllegal aliens didn't take place until over a hundred years later\nTill over a hundred years later Congress didn't do it there was no executive order there was no court decision\nThe bureaucracy just started doing nobody knows exactly who did it they just started doing it that is what progress which do and now to hear Republicans say so called conservative Republican say look you can't change the constitution with an executive order\nOr we don't do what Obama and the left us using an executive order and law of us that you\nKnow I don't doubt that activist judges and courts will make that argument but for Republicans and conservatives to completely reject the constitution to completely reject history\nAnd to claim that the bureaucracy can reinterpret the fourteenth amendment but the president who's in charge of the bureaucracy can't put it back in a box with an executive
