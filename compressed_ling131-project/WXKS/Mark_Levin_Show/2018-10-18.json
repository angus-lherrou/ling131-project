time I'm well John I Would say that it's not an admission of guilt but yes it's been a mission that it was Obama administration policy to ignore parts of the law that Obama did not like\nI'm so yes

again for your great show Katie thank you for your great message now I Need some advice to help resolve the political dispute my dad and I are unexpectedly at odds in an upcoming state election in Mississippi\nWe're having a special election that is putting two Republicans against each other one is a Tea Party candidate who was doing the truth to the point of light and who perhaps has been involved and questionable a pub a publicity schemes\nThe other is an establishment centers former Democrat\nI'm not looking for an endorsement for either but for your political philosophy given the option between a dirty candidate that aligns with you politically and a candidate you can trust devote more moderate leaving you prefer who do you choose thanks for your opinion Katie Katie a very\nVery a thoughtful question from you thank you so much for writing in\nUm [noise] well you know since I Do not know either the people in this specific Mississippi raised\nThis is just a question of establishing maybe a a means of uh judging similar situations this is really about what is my benchmark do I want somebody who votes the way I Want or acts the way I Want but doesn't vote the way I Want in a politician\nAnd I have to say that I've evolved on this issue with it\nI I think that uh principles are most important for you and your day to day life the principles and politicians can be very hard to come by and you have a ... a politician who holds principles but no power is pretty useless\nSo I Would tend to say in the current political climate\nWhere centrism is really not a thing there's no spirit a bipartisan a pipe bipartisanship whatsoever there's no effort you meet in the middle it makes it look what happened with justice capital I think you've got to do for whoever can deliver the policy wins that's my honest assessment now\nThat varies I mean there's there's people that are shady and there's people who are who are grotesque and\nDeeply corrupt and it's not the same thing uh but yeah I Would I Would take a trustworthy on policy but shady personally conservative or Republican are cheap\nOr a year or whatever over\nA upstanding but legislatively on palatable Democrat\nI suspect Robin writes yesterday you stated you wonder if the press is delusional or just not that smart it is both it's a time where introspection is essentially a profession for over sensitive snowflakes\nAre they are completely ignorant of a lengthy which they distort truth to make their agenda seem plausible there are so ignorant they can't see their own delusions and so delusional they can see their own ignorance it's psychosis which requires a diagnosis hey look at ...\nI think Trump delusion disorder had gone further and become liberal or progressive delusion disorder there was no area in which they can see truth\nHuh Interesting\nThank you so much writing and yeah I Do think that there's a a mass hysteria and really a mess psychosis those overtaken the left Michael writes a high bucks and short shouting regarding Elizabeth Warren here are some phone nicknames a liar walk the fraud resume or\nThey could jewelry or I guess instead of ... and of course Pocahontas and Pocahontas Michael well Michael you are certainly a creative fellow appreciate you writing and sit\nNext up here he says I have no idea why no one is that the possible murder and Turkey's Islamic problem with my three combat tours in the middle east as an infant treatment I never saw stories of babies rounded ovens dead families to include journalist make them shut up please\nA wise on said the ... is turkey is as long as problems um yeah you know ... you're not hearing any criticism of Islam you're only hearing criticism of Saudi Arabia and this whole um this whole murder and that's\nNot by accident the left is very quick to criticize religion that is not Islam but it's very fond of\nDefending Islam at every turn even even radical and more extreme interpretations of Islam\nWhich is really where the problem was so there you go a journal and writes the way you hear the news talk about the report at first I thought it was one of ours\nThis is not our issue not our citizens not our our territory I feel like this wouldn't have been so big an issue with Trump hadn't just succeeded in getting our pastor back half a draw attention away from that to

B. S. that MPs who somehow\nConsulting with Trump to decide what to do ahead of time which is a bunch of crap\nNobody's in favor of this we have any western mine are Judeo Christian ethic we believe in due process so at least Republicans do\nSo we believe in fairness\nAnd and so whatever happened to a Saudi Arabian\nBought a Saudi Arabian government\nIn a Saudi Arabian consulate in Turkey is interesting but hell we got ten thousand murders in this country every year not being investigated by CNN or obsessing by the New York times or the Washington Post where he worked as a contributor\nKicked him we let it go a little bit and see what happened and when it comes out\nThat the M. B. S. directly or indirectly ... show the murdered in a horrible way because he was a dissident and it's a ... and offer regime and Saudi Arabia that's what's gonna come out\nI guess Trump's responsible for that to it never stops it never ends I Can't take it anymore it's awful and so can we move on from\nThe answer of course is no this is the ah\nThe event does your the event this week and next week they keep coming up whether it's Kavanaugh or Julie sweating ache or Deborah Ramirez or a bunch of other incidents that have arisen the past several months of the Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump how can we use this event\nHow can we take Christina for how can we use this event that didn't involve Trump at all and somehow wash this upon him and stain or smear him with some news event\nThat Trump it nothing to do with doing nothing zero zilch nada didn't happen now is that possible\nBut it goes on and on I I tried to watch for hours\nWolf Blitzer and others on CNN it's impossible to watch ... MPs is on speed dial with coach dinner and Trump taking orders assuming he did it what does that mean what might be behind it is is\nThere are many in this country and in the media\nWho thinks the Iranian deal was wonderful for our country and that brought Hussein Obama delivered one point eight billion dollars in cash on governmental pilots to use for terrorism by Ron man that was a great idea we ought to do more of that\nAnd so because Saudi Arabia is the pitch enemy of Iran\nThose in the media wants to get back to the Iranian deal and weaken Saudi Arabia and the middle east\nSo that Iran takes over larger chunks of the middle east Iraq and Syria not being enough maybe that's what's behind it plus as you may know if you've been paying attention Israel and Saudi Arabia have become brothers they become sisters they become friendly with each other because their enemy is Iran\nThey're the enemy of my enemy is my friend so because Israel\nAnd Iran are enemies and because Saudi Arabia and Iran are enemies\nNow Israel and Saudi Arabia are working together in lots of areas so they may be parts of America that wants to get rid of that uh that budding friendship between Israel and Saudi Arabia by weakening the Saudis\nBut whatever it is we don't have a dog in this fight\nYou may want to strengthen Iran and the media does or weaken Israel which the media does\nBut by doing that were hurting our country after nine eleven which I think Fifteen of the Nineteen hijackers came from Saudi Arabia we got a little sideways with Saudi Arabia for a while but now we're back together and they're spending\nI think the president said the other day something in the range of a hundred and ten billion with a total cost of five hundred billion dollars\nOf taking our military hardware to upgrade their military to fight Iran who's our enemy they'd been our enemy since ... since we help get rid of the shah of Iran look what happened there\nAnd so whatever happen happen it occurred let the Saudi Arabians deal with it if the government ordered the killing of someone which by the way America itself has done on a regular basis countries do these kinds of things if Saudi Arabian government decided to murder\nJamal could show gig and stupidly they decide to pick a consulate in Turkey to do the Daschle deed and if that's a violation of some criminal law somewhere to the Turks the sides you know what I say have at it\nBut according to diplomatic law the consulate Israeli Saudi Arabian territory and so what happened there stays in Saudi Arabia so whatever happens happens it is what it is can we move on absolutely not you see\nThe mid term so now only about what twenty days away twenty days from now the midterms and so things were heading toward\nThe Republican way in many states especially in Arizona Nevada and a Montana the president is going to make a greater parents they're North Dakota Heitkamp that a lousy thing with the disclosing the names of sexual assault victims so the red wave appears to be building and the Senate\nAnd that was the big news story so the last several days said wait a minute this thing is heading toward the Republicans to help Trump we can't have that so they started this other thing about your mark ... who was killed\nIn Turkey and he's a Saudi now as we speak the last several days there have been hundreds of Americans who have been killed a few dozen by legal aliens there was a horde of some two or three thousand Central Americans making their way up to America paying their passage MS Thirteen\nWith are girls being raped and men being killed it's happening right now and so there's other news stories going on in the world and because it was kind of going toward Trump's direction and his Rasmussen approval rating was up to fifty one percent the media might have said you know what\nThis is going the wrong direction\nIf we can go after some out the sides and you and in their place put Jared Kushner and Trump somehow responsible for the murder of cars shaggy maybe that'll be a good thing maybe we can stop the building red wave in the Senate what's going to happen\nIn the house I have no idea so let's

good look at it this way Tony days from now\nAnd uh I met with the president or two or three days ago we are going to share with you some of his thoughts later on that uh it appears to me\nThat the number one issue right now is the court system is I just told you Seventy percent of the judges are appointed by Democrats great majority of the cases Ninety nine point nine percent never get U.S Supreme court and so if\nIn twenty days the Senate flips through the Democratic party Chuck Schumer will hold back and not confirming any\nAny of the White House's judicial nominees through twenty twenty which really is January of twenty Twenty one\nAnd then at that point of Trump is reelected which most of us believe he will understand that state's democratic is not going to be twenty Twenty one and it'll be twenty twenty three\nHe will not stop they will not nominate he could nominate but then when I come from one judge so what's on the ballot and twenty days is the court system and whether the destruction of our constitutional several more rights than traditional values will continue\nOn or else we can make the turn some out back to the mental\nSecondly all the investigations\nIf the house becomes democratic which is appears to be very likely\nThe investigations of every aspect of Trump's life his wife's life\nJared Kushner's life everyone's life for the White House will be laid bare and the next two years will not be about legislation but rather investigation so if you want the mob rule that you've seen the past several months\nWhere Republicans are shot\nRun off the street cars blown up and beaten than incentivize the mob by giving them up power by putting their house back in charge of Nancy Pelosi and watch what happens it's going to be unbridled is going to be unbelievable and other aspects of course his foreign policy right now\nDespite the efforts of CNN and others to destroy our relationship with the sides things are pretty good\nNorth Korea's not shooting missiles anywhere right now Iran and Iraq are somewhat quiet right now Syria is heading toward a conclusion I've got a horrible war incentivized by the Russians by the Iranians and vibrant Hussein Obama who allowed the Russians and the Iranians to come into Syria\nForeign policy wise things are pretty good that's on the ballot the economy\nAccording to some national international expertise the American economy right now is the greatest it's ever been in American history\nHow were the stock market react if Nancy Pelosi begins investigations of every aspect of the executive branch of government it won't be good plus you got the impeachment issue is there any doubt in your mind that the Democrats want to eliminate Trump from office so if you went the next two years not to be about judges\nTo be about a and only about investigations and impeachments in a hurt the economy then that's what's on the ballot so when Trump comes to one of these states and he came to Cincinnati a few days ago I spent some time with them and and play some of his thoughts later on\nIf that happens do they're just don't talk which is all we do go they're physically in confront and say yes I Am here as as testimony to what this country can be and should be do I like all the tweets do I like the horse ed comment about the strip or no\nBut the policies the procedures what's happening with the court system what's happening with the economy what's happening with Foreign Relations you know is damn good it's really good\nAnd so think about what's on the ballot and twenty days because the Democrats are as incentivize is they've ever been and it's going to get more ridiculous they're going to more incentivized and if you incentivized the mob by buying them off or paying them off is going to be nothing but difficulties so let's go to your calls now we have a case\nIn Los Angeles and Chris in Atlanta line becomes available you know the routine let's continue with more

that us and tell us I don't know if it's the deep state\nBut the league that they had conversations with authority plans and his entourage around a range of getting that this guy do and if you look at recently I'm John Brennan the last past two days and then NBC confirmed that through his CIA operative so I think [noise]\nUm yeah we are complex and even though we didn't have involvement in the murder and we did not warn him and that's what a big issue on the bottom point\nOut on on that point do you believe al Jazeera any more than you believe CBS why why\nWhy do you rely on al Jazeera

to go to an area that's been completely controlled by the Democratic party\nFor a at least a half a half a century\nAnd see how those theories are working out to see if it's occurring to see if crime is non existent to see of job creation is happening everywhere to save educationally the children are exceeding Adam above their their grade level\nTo see their families are being formed to see if families wanting to move in you want to move into those communities\nAnd we want to see if there is moving trucks bringing new families in the south side of Chicago and other barriers of Memphis and Tampa in San Francisco and Los Angeles and ... we want to go to the poor areas where the Democrats have been in charge the longest to see how successful there are theories have been\nI'm waiting for CNN to do that why haven't they done that\nEverything's Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump what about the lives of average Americans according to the according to the department of education about half the black kids\nPoor kids who go to an inner city school don't graduate they give it up along the route and a half to two graduate the best academically agreed on average at the eighth grade level with all the money being spent in Washington DC\nGood chunk don't graduate twenty to thirty percent don't even\nSchool any particular day the beggar and see right through through the roof and the reason is not race because most poor people in America mathematically or white\nThe reason it happens is the lack of family formation whack a job opportunities rampant crime because of drugs and the Democrats have been one was the last time there was a Republican in charge of Washington DC and the city council of the ... what was the last time there was a Republican who was the mayor of Chicago\nWhat was the last time any of this stuff went on\nThe answer is decades up to a half a century it doesn't happen so these series of Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi or operational and they actually work\nWe would see a completely different result when we must continue now let's go to a Josh in Alexandria Josh and Alexander a welcome to the mark Levin show and Josh please go ahead\n[laughter] Bill thanks for taking my call um I I wanted to ask since when did the ... start to want us to battle and other countries' businesses I mean the Scott Korb or what happened but he's a Saudi Arabian citizen it happened and Saudi Arabia or at the sea and turkey\nLast last time I checked they spent a decade saying oh why are we involved in Iraq why it out with all of with all the war crimes with with Iraq and and uh Saddam Hussein\nAnd now they want us to start meddling I just because they think they can tide Trump to it I mean it's just crazy to me\nWhat what can we what should be the reaction I guess October the second\nOr ... was killed in a horrible way but in America there are cops killed\nThere's American citizens murdered by legal aliens there's horrible domestic violence happening that those crimes happening tonight some were terrible not solved why does CNN want to use that crime eight thousand miles away as a cudgel against Trump what's the reason\n[noise] I mean personally I think it's because it's a horrible story and be a Trump is looming on all fronts right now and they are desperate to find a way to bring him down and that's just one little thing they're going to try to throw it and but I personally don't think it's going to work um\nBut it's a they're just desperate for anything to try to try to bring him down and and time up to says she goes I\nPut this thing what is there about this thing will show gay I guess I wrote some comes the Washington Post he had a green card but he's a Saudi Arabian citizen killed in Turkey\nGuess on Saudi Arabian territory\nAnd yet and yet what ah it's it's what I mean oh interesting\nOh when a when re most in lieu were murdered in New York City in cold blood by black nationalist who came from Baltimore to specifically kill in uniform in their car\nPolice officers in New York City\nThat was like a one day story nationally and then it evaporated died because it didn't fit the agenda of the liberal national media can you imagine if some Trump wearing M. A. G. A. had had hunted down somebody to kill somewhere how big without being story how long without going on\nOh would have been the store for a week and I think you brought up a good point\nWho do you think are left as wanting the fat and quick or a journalist or one of their own or a police officer and I say that all the people who are amount of others don't like police officers but they're gonna be much quicker to rush to the case of of one of their own who works at the Washington Post rather than a sort of our of our um police officers\nIsn't that a parent I mean ... why do we spend\nI mean I haven't seen it tonight I refuse to watch it I imagine it right now it's the biggest story on CNN and MSNBC all it is is about ... ... what did Jared Kushner knew who knew NBS better was a ... or was it\n... or was that Trump did sod spend money and wanted Trump properties at some point they keep making these connections you know what I care about is the murder of re most in lieu and what that said\nAbout Brock Hussein Obama meeting in the White House with representatives of black lives matter whoever cater to murder of police officers and when the L. M. got what they want and what are we went dead cops when even when I'm now in rainbows St Louis were tortured and killed\nThat was a one day story and the media quickly dropped it because of who did it one officer Jason Ellis was murdered and a barge down Kentucky ambush Kelly we don't know who did it\nAnd at this point\nWhat is in the media spent time instead of ... in Turkey take up the calling of a police officer who was tortured and murdered in uniform\nAnd spent time as to who killed him and why was murdered re most so Lewis killed according to this black nationalist he said that he wanted to come and killed police officers because what cops had done to Michael Brown and Eric Garner\nAnd so the media covered those stories as if cops killed wrongfully Michael Brown in Ferguson which they did not do Michael Brown tried to kill a police officer Darren Wilson and it was proven beyond a shadow of a doubt\nBy Obama's Justice Department then Michael Brown should have been killed because of his behavior and Eric Gardner killed was killed he died because he was resisting arrest\nAnd so but when the media cover these events there was a sick mind in Baltimore who thought police officers ... fold because of the way CNN covered the killing of Michael Brown who was an unarmed robber who tried to kill police officer Darren Wilson\nAnd grabbed his gun inside the police car and that was proven that was proven but the media cover these events in such a way that causes black murder nationalist the hunt down ... New York city and murder them why didn't CNN covered that aspect to the story\nAnd the fact that Obama in the White House repeatedly met with representatives of black lives matter that advocate at the murder of cops who were killed in Dallas in Baton Rouge why didn't CNN cover it that way\n[noise] [noise] because it doesn't fit their narrative 'em and they are back and think about that it doesn't ...\nIt doesn't in other words they can't use that as a weapon against a either John Banner or George Bush Ronald Reagan or now it's now it's Donald Trump see the media ought to call balls and strikes\nBut instead of doing that they take sides in a dispute and ignore all this other evidence that doesn't fit their agenda and then they go after the obscure fact\nI'm some side being killed in Turkey which they can use as a club against Jared Kushner because Assad's him invested in real estate ventures of Trump years ago and they spend money at the hotel next to the White House so they keep looking for reasons that tight Trump to the murder and ... seconds me Josh thank\nYou for your call let's continue with more we have a ... a couple of days ago I met with the president and ah he gave

lot of feelings for the president to forty five Donald J drop in\nMr President before we get too deep into this money is playing a little bit difficulty and is doing quite well so instead of dealing with that let's talk about Maloney as trip to Africa how things go\nWell she's a terrific first lady and a great human being and she wanted to go and see for herself Africa because we've heard so much about it some very good step but some very tough stuff in a sense of the way people live\nAnd she made for substance you also went to the pyramids and Egypt and that was quite something special [noise] but uh\nAnd the poverty is incredible the level of poverty a\nIt was very sad a beautiful in one way and very sad and I know the kids were beautiful they loved her\nAnd she came back and she said I Hope you're going to continue to give a lot of money because they need it it's not a question of it's not a question of defense it's not a question of it it's just touch on the human race as they need it and she had a big impact on me I Will tell you a\nBill she really had a big impact\nOn me and the other thing the mid west I looked at Canada Mexico and South Korea [noise]\nMillions of jobs have been credit and you were told a year or two ago by Gary Cohn and others that you know the candidate deal is probably not going to happen Mexico's too tough NAFTA is ingrained what did you do that caused Canada may not be real happy right now in Mexico may not be real happy and then South Korea\nTo kind of play because we're the big dog in the kennel but they don't treat it that way what did you do with the\nDeal and we're also the piggy banks that everybody wants to come and then Rob\nAnd uh Mexico we made a deal and we told them look otherwise we're going to have to just actually car industry which would have been bad for them and\nFrankly I wouldn't have wanted to do it but we were going to do it and we made a deal with Mexico we could not make a deal with Canada they just wouldn't make a deal that was fair for us because ... was a total and complete disaster you know that better than all of that you saw what happened over here with you still have building's empty will just everybody moved out\nI don't know what they were taken so that's why I refused to call it NAFTA I said the deal with making I refused so we call it the U.S embassy a and it works good but we made a great deal is\nWith everybody what happened then is Kennedy came along in the end we weren't able to make it I said we're going to tax you cars coming in and then what happened and they made a deal they made a deal they made a deal and it's a deal that we're very happy with I Hope they are very happy with hope everybody is\nThat's a fair deal for us and we have now we just need to deal with South Korea which is fabulous much a a much improved approved deals you know improved\nI Will say that Hillary Clinton do you remember she made that deal and she said it's two hundred and fifty thousand jobs and she was right for South Korea so they got two hundred and fifty we didn't get two hundred and fifty [noise]\nIt was a terrible deal so essentially we terminated that deal and we made a new deal with South Korea\nSo how many jobs and talking to my every time I can or Mexico will be talking about a million\nWhat you're talking about millions of jobs potential don't forget we've opened up countries that were just totally close to it if you look at Canada we couldn't sell our dairy products out there and if we did it was a three hundred percent of people don't talk about that you know if I put on a ten percent or twenty percent Arab they make a big deal if they have three hundred\nActually three hundred percent two hundred and Seventy five percent two hundred and eighty five percent these are the terrorists they charge so essentially that's a wall because if you have to pay a tariff like that you can't sell the product is so expensive so we've opened up Canada\nWe have a very good relationship now I think they respect us more than they did before\nBut now at least it's fair in our farmers are in love with it you see what's going on it's beautiful now we're working on China and we're working on the European Union which have absolutely taken advantage of our country is the European Union has been brutal and the way they took advantage of the United states for many years\nI mean they were formed to take advantage of the United states that was a reason they were formed how can we\nHow can we take from the United states\nSo the European Union they formed and they have their very unfair to us they have barriers where we can't sell into their into into their countries\nThey have a tremendous tariffs that make it impossible\nAnd yet they still Mercedes Benz and BMWs by the millions they come in there and Indians and we charge him essentially no tax it's two and a half percent but for the most part they don't even I liked it\nSo we charge them virtually nothing and they send millions and millions of cars if we want to send a a piece of grain okay we want to send a piece of grain we can't do it and to the European Union so it's unfair uh we met with them I told them I'm going to start\nTaxing because because Obama they wouldn't even talk to them right they said we're very happy the way we are and that's that was that Obama just went away\nAnd then ah with us I said look we want to talk I didn't hear from I said we want to talk I didn't hear third time I said listen we're not ever call me back but I'm going to give you one more chance and interested that's okay I'm going to tax you cars at twenty five percent coming in which is frankly more money right it's devastating to them but it's more money\nAnd they immediately have a plan and came over and talk to and now they want to make a deal I I don't know that we're going to make a deal with um I can tell you they want to sure but we're going to make it one way or the\nI've

from the mainstream media about Elizabeth Warren good friend a rich Samantha's Elizabeth Warren\nNews said this on Monday Elizabeth Warren reveals proof of Native American ancestry about that headline about the peace supposedly objective independent they be quote Warren DNA shows Native American heritage about CNN you'll love this one this week as of Monday Elizabeth Warren\nYou know Pocahontas

samples from Columbia in Peru not from America\nAnd that she is something less than point one percent Native American blood that she played for decades as\nA minority to make money and so it's amazing to me how the media covers for those protected inside the progressive tribe if you're part of the group\nAnd your Louis Farrakhan using hate speech against Jews Twitter went up and you\nIf you're in the group like Brock Hussein Obama and you admitted into presidency using drugs committing felonies it's no big story at all but if you're outside the group and your name is Brett Kavanaugh and when you were Fifteen Years old you drink beer\nOr had some posting in your your book my God that's a big story\nSo Clinton in office as president drugs\nNo problem Brett Kavanaugh drank beer you're ...
