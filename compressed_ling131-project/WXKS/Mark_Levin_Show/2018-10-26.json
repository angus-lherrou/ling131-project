{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WXKS", "content": "Irwin writes I Would think that one of the things that we could do with these invaders before they get to our border is pre position all the materials necessary to build a tent city I mean living quarters shower facilities messed facilities port a potties\nFood water betting clothing everything\nHave the grounds all staked out and ready for construction and bring in Sheriff Joe to supervise the whole thing\nAlong with all this we should bring in ten or twenty functional FEMA trailers\nThat can be used as temporary courtrooms that have all the judges already there to adjudicate any claims and all of for sanctuary status right there none of this come back we're three and three or four years for hearing bull crap\nI early on you know you're you're actually much more solution oriented than a lot of other people who think they are on this issue because the problem is not that\nWe don't have enough people to catch people at the border from this caravan the problem is that they will turn themselves in and claim false asylum\nThat's what they will do right so it's not decision oh we need more people to catch them I don't think I don't think everybody really really get that part of this\nYes they may be initially prosecuted for illegal entry if they don't show at a port of entry if they just try to cross the border but think about the the value proposition from their side\nIf you get close to the U.S Mexico border and you're a Honduran as part of this caravan you can either just try to sneak in the United states free and clear or if you get caught then you say oh well I'm claiming asylum\nDefensive asylum is what they call it I'm I'm I needed a song that you will still get process for the illegal entry but that's a misdemeanor and they're not going to deport you for that and so you've had your asylum hearing\nSo you really get two shots to stay in the U.S under the system as it is now and we do need much speedier process uh but keep in mind how do you even hear these ... properly\nThey're not providing any ... any specific documentation of a threat against him they just tell a story and the question is is their story compelling\nSo butter or in your ear at least thinking about this and the right way which is that if we had a\nA a set up at the border where was essentially you know when they have the a producer Mike knows about this they got the uh courthouse under the the eagles the eagles play you know the football stadium they have a courthouse in the stadium for all the drunken brawl so their take you write down there and you know\nYou get justice dispensed right away you get your fine are you going to jail or whatever so it it sort of like that at the border would be what are what you can do so or when you're\nThe right track my friend Bryan writes buck still laughing out loud about trying to mediate discussion on the heated topic between crystal in Kansas we're actually well beyond time candidates did an incredible job holding her ground oh to be a fly on the wall pre and post that segment\nCanisters fears no there's no two ways about it I mean she you know you can come at her with with everything you've got and I'll tell you look crystal from the left is also very tenacious so it was quite as I can tell a lot of you that does all this but it was quite a thing\nIt was quite a thing that ah that happens or by the way there's a rumor that junk weaker from the young church maybe there tomorrow and while I'm not planning to be in any way hum disrespect for aggressive ah I have a feeling we will disagree profusely on some issues I have a feeling that could very well happen so\nWe will see a Josh book I Want to thank you for writing my day after long stressful day it's nice to listen in on the drive home you're accurate depiction of Hillary Clinton's ... while thank you\nTen years the intelligence related field I got out disillusioned in part because of Hillary Clinton when I hear you or impersonate Hillary I Can't help but smile and tropical and it makes me feel a little bit better about the world and the country and that at least some of us understand who these people really are\nFrom Josh I'm Josh I'm I'm Glad that I can bring a little Lebanon into things and uh just just remember that how did you so there you go about my it sounds

the best that everything that she's doing because a personal loyalty an honor and friendship come before the debate for me you know what I mean that's that's just the way that it is and uh as these are a great lady and very very talented\nAh as to anyone telling it turned out my rhetoric oh no it was never see she she wouldn't do that or it was other people it was actually a pretty prominent

I think when you have a right or if it were kind of rhetoric we've having this guy over and over again\nThis is the president has called the media the enemy as people and his right now\nSo the president calls the media the enemy of the people and their ten bombs I don't know if they're fake bombs real bombs whatever they are but they are obviously a terrorism threats as far as I'm concerned\nAnd that you see is what triggers everything I remember when Gabby Giffords was shot in the federal judge was murdered I remember that ... that assassination attempt on her\nAnd it turns out the guy was a psycho and I remember how they tried to blame Sarah Palin quite frankly they tried to blame me in a few others nothing to do with any of this\n\nWe have these mass horrific killings of kids in elementary schools and there's the media\nAnd then you know cost the enemy of the people of course we're not the enemy of the people well what the hell are you really I what are you what are you doing tonight what did you do this morning what did you do yesterday\nIt's appalling go ahead\nOr whatever ... is a part of this and is being treated as an enemy soon going to act like\n[laughter] to see me so I've or she will be complicit\nIn ...\nSo he is complicit in what follows what a disgraceful for really to get face time on MSNBC they'll do anything what a disgrace wet a disgraceful\nGroup of clowns\nHere we have this going on in the country and its Trump and Trump they're obsessed ... make and Joe ...

let's look at drugs\n\nThe president's put out a dictate it's not even legal\n\nHe's put out a dictate through the department of ah what do they call health and Human Services\n\nThey want price transparency I don't have a problem with that\nWe all want price transparency but when they do the price transparency on pharmaceuticals here's what they need to do the same thing at the gas tank when you go there and they they show you are the prices in all shows the taxes\nShow us the cost show us the are indeed that went into that particular medicine\nAnother word you want transparency and give it give us all the trends parents that's involved\n\nYou see the amount of money that's being spent you can read in the newspaper all the time to find various cures for cancer you see the amount of money that's being spent did find cures for dimension all time or the amount of money that's being spent to try and find cures for diabetes and so forth money's being spent over and over again and really\n\nIn many ways or at least in some ways it's been quite beneficial people live longer than ever before\n\nYou know the government tried to regulate the cost of vaccines under Clinton and other administrations you know what happened we had one vaccine company left and they couldn't make enough vaccines and then they had a hustle so we import vaccines from Europe\nAnd other places when the government gets involved prices go up demand goes on quality goes down availability goes down this\nIs a matter of fact it's not a matter of conservatism liberalism socialism capitalism is a fact\nIt is experience it's provable so now we're driving up the cost of consumer goods big consumer goods I'll give you another one\nAnd some of the you won't like this either because you know you're suspending irrationality and it's just a you're waving the flag of one party or another I don't care\nI support this president doesn't mean I agree with everything I don't agree with what he's doing in these areas are winning bring 'em up\nThe tax cuts\nNew home sales are flat and starting to decline it's starting to happen with re sales now why is that\nWhile the media will tell you mostly\nThat it's because of increasing interest rates low interest rates are increasing but ladies and gentleman they're nowhere near high interest rates four percent four and a half\nPercent many of us live through eleven twelve Twenty one percent interest rates this is nothing historically it's minimal that's not why\nWhy you know why Mr producer\n\nBecause you can't deduct all of your interest payments on mortgages and all your property taxes anymore\nThere's at ten thousand dollar threshold and it's doing exactly what I said it would do\nHaving a negative effect on home sales those if you want to resell your homes whether it's in a red state blue state I don't care you're in America it's harder to reach your home now\nAnd for builders who hire what we call construction workers and electricians and plumbers and ... and brick workers and on and on and on all those men all those women are affected by this\n\nI Wish it was the greatest tax cut in American history but as it applies to individuals that simply was not\n\nAnd so it has a downward push\nOn the housing industry we're seeing a downward push\nOn the production of automobiles and we'll see more the downward push on the production on home appliances and so for this is what happens when you screw around with the economy whether it's Bernie Sanders or Donald Trump or or Jeb Bush or whoever it is thrown any name you want this is what happened\nAnd what's gonna happen in the drug market I'm very concerned about\nYou're going to start to see shortages there's going to be less R and D and to new cutting edge in life improving medicines\nEverything can't be about redistributing well everything can't be a ... and maybe they cannot be about lowering prices had no with no effect\nWe don't treat salaries that way we don't treat profits that way\nIt's amazing to me the only entity that gets bigger and bigger and gets more and more money is the federal government and even conservative nationalist populist\nThey always turn to the central federal government to step in and rescue this are rescue that we never learn our lessons\nSo I picked at least for industries now that this administration has interfered in in a significant way and I'm greatly concerned about it because that creates precedent for a left wing cook president that come in and say hey look Trump Administration did it I'm only building on

Fox News Florida now considered to read you know the interest is federal and local authorities continue to investigate a series of suspected bombs into high profile Democrats and others one today found in New York City a pledge\nCats are served as deputy White House counsel before Trump tapped him for the powerful D.C court of appeals last year\nGoes on\nA spokesman for Mueller's office beat her car declined to comment on the litigation\nLawyers for Trump's mystery grand jury subpoena fight moving through the DC circuit had nothing to do with the president know ideas said Trump's personal attorney Jay Sekulow when shown the docket for the case\nAttorneys for Roger Stone said they didn't know of anyone challenging a mother Sabina beyond Miller Miller's lawyers agreed with Mueller's prosecutors to make many aspects of the dispute public\nNo such agreement appears to have been struck and the other fight although Mueller's team and the mystery witness did file a joint motion earlier this month the asking the appeals court to expedite resolution of the dispute\nSeveral other lawyers who represent witnesses and the mother investigation also said there were unaware of who's crossing legal swords with the special counsel's team and the largely secret case a few barebones\nDetails about the dispute are available in the public record while all records about the litigation and the district quarter sealed DC circuit stock it shows that the case was brought the D.C court on August sixteen and how ruled on September at Nineteen the initial appeal was filed five days later\nStay with me on this because we'll try to make sense of this it's actually very very fascinating\n\nThe bottom line is most likely scenario someone found a motion to quash or otherwise resist the grand jury subpoena\nAnd the judge issued an order denying that and saying the witness needs to testify said Ted Boudreau so I Know a Gibson Dunn and crunch or attorney who is handled grand jury related litigation for journalists and media organizations\nChunk clear what is the case the appeals court has agreed to here in December involves an assertion of attorney client privilege or some other privilege is framed as a broader attack or most of the party or perhaps advances both sets of arguments very hard to tell from the stock and well I'll tell you\nIt's not hard to tell at all\nMr Miller ... challenged we know from a few months back the constitutionality the appointment of Mahler or the appointments clause of the constitution the same argument I been making\nAnd professor ... has made\nI don't know exactly what kind of argument there making obviously I'm not privy to this sort of thing but it's the same person Miller and I assume it's the same lawyers who are making this argument probably challenging the subpoenas challenging the constitutionality of Mahler and his operation\nIn the first instance\nI suspect I Believe strongly that that's what's taking place again because I have first hand knowledge but because remember what took place a few months ago\nThe grand jury cases pose a threat to Mueller's investigation because they can serve as vehicles to get questions of its authority illegal legitimacy before how judges relatively quickly and I believe that's what's taking place here such questions have also been raised by defendants and some of my list criminal cases but all the human defendants who\nSet foot in a courtroom and ultimately decided to plead guilty and drop any challenges to the special counsel the hardier tactics\n\nMystery cases moving through the courts and Robin grand jury matters and independent counsel matters or aren't on common in Nineteen Ninety seven conflict of interest investigation into America our chief Eli seagulls fundraising activities was conducted under steal from its star\nIn the final report remains that are public view involving another Clinton era pro the labor secretary Alexis Herman and influence peddling accusations\n\nThis can't they can get a step or two weirder than it already is set an attorney representing a senior Trump staffer in the Russian inquiry Tiller recall the case from a previous investigation where he couldn't even get to see a judge's opinion\nBecause it was under steal All right\n[noise] I'm\nFairly confident that this is the case that was originally brought involving Miller by counsel as I said the question the appointment of Mahler or the appointments clause and the DC circuit has been packed\nA wood left is an Obama appointee so who knows what'll happen there perhaps they're building the foundation also to take it to the United States Supreme court\nAnd despite what you've heard by senior judicial analyst and others this is not the Martian versus Olson case of Thirty years ago and bobbing the independent counsel\nThe elements in that court decision appear to have been violated in my opinion and in professor calories his opinion respecting Muller and this is why these two questions are important to stay with me 'cause you're smart and you'll know you'll be able to follow all this we've talked about it before\nIs Mr Mahler a principal officer of the federal government or is he an inferior office for purposes of a challenge to the appointments clause of the constitution\nI have no doubt that he insists that he's an inferior officer so reports to deputy attorney general Rosen stain that he did not have to be nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate\nHe's nothing more than an inferior\nOffice official like some assistant United States attorney or jeopardy to an assistant\nAttorney general now you know that's not true he's got more power than a U.S attorney\nAnd the reason among other reasons that he has more power than a U.S attorneys because his initial\nAppointment was enormously brought it didn't provide any criminal basis for his investigation we've talked about that so this isn't like Martian versus also know the court may conclude that it is but on the facts that is not\nIt's a legitimate challenge of is it's hard I don't know where it will go but I'm Glad it's being done\nAnd eyes more than ... suspect I Believe strongly that that's the ping pong that's going on between the trial court the district court and the appellate court back and forth and that's why the appellate court is so there's going to hear the case and again as I said that court\nIs heavily loaded with a a leftist activist so the the final case will have to be made to the Supreme Court if

have had that did violate Florida ethics laws and then the lobby it's got a exactly what they were paying for and so that's really the way color has the government runs its corrupt\nIt's wrong I'm Andrew has you know he lied to the country on Sunday night when I confronted him about this but then documents came out almost immediately refuted is denial showed he was lying\nUm and he's basically tried to blame everyone he can cause he just refuses to take responsibility but the bottom line is it still to this day tries to say he's not under investigation but mark you're very smart in the law you understand the stuff\nWhat an FBI agent ever act Under Cover and give somebody a potential drive like that if they weren't investigating the public official that now only reason you would do such a ...\nOf course nobody knows if he's in the clear now are not nobody knows if this is an ongoing investigation of among other people and him\nOh it's it's it's definitely an ongoing investigation I mean not bad that\nMight just be there um it's interesting we re ran an ad uh basically uh talking about all this problem\nAnd his attorney wrote a cease and desist letter to the station and then the letter the attorney said a public reports have said that Andrew is not the subject\nOf the investigation but as you know mark some of these bugs words you can be a subject of an investigation you can also be a target of the investigation his own campaign attorney\nDid not put it in that letter that Andrew is not a target he just said Andrew is not a subject so that to me is is a is an interesting omission or because the bottom line is\nWhy would they be investigating corruption in city hall if it had nothing to do with the mayor you wouldn't have had those FBI agents around him on these trips like they were on\n[noise] Enron descent as he immediately tried to racialized this issue that the reason you were bringing it up and for that matter I guess a local media is bringing up is because of his race\nNow last time I checked it has nothing to do with somebody's race when there's an undercover agent giving somebody I'm a value to try and see if they'll take it any tuck it has nothing to do with race and I notice he's tried to do this over and over and over again in this campaign let me ask you a question your running mate who is your running mate", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show",
