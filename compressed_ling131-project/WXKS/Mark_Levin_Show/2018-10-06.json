Nineteen forty seven if you had a T. V. in your house in Nineteen forty seven you were a Rockefeller\nTVs were harder to find the cars in this country\nAnd TV signals weren't exactly what they are today either so true and doing this first broadcast yeah I'm sure it is historic and all that but many more people heard it on the radio than watched it on TV that day and what was Truman talking about\nWhat was so important that he had to do a national broadcast\nHarry Truman was appealing for Americans to cut back on grain you use in order to help the starving people in Europe this was post World war two and while we were the bread basket for the world\nUh Europe was starving and Truman said look we got to cut back a little bit so we can be the benevolent leaders in the world\nAnd now if you fast forward sixty Seventy years\nAmerica is not the leader and wheat production anymore\nYeah we still do well but thank God a lot of other countries are starting to become self sufficient\nBut that's what that speech was about on this date in Nineteen forty seven also in uh Nineteen Ninety One if you're a Mark Wahlberg fan you probably in your you're my age you might remember this understate Nineteen Ninety One\nMark Wahlberg at the time known is Marcie mark and the funky bunch\nHad the number one pop hit in the country with something called good vibrations not the beach boys song it's more of a dance track with Mark Wahlberg wrapping over it\nAnd now Mark Wahlberg is a massive box office star and how did he get there how did he go from being a\nA an underwear model and with the funky bunch doing good vibrations to one of the biggest stars on the silver screen well if you've ever read Mark Wahlberg daily routine you understand\nHe gets up at three thirty in the morning and he does two things for half an hour each every morning he prays yes he said he praised for half an hour in the works out for half an hour he works out like three or four different times a day\nHe also spent time with his kids he works and he goes to bed at seven thirty so while he is up and ungodly hour three thirty in the morning you also it was in bed very early\nAnd ah one more little notes here on this day apple

and it's only Fifteen her speech tonight is seven thirty to\nHer that's a false premise and guess what you'll lose\nBut we all do so that's the the first the most important thing the second is that there are two sides to stories in one side effects now you're the facts and it's something that drove me crazy crazy crazy crazy\nLast Thursday and bless her heart Susan Collins who\nDelivered a speech and among the things I never imagined that I Would be saying\nAt any point today\nOne that oh my God Chuck Grassley who's left who goes by well spunky and Susan Collins\nSusan Collins this afternoon delivered the most remarkable speech I've ever heard a senator deliver who the heck happened here at a at a lot of interesting the interesting things going on\nBut in the context that there are two sides to stores and one side effects on Thursday you have so many people including the aforementioned Susan Collins who was unbelievable today\nWho said that you know what she was really credible really credible Christine forward you know really believable and uh you know so it was Brett Kavanaugh how many times did you hear that from people yeah you know they both were known and we're not no they were not going to be right somebody was lying\nSomebody was committing perjury\nSomeone testifying last Thursday was really really committing an act of evil\nAnd that person based on all the information available is Christine for the film out people are treating her with kid gloves but in this moment where by age to vote margin we're advancing to the final votes tomorrow and Brett Kavanaugh approximately five o'clock eastern time\nIt's also important that Christine Ford saying that she is one hundred percent certain that Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her\nBut she is not allowed to just went off into the sunset is though she never made those claims now there's not going to be any accountability there's no way in the world but the the Senate Judiciary committee is going to pursue her for perjury\nThey should they should there should be a full investigation of her but\nAs long as I have an opportunity to do so which she did it's an act of evil Christine for\nTrying to ruin a man's wife said she is one hundred percent certain providing witnesses none of which corroborate anything she said it's wrong\nThat's wrong and it's important now when we are confronted with the axis of evil in this society be false accusations by someone like Christine Ford they are called out for what they are and she is made to to have to account for what she is which is a perpetrator\nA woman who committed an act of evil\nBut there are some folks that go yeah but she might really be a sexual assault victims okay it's ... I'm not saying she is and possibly a sexual assault victims let me ask you if\nYou have someone who is a legitimate victim of sexual assault and they go out in the murder somebody down the line are they not accountable for that murder because they were a victim of sexual assault somewhere\nIn their life they absolutely are held accountable for murder right what was she tried to do to break out and I am one hundred percent certain it was Brett Kavanaugh\nWas she not trying to effectively ruin that man's life his family's life how evil do you have to do that so I don't care\nIf she was a sexual assault victims somewhere along the way does not give her the right to do what she did and it's important once again and we don't just wide off because breakout is going to make it through this thing\nAnd ignore people who are perpetrators like Christine bored\nBecause there will be others we ended up a thorn in the\nBiggest issue we could have had in this country which is due process just going the way of uh I don't know oh Chuck Schumer's credibility or the Chicago Cubs season I'm not trying to rub it in by the way I'm just pointing out that if I were a leftist in Chicago I wouldn't show up to vote because I mean just why you know not and things aren't going\nWay right now and ... what's the point\nBut that's where we are that's where we are we're on ... razor thin edge and if you are someone who believes in right and wrong if you are someone who believes in the constitution if you are someone who believes in the premise\nThen we all need to acknowledge what happened here and who the perpetrator watch and\nRecognized in our own lives should those people come about the bay as well will be called out he made accountable for who and what they are now a couple of things as we were just getting warmed up Happy Friday by the way\nIt really has been that kind of a way casting that kind of couple of weeks to cut up three months I mean shoot pretty much only Clarence Thomas and and understand well Kavanaugh has been through an emotionally doesn't know it was kind of feel like we were through another election here this whole cabinet ... is a pretty emotional deal because there was so much on the line\nBy the way I mentioned on ... or ...\nI don't want to show my home station W.

have the exact same phone number so just to please do not share your Chuck Schumer sexual assault allegations on the Marco then show just pick those straight to the FBI place\nNow um right before the break\nMentioned persuading people how to persuade somebody politically or over the course of my career is the single most common question I have a receipt and [noise] the easiest way to tell you how to persuade someone if they tell you who you shouldn't be attempting to persuade\nPeople are closed minded if somebody is genuinely not open to information odds are you're not going to get anywhere\nAnd that's the problem most people and this is true conservatives to by the way it's it's not like this is unique to liberals there are a lot of close minded conservatives too but you got to be open a new information and you need to identify who those people are in your life\nYou know I mentioned the Kavanaugh polling firm Gallup that start to finish everything that's happened over the past three months everything public sentiment I'm Brett Kavanaugh only shifted by seven points the entire time puts it\nIn other words at most seven percent of this country was even persuadable I'm Brett Kavanaugh\nSo what does that tell you just go to the average person in that opposes your thought process and expect to get some way somewhere now you need it all you're doing is banging your head against the wall and you're going to make yourself on happy so if you want to be persuasive the first thing\nFind the right people people are open to information not the loudest people who will fight with you politically and the next thing is credibility\nOne of the biggest mistakes that people make\nJust by lack unit because once you give up your credibility why is anybody going to listen to\nExcept for that reason operate with facts operate with information if you just operate with opinions independent of the facts and the information somebody who is otherwise open to that information\nThey're just gonna view you as someone who is highly political train that can communicate or your your emotion rather than principal a because typically what you'll find for those that are truly persuadable or is that they are analytical\nAnd that they genuinely are inquisitive looking for more information and by the way\nThis surprises a lot of people but I find that common link that millennials are a number of reasons and it starts with the economy\nA lot of folks have given up on the millennial generation which by the way the youngest millennials are closing in on being legal to drink the youngest one's right oldest one's like thirty five thirty six now\nAnd I have not blame that ride along because when was it that they came of age they came of age and the great recession right so here they went through the education establishment they were fed a bill of whatever the education establishment feeds them\nAnd then they come out and the economy's terrible\nAnd they weren't able to get a opportunity and so it made sense to them yeah you know what capitalism this economy doesn't work we need change you know Obama probably made sense because hey that was what our teachers told us in here we are and things are working\nThey had never seen a good economy never seen a good economy we finally have it right now is one of the most important window of time\nWe have two really good opportunities to reach people\nEspecially younger adults that now do have opportunities three point seven percent unemployment are you kidding me right they're getting the wage

emotional time and no doubt or we're gonna have must see a TV going on about five o'clock eastern time tomorrow as the final vote or should take place approximately around that period of time but at this point\nGiven the Susan Collins made her speech made it clear that she is going to be voting\nI took him four and Brett Kavanaugh and then shortly after that Joe mansion Democrat West Virginia who is a Republican and waiting at this point I'm humid\nOr at all it seems like it's inevitable at at this point the mansion is going to go and make the move maybe I after the election of but he is a he said that he is also one board so uh the it it absolutely appears that there are the boats and in fact\nSomething interesting that developed out of Alaska\nLisa Murkowski voted no Republican Lisa Murkowski voted no she didn't want to end debate and again if debate did not end today basically Kevin I Would have been dead that've been it right there at the procedural vote today absolutely critical to its her voting no\nUh you know she has come under heat\nFrom her constituents on the right\nAnd what's interesting I when you take a look at that in context is the way they've been gone about not screaming out protesting not people they're chasing her down in elevators but there have been a lot of folks\nThat had been to lighten up her office or with phone calls them know how can certainly are there have been some pretty good pieces put out including one by the wall Street Journal that was amazing pointing out that hey you know if Lisa Murkowski or to have a ... year the ninth\nCircuit court of appeals\nWould be kind of the final say if you end up having basically this split court and you had significant decisions don't impact Alaskans the Ninth Circuit ruling ultimately if there weren't a decisive decision at the Supreme Court that would stand for all Alaskans seems like Lisa might now actually be reconsidering\nOr taking a look at the most likely outcome here are you looked like it might be in that fifty to vote range and I we might end up there even though we were fifty one forty nine today now something that I have tried to lean on from a point of optimism throughout this process\nIs the positive that can be gained from all this how many people knew how many folks were on the Senate Judiciary committee until the past couple of weeks\nHave known many I I mean even you and the student listener somebody who cares and is engaged in you know that they were Twenty one members well I mean okay so twenty in Spartacus but did you know how many members of the Senate Judiciary committee there were\nWe learn that right I mean it's one small detail but for many folks because we don't teach civics in school this has been an opportunity and cabinet but check your\nUh that that may on what he has been through and and having a backbone of steel so see this thing through holy cow incredible person definitely a role model a role model that we could all point to\nThat's ultimately what a think Brett Kavanaugh's role it's twofold one\nI think he taught history by what he went through during this process and having a whole new generation of people engaged in paying attention\nSecond thing is I think we have a new role model that we can point to one of the big concerns of course has been well you know Trump's going to Trump Donald Trump has been an incredibly effective president the United states not necessarily the best role model right\nBut if you want to introduce your kids to somebody\nThat seems to have all the ripe for priorities and the right places they just the right way doesn't back down when he's faced with adversity you absolutely can point to Brett Kavanaugh now\nHow many folks necessarily knew how many Supreme Court justices their war before all this I'm sure you did but a lot of folks have learned that\nA lot of folks have learned about how this than it actually works and that's important from a point of civic says well how delivered is the process is by design all these procedural votes and everything that's happening now including the thirty our window that we're in as we wait until\nApproximately five o'clock tomorrow afternoon for the final vote\nYeah there are a lot of things about our government we complained about a lot of things we don't like a lot of things that we should be frustrated by but they're always opportunities and we're in one of those moments one of those historical moments\nWe can look back on and this could be an opportunity for generations to learn what they never would have learned and I have an opportunity and the time of adversity with leadership to point to somebody does have the right way doesn't back down I'm Brian month we'll be

incredibly predictable in terms of political swings in this country the issues change the politicians change times change\nBut we had been incredibly incredibly consistent in our decision making a walk your back real quick to the presidential election twenty six same\nI've done this for years for years are going back to the two thousand cycle but it was most notable and twenty sixteen when I was able to effectively and accurately depict Donald Trump winning the presidency\nBased upon the electoral college and the way I was able to do it is based upon historical trends simply put you take a look at history back in a twenty six team we had a full term Democrat who was president\nThere has still to this point in American history never been a full term Democrat who was succeeded by an elected Democrat not ever\nAfter eight years we tend to have enough the only time it has ever happened many Democrats as he did a full term Democrat was Truman after FDR he inherited the office yes he later ran as the incumbent and one\nBut because of that we tend to be incredibly consistent in all during the primary process especially here in Florida folks were asking me with Rubio running isn't Rubio more electable Trump's winning this can't be good this and that ... vote for the person you believe in\nBecause the odds are the Republican candidate what when\nAnd sure enough there you go now in the context mid term elections you're probably aware that the incumbent presidents party loses generally in fact there's only been three times three times since we had the two party system which started in the late Eighteen fifty is\nThat the incumbent presidents party has actually gain seats only three times and they each happened with an inflection point in American history the first time was Nineteen thirty for FDR was president we had the great depression\nThe second time Nineteen Ninety eight we had the bill Clinton botched impeachment effort by Republicans\nCollection point American history and then the next one came for years later two thousand to George W. Bush in the wake of nine eleven\nSo we took the great depression nine eleven\nThe botched impeachment of Clinton to bring about the president's party gaining seats\nThe average outcome in mid term cycle is that the president's party will lose four seats in the Senate thirty seats in the house it's just the average outcome happen this year Democrats regain control of everything now\nThere's no chance whatsoever that Democrats will gained four seats there is a better chance at this point the Republicans gained four seats the Democrats\nAnd Republicans are almost certainly at this point\nGoing to retain control the Senate map favorable for them\nHeidi Heitkamp has pretty much done herself in in North Dakota she voted no today and what we have seen advocated that she was going to be a no vote about ten points about ten point to what the what the difference in her race in North Dakota and she was already endanger their Claire McCaskill\nOf Missouri voted no\nShe already was trailing slightly in the polls likely to end up being a big time issue for her and then Joe Donnelly in Indiana same deal voted no these are all big Trump states than you did have Joe Manchin of West Virginia voted yes Joe Manchin by the way is almost certainly going to be re elected on backup this\nAgain when I've been taking a look at for ... how much this boat meant\nThose particular states an average of about ten points ... or nay because those are pro Trump broke having all states\nSo the Senate almost certainly going to stay but still the house you take a lot of getting it if you check any of the polls he checked decide to take a look at everything right now does not look good for Republicans looks like Republicans are pacing somewhere in the neighborhood of about thirty losses which will be enough for Democrats to take control the house\nBut I continually have people say that they just don't see that happening\nWe'll see it happening they don't see it happening my question is and this is what I'm working out because again I base everything off of information are we at an inflection point in American history is this number four\nIs Donald Trump as a catalyst just him being the disruptor as president of the United states\nThen this cabinet situation is that it now I guess to what we went through and any of those other examples\nNot the great depression\nNot after nine eleven but if you're looking for a cop you absolutely could point to Nineteen Ninety eight right there are so many similarities right now booming economy what's going on right now in fact our unemployment rate is much lower than it was a Nineteen Ninety eight\nAnd you have the president well he's not as popular as Bill Clinton\nBut then again he actually isn't specifically the issue here except that they made him the issue right we've had the ... we've had to get Trump effort since before he even took office\nThat would certainly do it hasn't risen to the level of impeachment yet because Democrats are not in control the house that could be analogous your throat cabin on the mix maybe that is too\nSo this is all something that I'm working on right now is there a chance that Republicans really might gain in Congress this year\nIs that is that moment of done that inflection point in American history where things are different\nHistorically Ninety two percent chance that Democrats win more seats than not this year but there's an eight percent chance that they don't for a reason are we in that window will continue that conversation coming up next I'm Brian mud in for

had her finest moment in fact\nAnd I'm Still shocked by it be fined this moment I think any United States Senate or is that at least that I have witnessed still almost beyond belief\nOr if you did not catch Susan Collins her speech\nEarlier today it is definitely a must listen and watch it so I take it in for sure uh she really ended up ...\nAnd uh want to get some of your thoughts let's go to nitty in Anchorage, Alaska and and then they understand that uh you're a you're a little higher Lindsay did not do that at this point\nWell just from the standpoint Brian of a senatorial moment because I think quite Lindsey there last week it wasn't on the for the Senate didn't have all the trappings but Lindsay made those other members on that Judiciary Committee eat it eat spinach\nOkay ... exactly what they need to hear I don't think they pay attention to it but he took a stand in the heat of battle he didn't wait to see which way\nThe wind was blowing that's kind of way I look at it and I think and I'm going to say that um [noise]\nThe the never Trump hurts which Susan Collins was one researcher mccaskey was one and Jeff Flake was one I think that they had seen the attendance at Trump's rally they he's been had four or five I've lost count he's like the Energizer\nBunny [laughter] they they and\nEnthusiasm in those rallies when President Trump would mention cabinets name I Am sure you heard that too\nUm and so I just I I citizen Collins for her speech today but I really wanted to say how much I admire Lindsey Graham for really having them for the kid there to\nReally say what needed to be said to those members of that and Judiciary Committee they were acting\nUh well they are they all have their Spartacus moment I think [laughter]\nBut but actually something you can be proud of but you know I Would agree with you as a probably Lindsey Graham spiders moment as well are you talking about the the ... ... eastern time tomorrow we're going to have this vote\nAnd uh it was ... o'clock eastern time that Lindsey Graham a week ago yesterday ended up by having that particular moment where it's better now\nRespectfully disagree with you just in terms of him influencing in this particular case Susan Collins she was so principled and detailed as she laid out I don't think there was anything that she was going to be swayed by by virtue of simply be\nPragmatic yet emotional William Lindsey Graham ah but ah but ultimately I have to take anything away from him it really was a pretty incredible moment but speaking of Lisa Murkowski I'm interested to get your take a given that you are in Alaska\nSo she voted no today the the heat is being put on her ultimately what are the implications in Alaska does she have a chance to uh to win her next election if she ended up going down this path\n[noise] well I I Wish I knew the answer to that Brian judging from the very popular radio show in the afternoon for three to six up here I listen most every day and believe me the people I Can't remember very many calls maybe one hand for foreign Lisa\nAll the other calls have been um [noise]\nUm we hope she votes for a ... a cabinet [noise]\nOkay it's going to be interesting to see what happens there I actually think there is an outside chance that she ends up becoming a boat in the affirmative tomorrow or I Know that the earlier today a in addition to her voting no to end debate she also indicated that he wasn't the right person at the right time for this country\nBut then she walked back through his comments later in the afternoon after she started getting some of the response in so\nUh she'll be an interesting one to watch tomorrow although which would likely be a formality which gives recovered by the way because you can go ahead and you're Lisa Murkowski in and vote in the affirmative because it's like an ultra the outcome almost certainly tomorrow All right let's go to Dan Dan is in Clearwater, Florida Dan welcome to

damage control things less of the damage to them that's what I saw I think it actually her ... her speech was scripted\nShe did not speak like the protests was written\nSo I don't I don't think that that was genuine I I think that they were really running damage control and trying to you know take the anger directed that they righteously have towards them and less and [noise]\nThat Dr Wilbur

side of judicial really\nThank bank\nPraised Kevin on one of his rulings and one of his books blah blah blah anyway here's the deal I Do credit the Palm Beach posed by the way for at least be somewhat honest by saying that he is known to jump on the liberal side of things let me give me an idea the media it sucks in this country All right and uh I don't have to tell you that but\nIt is really easy to information early and empirically tell you who in what John Paul Stevens is because anytime you could find a Republican in this case a lifelong Republican\nAnd give you an idea about John Paul Stevens former Supreme Court justice he is to the Republican Party\nWhat Steven briar is still ... to the Republican Party you go see the briar\nAnd then how liberal from San Francisco on the ... yes thing go Steven briar now why\nBecause they are heading to any little check of the Washington University school blah Supreme Court database went back and compared the voting records of one John Paul Stevens to other Supreme Court justices he served with guest who he broke with most commonly you guys did even\nImagined that and I can't even put a number two it or any John Paul Stevens the lifelong Republican Supreme Court justice who said that Brett Kavanaugh should not be on the court\nOn partisan split decisions during his time as a Supreme Court justice he was Seventy nine percent liberal Twenty one percent conservative\nAnd again to give you an idea Steven prior exact same split in fact ... step further\nWant to know how liberal John Paul Stevens who do not believe the Brett Kavanaugh should be on the Supreme Court how conservative this guy really is if you compare voting records and the United States Senate right now on partisan splits if there are forty US Senators forty\nBetter more conservative that are Democrats than jump all Stevens was that the Supreme Court justice said that was interesting you know two sides to stories one set of facts\nI think numbers are fun and I

people that hold the Baghdad that make the case for Debbie Wasserman Schultz\nSo it is the consider the source thing but I I Want to illustrate some points here\nThis is an excerpt from an article yesterday police union endorses Republican Ron disadvantage for governor for years after endorsing Democrat right\nLikes or from the story a major union for police officers to Florida police benevolent association is endorsing Republican Ron disadvantages for governor four years ago the Florida PBA endorsed the Democratic nominee for governor\nCharlie Crist anyway there's\nA lot of people's Charlie Crist Charlie Crist are literally has been everything politically in in our state if you're not familiar he currently has a Democrat that is a serving now the saint Pete area but uh anyway what's the last time he actually was a Republican governor in in Florida\nRubio ran him out of the ... what happened anyway I'm continuing\nAnd Wednesdays endorsement of just saying it is the PBA president said just Santas would be the kind of governor who would stand up for what he asserted are unfair efforts to malign bullies quote\nThe men and women of law enforcement want to tell Floridians better ... said this has our backs that's why I'm proud to announce that we have his back said the Florida PBA president\nAnd his endorsement of this and this is ... that police had been treated unfairly in recent years said the quote\nFrom the president of the or the police benevolent association as we've seen in the past few years police have been scrutinized for doing their job and kicked to the curb by special interest groups media\nAnd politicians whichever resulted in the rise of law enforcement officers being killed or assaulted and the line of duty he said and the my blood boil boils here but the the whatever you want to refer to this\nHose or\nThat pretends to be an objective journalist I wrote this garbage for this until he ended the article with this he didn't offer examples of how scrutiny of police has resulted in police being killed or assaulted\nI call myself down\nA morning show yesterday I think at one point I was actually yelling I had a mother said their children in the car but you know what this is that big of a deal because if we don't have good cops what happens in this country\nIt's game over its came over and\nPart of what made me so upset I noticed what was going on\nNot long after the whole Kaepernick thing broke was taking a look in in I was\nTracking violence towards police officers remember before the whole capture Nick thing even ... you had the Dallas Cowboys and they wanted to honor you know the the cops that were murdered the NFL wouldn't let them and all that and I started being more aware of what was happening to police officers in this country\nAnd I noticed that there had been escalating violence I actually started a weekly series that I Do here in South Florida\nThat tracks the violence against police officers and here you have someone posing as a journalist who has\nThe audacity to say he did not for example ... scrutiny of police as a result of the police being killed or assaulted\n[noise] well I got it for you you might suck at what you do might not do any homework\nThey want to because it would just prove the nonsense narrative advanced but here's what's real\nIn this story remember this is the for the police benevolent association and about politics is it they endorsed the Democrat four years ago for governor there Dorsey Roger saying is the Republican this year\nSo obviously\nIt's because it matters more now right now\nThey fill in the blanks here since twenty Fifteen five hundred and Seventy three police officers died in the line of duty five hundred and Seventy three to say last made a political endorsement\nOf those five hundred and Seventy three officers three hundred and forty were killed three forty\nKilled and until this week\nWe had in business the audacity of this person writing this article and forward about the ... police benevolent association with more officers dine light duty afforded than any other state in the country\nBut this is how bad it is and yes it is a specific to Florida but this is what's going on across the country\nAnd he has the audacity that he didn't offer examples of how scrutiny of police as a result in a place being killed or assaulted\nNow\nIronically it is exactly exactly what the president of the Florida police benevolent association was saying when he made the endorsement with being kicked to the curb by special interest groups\nBy media by politicians\nAnd it's exactly why I started a series that I did a couple of years ago and in the grand scheme of choosing sides we've now button put in that position yeah every now and then you're going to have a bad cop\nGet ... get hundreds of thousands of people from any background in any profession together and tell me you're not going to find a\nBad apple but

year\nWe had Seventy widows Seventy widows Seventy people that have lost their spouse\nAnd the line of duty we've got more than a hundred children that have lost a parent\nIn the line of duty stories
