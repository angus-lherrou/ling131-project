decision that we're the last defense against an invasion force an invasion force should echo from here to the border and to the heavens so there's that uh this brand rather should I go from here to the heavens cheers a mud Matthew I'm\nI ... well the ... the point is that the border patrol has to tell people not to come into the country illegally uh but what I Will tell you and many others won't is that they're they're abusing the process\nRight now by their not technically illegals and I we all need to understand is if they show up at a port of entry and they're from Honduras and they claim that they are incredible fear of their lives\nOr or the you know whatever the specific verbiage is that they're all using because they've been told this is what they should say they're not technically at that point illegals they will become illegals when they were led into the interior of the United states and they do not show up for their hearings or or if they're at their hearings they are\nTold that they must leave the country and they don't\nBut it's important we get all this right and they're not technically illegals if they show up at a port of entry\nOr even if they claim defensive asylum asylum laws are very deep I shouldn't say laws asylum process is very favorable to anyone who shows up in the United states and and claims that they have an asylum case so\nWe gotta gotta remember that uh she Jay writes a book about these bomb packages I Know it's too early to tell the monies that it was the Russians they know both sides blame each other and therefore thereby resulting in more political chaos similar to how Russia is paid for political ads on both sides\nAnd the twenty sixteen election promote disdain TJ my friend I I Can't tell you if you're right or wrong on this one I all I can tell you is that um\nYou know we don't know if we really just have no idea I'm being a way that we don't know who's behind this\nWe know that it's a it's a terrorist act and that's that's kind of where I have to leave it for now I I don't know the speculation at some point can lead you down a road of well let's just say that once it turns into more wild guess territory you're really not helping yourself or anybody else out\nSo I'm trying to I'm trying to withhold my found this and how you guys know that ... ... when they're tough calls and I feel strongly about them I'll make it right away\nAnd and I I knew right away that it was of the fix was in against Kavanaugh and that that was all hate that was a an ambush\nUm but you know that that\nThat this one I just can't tell you that I have enough of a enough of a sense of what's going on to to go to deep into it I'm stems telling the truth and\nGas is there a part of me thinks that if you were trying to create a lot of sympathy for the Democrats are and for the last right before an election that this sure ... everyone is thinking that in the back of their minds but that's not enough to say well that's what I really believe that's what the evidence leads me to believe is happening that's a different thing\nAries rides a brilliant analysis as it concerns the media's propaganda toward Trump\nThey'll sign a simultaneously say ... a Trump is in students pocket while saying he will start a nuclear arms race with Russia\nMaybe they're flipping out over Trump's handling of the show the incident try to create the narrative the Trump is in a K essays pocket because the king of Saudi Arabia because the narrative him being Russia's pocket isn't working out so well funny how you call the situation with cats

Daily Show and a and I I uh I missed the\nI missed the boat on this one um yes there was an attempted assassination of a U.S brigadier general Afghanistan insider threat Taliban infiltration this keeps happening and ... and they got a general a rustic and Afghan general\nAnd you know now they're going after senior military a very very senior military officers\nAnd we can't protect her very senior military officers the measures that that sends all the way down\nThe uh the chain of command is no one safe anywhere in Afghanistan now that that's the message\nAnd it just goes to show you that uh we are not look we're not we're in the war in Afghanistan my friends and we're not holding the line either an Afghanistan we're losing our area control was receding\nAnd we think that because we don't have that many of our soldiers doing frontline patrols every day that they're not\nQuite in the same you know they're they're not really in harm's way quite the way they'd be at other stages of this war but there's still a threat and if things go really badly then it's gonna be all hands on deck so to speak and that means our men and women are going to be the ones that have to keep ... from falling\nSo a tablet thank you for the reminder I did read about that story and a dose of research on it I I have also reached out just a you know to a ...\nThrough an intermediary is all is

matter downplayed\n\nAnd I'm not saying this is exclusive to the left\n\nNot saying it's such closer to the left at all we want to know who did this as soon as possible and I believe the FBI we'll figure this out because nothing exploded\nSo they have these uh these packages and these devices are in their original form\n\nWhich will make it much easier for them to track down ... they'll get the guy or gal the guys are ...\nAt least I Hope so I think so based on my ...\nThat's the experience of the department of justice they have a ton of evidence now they're going to be able to use different methods of tracking this down and they begin to pull strings and then the strings begin to pull the fabric the fabric begins to unravel and then they\nThey're able to track people down but they need to find this person or these people because they may do it again they may do more of it\nThat's all we know we don't know their motives we don't know their motives\nWell we know the motive uh obviously it's the threatened if not harm if not kill the people they targeted\n\nBut there's a lot of speculation out there now why why can't people just white particularly in the media\n\nNow you can see the question do building that somehow this is Donald Trump's fault because the way he goes and speaks at rallies and the language he uses about this that or the other I Am so sick of this you have no idea the president of the United states without question faces death threats all the time\nIs it because what the Democrats say about him is it because what Joe Scarborough says about him or Don Lemon says about him or Steve ... says about him\n\nThe other day the president said or rallies in a rally I think it was used in a says he's at nationalist well I'm not a naturalist but not for the reasons the Democrats on the left say he's a nationalist now we know what he means America First and so forth\n\nAnd they try to tie it to not see is up or ... or to stop these this is in the media\nNational socialist party notice when people proclaimed that their socialist they don't try to tie them to the Nazis it is nationalist socialist right they didn't say that\nAbout Bernie Sanders

on cable TV\nOn MSNBC and CNN for the most radical among them on the today show good morning America\nFor the most radical among them now point a finger at Trump would absolutely nothing to do it this
