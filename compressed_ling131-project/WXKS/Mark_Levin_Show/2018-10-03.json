with respect I think that you are\nI Can't say misinterpreting but I think that you are not properly ...\nHow a person like having all would feel under the circumstances\nI think that you're taking a lot of your outside observations about as you say preppy spoiled kids and and try and supposing that onto a man when it doesn't matter if other people have done terrible things when they're in prep school\nIt doesn't matter a fraternity brothers are off in a in coherently drunk and there's far too much sexual misconduct among them none of that actually matters\nWhen you're looking at the innocent or guilty of an individual did cabin on do this thing is there evidence to believe he did this thing I answer those questions no and no\nAnd I also think that your your being far too kind to

believe it I don't believe that her memory is accurate maybe she believes that\nThis happened to her but I Do not think that her recollection of events squares with reality that said Sally I Do like when people write in who disagree I Do like when people want to try to either convince me of their side or just have a different voice heard so don't feel like I'm In any way\nTrying to shut you down or shout you down I I just have to tell you I I strongly disagree with your entire premise on all of this\nUm or I should say I disagree with your analysis on all this\nRight hey buck a with a new FBI investigation look into the will of the new FBI investigation look into the new accusers background where we learn is lousy for ever had a substance abuse problem or a diagnosis of bipolar disorder or borderline personality\nWill we learn what she was like in high school and college or if she ever complain of any other instance of sexual assault or having been molested aren't these things that we should note to assess the reliability of her memories from thirty six years ago max\nLet me tell you uh I I agree in the sense that your question here is why is it that we don't get any answers about lousy for\nWhy is it that lousy Ford is a sacrosanct she cannot be cross examined she cannot be challenged her sexual history when she was ah in high school her sexual history in college or as an adult beyond that\nOf that can be discussed that meanwhile Kavanaugh can be trashed why is that\nBecause he's accused I'm Sorry but we have a system of justice that relies upon oppositional narratives\nAnd it's not just you get the first crack at somebody and then they don't get to come back and tell their side of the story or this is fundamental to our justice system we are letting it'd be abused in front of us right now because there are so many people\nThat just want to believe lousy for desperately want to believe in for reasons of politics for reasons of their own emotional attachment to the notion of sexual abuse is something that has not taken seriously I reject that by the way I think that's actually\nIt's taken very seriously there's a reason that sexual abuse in many different ... you know many different iterations is a very serious felonies people go to prison for a long time so I I reject this narrative of sexual abuse is not taken seriously which a lot of people seem to want to believe\nUh Jennifer I'd say their pocket cash listener here first thank you for being a voice of sanity and reason and being hilarious at the same time quick question maybe you
