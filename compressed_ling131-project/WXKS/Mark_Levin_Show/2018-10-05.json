linked nothing and the reason nothing's been leaked this because the Democrats have nothing to leak from the FBI report\nIt is as we said it would be\nWhen you have to adults testifying in front of the United states the public testifying in front of a Senate committee testifying in front of the media you've garnered more information from those two adults and you would garner from a background investigation from the FBI\nBut the Democrats were hoping that something would come up anything would come up\nAnd as I said back then it's a remarkable thing to watch the Democrats they hate law enforcement they hate law enforcement they hate the FBI they hate ice they hate the border patrol and yet they tried to use the FBI is a fig leaf\nAll through all through the ... the ah Coney unethical and activities\nAnd the other criminal activities by senior officials at the FBI\nWe had the Democrats telling us that we were attacking the FBI and over and over and over again we said no\nWe're attacking the leadership or the FBI call me now gone under investigation the number two under criminal investigation the number three under investigation on and on I've never seen anything like it but the men and women are the FBI or patriots the men and women of law enforcement part patriots\nAnd the Democrats cannot stand them even though they run the cities\nAnd oversee these police

past every regime\nSounds like the Democrats sounded during the Senate Judiciary committee hearings and today\nAnd the media in this country the media in this country no better\nThan the government
