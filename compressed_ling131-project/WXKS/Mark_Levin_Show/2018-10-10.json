Fox News hurricane Michael a dangerous category three storm it's now two hundred and fifty five miles south of Panama City Florida\nWas talking to Richard cement and also Richard Valdez earlier that great producers of the market live in show to talk about their winners and losers of what happened with a with a course today Kevin ... on the U.S Supreme Court number one the biggest winner I think is due process in fairness\nThe principal and old fashioned principle that the mob does not rule and that's a presumption of innocence applies in that subset of substantive and procedural due process must apply the second big winner is my president Donald\nJohn Trump not singing one more victory and his first what a twenty two months in office the Trump search scored a hundred and Democrats have scored zero\nThe economy is percolating like crazy the Mexico Canadian trade battle is won by Trump including South Korea next fall will be the God was he then said Beijing and communist red China that\nTakes out about five hundred billion dollars a year so it in the last ten years they've taken or something like five trillion dollars to build their country and at the end of the day they need us a lot more than we need them so when Trump gets done with the Chinese is going to be the same thing that happened with Canada Mexico and South Korea\nAnd now according rats and mice and they came out today that Trump's approval rating is sort of fifty one percent\nSo whether it's the economy immigration are federal judges I could not think\nOf a better president than Donald John Trump he makes Reagan almost look like a liberal because unlike Reagan and the bushes who were pinned cushions this guy fights back when Trump is hit its back Carter what he did on a Monday Night\nLast night with the Supreme Court saying that I hereby find you not guilty judge Kavanaugh you are an innocent man\nAnd he went after the Democrats with the other eight members of the Supreme Court sitting there and the Republicans to me it was beautiful it was wonderful this guy's got no backup and them and only has stack up it continues to teach all of us about winning in Trump's world it's about the fight and you're fighting spirit and your ability to be bare knuckle and think about this\nKavanaugh was a Yale middle aged judge who are educated and yell undergraduate and Moscow spend about twelve years on the second circuit court of appeals\nHe's not the kind of guy to fight like Trump but when they push Kevin off further and further and further cabin all\nKind of local looked over Trump and said that's my motto\nThat's the guy I Want to be they never imagined other wimpy middle aged judge from Yale\nHeaded in him to fight back and no holds barred straight parole or fashion because but Kavanaugh studied Trump he learned from Trump so all of his brilliance and eloquence all of his uh all of his grade school girls' basketball coach and you're teaching at Harvard would not helping all to win this fight\nUs people like Chris Wallace of Fox News who said after the testimony of that liar and she was a liar Christine for she lied about what happened at a maximum she was mistaken at a minimum we might go over that later\nBut Chris Wallace of Fox News said after she testified that it's over for the Republicans the Republicans had a bad day I'm a trial attorney I see it all the time a witness testifies and and you buy it hook line and sinker and then the other witness testifies and you say you know what\nI don't know what to believe now Kevin all he in a sense hypnotic laid took on Trump's personality any thought no holds barred bare knuckles and guess what Kevin all one by Trump rules he knows that if you want something in your life bad enough you gotta fight for justice Trump proved\nAnd ah he won the Supreme Court after\nChristine forward testified about the second front door and about afraid to fly and about their claustrophobia and how it changed her life\nAnd I thought okay that's under refuted evidence Kavanaugh get up and spoke and you know what I thought I cannot believe cabinet and then I waited for the next week to transpire and it did and the next week clearly demonstrated that Christine forward was not telling the truth well as she lied or not it's a different matter\nBecause she said there were four witnesses in every whatever witnesses refuted a story or had no memory of the gathering question whatsoever the therapists notes were critical to this\nThat she released to the Washington Post but not to the U.S Senate committee she said for boys tried to rape her when\nShe was in her late teens and the time was in the mid Nineteen eighties now\nShe says it was one boy\nAnd it was a in at the age of Fifteen nod or late teens and it was Nineteen eighty two not the Nineteen eighties and she flipped on that because in the Nineteen eighties Brett Kavanaugh was not even in Maryland He was in Connecticut\nSo everything she said at the therapist was probably accurate because she said at six years ago before politics entered the fracas\nSo when she said for boys tried to rape her\nShe she was in her late teens what Eighteen or Nineteen years old and the Nineteen eighties Nineteen eighty four eighty five eighty six\nThat didn't fit the scenario of Brett Kavanaugh so she flipped and change what she was saying in order to try to take Kevin down and it didn't work\nAnd the second front door was put in and twenty overweight and twenty nine because she wanted her psychologist slash therapist to have an office and the direct entry into her house into a room so the second front door was put in not because she was scared of only one exit but because a person she wanted to run out some of her house\nTo a small business owner a psychologist to have a direct entry way and of course the other thing was she was afraid to get on planes her boyfriend of many years testify they took single propeller planes all over Hawaii that she traveled to Haiti travel deal why travel to Central America travel to South America travel to Israel and travel to Europe\nHow is it does she swim all these places hell no she flew everywhere including on single propeller planes which are quite claustrophobic if she was so nothing she said at any relationship to reality and over the week delay brought about by Jeff Flake\nWhose last name by adjective describes his character refuted what she said and that's why Susan Collins put up\nOn Saturday about three o'clock and gave that great speech I never thought I Would say this\nSusan Collins is a profile in courage as is Lindsey Graham Mitch McConnell Brett Kavanaugh and of course the president Donald John Trump those are the big winners and now today Brett Kavanaugh as his first day on the U.S Supreme Court I'm sure he's going to do great\nBut do not think for a moment to the fight is now over it's only just begun you fool we've got four more weeks to go\nI cannot imagine and America when Nancy Pelosi in charge of the house and Chuck Schumer\nIn charge of the Senate and the investigations that would be launched and all the problems that arise\nSo tonight I Want to get your

that the life\nOf Brett Kavanaugh is now ruined his wife's life Israel and that his daughter's life has ruined morality guess what Ariel doom is very Kevin O's life is not ruined\nHis name is not

what they stand for my daddy was a marine John in Washington DC I get Marines presidents here do cutting them in ... John please go ahead\nAnd show them following this thing for intently from start to where it is now an absolutely I agree with your opening first off facts are stubborn things you know and\nYou know John Adams just guy back and look strictly at ... and you go off the values of the country that you don't even guilty it's absolutely mind boggling oh no kidding of course you know all this guy he's guilty\nJohn last night I watched some of the left as media today talk about how how unfair it was\nThat the president declared a innocent a bread Kevin isn't that what are you aren't you innocent until proven guilty and this wasn't the case but it just wasn't closes wasn't fifty one forty nine give me some small example Rachel Mitchell who I think that a lousy job is the price you drinks before the U.S Senate\nIt kind of walk a Christina for down to ... path when she oddly questionnaire about coaching a friend\nWho was taking a federal lie detector tests and now I'm watching Rachel ... said she must know something in what she knew what was that the ex boyfriend oh Christine afford and by the white Christina forward cheated on the ex boyfriend has told his credit cards but I redress\n... what what the reason Rachel Mitchell said those questions about coaching a a friend protecting a lie detector test\nOr the under oath to a sworn affidavit the boy printed Christine afforded the Nineteen Ninety said that she coached a friend of hers are female friend preparing to take us governors administer polygraph exam\nAnd soap practically everything that Christine Ford said was either a lie or a fall sewed whether it's the front door the fear of flying not taken airplanes whether it was coaching someone on a lie detector test\nAnd she did kill somebody on a lie detector test so Christine afford lied about little things that a lot about the big things and assuming she lied John what does that mean for Brett Kavanaugh's sanity and for his status does not mean he's innocent until proven guilty\nWithout a doubt I mean that is the only conclusion one could come to feel absolutely sad for the for the family and I feel a lot of fear of getting out of it actually oh\n[laughter] that's terrified because you're now take somebody a lesser degree or a lesser a common life whatever the case may be a you know sometimes they're just they're all coming back or something like that\nThere could be no coming back whether whether you know just the fear factor and it can be absolutely books at something like that you know gets thrown at someone and that's it life is\nWhat John Waters Brett Kavanaugh will go to get back his reputation you're in the marine corps if some other fellow marine a woman accused you of rape\nAnd there was no evidence that took place she didn't know where it happened I didn't know what had happened didn't know how it happened and the foreign witnesses she possessed applied to be witnesses turned out to be non witnesses because they didn't they didn't they didn't see what she said they saw\n... and here still found guilty about and bounce out of the marine corps where would you go to get back to your reputation\nRight\nOn [laughter] that would that would be on the road and wouldn't you know uh but then again I wouldn't get their due process went from such a thing\nAnd you know John I I'm a criminal defense attorney I've been in the attorney general's office when someone comes in and says I was sexually assaulted unlike many other crimes I tend to believe them if you come in to me and say you know what uh\nUh someone stole my Chevrolet I'm not going to question you to say wanted someone still for no it was a Chevrolet if so if you go in and say my left foot is hurting I'm not going to say well don't you mean you're right elbow no but when it comes to sexual assault\nTen to twenty percent of the time there are false allegations\nOf sexual assault that later on proves to be absolutely alive for example the Innocence Project has listed hundreds and hundreds of men who've been exonerated years later\nWho are wrongly convicted of sexual assault or Gregory counts and Van Dyke Perry uh two black guy spent thirty seven years in jail unfolds rape charges there was the host or university case were for college man that hubs or were chores and raping an Eighteen year old fellow students\nThey came out a year later she made it all up and it was a lie there's thousands of examples how a woman or man falsely accused as someone of a sexual assault for all kinds of reasons and all I'm saying is\nGive Brett Kavanaugh due process the right to cross examination the right to confront its accusers the right to be in the same room and look her in the eye which the Senate denied\nAnd now that we took ... you know Jeff Flake oddly enough it was a good thing it took an extra week because conservative media tore apart the story or seen afford improve that she was either a ... or a lawyer or both and they could prove that Brett Kavanaugh was in fact innocent and not even present\nCom or call eight six six eighty eight Bible that's eight six six eighty eight Bible

this\nPresident is not normal I hear about the norms of the presidency let's talk about norms a presidency going back to Bush forty one read my lips no new taxes was\nThat normal how about the eight years of ah William Jefferson Clinton sexually assault and Kathleen Willie inside the White House raping Juanita Broderick having sexual relations with numerous interns including Monica Lewinsky then he violate the norms of the presidency moving on to Bush forty three\nIncrease taxes increased Rosa regulations greatly enlarge the role of the federal government got us involved in a war in Iraq that caused four thousand of our best cost trillions of dollars Iraq has lost now part of Iran\nThe Bush forty three get us into the norms of the presidency is that normal then you had Brock Hussein Obama who won an MTV and talked about using cocaine and other illegal drugs while president on MTV is that the norm of the presidency\nSo please save me liberal media the idea that somehow this president forty five is violating the norms of the presidency\nThat John F. Kennedy violate the norms and the presidency when he passed off as a young in turns to\nOther male cohorts in the White House to perform oral verbal services on them was that part of the norms and the presidency when LBJ lied about the Vietnam War getting sixty thousand of my generation killed many murdered that Nixon violate the norms of the presidency\nWith water great in line did he violated about Jimmy Carter his mirror presidency violated the norms of the presidency so please save me the embarrassment of trying to convince me that Trump is somehow\nViolating the norms of the presidency is if Obama and Bush and Clinton\nAnd Bush and LBJ and John Fitzgerald Kennedy and everyone else violated the norms and the presidency please save me\nWas continuing our way of sharing and Downingtown, Pennsylvania sharing welcome to the ... show bleach chair and go ahead\nI I just wanted to um hey thank you for noting that list of people that were profiles in courage I totally agree with you I also wanted to add Chuck Grassley role he really had to hold the line on some pretty\nStrong personalities you wanted to pull any direction acreage of cars much trouble are great courage and I just wanted to ask him to the list and that was that otherwise I'm I really enjoy your show\nSharon thank you let me ask you shown as your question talking about the norms you know I'm Liz listen to a liberal media today because they think Trump last night violated the norms of the President's Day by being political in front of the U.S Supreme Court\nDid Kamala Harris violate the norms of the presidency how about Cory Booker the one with the crazy eyes crazy eyes Booker\nDidn't violate the norms of the Senate their behavior in front of Grassley in front of the nation Grassley cannot even make an opening statement into Kamala Harris and Cory Booker in the war hero Richard Blumenthal\nDid they violate the norms of the Senate and did the eight hundred people who showed up and about and I don't know how many two hundred arrest inside the Senate did violate the norms of the Senate do you think a little bit\nI think all violated annoyance than I think their behavior was extremely heinous and I think that you know age has now marker for maturity and I think it was terrible\nAnd another point and the third debate I can recall Trump answering a question about whether he would X\nAbout the outcome the twenties sixteen election and the third debate Trump several it depends on what happens and he didn't give a hundred percent yes answer\nHillary Clinton and the liberal media viciously attack Trump for saying three weeks before the election in November ... remember the eight twenty sixteen but he may not like it might not accept the election since the election\nAs Hillary Clinton and the Democratic party accepted the outcome of the twenty sixteen election\nAnd our I haven't met become what they criticized\nOh absolutely and worse worse because they are determined you can see the devotion and dedication to things that do not bring this country together in any way it's terrible it's really very very bad and I know as far as I say it's back\nHow about accepting the results of the election\nWhether it's the Russian collusion delusion or what whether it's all the other investigations because we have a foolish attorney general\nNamed Jeff Sessions who should have resigned as soon as he resigned from the Russian collusion delusion and as soon as she could not do his job as attorney general he should offered his resignation at that moment and right now the Senate seat would not be in democratic hands without Jones' character out of Alabama\nBut what happened is that that uh when Trump is criticized for not acting normally if this is abnormal\nIf this economy as a result of amoral abnormalities I say let's have more of it\nIf the southern border which has been guarded by this president is abnormal please give me more but if we have the trade deficits we used to have with Canada and Mexico and South Korea this president has corrected the trade deficits and the only reason the communist read Chinese are doing what they're doing is they're going after the Trump voters\nThe Trump base in states like Iowa where the president's going to be the night\nAnd and at some point the Chinese New dollars more than we need them at some point they're going to recognize that they rip dissolve for five hundred billion dollars a year and that's way too much so\nUp all this is a normal Sharon I Want more abnormal because if this is a normal I cannot think of something better than what we have right now\nWell I'm with you and I also did test the fact that they will not acknowledge anything good\nAny thicker every bit as good and that they will acknowledge nothing good that Donald Trump has done Donald Trump never sit in front of everyone and said you know what I'm I'm perfect you know he never did that so he tries\nHe tried hard hard working man for a orderly and it doesn't have to do it right I have ultimate respect for him and they will not acknowledge anything\nAt that too is sick today you know sure we got her run thank you

other side the Democrat\nBe as nice as you can wise you can't try to ... people why why you've just curious why you vote for for this person because the reason\nYeah because you know there's you know there's plenty of reasons not vote for him and just being is not just in about it but engage them and try to get them to talk a lot of people you know they they're bandwagon fans or whatever they don't really know what they're voting for they're just you know I Want to be part of the crowd so trying\nTo talk to me about ... even ... is that close could Ted Cruz actually lose the Texas Senate seat to a clown like beta O'Rourke is that possible\nOr it is possible I don't think it's going to happen though because um you know the betas got this Kennedy esque vibe about him you know young and you know he's\nA you know some people I guess finding physically attracted to eat different strokes for different folks whatever but um there's been a lot because Texas economy is so strong we've had so many people moving in from out of Texas\nAnd yeah there there's obviously some liberal natives here you know in Austin area and some other Houston Dallas\nA but most most of Texas is you know pretty normal solidly conservative normal there are no yeah yeah but ah yeah we've got people moving in her changing the demographics and so\nUh it's important for everyone to get every vote here in Texas we cannot let cruise blues we've not we've got to have him when\nSee what's happened in Florida is too many New Yorkers have moved to Florida\nAnd they're taking their virus in their cancers ideas with him from New York\nFrom the Empire State to the sunshine state they're taking too many New Yorkers are moving in New Jersey I Can't stand the place anymore and moving to Florida so Florida I think is kind of like a purple state at this point\nIs going to be hard for the for the governor when the U.S Senate seat but you know Scott ... is pretty good governor but nonetheless you bring up a good point that the goal of if they flipped Texas or Florida\nThen the country's done if we lose those twenty nine to thirty five electoral votes either one it's over with and and Trump can't get reelected heck a Republican can't get elected\nIf in Florida and\nNew York uh begin to be as one in uh Texas looks the same electorally as New York then we're done goes Texas and Florida with tempting permanently well\nI'll leave you with some good news or play I I was not a Trump fan okay I was pretty hardcore and for Ted Cruz for president and I have to admit I was dismayed by what happened and you know not that I just [noise]\nI wasn't a fan of Trump because I wasn't sure that he was going to be conservative you know and I was sure that it was so\n... and I look at it this way I I thought when Trump got elected he would run toward the center and kind of be a New York Republican and I supported Ted Cruz in the beginning 'cause I thought he was a real Bible believing conservative from Texas who was bright and smart and knew what he was going to do but\nDonald J Trump has done governance what Ted Cruz would have done and you have the star factory is going to be in Cincinnati on friday and I'm going to be with them a little bit on friday and I've been in his presence at these rallies\nTrump is a rock star it's like Elvis it's the Beatles it's Michael Jackson and Ted Cruz legit wherever you want to say\nDoesn't have the rock star status of forty five Trump is a rock star and there's the animal magnetism that I see president I think is an Iowa tonight he hopefully it will be out every day between now and election day\nAnd when he comes to town and in Des Moines Iowa eleven thousand on the inside and ten thousand on the outside and this Friday there's like an eight thousand seat facility he's going to speak on friday north of Cincinnati and Warren County it's already sold out\nAnd there's going to be twenty thousand people show up this guy's ... a conservative politics\nHe's done exactly what Ted Cruz wouldn't have done but crews doesn't have the magnetism doesn't have the charisma doesn't have the charm of whatever you want to call it but Trump is a rock star and if you have a shot Chris getting his presence go to one of his rallies\nAnd will back the Beatles circa Nineteen sixty fiber Michael Jackson circuit twenty over for or Whitney Houston circuit twenty three this guy's a rock star\nAnd when he shows up in your town it's a wonderful thing to watch and when you got that magic in a bottle that you catch with Trump you got to write that baby for all it's worth and this guy makes Ronald Reagan looked like a liberal\n[laughter] well you know if if it would have been up to me I still would have had cruising there but my eyes were opened and here's what miles rope into that God is in control not me and he knows what he's doing and I think\nNow that I've seen it happen that my faith is behind Trump as a president or not because he's the most godly man but because I I Believe that this is ... because I don't think it could have pulled off\nWhat and I loved it but I don't think you get pulled off thanks away Donald you know and nobody

and abetting I'm also against\nYou know forty two usa Nineteen forty eight is a statute that deals with one state authorities act or under act on their color if state law to violate someone civil rights\nThe mayor of Portland, Oregon is part of an unspoken conspiracy the object to which is to violate someone civil rights you have the right to travel and when these individuals' confronted Ted Cruz in a restaurant in a private restaurant on private property and then when authorities did not arrest those individuals\nThis happen in Washington DC\nThis was under color or a state law or city ordinances\nCity or state officials acted in such a way so as to deny the human rights\nOf Ted Cruz and his wife Heidi and so the answer is yes if we had a functional department of justice under Jeff Sessions\nThese things would be prosecuted for what they are which are hate crimes under color of state law and the fact is not ... not and the other thing that drives me crazy drawn\nIs that the national media doesn't cover this do they as a hate crime why don't they cover it can you imagine large numbers of radical individuals taking over intersections and a great American city like Portland, Oregon allowing only the people of color to go through and attacking white citizens'\nHow is it possible the mayor wheeler doesn't arise and say not in my city there's tape on Fox tonight of Portland police watching it going on and doing nothing about it because the mayor wheeler doesn't want anything to happen this is despicable this was wrong it can happen in America\nIs political gender to go forward or didn't even expect the governor to step up and say I'm going to bring up the national guard I'm gonna take my state back I'm gonna take my city back I'm not going to tolerate this maybe somebody above it needs to step in the federal government but we can't have America like that they have to do all this violence\nWhat what I think the mere Portland believes what he's doing is politically popular he's doing what the citizens of Portland want him to do an elected him to do it\nAnd so how is it possible that a great American city not in the south but Portland, Oregon allows in ... to take over city streets\nBlock intersections line in front of federal buildings making an impossible for federal agents to do their job and the mayor of Portland a clown affects ...
