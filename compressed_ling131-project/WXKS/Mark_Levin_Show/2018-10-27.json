and is this\nThe prime minister of ah Canada\nTrudeau young Trudeau chip off the old man's block Trudeau has said in the past I we we uh welcome aliens illegal aliens I guess he calls them undocumented migrants from all parts of the world we in Canada we're loving people we're compassionate people\nWe welcome all people hear some thinking to myself I have a solution to all this stuff\nA solution for the illegal aliens who were trying to come into the country illegally a solution for the Trump Administration and a solution for the Trudeau administration here's what we do\n[noise] president United States picks up the phone and he calls Trudeau and he says hey we got\nSeven to fourteen thousand people coming here legally I Know you support illegal immigration I Know your borders are wide open you've said it over and over again and you've said you're very compassionate about these things so here's what we're going to do when I get a whole bunch of greyhound buses\nAnd we're going to have as many of these caravan marchers as possible get on the buses and we're going to drive them you know the way Mexico does it lets these people go through their country and our country we can learn something from Mexico or we can and what we'll do is we'll put them on the greyhound buses\nAnd will drive them tour northern border and won't let them out\nIn Canada wants them these people want to leave\nThey ... they come from my lab to say that I mean if you're marching a thousand miles or two thousand miles I assume\nThey're how ... even though they're carrying their flags and in the United states\nThis president believes in law and order and enforcing the immigration laws so there you have your satisfy all three the illegal aliens wind up in Canada leaving their hell halls Canada receives them because their arms are wide open for them and in the United states we enforce our border and our immigration laws I think that's a brilliant idea miscarriages\nAnd on top of that look at greyhound greyhound makes a profit to they could probably use so that's my solution ladies and gentlemen for the\nCaravan ha a parade of illegal immigrants who are coming into our country\nSupported by left wing groups south of the border left wing groups within the United states funding organizations within our borders funding organizations outside our borders like in Venezuela and so forth\nBut

first time where supporters of a particular candidate have been directly or ... of the attack\nAnd attack regularly for a long term and you know and that's a thought things that people when they when they fix at five and then there are backed by that\nAnd that that's my point is you know they're going back and forth that if the if the rhetoric between um what Donald Trump that and and what the media and the Democrats say it it showed directed to I don't ever remember Donald Trump I'm doing something that the supporters of the Democrats the way that the\nDemocrat I think I think you're giving this not way too much credit CERN two thousand two he threatened to bomb a or a public utility because he was angry with a worker\nArm burglaries and so for that we actually to believe\n\nThat the political rhetoric causes these things I mean seriously ladies and gentleman this guy has a a long crime record including threatening to use a bomb in two thousand to multiple felonies\n\nAnd we get played all the time by the media really by the left more more more generally played all the time well if the president we keep them as rent has nothing to do with the president then as I pointed
