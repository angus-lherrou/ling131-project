that one off\nSo Adam writes a book I'll keep it short as possible your show last night hit home when it came to how the left has radicalized at a form of psychological warfare is now going on not just with prominent figures like yourself supporting the president or spouse or a conservative principles\nBut also regular folks like myself where if you outwardly express your belief in small

vote for Trump thanks for listening taking care of the fight daily shields\nHigh uh yeah I I think you've got the right idea if this is not\nYour path I mean if you do not actually work in conservative media don't suffer the consequences publicly of being a conservative unnecessarily now\nThat doesn't mean don't be a conservative because you're a conservative in how you act every day and how you deal with other people and how you view yourself as a citizen in this country are and you're also a conservative any actions you take to support other conservatives\nSo while it is certainly a helpful for me and for the show when I tell you please do check out our sponsors pleased to use those codes you know that is how you show would you care about and that is how you show what what matters to you or because especially in a businesslike radio it's about every single person who listens to the show\nAll the support that you get from every individual is what matters and that's what gives you a show so who you listen to who sponsors you go check out and also you know what you do to support those who are on the front lines of the ideological fight those with all the ways that

film business in LA\nI Would listen to your show talking about how immigrants are now know what to say at the border it reminds me of how we found pamphlets both in Iraq and Bosnia a when kicking down doors outlining exactly what they should say what country to go to you and where to go in that country how much money they can ask for and expect and what to claim\nThat is why Europe has been filling with refugees fleeing economy's not war Europe has been deliberately flooded by these people the efforts and pamphlets were professionally printed and uniform I suspect a similar effort is taking place out of our border it seems there's a deliberate attempt to flood the west with people who will not integrate\nA and deliberate effort among the intelligence services in Europe and especially Germany\nTo destroy any patriotic politician or effort to gain any power\nUm so there you go and if you never need a sofa in marina del Rey it's always year shield science or a sharp Gino Gino thank

Joe Kennedy was said to formally endorsed her this afternoon as she's running to the seat of retiring congresswoman Nikki Tsongas\nAnd and it it would be ... by All right because this is what a normal president does this you know what a normal mother or father would do to protect their house or a normal person would do to protect their business I mean this is no different than putting a lock on your door having a fence around your house\nHaving a a a worm system if you know that people are coming for you what do you do your gear up\nIf I Know that someone's coming to break into my house I Am going to get ready and I'm going to warn them that if they break into my house I Will shoot them I'm going to I'm going to gear up to protect my property which is exactly what the president's doing he's protecting the United states of America our property as\nCitizens now all of this I said to go back to a core point here I don't hate people that come to this country illegally I've said this coming in from work before or many of you know me I I play tennis and college I was ... almost every one of my roommates in college was someone from a foreign country\n\nMy best friend is from another nation one of my other best friend just from a another nation they both came to this country the student with a student\nVisa legally they didn't break in and they didn't come in a caravan they didn't chant they didn't yell and they love America and the both of them are still here and both of them love this country and respect our laws and make sure that all their visas and everything are in order they did it the right way\nI have no problem with anybody from any part of the world coming into America as long as you do it the appropriate in the right way and you wait in line and you do it the way it's supposed to be done I have a big problem\nPeople they just say I'm going to break into your house because I Want your TV I'm not going to go buy my own\nThe president's tweet today was what a strong advocate for a civilized nation says you\nKnow you look at what the media has done the last twenty four hours Donald Trump is standing with an evil nation\nIn Saudi Arabia again he hasn't stood with them he said we're investigating we're taking time he said the day before he got on to that helicopter go into a campaign rally ... it seems that he was killed and if that's what the facts they're out\nThere will be a very strong response\nFrom this country to Saudi Arabia more than words remember don't trust somebody actions not words when it comes to stuff\nAnd of course they say where's the outrage from Donald Trump it's one of the most irritating things about all of this story with with with Saudi Arabia and I'm using as an compare and contrast to what we're talking about with the with how the media treating him with his caravan of of ... of illegal immigrants coming to America\nYou have a president that they say must be outrage and there's an outrage enough done this one story but then they say this president being outraged over the immigrants coming here legally shows that he's on hands and he's a terrible person a should calm down and should be loving which one is it\nTo the media which one is do you want a president that defends his country and fights this country's interests like he's doing with these illegal immigrants care venting to the United states and then when he does that you criticize him for doing it saying he's on hands these crazy and he's mean an evil and he's so many of these poor little people meanwhile he says about Saudi Arabia which again\nI hate that this journalist was murdered\nI also hate that the media acts\nLike journalists are somehow more important than average people\nI'm In the media I don't think my life has any more important than anybody else listening I don't think my life has any more unique than any other person's listening I don't think that my job is it makes me any more significant in society\nOr should make me any more significant in society compared to someone else is just doing it normal hard day's work in something else that maybe doesn't get you quote famer or notoriety or whatever you want to call it the media is so self righteous that if one of their own gets tack they all come into ... and they all freaked out and they all go into overdrive over it\nAnd and the fake outrage is have you know I've been paying attention to the human rights abuses with Saudi Arabia do you not realize that they have killed women because the women were raped\nThey they give lashing to women who were raped because they were sexually in pure did they just allow women to drive and the only reason why they limited drive in Saudi Arabia is because they were taking so much heat for human rights abuses against women they are like All right screw it let's give them a license that will shut up the world\n\nEvery president in my entire lifetime has had a relationship with Saudi Arabia I didn't ... and Saudi Arabia has been brutal\nYou still in Saudi Arabia they ... they were literally take off a limb they will cut off fingers they will cut off risk they will cut off arms they will cut off legs they were cut off ... feet\nAs part of punishment\nThey will give lashing to old people and young people in the hundreds and hundreds of lashing ths they will throw people in prison who are dissidents or to criticize the government they been doing that for as long as I've been on this earth\nAnd I didn't see any of this fake outrage from the media when Bill Clinton was having relations with Saudi Arabia and I'm not talking about sexually I Know we have to clarify what Bill Clinton\n\nNo one was freaking out when Obama had relations with Saudi Arabia\nThey weren't riding these articles they weren't they weren't demanding more out of ... Brock Obama with human rights my point is the only reason why this one has gotten headlines and it's taken a life of its own because it was a member of the media and it's horrific what happened to him but his but but but the media who's acting like this is something we must\nWere I mean the media saying we we demand sanctions basically because of what Saudi Arabia did to this guy that's been happening to other people in Saudi Arabia for as long as they been alive who are writing these articles it's fake outrage\nI don't like how Saudi Arabia does things\nI don't know why we are an ally with them because they're extremely tough on terrorism and that part of the world and they do things that we don't do\nWe also need a place that we can land we also need a place that we can fire we also have it for oil interests whether you like it or not Democrats or Republicans have agreed that relationship with Saudi Arabia is incredibly important\n\nThey've agreed that it's important they all said it's important Obama agrees with Trump and Trump agrees Obama Obama agrees with Bush Bush grades with Clinton Clinton agrees with the other Bush and the other votes agrees with Reagan Reagan agrees with\nJimmy Carter we've always had these relations with them\nAnd so now because they do something they've been doing my entire life and it was ... towards a member of the media now we're supposed to put in sanctions and change American foreign policy\nWhen we've known that this is the only been dealing with all along\n\nI gave you that compare and contrast so now how Donald trumps the villain because he threatened to send US military to protect America's border and they said this is too strong this there's two main meanwhile they're saying we want\nYou to be mean and we want to be strong with Saudi Arabia 'cause we demand at because one of our own was ... was murdered which one is it\nHow is it the same demeanor from the same guy can be one eighty from one another all based on your perspective although I'm a journalist and I'm going to be bigger and better than you are and most journalists believe that they are better that their life is more important than your whole life\nMost journalists are self important\nI Can't use the word I Want to use a\nI Would argue that most journalists in this country especially those that you know they they throw the word journalism around like they are better for example than even talk shows are commentators well I'm a I'm not as commentator I'm a journalist I mean get over yourself\nI hated this happened I hate to this journalist was killed but make no mistake about it if you're writing articles freaking out over this demanding sanctions you as a journalist have not been doing your job as a journalist paying attention to what has been going on in Saudi Arabia your entire life\nSo spare me the fake outrage\nAnd I think the president it's America threatening to send the military to block the the migrant Caribbean are illegal immigrants heading nights it's America is what the president should do regardless of party you don't welcome all breakers you don't you know I mean what what what is the media wants Donald Trump to do what does it and I know what the left one Sunday but I'm saying that's directly the media\nDo they want Donald Trump to go down to the border and and and make a ... a great sense\nWith big doors open those doors in hand these people blankets in waters and say please come into America\nAnd break our laws and be a drag on our society and don't go through the proper steps\nAnd have no respect for this country and let me give you a big warm Donald Trump pug\nWon eight seven seven\nThree one thirty eight eleven one eight seven seven three eight one thirty eight

Harris is saying OK Obama phones aren't enough anymore to get somebody to vote for me because people can actually pay for their own darn phone bill now\nFood stamps or not enough because people are walking away from food stamps or we are seeing record numbers of people fall off of food stamps because they're actually getting good jobs where they're being employed in a great economy and they're providing for themselves government aid to keep people in poverty is not enough so now I gotta do something new I got to tell you that you still need more help from the government\nAnd I'm going to do it because of a website called bank great dot com that found that more than half of Americans cannot afford a five hundred dollar unexpected expense\nLet me just explain to you how worked this logic is this idea is I'll go back\nTo her first part of our proposal she said American families making Ninety nine thousand nine hundred nine dollars a year\nCould be eligible for a monthly tax credit of up to five hundred dollars or six thousand dollars a year\nAnd the reason why she wants to give me that money every month is because she says you don't have you haven't saved a five hundred dollars for an unexpected bill that could come in with a rent increase of medical bill or childcare so she wants to give you a government subsidized money\nSo that you making nine hundred nine thousand dollars a year have an extra five hundred dollars so that she can pay for your unexpected expense\nNow my my quick question for you is this what makes you think that if you give somebody\nWho's making nine hundred or Ninety nine thousand let me make sure I say this summer correctly 'cause I said it wrong a moment ago so people on the left will freak out so that said it wrong so I'll correct it right now are calm down\nYou're making Ninety nine thousand nine hundred dollars a year\nAnd you can't save for five hundred dollar unexpected expense you're an idiot\n\nWhat makes you think that idiot who's making that much money is going to take your government money\nAnd then go Oh thank you you just said me for my unexpected next expense of five hundred dollars I'm going to save that money because at the same dumb a hasn't saved five hundred dollars of is Ninety nine thousand dollar a year job\n\nMemory when we had the tax credit that came out the Bush tax credit member that what happened everybody took their tax money and they were they deal with it they went out and bought a ton of crap and boost the economy and George Bush and those economists rent 'em or right people didn't save that money they got extra money they went out and spin it right away\nGo look at the stats communal airs she knows that they're not going to say this money for five hundred dollar unexpected expense they're going to take this money immediately just spend every dime of every single month on average\nThe idea that someone making fifty thousand dollars a year if you give them an extra two hundred and fifty dollars a month of the government's money which is our taxpayers' dollars subsidizing people to make under a hundred thousand dollars a year but there are now going to say that money every month for an unexpected medical bill or child care you're an idiot\n\nTwo hundred and fifty dollars a month is not going to save someone's life it means that they don't know how to budget\n\nThis there's nothing more than buying votes this is not about ... and the fact that you're doing this under the under a survey from bank great dot com is the reason why we need legislation in this country which she announced today\nThat is going to save America's middle class by giving them extra money among subsides from the government that now they're going to save that money and not spend it on whatever the crap they're spending their money on now that they're going to become more responsible with that money compared to the other a hundred thousand or making your ... is just liberal and competency added\nBiggest form you can make\nBring this to a ... a family level if I'm making Ninety nine thousand dollars a year and I called my dad and said dad I man I had a flat tire this morning can you can you let me borrow two hundred bucks I don't have it\nMy dad would tell me to drive on the darn fair and get my house in order in my life in order and stop being a screw up\nHe would not loaned me the money because if I'm making Ninety nine thousand dollars a year he would say you're an idiot for not saving any of that I Am thousand dollars a year if I was making fifty thousand dollars a year to use her other example\nAnd I had a flat tire and I call my dad or my mom and I said hey mom cook I'm only making fifty grand\nI just had a flat tire I have no extra savings I Can't deal with this unexpected tire expense can you please send over five hundred dollars or two hundred and fifty dollars to use their math\n...
