that's just not a defensible position that because he was snappy\nWith them when they were calling him a gang rape is that's worse than ... than that that's just not it intellectually curious position and so for somebody who takes the position in\nGeneral as Tom does um that there's a lack\nOf intellectual rigor among the Trump supporters I look I think that uh I think he's going down the wrong

Republican but he actually I think is no longer identify as Republican\nBut he has to be a Republican he used to read the Daily Caller now he switched to the daily basis I think that's what happens when you go from being a Republican to a non Republican\nYou switch Daily Caller the Daily Beast and ... the good guy and I've known that for a while he's on with Brooke Baldwin Mary Catherine ... friend of mine also in never Trump Republican she has not renounced the Republican name she writes the federalist she's also um they're both paid CNN contributors\nAnd they're talking about the instability that we're seeing in this country and we're talking about the violent protests that we saw in the streets after the Kavanaugh hearing but frankly the violence we've seen for the last two years since the middle of the twenty sixteen election\nThe things that we saw against Trump voters at Trump rallies that were instigated by the left the things that we saw remember the antifa people following the Trump motorcade into a hotel and hopping over the freeway barricades to get into the hotel where he was having a fundraiser\nDo you remember the mobs on the campuses of UC Berkeley and other places across this country when Ben Shapiro of all people shows up to give a speech you know little mild mannered Ben Shapiro is causing a bonfire\nAnd the bonfire bunch of parents ever been around involve marshmallows and small cars\n\nIn the more the words of Billy Joel we didn't start this fire\nThe left has been doing this for the last two years and now they're disrupting us when we go to dinner we've got Maxine Waters telling people to get in our faces and disrupt us wherever we go so Brooke Baldwin host these two never Trump hers to talk about what's going on and listen to how it went\nWhen you see people like Ted Cruz getting chased out or restaurants by a mob\nNot going to use the word ... totally ... it is without a doubt that there's no other word is that they put a stop on non ... well we saw in Charlottesville, Virginia to August they go\nOh isn't that the life when she was so ready for that by the way did you hear how she jumped right on it you know when you go on television you often delivery you're talking points ahead of time you say yeah you know I go on a Fox a lot I'm Tucker Carlson and ... and bring him a lot a Stewart Bernie and they always say you know what your point of view give us a couple of lines as the host knows what's gonna happen\nAnd she was ready for the mob word right she jumped right on it and then she had her ... joined her she got her one rejoined her well we saw a mob in Charlottesville I mean honestly if if Matt had been a little less politically correct he could have easily immediately said well now which is that are you talking to the white nationalist racist mob which was a mob or the antifa mob\nWhich was also a mob I remember two mobs in Charlottesville\n[noise] uh but he did not do that the way the media reports on these things though you know they all whenever there's a protest from the left\nOr my friend Chris plants who was also a radio host national radio host\nHe uh he pointed out that uh they always report these has mostly peaceful in the mostly peaceful protests it's always a a left wing protest is described as mostly peaceful in the mostly peaceful protests of ... and the mostly peaceful protests on the campus of UC Berkeley in the mostly peaceful protests following the inauguration of Donald Trump\nIn the ... if they're mostly peaceful that means there are a little bit violent right\nRight I mean that just by definition if you're mostly peaceful means you're not entirely peaceful and that means you're actually a little bit non peaceful or violent so I mean maybe Matt Lewis what is that well yeah we did have that poor woman lose her life down in Charlottesville but you know the protests were mostly peaceful that was mostly peaceful mob\nIn Charlottesville but I don't think Republican would have taken up the right way because listen to how the conversation continue\nWhat we saw chasing right what about the people who were at the Supreme Court banging on the wall what do you call that\nCivil protest or is that a lot I think it's ... yeah and if there are the party as we call it um out for sure come on let's they serious\nThat so that's Mary under and ham jumping in there and and by the way at this point it's a visual wrote balls and actually puts her head down because she can't respond because she didn't say she didn't think she was gonna get pushback she didn't have another rig joined her the only one she had prepared was the Charlottesville sign of what a and then she goes on to say if you can play that are real fast Richard\nLennie Lennie Lennie will pass the N. word because I feel like that as part of the the weaponization of of what's happening now ah\nThe N. word and the weaponization of it that's right the N. word is mob and he ... he now says and she's not the only one says that Republicans people on the right Trump is weaponized saying that word\nAgainst Democrats against the law you know by calling a mob mob that's weaponized saying the word mob well she's partly right actually in a moment I'm going to actually play some audio from President Trump at a rally\nWhere he first raised this issue and uh and and she's apparently right in the sense\nThe word is being weaponized in so far that it is properly describing exactly what's happening in American politics today [noise]\nAnd it's being weaponized in such a way that it is ... devastatingly effective against the Democrats that's why CNN doesn't want the word used that's why the Washington Post doesn't want the word used that's why\nNext thing we know Facebook will start a silencing you if you take the your own social media and start calling a mob mob because it's correct\nAnd it's working because no normative American wants to vote for the mob party and put them into

could have done that\nBut they didn't they actually encourage it they say this is their base they have decided that there is more power aligning themselves with the mob right now than in condemning the mob\nThat's how all those protesters that were in the gallery of the Senate screaming during the vote or jumping up and creating their demonstrations during the comedians they got there because

change right\nNow today and he has not and this is the resistance these are the Democrats Chuck Schumer he said he said going into this administration that he was going to make every single appointment of fight to the death\nAnd and they would demand debate they would demand the time needed for you I think it's something like ... every single nominee that requires Senate confirmation or if they want to if they want to hold up the works they can put all of these roadblocks in\nThat end up being like Seventy hours of debate for each one and of course the ... in the past they haven't done that they'd been deferential and they've said listen every president deserves the right and opportunity and leeway to put people in place that he has put in place and and selected to be put in

office in the majority of the house and Senate our goal is done properly as a conservative is to relinquish power from the federal government to give you the power back\n\nWhat you do when you see the president's ability to deregulate so many things and cut down regulations and the EPA\nAnd in the U.S in the Interior Department and other parts of the government where they had slowly and in the city was taken so much control from you and your lives in your desk news or your state's rights to rub your affairs and run your lives the way that you see fit they have been taking that\nAnd holding on to that power in Washington DC that's why you use those words it comes naturally to the left we're going to take back the power\nIn twenty seven days and if not we will take to the streets where we can't

protest I go on the lights are the marched out of Washington in January it's a piece called much how many skiing and\nAnd then he sees all those stations cover that much knowledge it's a piece called march\nYou got almost a million people showed up there this past year yep Cabot I've been doing it for a long time okay we should march on Washington peacefully surprised the senators and representatives not tell them when it's going to happen on page down there and get\nIn the ... before you do and I will let you get your the thing but it's you know you're so right in pointing out the march for life you know I I I live in Washington I'm able to see the march for life and you're right it happens\nUsually or the third or fourth week of January it's usually bitter cold out there\nIt is usually close to a million people you know you saw the a video of the of the screaming Mimi is in the streets or the Saturday after the confirmation vote for justice Kevin rate you saw the video coverage of that nonstop on the news or do you know how many people were actually there ...\nProbably two hundred ... a little more than that I'd say it was between a thousand and Fifteen hundred but they had the most generous camera angles on them to make it look like the streets were just just overflowing with outrage and and and it wasn't\nThe but you're right you're so right how the march of light doesn't march for life doesn't get the coverage here's my question though we don't march I mean we're we're conservatives were good for maybe one march a year and it's the march for life maybe a second march\nUh here and there but usually eating that's not our style right we don't have the big Soros groups who were handing out walking around money and passing out the pre printed slow sides\nTo march ... do you think we have it in us do you think that will set our jobs aside in our in our in our families aside so that we can all come to this God forsaken town Washington DC in March\nOr do you think that we let our voices be heard by actually being good Americans living our lives\nIf we do not do that we do not get down there and present are cases these people that are

grain of what if I see a study and I said well that can't be true that makes no sense my entire life history and every single person I Know in my life and everyone that I've ever talked to a informed me that that is all a load of of of steaming dog do\nAre generally speaking then uh I I go with my instincts and I and I disregard the study this one though\nI find fascinating and I think that it makes sense\nBut what I'd like you to tell me is why\nWhy do you think this is true American men actually favor female politicians\nOver male politicians midterm elections are just around the corner and so it could be a potential turned the tide in American politics when it comes to gender says this skewed article from study finds a record number of women are running for Congress and there may never be a better time for such a breakthrough anew\nThey find that both men and women prefer female politicians over males a survey of fourteen hundred American men and women over Eighteen connected by researchers at the Steven's Institute of technology and\nI won't be bogged down in a lot of the uh various analyses that they do here but I I Will point out this because I find this to be a sort of the most important part\nOf when it breaks it down between a Republicans and\nDemocrats or this is fascinating ah Democrats Democrat men specifically tend to favor a female politician mailed Democrats\nWill favor a female politician\nBut when it comes to Republicans Republicans can go either way Republican men and women are fifty fifty they don't have a preference one way or the other you know now me if I'm looking at\nTwo Republican candidates and they're pretty much on paper the exact same and and in terms of their their a resume their track record it it is it I'd have to flip the coin between two Republican candidates and one's a man and one's a woman\nI'd probably go for the check I'd I'd probably put the baby up there I don't know why I got I think\nIt makes us look better when we have more women up there and frankly speaking generally speaking for the most part in in the modern era of the Republican Party some of the most ... nations fighters\nFor the conservative cause have been women I'm just more impressed\nBy them and I think they're used to take in the ... a little bit more and they give it back a little bit better\nI think men are are are are are too easily cowed by the media they oh they don't want to be called names they don't want to be a a oh don't call me sexist don't call me racist oh no no I'm I'm going to do whatever I can to make sure that the media is my friend for the most part I'm speaking in general terms that's what we do and talk radio\nBut women see for a woman to be a pro life true red blooded conservative woman in American politics they hurt at all and they don't give a damn really the life I had\nFight my way and the professional world being married for decades raising kids raising ... and you think I'm going to be concerned about\nAbout a Don Lemon calling me a name about Lawrence O'Donnell not approving of me please I've given\nBirth\nI don't know I Do need to worry about you I've been through it all but I I tend to want to put the baby in there\nAnd I like the checks generally speaking generally speaking\nUp but I Do find it fascinating that when it comes to Republicans that conservatives it doesn't they don't show a preference\nWhich truly shows that it's the conservatives who don't judge people by their genitalia but don't judge people by the chromosome or make up we actually judge people based on who they are the character that they bring forth\nWhere a Democrat men they're like oh well if it's a woman you betcha because I Want to show how woke I Am I'm I'm I'm more feminist and Alan Alda just wait I'll I'll you bet ya\nI think that this is the way you tell me I'm interested in your take on this eight seven seven three one three at one one but I think that that generally speaking Democrat dudes uh they they want to show women\nHow incredibly wonderful they are looking hardly ... I mean you couldn't have found a\nBetter Democrat then Harvey Weinstein he exemplified personified the very model of a male Democrat in the United states of America he gave the all the right causes he raised money for all the right candidates\nHe was pro choice he he's never met an abortion he hasn't liked\nHe made sure that he was in the forefront of every liberal causes in America because that was his suit of armor that was his protection\n\nHe was able to be as as abominable and sexist and horrible and despicable as a man can be but as long as he gets the where the mantle of feminist liberal Democrat\nWho checks all the boxes on the list of the causes the support and the candidates that you throw money at and raise money for well then you you get a free pass up to a certain point\nIt makes sense to me this is this is a Democrat do ... ah get the ...\nSay they they they can walk into what a coffee shop and order the right kind of ... and and\nWhere they are pro choice buttons and have a conversation with a barista about how they're going to the uh save the spotted whale rally tomorrow\nAnd uh that's they're opening line\nThat's how they get their checks most of 'em
