national TV at a fundraiser instead George Bush hates black people no one said that he was not reading then there wasn't a black Democrat in America\nWhen he said that that would have said this afterwards tell you what is what happens when negroes don't read I\nThink about that Kanye West is what happens when negroes don't read I Would argue that is an incredibly racist statement I Would argue that's a perfect example of modern day slavery from bakari sellers\nNow in ... west says this after Hurricane Katrina listen to it\nThe most tragic loss of all George Bush doesn't care about black people\nGeorge Bush doesn't care about black people did you hear the car sellers say this is what happens when negroes don't read snow you didn't hear it you want to know why because that was okay to be said on the liberal plantation of owning African Americans like modern day slaves\n\nYou will get what modern day slavery is in this country what is it\nIt is a party that controls the thoughts and the minds of African Americans it is a party that demands that African Americans don't succeed but fail so they're dependent on their government aid and they keep them in those poverty at high poverty high crime failing schools\nAnd when you\nBring up that you want these kids to be out of failing schools what do they say\nThey say no\nBecause we've got employees that are black working in the schools in where unions as teachers and you can't destroy public ... education I Would agree with that you can you've already done it so impossible for me as a white Republican destroyed public education you guys have already taken care of that on the left\nI Would argue the left doesn't mind that young African American kids are in failing schools\nBecause that keeps them on their plantation\nThat keeps them in modern day slavery and so what happened was as you have a I I I'm referring to the car sellers and what he said you're a negro\nWho went from living on the plantation miss producer once you play that audio get this is Kanye West while living on the plantation talking about George Bush after Hurricane Katrina\nGeorge Bush doesn't care about black people\nHe said and I quote George Bush hates black people and everybody clapped\nEverybody said Kanye West is a great black man who's calling out an evil white president and it was okay to say that on that you're on that day because that was words that were okay to say on the Democratic plantation\nThen the ... comes out in ... start singing for himself and starts realizing hey this this world I live in slavery is not very good\nI I'm seeing massive crime rates in my hometown of Chicago which apparently is moving back to I'm seeing poverty I'm seeing a kids that are getting a good education I'm seeing all of these things and he starts questioning the plantation owners which is the Democratic party he starts questioning the rich black guys\nWho are running the Democratic party who are telling them\nThat no no no no you need to stay in poverty because well take care of you there I don't know you don't need to think for yourself no no you can't even have an id to vote we're going to make sure you can vote without id because we don't even expect you to have an id how racist that mentality and then ... says you know what\nI'm going to be independent I'm going to be independent thinker I'm going to come out and say that I like black unemployment rate it all the time what I like a president that wants to talk about creating jobs the African American community and set of offering up welfare checks and food stamps\nAnd he does it and then\nThey reprimand this man who got off the Democratic plantation tell you what is what happens when negroes don't read\nHow is that not the most racist statement\n\nIs it not racist because the Democrat says it not racist 'cause the black person said is it not racist because\nIt's supported by all Democrats\nThe same Democratic Party that says Donald Trump's treats or or or her horrible the same Democrats say that Donald Trump bullies people and it's terrible that same Democrats today they're sending out tweets about this being national\nComing

sit\nDown in the back of our black bus and our black party in our Democratic Party and you're saying what we tell you to say\nAnd what you're going to say is George Bush hates black people and you're

... don't forget Kanye West also as a uneducated black man now because he's supporting Trump Scalia was\nWhat happens when they grow don't read 'em and then we have this now and now Donald Trump is going to use it in perverted and he's going to have somebody who can stand with mythic pictures\nGod [laughter] let's say and\nBlack folks are about to train Kanye West and the racial draft okay they've had it with him and he's an attention war like the president he's all of a sudden now that the the model spokes person\nHe's he's the token negro of the of the Trump Administration this is ridiculous and no one should be taking Kanye West seriously he clearly has issues he's already been hospitalized he's already been hospitalized ha ha ha ha ha ha hospitalized\nWho's already been hospitalized so we're going to slander do because he doesn't agree with us want to eight seven seven three eight one thirty eight eleven wants to get to your phone calls on this one Madeline you are on the marquee event show than Ferguson filling in an eye hello\nAnd thank you so much and like you're doing an excellent job thrown into mark\nThank you I appreciate that\nThat you um I have two comments one I Want to let you know first of all that I suffer from depression and I had a suicide attempt a number of years ago I Am doing somewhat better but I'm a couple of years ago I realized that I was probably living a little bit ahead of my time and that society was going in this direction as a whole\nUm even though I had depression I didn't have any kind of psychosis or thoughts disturbances but when I started winning and mental health housing and I spoke out\nAbout somebody of uses that were going on\nAnd some of the you know quake nut rolls and what have you all of the sudden I seem to have like sports disturbances although no one could that explain to me what it was prior to that no one ever thought it had anything but you know mental illness from depression\nUh then they made up story that I was violent and I got kicked out of two places even up to the age of forty four years old I never had any kind of history of anything on there and you're homeless twice I've lived in my car but it's also suicide prevention month\nAnd I think by making it sound as though ... what kind of mental illness whether he guys left I think it's not even an issue because as you said they had nothing to say that about him the four of them spoke out about Bush [noise] it makes it very difficult I think the young men in particular\nWas and it was an email today was it yesterday if I'm not mistaken mental health awareness day\nIt's a whole month you know how it is unfortunately a lot of there's a month to everything now they must be honest you know but it's supposed to be\nTechnically we're just and just that people know that we were when we make it clear what it yesterday was world mental health day two thousand Eighteen World Health a world mental health day uh it's it's on October the tent that's the reason I say this is where's the compassion and and I\nSay this first of all thank you for your sharing your story and I'm I'm so thankful that you were unsuccessful in your attempt to take your life uh I ... my best friend in college um took his own life and it is something that sticks with me and and all of our close friend group ever since and I have\nGreat compassion for\nThose that suffer with mental health and it's something that we shouldn't make fun of but to to score political points with Kanye West as the left is doing saying you know we're clearly and again they say that the president's taking advantage of a man who clearly has mental health issues as a\nToken a black man uh and and there and he's taking advantage of using him by putting them out there today no one said any of that when Kanye West came out and said George Bush doesn't like black people\nBecause it was a narrative they wanted to be out there it was the narrative that they want it they they they were OK with that narrative then\nYou are on the Marco venture open for us when we did not go ahead\nStole my thunder but the uh uh President Bush hates black people man I was like I was all part of it that um they check this out so now Herschel walkers it'll be the next soaking negro because he said that Don Lemon ...\nUm I think it was horrible at these lessons are doing but that's a whole other thing is to talk about or colder\nEric Holder not only him I Will first she's the only attorney general to be a contempt of Congress but that's a whole nother issue\nWhen the Obamas gonna we'll you when you know you really going too far in show probably grab by the IRS and said you can't do this for quite yet we're not there yet\nUm but him Hillary Clinton Maxine Waters Democrat power base that's all they do is they're inciting violence and then they said in the in the means of\n... and then and then they act like they get they get all you know their paintings in a wide when they when you say they're acting like a mob mentality\nWhen you have people screaming and beating on the doors of the Supreme Court because they didn't get their way that's that's a mob mentality\nWhen you surround a senator like Ted Cruz at dinner or that the mob mentality when you go in and you can you do these eat in and sit ins and screaming in the hallways and you get famous people to show up and then they're asking do you want to get arrested and you say yes that's a mob mentality\nDeal with it I mean if you want to talk about being honest be honest with it yes we are acting like a bunch of children were acting like a mob yes we're out here to to seek out and destroy people when we think about the ... district mob mentality you have to have\nTo ... to ... to first of all\nYou have a woman that doesn't and Mrs Ford they didn't want her name to come out and you do it anyway so you say we don't care about you were going to use a canary we're going to force you to defend your story about sexual assault so hopefully we can find others it will say the same thing about Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd then what we're going to do is we're going to find people to say we had sex we had a boat in the eighties well wait we got to recant destroying their might never happen well he he he actually in high school was was every weekend making parties for gang rapes and gang banging and and throwing trains on women\nNo one else to say that but we got a porn star lawyer an Avon Audi that will that will act like it's a legitimate and we'll throw it on the news\nTo try to find out other women out there\nThat this is what I mean this is the left this is what they're doing right now this is the normal for them and the reason why they're doing this is all I or go back to what I said earlier then\nThere is not a single issue that Democrats can actually run on right now except for personal hate\nAnd and to turn people into villains so that you hate them\nThat's their only play you can't scare people on the economy you can't scare people in the war in Iraq and Afghanistan you can't scare people on on healthcare because you you are the ones that created the health care disaster\nYou can't scare people on Social Security Medicare Medicaid so the only thing left for you to do right now is to say this guy's a racist and you don't want to raise has to be in the White House Kanye West is mentally ill so you shouldn't listen to him if you're a black person\nYeah I mean it's terrible they they really have no platform well don't forget they also have to take away the tax because we have to take away your problems away um we also got to have open borders and\nI'm abolish ice high crime I mean that's what they have to stand on you know speaking about the mob mentality I challenge any of these people to walk down I'm downtown Portland or a I've got friends down in Austin, Texas you go to parks down there and it's nothing but a ... and they will seek to living heck out of\nYou you will get the antifa protesters this week that were directing traffic and yelling at white people is that none of my mentality is the Democratic party not
