point being even to the extent that we've seen people from a point of partisanship registered to vote like they're all Democrats even though you would think that every young person you hear all the time all the young people to go down registering to vote and then they're all Democrats well we heard from Joshua\nTwenty two years old Washington DC in biology last hour\nWho's a thoughtful conservative so that can happen in DC well it can happen other places too and so don't be surprised that's part of the story beyond it you've got to think about what's happening here and there is a lot a lot to feel good about\nFirst he is you take a look at the economy we have the best economy in a generation I never faulted millennials for buying into the hope and change bull crap they didn't know better they went through school here in front of a bunch\nOf people who didn't get in the education establishment they get out there and go yeah this really does suck the hero bomb and they go with I guess he's right\nThey actually are given an opportunity to see what the US Economy is capable of and then he got the mines that are up and\nThat's the gun in the in the generation\nBut we have two Supreme Court justices tax reform the end up the Affordable CARE Act mandate what was that an employment rate in forty nine years in by the way record low unemployment for all demographics except Asian and white men yeah remember how it's all about the white men white man\nIn Asia and the only ... only demos out there that are not at a record low unemployment right out\nOh by the way but\nYou also have the biggest increase in the take home pay and thirty two years by the way I mentioned that I Believe on friday and I receive some notes from some angry folks on the left always happy to try to deal with him but I Want to\nLay the groundwork for that one once again because not hard to get there is a little math and it's easier than calculating the Pocahontas math if you're the Boston Globe listening\nIt works like this you take the overall salary that the average person was making last year you take a look at what it is today by the way it pays about two point eight percent base salary a year over year okay All right then you take a look at the average bonus that has been paid out so far this year\nWhen you do that it gives you a little bit over three percent\nAnd then you take a look at the average net benefit of the tax cuts which happens to be for the average fulltime employed person about Eighteen hundred bucks this year you put all that together and boom you get six point seven percent\nAnd complicated suicides histories one side of the facts Israel and by the way in the event that you're the angry left as that goes yeah but I see a benefit for the tax got well\nThat's because you know where your employer probably David about it which by the way by thirty million people who are in that situation where employers that make it adjustments you didn't make adjustments so if you're not seeing it it'll be reconciled when you file your taxes and congratulations you'll have likely given the government and interest free one but\nIt's still there because well over Ninety percent of people do benefit for the new tax law\nBut that's all the cool stuff right I mean all of that progress that I just decided\nTo ask yourself well if you voted for Donald Trump why would you vote against that in two years answer is if anything he probably has attracted more votes ... if he didn't nothing else no other accomplishments they always status quo from here until twenty twenty it probably gets re elected\nAnd again sixty five percent of presidents who run for re election in so if he were less successful than he is he would still likely be reelected and twenty twenty but here's the the next point and this is the under stated point\nI'm going to work on something conceptually before I give you some facts will do that in a little bit\nHow often were we talking about domestic terrorism thing about that how often did we have radicalized domestic homegrown terrorism in the United states prior to Donald Trump becoming president\nThat was a fairly regular occurrence wasn't it now you take a look at not having that problem\nYou take a look at not having Tea Party and and white people\nSpecifically oh these are angry white men men are singled out by the Obama administration as the number one focus on the watch list and instead you have people that do fit the profile or potential Islamic terrorism that had been number one domestically under the Trump Administration gets what\nDoesn't make the news if they stop it before it happens which happens a lot\nWhich happens a lot and the foreign policy success I'm not just talking about North Korea\nAnd the fact that to date we've released cat to Russia at bay or that Syria as much of a mess as it is has been dealt with about as\nPeacefully and with as little damage to the United states in our interest as we could have hoped for the spotlight and talking about all that might even talking about the trade deals that had been worked out this far to our benefit that are often under Scott\nI'm Talking about the eradication of ISIS but also the implications for other parts of the middle east now one of the amazing turnabout and all this had been Saudi Arabia\nWe actually had Saudi Arabia under the Trump Administration say that they are with us with Israel a Middle Eastern country\nSaying there with Israel against Iran\nThat's holy cow immaterial now that's where this whole situation whether hey we got this journalist who by the way you know has a interesting history of his own\nThat goes into a consulate in Turkey we have some ah folks from uh the the Saudi regime that enter and a few hours later they leave and you know probably not putting his foot beat up by eating bond bond so we we have a missing journals okay\nThat's where this whole situation gets complicated because we've made some progress with Saudi Arabia but the problem is back to my sliding scale morality if you are\nNot there anymore all at the started your compass you can become pretty evil at the root of it\nAnd it's important to know who and what these people are that we're still dealing with and I'll bring you the rest of the story as the late great one would have said uh I'm going to bring you back them up you're on the other side I Am Brian mud in for the great one month\nHim bond and conservatives talk talk and you will not\nAsk any a Mac remember what they like most about belonging

serious\nOf ah not Benjamin Button but the ... who has gone missing two weeks ago today\nAnd at this point it's rather obvious that we've heard the rumors that have come out with Saudi Arabia or the other day you know I mean like we are the crazy thing yeah there's a little interrogation and yeah you know I mean that they would just\nI just really hated when when we accidentally kill I I'm Sorry sorry we won't do it again really\nThat apparently is what we're eventually gonna get or at least that's the rumor of what we're going to get out of Saudi Arabia while also having the assertion that uh hey the king this young and and hip king who's the women could draw right now I mean come on I mean is that he liked yeah when they get dry\nSo he's so did that guy he doesn't know anything and and he's not supposed to do anything\nSo that's where we we are in this process but the the way the president was even talking about that today he said that for the record I have no financial interest in Saudi Arabia but he also said that he spoke with the gang and hey he denies everything in ice lies everything so\nThis is typical this is difficult for a lot of reasons\nWe don't know the exact where it was obviously\nAnd you had a lot of folks who say yeah you know wage shoot sanctions bring it on I mean let's just whatever it was Saudi Arabia the first thing is one be thankful that we're very close very close to energy independence of this country by the way did you know that we are now\nThe world's largest producer oil yeah now Saudi Arabia\nRussia us oh\nGreat we're actually facing the get their January we got there a little bit earlier it's awfully good about now because if you're a baby in the ... they had 'em back but they decided hey you know what we don't like you putting pressure on us and they go ahead and dramatically reduce production you could see spike in prices obviously that could hurt the economy boom you you know what happens there\nSo that's one thing we got to consider and this entire process but the bigger one again as you do have this new younger hip king in Saudi Arabia\nWho is like yeah women can can drive now I mean look how progressive ... and equal rights and all that\nHe's on board with us against Iran and with Israel where you can get that in the middle east you take it for sure\nThat is what complicates this deal but the problem is still is mentioned Israel off it's evil wherever it's it's found there's nothing good about it\nWe have had one thousand five hundred and eighty nine Islamic terror attacks around the world so far this year\nWe've had Ninety four hundred and eighty three people killed in additional Ninety six hundred injured\nOh by the way so Islamic terrorists still alive and well ... and are the folks that govern under it still sponsor terrorism and the least of which is ... Iran but here's the problem the dirty little secret about sharia law in Islam in governments predominantly in the middle east\nThere are still over forty of them they carry the tenants of sharia\nIncluding by the way Saudi Arabia now\nWe haven't necessarily had on track record to see how long that's going to remain part of the government but the bigger problem is\nIf you're on board with shrimp your moral compass really sucks and if you were saying that you can like ah you know kill people at will because I don't know there are a woman they were raped or you're homosexual what else are you willing to do like this journalists thing for example so that's where this becomes the tangled Web\nAnd so it's it's easy to quarterback deciding it's much different to to be pragmatic with everything that's on the line we're up to see where this all goes well let's go to Isaac in Washington Isaac go\nHey Brian how are you all day today\nAll good ... ah I was talking to your call screener a bum Pocahontas over here [laughter] um I think that this lady is trying to ... herself seem like a minority of people would just like her and ah [noise]\nI was calling them you know I think that these people what the Democrats are ... are trying to do they're just basically turn this country of Mexico or or even bringing swell I'm someone who I Am here in the United states under the ACA program and it I think that I think that really sucks you know that there's a ... these people have the nerve\nTo actually put themselves make themselves look like oh we're wondering we're under you guys just to try to get sympathy from anybody and anybody who who actually cares how long have you on a ...\nHow long have you been here ...\nI have been here since I was ah about eight years old\nOkay and uh how would you know or ...\nRight now I'm thirty three\nOkay so your view of the United states as a child and an adolescent to to today what what's changed in and what's your perspective\nYou know what I'm like in any any like any race there are good people there are bad people I've had good experiences and really bad ones too but overall ... ... people have in this country if if you're like oh let me let me just say this or\nThe ... the privileges or the ... everything that people have in this country a lot a lot a lot of the most ... if not everybody in the Democratic party picks up for grabs her\nTop two tax relief\nNow a year in rock spotlight Ninety Seventy three and\nA and the\nRolling Stones are back on top of the number one album in the U.S and the u._k. and a number one single Angie\nLet's get it on as the number one single\nFrom Marvin Gaye also in August ...

bad people all the time but this is in our face I feel personally offended they have nothing but contempt for us would you put a guy like me and the president in this box for after all the press and has done this guy's gotta go Saudi Arabia the lifting there are a lot of good people you can choose but NBS has painted your country and painted himself\nOf like Lindsey Graham did his version of coming out isn't it\nEver since the ... there's been a whole new Lindsey Graham and he's\nHe's out these loving every minute of it I mean this is enjoyable for him I mean you sanction the hell out of the old\nStudy born and Lindsey Graham anyway a in this particular case that's what makes me nervous and it's what makes me not just the the idea stage in the hell out of okay well what happens for example of Saudi Arabia is\nIs you know what I Know we\nGot to be with you on Israel and against Iran but uh you know we are feeling quite as as cordial as we had previous\nIt's really up and stuff and what happens if they say you know what we're just\nGonna go ahead and turn off this big to do back and see what happens to oil prices and see if we can do something that a wreck the economy a little bit therefore you know Presidents Day\n... things that that could happen any number of different applications so I think it's easy for a Lindsey Graham who's out there and loving every\nOf it enjoying this newfound freedom maybe being the person you always wanted to be that he finally feel that a peace being is kinda fascinating if you think about it and I digress here you have Lindsey Graham is like oh no I came out uh maybe said things but it would that have always meant to be sane\nAnd people did\nYou know you're talking about the Trump effect me would take a look at it and the Republican Party Mitch McConnell got an incredible reception in Kentucky the other night I mean what does that ever happened\nI mean it's an interesting day these people clearly enjoying this this newfound freedom of the Trump effect that has come up for them\nBut it's complicated it's complicated so I don't know but now let's just go sanctioned the hell out of all that's the best answer and I'm not sure that we're necessarily going to find our our friend ah who uh\nIs mysteriously well where exactly\nJamal talking let's go to Aaron in Kansas Erin go\nOh just a quick question if the king she lives any knowledge of it ... it was a body ah it's obvious that he's not in the conflict in a more give us a body this poor guys in a hole somewhere still being tortured\nYou know it's an interesting thought a if you were going to be really uh I don't know a ... if you're going to engage in in a war game I I suppose you could end up putting up any number of Syria it scenarios and the least of which would be well maybe when you you held the Saudi officials leave\nThe consulate they left with them\nYou know if your if there are any number of things that could happen I'm not sure that it would make sense for him to remain there and be tortured because well you are and how many more potential witnesses add a lot more difficult situation for even ... at that point so\nAll all the scenarios that two weeks later he's still there will be tortured I think would be among the least likely but hey to your point anything could be possible appreciate the call\nNow but talking about

Sunday on CNBC out Taylor Swift political Dorfman could become the biggest red\nEver at the polls ripple Everest appalled [laughter]\nI mean OK okay maybe just maybe not how you thought here's an actor\nLast week pop star Taylor Swift made waves by breaking her stance a political neutrality and backing democratic congressional candidates in our home state of Tennessee\nBe effective switch surprise endorsement which was made the on Instagram post were felt right away as thousands of people between the ages of Eighteen and twenty nine registered to vote according to vote dot org\n[noise] okay now\nGoing to get straight to the point about the Taylor Swift the fact that some of them\nYeah the reason only has a couple of days ago we're still my gosh it's happening I think it's quite a down a little bit over the past the hour or so because I think more of them are like being pointed to the polls and going hey are you so he was up in Tennessee or\nI'm Taylor ... specific endorsement of the Democrat Bill Bratton sitting and tendencies US Senate race you see at the time of the endorsement Marsha Blackburn the Republican challenger in this race\nSheila's average in a three point lead and the three most recent polls in Tennessee right Blackburn three point lead in the three most recent polls prior to the Taylor Swift effect\nWhere is she today and the three most recent polls in that particular race is now nine points\nSo\nOh not exactly what you probably thought would happen here so the Taylor Swift effect in the immediate aftermath of the race that she finally weighing\nIn on is negative six percent in a week so I like to say you got two sides to stories on one side the facts but here's the deal he got\nA lot of folks are if you play the millionaire the concept that for every action got the equal and opposite reaction ... guy on earlier in the show\nHere's the thing that I'm In in the south in particular\nYou have a lot of folks that will end up getting energized about the moment you got celebrities that are weighing in and specifically when she ended up outing herself\nPretty much immediately or her lack of understanding of pretty much everything including the person she was endorsing\nSeat if you're in Tennessee and you're fine politics you might have noticed that she was a bit of an obvious hypocrite for a few reasons among others now she said that Marsha Blackburn doesn't represent her tendency values\nBut you see here is that the the dirty little details Taylor isn't actually from Tennessee she's from Pennsylvania\nPennsylvania\nAnd she happened only moved to Tennessee to pursue her music career in high school oh by the way she's lived there less than half for life\nYou know in the you know Taylor Swift as to Tennessee values as say a Elizabeth Warren is due to Cherokee Indians you know the person sometimes referred to as Elizabeth Warren better known as the bad Pocahontas spelling now\nShe spoke up supporting L G being he writes\nGB T rights as part of her Tennessee values by the way [noise] I guess what\nThe Democrats the she endorsed bill Bratton said he doesn't support gay marriage and a bunch of other issues he's on the record as much [laughter] so it's clear that she's never even looked into what he believes in they'll go\n\nAnd then you got the optics we see for maybe you could activate some of those young folks in in Nashville better yeah\nBut here's the thing anybody noticed that you got Taylor Swift endorsing an old white guy who does not support\nGay marriage and host of other old GB T rights that Taylor says are part of her tendency values from Pennsylvania so she's endorsing in the old white guy bat evil these days and leftist politics right over a younger woman\nHa ha interesting\nI mean and there's a lot more we we can continue\nDown that rabbit hole but it's not necessary but you see those in Tennessee they pretty much get the point to and yellow and get a lot\nIn terms of tendency values I'm from suburban Georgia lived in Knoxville for a time when I was small and I'm pretty familiar with tendency values and they take a look at these celebrity in in Hollywood endorsements and ah well\nNot often impressed so it probably is going to continue to have the opposite of the fact that they weren't dissipating I mean come on\nAll these celebrity endorsements work right Katy Perry holding up Hillary Clinton's arm\nBy the way it wasn't an awkward moment I mean I did the trick always does and so here's the funny thing if you're taking a look at when celebrity endorsements actually matter well she kinda miss her moment you see if she actually wanted somebody with her Pennsylvania\nTendency L G beats he writes values\nShe could actually weighed in in the primary because Columbia University actually did prove that some Democrats are impressed by celebrities for example Columbia University they did show pretty empirically that in the two thousand eight democratic presidential primary\nOprah Winfrey's indoor spent really did encourage an additional ... million people largely black do vote for broad Obama over Hillary Clinton\nSo if only Taylor Swift had to wait in Pennsylvania algae B. T. tendency values maybe she wouldn't have ended up with an old white guy who doesn't support\nGay marriage or the L G Beatty rights that made her look like she is as cool as as she actually is she could have had somebody that you know it was going to I don't know shake it off do whatever it is but she does these days but nice\nTry Taylor nice try and find a way by the way as for Tennessee values part of the reason why you have the Democrat Bill Britain's and that is not supportive of those things eighty one percent of tennis fans are Christians fifty two percent of the evangelical variety\nOh by the way you might want to at least investigate the state that you claim to be from that you represent the values off saying\nTwo sides to stories one side effects anyway uh we're we're just getting warmed up this hour Brian ... in for the great one month\nHim bonkers home porn normative dong dong dwell on during the ...\nI enjoy helping my listeners like Nathaniel who owe the IRS tens of thousands in back taxes he told the IRS he didn't have the money to pay but it didn't matter they put a lean on his home anyway it's an annual heard how much I respect optimal tax relief\nSo he engage them optimal got the IRS to designate Nathaniel ... case as the and the status currently not collectible that's a big win because it basically says\nNo use pursuing our client there's nothing to be gained here after my kept finding on Nathaniel spy happen till the IRS agreed to a deal\nThat saved them thousands of resolve this tax that for good optimal knows that behind every tax problem are honest hard working Americans with families homes savings in paychecks that need protection they resolve over half a billion dollars in tax that for their clients now fuel back taxes to the IRS call my friends that optimist tax relief\nEight hundred for nine nine sixty three hundred eight hundred for nine nine sixty three hundred that's eight hundred for nine nine sixty three hundred\n[noise] now are you in rocks spotlight Ninety seven\nSpectrum reduced album let it be generating three number one hits back method vi and their final number one the long and winding road thinking some Lola about a romantic accountable transvestite make the case I never nine [laughter]\nHe's alive is to just release their second album on all the records on our end British Band ...

banger beggar mania Bangor Maine why\nOr was that about well it's just more peace loving liberals there because a B colon family home actually her husband had taken a in a threat letter that said it contain price it\nAt the house by the way just getting more he's love and and the liberalism to wear a ... you didn't vote the way we want to do so now we're going to threaten to kill you and your family I you know oh okay well that makes fun of the party of course ah to where hey if\nMr holder the attorney general you know the the former top law guy in the country I mean you you can really see the value system air when they go low we kick them okay violence yeah that's that's cool uh just like Maxine Waters so I was encouraged her I mean it's not like we had a somebody who went in and hunted down Republicans at a baseball field or anything\nOh wait we oh gee\nIt's almost it's almost like it's imbedded and many of these the Democrats yeah just the peace and love the open mindedness it's all there for you all there you can feel the ... ... ... why wouldn't you want to be part of that by the way so I'm Sorry\nOh let's go to Joe in Jersey Joe go\nHey Brian how are you all good a\nWhile I was waiting for you I just thought of something an extension to what I Want to talk about with what you were just touching on but um this is Taylor Swift thing could be\nEven a larger on a larger scale where people are just rejecting a Hollywood talking heads as being any body of any value or wacko value whatsoever that number one\nNumber two I don't know if you recall but on a night of nine eleven you remember they had that music vigil of ... a vigil with Springsteen and Tom Petty where they were pounding the wardrobe you recall that\nNot really to be honest with you\nThey all came on and Tom Petty song is when you walk back down\nUm it was all a it was all in a kind of aggressive music or that hinted towards we're coming at ya but they're the same they recover from the same cloth especially Springsteen were they were anti war\nA it they they are just so hypocritical I'm hoping that God that people are just not taken I'm Serious anymore\nWell I can take I tell you this much in in Tennessee in particular there are some places where the celebrities don't play if you're in California I have no doubt that it plays in fact there is research that did show a from Columbia University back to two thousand eight\nA presidential primary to where there are Democrats or a percentage of them that are activated by celebrity but you've got to you know somebody's got to be open to the message is what I talked about when a I'll describe being politically persuasive one of the most common questions I get how is it that I find somebody who I can uh you know convince of of what's right\nWell it the first thing is you got to find somebody who's open to the information if you find somebody who's close minded\nWell it doesn't matter how hard to try their not to the information so when the case of the celebrities when you're talking about what's going on in Tennessee oh well you've got a large swath of that population that is not\nNot going to be turned on\nBy a celebrity endorsement but what's worse and this is the most of its offensive thing and I say this yeah I'm not really a true southerner in the sense that I'm from suburban Atlanta\nAnd to be honest with you I didn't even know what the the saying get out of the judgment until I was sixteen that kinda thing didn't come up where where it was from but I Do understand a lot of southern culture and\nYou know when you say that you have tendency values\nAnd you're not only not from Tennessee where you're from Pennsylvania [laughter] same thing too many of the folks in Tennessee that those people and\nSo it's kinda like a no offense to you and in in Jersey job but I mean in Tennessee you know Jersey\nNot not the best reputation so anyway it's a good point\nStates all jerseys kind of cut in half you know are almost at the center of the state\nUm for the most part I'm and I'm Down in the you know the more conservative area but I just ... hoping to God that these numbers who who who rely on these celebrities for their political opinions are shrinking more and more and more that's that's my hope\nYeah I I think the only celebrity that are necessary have to worry about in terms of this cycle\nIs the president of the United states\nI mean there is an irony there are certain extent you know he's obviously successful independent of the celebrity but you know I just ah\nPointing out with somebody otherwise probably will as I don't appreciate uh Joe and Menendez I mean come on really ... you got some work to New Jersey oh let's go to a liberal land in Arizona not happy with what's going on in North Dakota ailing\nOh I'm a liberal I have always been on both sides of the fence and on and play with the campaign sounding egotistical you should have somebody called me back
