not a bad thing\nNow all of a sudden the Democrats that they have lost their bid to take over the majority on the Supreme Court they thought\nThey'd have a six three majority with the president Hillary Clinton right out as well read in quite work out that way\nNow that it is a five for conservative majority and the swing vote is now John Roberts rather than an Anthony Kennedy who is a I Believe more reliable conservative vote I Hope in\nThe future [noise] the liberals are now with packing the court's not listen attacking an institution in the United states because you lost is not a good thing but heart which makes a really good point here folks liberals for years have had a really\nHard time doing one thing they can't seem to get a national mandate for any of their hard left proposals to pass through think\nAbout it now I'm not saying they haven't had big wins they had that at the stimulus Obamacare let's not put her head in the sand to pretend that didn't happen but the big ticket items that liberals on abortion on\nBob yeah a basic income Medicare for all these are big ticket big monstrous platinum and gold winning items for the liberal they have no national mandate for\nThey wanted a national mandate for gay marriage wherever you stand on it\nWouldn't get it states were knocking it down they were putting it on referendum they were losing\nLiberals as a backstop have always relied on the courts and legislators in black robes who pretend to be judges to pass those items why it's very simple when you think about it\nIt is a very simple mathematical equation do you want to have to convince a hundred million Americans in a presidential elections to vote for your candidate along with your house of representative members and your Senate members or do you want to convince one or two judges and a black robe all consider themselves swing voters to do it for\nYou the answer is obvious they have always relied on the courts because the ACC you're just get a bunch of\nLiberals pretending to be judges on the court you choose to legislate from the bench and you don't have to do the hard work\nOf knocking on doors getting elected in telling people why you think government controlling their health care when they can't even run the damn the Ovie or a DMV excuse me ... or whatever the deal for years they can't run that either they convincing them that that's good for them\nYou can't there is no popular mandate for it so now that that avenue to the Supreme Court has been cut off for them they're starting\nTo now I Want you to screen shot all of their tweets when you're out there on Twitter them saying the Supreme Court it's not legitimate screen\nShot all of this because there may unfortunately become a time when they take\nBack a majority on the Supreme Court and I want you to fire all those screen shots back at them on Twitter hey look at this remember when you said judicial supremacy and the Supreme Court didn't matter\nNow it's not going to matter you're not going to change your mind these people don't stand for anything sometimes there's actual principles principles power they worship the golden calf of government that is what they do their national pastime is Jenny afflicting before the author of big government at whatever means they have to use the get there doesn't matter\nBut another lesson learned from this is if the Democrats are going to attack\nJudicial supremacy we as Republicans should say is don't need to make this personal the courts do have a constitutional role but you know what labs you don't think the

was an effort\nBy Democrat Party operatives\nThey're paid contractors whether they be law firms are opposition researchers was an effort by them to shuttle negative information about Trump and his
