care called Medicare for all and he wants to take away resources from the border patrol and give him the other country and I can go down a long list but he is trying to run it the factors that he's not\nBut I think the people of Texas are seeing through it just like they are seeing through Mr O'Rourke a efforts to a claim centrism and if that's set for them that were in San Francisco and not the center of Texas\n[noise] and a lot of these leftists in Texas and Florida and these other states are really trying to disguise in camouflage their true hardcore left wing agenda aren't the\nOh I mean

could run because they may have worn a uniform or otherwise good a wrong with the veil of centrism or moderation because they know liberalism doesn't sell in Texas and I'll tell you something more good I think you'll you'll appreciate as well your listeners you know and I mentioned this to my own and he never has a response\nWhy would my opponent or why would better or not want to run in Texas for governor or state rep or senator to do all of these social as things weren't at least it's constitutionally reasonable to have the debate but they know that stuff doesn't sell in Texas so the only
