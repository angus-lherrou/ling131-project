third season of daredevil all over the weekend which I Would have to say you know the thing about daredevil is that\nIt it's also a little bit dark a little bleak I think it's well executed for what it is I just can't understand how they made daredevil such a compelling show at Netflix\nAnd they made iron fist which was just on washable garbage man iron fish was crash it's also a superhero story also set of New York same you know platform with Netflix you'd think they'd have some idea how to do it the iron fist got cancelled and thank heavens because it was such\nA piece of of waste and ah

I'd like your general take on or what has taken place here in secondly I Know you've been in Pittsburgh who did you meet with and what did you see there's there\nWhile it's you know a horrific act or sent us a medic attack and us history they climbed eleven lives I I was in Pittsburgh yesterday\nGot to meet with the members of the community you got to meet with the mayor with the county executive I'm with Senator Casey was there we had a a a congressman Republicans and Democrats and talk to a lot of people have to tell you mark it's a very very strong\nCommunity and I think a special community and squirrel hill\nA Pittsburgh they're they're very very tight it\nIt's not just tight knit among the Jewish community but also the Dodgers community supporting them and I went to an event last night\nUh been really brought out the entire community faith leaders Christians are Jewish faith leaders of Muslim leader who actually spoke there as well and spoke very well and uh I think the whole community is just trying to support 'em the Jewish community there and everyone told me the same thing we never thought it was going to happen here\nAnd I think they were just shocked and stunned are and what I wanted to do is Israel's ambassador to the United states is just tell them that Israel stance with them that they're not alone\nAnd they in Israel yesterday morning our government may taught Sunday because some days like Monday and Israel the first day of the week and the government meets every Sunday and there was a moment of silence where the entire government of Israel ... because we are the one and only Jewish state and so we feel a\nSpecial sense of solidarity with Jewish communities around the world and that's why it was important for me to be in Pittsburgh uh yesterday\nYou were born in Miami I just want people to know this you're born in Miami your father was the mayor of Miami your brother was the mayor of Miami\nMiami Beach Miami Beach where it was about that yeah we're the ones with the speech that that's true [noise] um\nSo you know the United states very very well obviously you are an Israeli citizen and you are you're very close to the prime minister of Israel so when you look at this we see growing anti Semitism throughout Europe\nOr the FBI put out a report to the latest report you see growing anti Semitism or hate crimes as I called in the United states what do you make of this\nKind of it is it's going to say a growing problem uh many people want to say that it began in two thousand sixteen with President Trump's election that's simply not true and you look at the FBI statistics that you mentioned\nA and two thousand four ten and two thousand Fifteen\nA hate crimes against Jews accounted for over half\nOf hate crimes against religious groups and the United states it was only ... percent of the population mark and their accounting for over half and by the way there were periods over the last Fifteen Years was about Seventy five percent of the number of an attack the crimes against Jews were actually much\nBigger than I was in two thousand fourteen of two thousand Fifteen I really think what you have mark is is the rise of anti Semitism over the last couple of decades what you had was about a half century after the Holocaust where was politically incorrect\nShoes and I think what you've seen happen over the last two decades is that it's once again become fashionable or to attack juice and it's no longer politically incorrect to go after ... now most of the attacks actually hide themselves behind the mask of hatred towards Israel to one and only Jewish state\nBut at the singling out of Israel is very much like they used to single out the Jews for special treatment so I think you've seen this on the rise it's not just in America it's all around the world you've seen attacks against Jews in Paris\nAttacks against choosing ... attack against Jews in Copenhagen attacks against Jews in Brussels and in London and even in the United states uh this is not the first attack\nThere was an attack in two thousand six hundred you federation in Seattle there was an attack in two thousand fourteen at a Jewish community center a added outside of Kansas Kansas City which I think claimed three lives and this is just the worst attack but this is a growing problem and I think one of the issues is social media\nBecause you know you can have a very very small fraction of the population that are these are you know these crazy I don't know if I'd call them crazy but evil people\nUm you could have a a one one hundredth of one percent could be thirty thousand Americans um and there's extremists thing I can be people like David Duke it could be neo Nazis it could be white nationalist all sorts of people\nBut online they can actually build communities have hate in a way that they couldn't do before so I think as you get more and more people going into social media as you have this rise of these online hate groups I think it's\n... dangerous Senate dangerous and it it has given\nThem a sense of community of haters and I think it's important to take action against that I Will tell you marketed in Israel we monitor the Internet now we're a different country and you have constitutional protections here I Know that you're\nYou're a great defender of them we don't have a First Amendment Second Amendment Fourth Amendment but hopefully your law enforcement authorities can figure out a way within your laws constitutional rights that Americans have to figure out a way to monitor this so they can see one sort of this kind of hate pops up\nAnd then be able to take action before the crime takes place that's what we have in Israel um and it's been very effective at preventing a lot of these types of attacks I mean I Would love to believe that this was going to be the last attack but I think given that these all these haters are communicating with each other I ... I think it's important for your forties to see what they can do to\nA is the day when CNN and MSNBC and these these used to be reputable organizations really focused on reporting\nThe news rather than driving the news and creating the news the news conferences now at the White House you clean nothing that's newsworthy nothing I'll be right back\nIn the new bomb didn't nervous the dog no longer will laundering\n[noise] now are you in rocks pa Seventy seven\nDo worry Seventy seven six\nMen as bad as the U.S number one hit and\n\n\nSo do I do do a home and have their first us some rich girl\nWe would max album rumors is releasing their second number one album in a row in the U.S dominated the charge at number one for one week going sports Austin singles including the number one dream\nListening to my heart radio from Nineteen Seventy seven coming on ...

more time\nNo they're not you know Senator McCaskill is trailing in the polls that she does she look desperate to be honest with you mark and as you should be because ... she is out of step with the

by twenty\nAt dinner McCaskill turned around to vote no on Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court no one just as Kevin ... know on the tax cuts no on border security no on rebuilding the military I mean it's just she could not be more out of step\nWith his she running in New York and Missouri\nYeah exactly well most of her money comes from New York and California that she'd be a great senator for one

left us to be perfectly honest with you her votes really are not much different from a Bernie Sanders or ... and of course she will vote to make Chuck Schumer the leader of her up of the of the
