guy if he could of would have gotten bombs to people that that would have you know maimed in or kill them it just goes to show what a what a complete maniac lunatic he is\nA but the people that were really with those kinds of what the devices that that that we are talking about a year for the most part the people that are at great is that we're at greatest risk assuming that they were\nDevices that really could realistically I think that the it's likely they theoretically could have gone off with that not a single one went off makes me think that there was a a a repeated flaw in the design which they don't want to talk about because they probably hope that other people make the same mistake\nBut the the individual the pipe bomb who's probably the greatest risk is when you're sending them to mail when he's sending him to a big news organizations or the you know the internal works in the mail room or the mail carrier or somebody who's just you know in the vicinity of the package

they don't want people having civil substantive serious debates\nThey want centralized power\nWith these corporations and these executives believe they can uh\nThey control outcomes in this society\n\nThat we're going to talk more about this is the program goes on but I Want to hit this issue again the birthright citizenship\nYou are hearing people who make absolutely no sense on this issue saying that the president cannot use an executive order to address birthright citizenship again my carry out is that I Know the courts are going to be hostile to any effort\nTo curb birthright citizenship statutory or by executive order\nBut I hear people say a statute will be stronger first of all they're not going to get a statute because it will be filibustered in the Senate so it's a non issue that Democrats aren't going to allow it they want birthright citizenship some of the filibuster rule in the Senate there will be no statute the president as aware of that\nThe commentators on TV even some conservatives they pretend they're not aware of it but we're all aware of it or what have been done already said the same people in Congress who refused to build physical barriers on our southern border to protect this country and to enforce immigration laws suddenly they're going to pass a statute\nOutlawing birthright citizenship but why passed a statute if in fact as the laugh says on some of these conservatives say 'cause they're known as things that birthright citizenship is in the fourteenth amendment which is what Paul Ryan said preposterous\n\nIf that's the case then how is the statue gonna ... statute won't fix it because they're saying\nYou have to amend the constitution when's the last time we actually amend the constitution the old fashioned way or want it to the old fashioned way it's been a long time why because the left changes the constitution all the time and\nNow when we want to address something that they did outside the constitution now we're told we have to pass a constitutional amendment helps her\nAs we discuss the other day as I discuss this Daniel Horowitz from conservative review discussed with me birthright citizenship was\nNot actually implemented in this country into the sixties and seventies then Nineteen sixties and early Nineteen seventies by the bureaucracy\nBy the bureaucracy\nIt wasn't in the constitution no court ordered it and no statute was passed so why do we have to amend the constitution or pass this statute while the better chance in front of the Supreme Court if that's the case we have no chance in front of the Supreme Court\n\nTennis as much as this battle over Kavanaugh was so crucial he's not Clarence Thomas he's not Antonin Scalia and neither is John Roberts\nIt's just what it is\nThe president happens to be right about this the president happens to be right about the constitution the president happens to be right about an executive order however it turns out and all of his critics happen to be wrong he knows more than they do\n\nAs Daniel Horowitz put up there on the conservative review today leftist concocted an ingenious game of judicial supremacy isn't that great say one way rash it for their policy outcomes heads they win tails they win yet the so called conservative legal community chooses to play the game\nNo where is this more evident than in the debate over so called birthright citizenship with a left cherry picks one non binding footnote of a terrible decision misrepresenting another bad decision that violates previous president that plane meaning and purpose of the fourteenth amendment sovereignty and the social\nBack what collectively ignoring endless uninterrupted case law indicating the opposite all for the political outcome of giving our sacred birthright to

citizens would be used as a tool to prevent Congress from regulating citizenship for immigrants of all stripes is scandal is\n\nThe first sentence of the fourteenth amendment all persons\nBorn or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states and the state we're in they reside we need not speculate what subject to the jurisdiction there are means as I said the other day\nSenator lime in Trumbull of Illinois the chairman of the Senate Judiciary committee at the time\nSaid during the debate over the fourteenth amendment quote subject to the jurisdiction unquote of the United states means subject to its complete jurisdiction quote not allowing allegiance to anybody else on quote\nOf course persons present inside American

he is a constitutional is he doesn't have to wait for the Democrats to vote to figure out the way he should vote he will not vote for Chuck Schumer to be the Democratic leader in the United States Senate how are you Patrick Marcy\nI'm doing great mark Levin thanks for having me on your show I'm a big fan and I'm really excited to be on line and talking about the big issues and the U.S Senate race is going to be a lot of fun\nWell it's my pleasure go ahead and tell us the big issues where you stand and where your opponent stance\nAbsolutely well I think as many people are beginning to really follow this US Senate race in West Virginia they're seeing that there couldn't be a bigger contrast between the Republican and the Democratic candidates\nEh let's start at the base it I'm a conservative fighter mark you know I took on the Obama administration I sued them we had big victories in court\nIt was West Virginia that led the way to defeat the Obama power plant that was just this amazing power grab over the United states energy supply\nWe lead the way built the twenty seventh state coalition we stop Rocco bomb at the U.S Supreme Court fact it was the last major decision\nOf Justice Scalia's lie that was the big deal we've let on many other big issues taking on the federal government in their own lawful unless I'm strongly pro life\nEndorsed by all the pro life groups because not only check the box on the issue of why I Believe in the sanctity of life and I'm actually in part responsible for a lot of the changes which of of all in West Virginia so we have protections for the unborn\nI'm also strongly in support of the second amendment in our gun rights and we're working tirelessly to help President Trump we think President Trump has been doing incredible things for the country and for West Virginia and I'm proud to stand with them\nOr running a campaign partnering up with this president because he is helping turn us around now the flip side of that\nIs you're dishonest Washington liberal Joe mansion and he's just another one of these Washington politicians he went to Washington he drank the water and now he's in cahoots with Chuck Schumer Nancy Pelosi and all the radical liberals including Hillary Clinton on the issue of why\nHe sold out west Virginia values he actually literally had signs saying that he supports Planned Parenthood and also that he stood with life\nOn the issue of life that's not a multiple choice question you need someone who's ... who opposes taxpayer funding of abortion who wants to stop the government funding a plant paranoid on the issue is Second Amendment we need someone who's going to stand against the gun grabbers mansion is best known for offering a big gun control bill\nAnd on the issue of coal oh I have to say is this he doubled down on his support for Hillary Clinton even after she said we're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of work big differences between\nWashington liberal Joe mansion and\nConservative fighter Patrick Morsi and that's why we're going to win an election day in West Virginia\nYou know Patrick Morrisey there's a reason why Donald Trump keeps coming back to West Virginia to support you just because he not only support to he doesn't trust Joe mansion and I notice throughout his career in the Senate he waits and weights and waits to see if he can throw a safe vote\nThat isn't with his party he doesn't lead on anything am I right about this\nYou are right and I think vice president Mike Pence said it very well he said quote Joe ... is always there when you don't need him and you're a great line at all it's a terrific line and and really accurate about match\n... now what are your priorities among other you you mentioned a number of them is ... she supported the president's tax cuts to reject this caravan you want a wall on the southern border\nRunning man well absolutely so let's START I agree with all the above the Trump's tax cuts are good for West Virginia\nNot only doubling the standard deduction which helps a lot of hardworking families in our state the lowering of the rates are but we also have other changes here they're really hoping lift our economy up to levels we haven't seen before when you combined the Trump tax cuts more with the deregulatory approach\nI mean let's face it onto the ... Obama era they tried to put a lot of organized for profit businesses\nOut of work and certainly they went after fossil fuels I get up and I said no to that nonsense when I found those lawsuits and President Trump well he's just finishing the job I was basically the bridge to President Trump who's done so many great things for our economy and for energy jobs in West Virginia\nWe need to continue that approach of lowering our taxes and then ultimately deregulating so the regulations fulfill a more basic purpose\nMarkets you know were meant to be a free people that means we should try to solve most of our problems either\nIndividually or within our communities on the local level when you have federal regulations in place\nThere has to be a very compelling health safety well for aspect to it and it obviously must comply with the constitution and that's part of the problem with the rock Obama era\nAccording to the department of energy the most expensive utility for most Americans is their electricity\nBill adding to your financial misery this allergy season has been one of the wars in years so now is the perfect time to order a new set of age back to the Bruce Bruce filter by dot com with over six hundred scientists to choose from including custom options you'll find the perfect in ships free\nWithin twenty four hours with filtered by dot com they're made in America\nEmail phishing attacks cost businesses billions annually in real cash data law and brain damage fishing emails are hard to detect it gives the messages appear to be legitimate to unsuspecting employees\nIntroducing barracuda fish lined a groundbreaking cloud based solution designed to help employees recognized sophisticated emailed phishing attacks do interactive training reinforced by continue with the new elation transform your employees from a liability into a line of defense to barracuda dot com slash appeal to learn or\nShould have the\nMind behind ... get marred love and radio show\n[noise]\n\nI can\nHear a lot of activity which trick or treaters my own view about\nThis is the fewer trick or treaters the better you know what I missed\nBut it is here to exactly more candy for me I'm just kidding for crying out loud\nThere was a time at the bunker when I used to put out I've told you this before a big bowl of Hershey bars I don't mean the tiny little ones one bite I mean the big ones and not the big big ones but a real Hershey bar\nAnd I used to put out a big bowl of them used to have like three balls and them and I would do it during the course of the broadcast during the breaks\nInto a few years ago when I Would do that and apparently some kids are teenagers took all the Hershey bars\n\nAnd so there were no I'm not ... but the another bowl out they did it again so I stopped and I shut the lights out and said that's not enough of that but now my wife's in charge of it\nSo uh I hear a lot of activity going on up there the Halloween people are talking about ... went to the weekend I don't you just leave things alone what just leave things alone from once\n\nYou know or\nHave you ever thought about the word education it means to lead forth the word for it raises another question is you know we've talked about this well which way is fourth\nHow do you know you're going in the right direction while the easy answer is it just depends on which way you want to go\nNow my friend Dr Larry aren't president of Hillsdale College says young people almost always say that\nAnd that they've been taught to say that you and I both know that's the wrong answer let me tell you about a place that leads fourth Hillsdale College at Hillsdale they understand the true education means pursuing the highest answer to the question which way is fourth\n[noise] Hillsdale students are challenged to discover to discover the right way forth by reading the greatest books are the greatest minds and history and they learn the meaning of the three ... and related things the good the true and the beautiful\nHillsdale holds a unique an important role in American education today I encourage all of you my listeners to learn more about this remarkable institution and that certainly is\nAt love in Hillsdale dot com L.
