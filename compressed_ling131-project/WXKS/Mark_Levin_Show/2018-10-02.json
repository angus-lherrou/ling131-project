know Mr Kavanaugh and she has no recollection of ever being at a party are gathering where he was present with or without Dr Ford\nQuote unquote\nIn a subsequent statement to the committee through

Democrat Joe Manchin agreed\nThey had the power to make or break Kevin and without settling on precise details they decided to use their leverage to insist on a process that would allow them to retake comfort level with Kavanaugh's confirmation process and seek more information rather than to kill the Supreme Court nomination outright\nTo two people familiar with the meeting that's two senators leaking\nWhat resulted on friday afternoon through Washington and the chaos and guaranteed another week of uncertainty and suspend another week of character assassination and one way character assassination\nSurrounding Kavanaugh's confirmation just hours after flake endorsed cabin on seem to put him on a path to the high court the Arizona and said he first one of the week long after the investigation into Ford's allegation\nThat the judges saw there\nWas a victory for Democrats who'd been demanding such a probe to no avail promises to define the retiring flakes legacy as someone who refused to let cabin I'll get a vote while under a cloud of death but\nThe like lead rebellion however long it lasts\nHad been building for nearly two weeks the Murkowski college would mention all endorse the FBI investigation on friday flight needed another partner to pull off his move because none of them serves on the Judiciary Committee so flake just been mocked for writing a book blasting the Trump presidency only to vote for his agenda teamed up with a Democrat\nChris Coons\nEight years Senate career making Ernest attempts to build relationships with Republicans are just reading it as

further delay an investigation political continues\nCoons inflate vacated the Judiciary Committee shortly before the panel [laughter] excuse me what is expected to vote to advance Kavanaugh\nSeemingly innocuous moment the left onlookers increasingly bewildered as more senators joined them in the back room they were trained minutes later with a deal that's forced Republican leaders to bounce other minorities demand for an FBI probe delaying the confirmation for as much as a week\nI did not expect him to do this today ... set of flakes speaking for nearly everyone in official Washington\nSo legal insurrection points out flakes plot doesn't stop there it includes signaling to Senate Republicans that his intentions are not to bring down Kavanaugh it's unclear how true that is but here's political what continues\nAnd facts like was playing a longer again\nHe said his statements supporting cab when I was a signal to Republicans that he wasn't joining the Democratic resistance and would show he was an out to bring Kavanaugh's nomination down I hoped that would help provide leverage flake recounted\nBut he needed some Democrats to endorse the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh's nomination to get fellow Republicans to agree flake wanted to demonstrate that the process is fair at least even if Democrats are not going to vote for Kavanaugh he added\nFlake wouldn't say whether the protesters played a role in his decision but he acknowledged he was in the middle of a remarkable moment ticked off his interactions with a lot of people on the phone email text walking around the capital you name it I Wonder if he spoke to the Duke lacrosse players\nIn his speech little noticed at the time ... suggested that someone with a partisan agenda might have leaked to the media Ford's letter alleging the assault harmonizing with what Republicans have been saying for days Kuhn speech also repeated his request for an FBI investigation\nWas exactly what flick was looking for not long afterwards ... like repaired committee a ... anti room to hash out an agreement Democrats would endorse a one week FBI investigation into cabinet\nAnd flake would uses leveraging the narrowly divided Senate and threatened to vote no on the floor of Republicans refused to go along\nNow there's something just somewhat disturbing revelation and the remaining Political Report quote Collins asked that Susan Collins that Kavanaugh's friend mark judge\n\nAnd now they just introduced an interview the what is her name's swell shtick what is what is her name\n... sweat Nick\n... is a abalone ... ah I no

guess I'm the only one and you'll get more but today and tonight and tomorrow in tomorrow night before there's any\nActual news but isn't it amazing that was the lawyers involved there's not a single accuser whose filed a criminal complaint not one\nBecause if you file false criminal complaint you can be charged with a felony\n\nOr maybe they're afraid that the case will be taken to go to court and the lows\n\nWhy haven't they filed a criminal complaint and then they talk about we want an FBI investigation you know why they do that to you so you think there's actually a criminal investigation going on here against Kavanaugh that there's\nA real lot criminal investigation\nNow there's not there's nothing to do\nA criminal investigation I Will be honest with you I suggested the two senators on the Senate Judiciary committee that ask Dr Ford why she doesn't walk into the Montgomery County police department and file a criminal complaint you know what those senators said to me Mr producer nothing they ignored me\n\nWell what if she does not what\nA biz Ramirez does go instead we get reporters we get get people giving their opinions we get this when I started the show with a real lot prosecutor\nWho sent a memo to the Republican senators laying out a list of in discrepancies of memory lapses of contradictions\nRespecting Dr Ford crickets nobody gives a damn before that she was track ... she's an incompetent incompetent my but she was great\nThese are facts\nSo why why didn't\nMiss Ford's Dianne Feinstein hand picked lawyer\nDebbie Katz\nTake her clients hand and walk into the Montgomery County police department in Maryland\nThey dare not do it they dare not do it\nOr ms ... lawyer they dare not do it\nOr the rest they dare not do it instead just keep them we need an FBI investigation isn't it interesting that the Three Stooges of the Republican Party Collins Murkowski\nAnd flight not one of them\nSaid you know I feel a lot better if she'd actually saw a you know filed a criminal complaint I Would have felt a lot better how come they didn't say\nBecause they're afraid that's why\nNow you hear this now on Fox some short tonight somebody will bring it up some former prosecutor or whatever that's OK I'm used to this\nBut it's an important point\nHe said because any quarter law there's that Kavanaugh does that the presumption of innocence and a quarter law there is due process and a quarter law which a criminal case it's beyond a reasonable doubt but as prosecutor Rachel Mitchell set in her paper there's\nNot even a preponderance of evidence here and I would add there's no evidence\n\nSo we have a circus we have the Roman Colosseum\nAnd everybody's gathered because now the lines are going to kill the Christian just throw Kavanaugh in there from in there and everybody's excited everybody cheering what do you mean to process due process she's up against the law and what the hell do we care\nWhat do we care\nThese phrases innocent until proven guilty apparently they only apply to a al ... terrorists and mass murders\nNot to a federal judge\nNot to a federal judge you got Frank Rich that part's\nTweeted\nKevin O's bragging about coaching girls' basketball is troubling in retrospect and why is that Frankie\nWhy is that you\nUse nibbling moron or judge lego whoever they held at it in retrospect Kavanaugh using a girls'

should on free media\nThe way they cherry pick their stories they're partisanship it's obvious to everybody even the people who watch these these carbon footprint says CNN and MSNBC they know their parties and that's why they watch 'em all twelve people\n\nBut I go back to my point I always have to say these things five times or so just to make sure even the media here me not a single accuser has filed a criminal complaint with the statute of limitations would not have run and has not run in Montgomery County Maryland\nNot one and I'll tell you something else [noise]\nOne of the reasons they think they can continue to say the most outrageous sickening insane things about capital is they know he's a federal judge and they know he seeks to be on the Supreme Court so they know he will not sue them for defamation\n\nAnd if he sued Dr Ford for defamation\nShe would lose\nEven on a public person standard she would lose she has no evidence if he sued Mrs Ramirez she would lose if he sued Avon body and his crime they would lose\nYou can accuse people of the most vital things with no evidence with no witnesses corroborate ...\nIt's a slam dunk not might take a few years but\nThey know he won't they know he can't given his interests and still being a Supreme Court justice and eventually if not returning to the uh staying on the DC circuit\nThese accusers and their lawyers and
