{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WXKS", "content": "I just I I think that there's a there's an adaptation going on in my thinking and it's maybe something I've been a little slower than some of my other colleagues on the right to adopt in some ways because I come from this perspective of\nWell this'll sound self aggrandizing but knowledge having a background in in the actual work that I Do especially in the national security side knowledge in fact\nAnd wisdom that's how I Try to approach would I Do and and so I always want to think that I could have\nLiberals listen to this show when I certainly hope to all the liberals who are listening that they still feel this way but I Want them know that I I Want to bring them over to my side a and I don't want to be too strident that has always been my approach but recently the left has gone insane and so I Am separating out in my mind\nI Want to say and saying I mean more insane than usual I separated in my mind how I speak to Democrats really in general from how I'm now speaking to the hardcore left because I Am an ideological war with the hardcore left a centrist Democrats I Want\nTo come over to my side not necessarily even on everything but them whatever they're willing to\nPut the hardcore left just must be ideologically smashed\nAnd and destroyed must be defeated you know the ... the ah the people that are running around with the pink hats on and that are saying due process doesn't count anymore and\nThey they the ones who are doing deep platform ing and want people to be boycotted and to be fired from their jobs for you know expressing that served her opinions we have to fight that ideology not not meet it in a gentleman the contest but we actually have to throw some elbows\nAnd that that maybe has been a a learning process for me in this Arab Trump because I've seen more and more of what the left\nAnd not just with the left is but how much of\nThe Democrat Party and how much of the ideological a center left they control and the hard left I mean the progressive vanguard is way too prominent way too powerful and can and cannot be\nA just wished away any more so if I sound at all like I'm a little more strident or a little more a far enough about things in the last few months it's really because I've seen this battle we're entering into is all about and this is political total war this is not\nA you know made the best man when this is one man will win and one man will not leave the octagon so to speak\nAnd in that kind of political environment you ... you have to be ready to to go bare knuckle an end in a sense that's really what I've learned from Trump\nYou know there there have been some things\nThat Trump is Donald Trump is said and I thought oh my gosh that's such a mistake oh my gosh how could Trump if\nHave gone with that that's so that's so foolish of and that's so silly and then within a few and this happens less and less now because I realize who were dealing with with Trump or and then time passes and I realized wait a second he was right not to apologize for that they would have just\nMould him like a like a ... I was gonna say a flock of per on us but now I'm mixing things up a like a school of angry raging Peron has a ... they\nThey would have torn apart if he had agreed to what they said he should agreed to about one statement you made or another better just stand and fight and constantly push back on these issues these things that I'm learning from Trump isn't just like all of you\nI have to adapt my approach and my thinking for the the current moment I have to actually think about what's working what's not working and I I reevaluate I'll say one of the most important lessons I've seen one of the biggest\nUh differentiate or is when it comes to whether someone is successful or not is do they have the capacity for self correction\nOr do they have the ability to look at whatever they're doing in life how they're treating themselves how they're treating other people or how they are doing their work or whatever how how they're taking care of their health and an objectively assess what is going right what is not what is going wrong are not going well and make changes\nAnd I'm constantly making changes I mean I have core principles and a and an approach and an east coast but I'm counting making changes to what I think is going to to work best in this this ideological fight I mean that's really what I\nDo your everyday yes I like to present information and there's an aspect of this that's a really just about there I say ... community right we're all a community here on the show\nUm but there's also how can I equip\nThose listen to the show with the best arguments possible and equip them also with the knowledge that they are in fact correct in their beliefs ... explain not just what we should all think about different issues but why we should think that way\nSo I think that's all very very important um\nAnd uh and yeah I I Am also in a process of of learning all the time I don't want to ever make it seem like I'm just the one guy who thinks that he's doing it the right way and and it's never adjusting I'm adjusting all the time Brad writes dear book I just read that Hillary Clinton security clearance revoked at her request\nI was wondering what are your thoughts on this are and why in the world would she make such a request especially if she's planning on running again in twenty twenty I'm a loyal podcast listener and wanted to thank you for releasing your podcast earlier\nSo us folks up here in Alaska and listen to it on the way home she'll giant thanks for keeping us in the know Brad a well Brett Brazil I'm so glad you liked the catches out sooner\nAnd I'm hoping that everybody in the west coast knows that we're pretty much now our podcast is going up for this show for the buck sex and show in drive time on the west coast\nSo ... there's no problem with you decide and that you're going to just get a little bit ahead of the game and a and listen to a lower laid off you don't have to wait and wait for it to be rebroadcast or to be broadcast on whatever stations near you you can listen to it on the\nUh on the podcast however you consume podcast or and so that's great news and you're listening up in Alaska that way and as for keeping everybody in the no I certainly try Hillary under a security clearance\nLook let's just let's just call it where\nIt is Hillary should never have been able to keep a security clearance after the debacle that occurred with her private email server private email account all that stuff and that was just completely it should've been terrifically embarrassing\nOr for anybody not just associated with Hillary Clinton but who was willing to defend that nonsense that she held to a new clearance until this point just goes to show you how broken the system is\nWandering mind you all that just this Friday I Will be doing an event with my friends that stands for research will be about what's coming next in the markets and big big things to tell you about I'll be joining them for a full [noise]\nLive event this Friday just go to book event dot com free to register folks totally free you can watch the whole thing register for free all free\nBook events dot com and getting ...

nursed a patient staffing ratios Markey says it will allow nurses to do their job safely while wall says it will allow them to provide the care they are trained to give\nBut instead of a Republican just answering like that oh yeah\nOh they hadn't been a hawk and they're terrified and they backtrack and they let people like Leslie stall run the table\nBy framing framing the question to advance a narrative they are not looking for an answer they're looking to put you in a corner\nWhat Trump did in that interview was just beautiful and it is a PHD course in owning the lips completely it is a PHD course and how to handle the liberal media\nHe does not accept the premise of the question and turns to question to answer he wants to answer not an answer that's already a you know that they they think they're going to get out of abide by a pre existing narrative and trying to advance she re frames it in his way perfect example was the question about\nThe Washington DC with Trump starts talking about how bad the media is this is eight eight is Trump's narrative it's a narrative that is true by the way that the media is biased against the American people were weapon to be conservative or even moderate Republicans this is a that's a that's a almost taught a logical\nTrump knows that Trump is comfortable\nWith that territory talking about the media and they're biased towards working class Americans and others right\nSo what does he do we re frames Leslie stall smart\nShe's listened she's not dumb she's very bright she's just the liberal just liberal you know pretending to be a journalist right\nShe automatically senses Trump's getting into this media war she knows that works for him and she tries to stop him she cut them off by the way she interviewed them I I saw something on Twitter fish sixty four times and when they interviewed Obama they interrupted him four times\nBut we figured that because that's what they do right\n[noise] she get the rub some to stop 'em because she knows she's now playing on on on the away basketball court here\nShe knows she's playing and his territory she tries to stop him and he doesn't have it he doesn't have it he keeps going and going because Trump knows that authenticity cells and he's going to be authentic even if it comes with battle scars at all\nThat's Trump's MO he is not going to talk and focus group tests the talking points he's going to talk like Donald Trump talks period and the story right\nSo the take away fear\nFor anybody thinking about or ... or interested at all in running for office becoming a conservative activist takeaway number one is you re framed the question to reframe the arguments went answer you want to get not to the pre existing narrative they want to advance\nTrump does it all the time watch you know\nFolks they sell this guy short constantly constantly the liberal media paid for this guy as some kind of a buffoon yet he is constantly having them back on their heels\nSo it makes no sense\nNow he did something else that support not just that he turned around and reframe this thing\n\nHe got the last word and this is critical he would not let Leslie stall that sixty minutes and if you get the last word he gets a last words he did it constantly and he did it one time and what happened what's the benefit of getting the last word and they come on this is simple this is really using\nThe benefit of getting the last word in if you talk last and that's what everybody remembers\nSalt tries to stop 'em on when he goes on this uh when he goes on attack with the media right and he keeps going and then he says at the end and you know Leslie\nAnd and that's why I'm president and you are not and boom that's what everybody remembers at the end\nFolks that's what I think this is the tough time the media is having with this guy they don't understand that it's the sense of again\nA battle scars and all and authentic natural way of conversations sometimes it's sometimes it's heated sometimes it's not there are hills and valleys there are the natural vicissitudes of the ... the conversation he goes up he goes down but when he hits hits hard and people are attracted to that authenticity\nSo we understand if he has to reframe it number one and secondly he understands fully that he needs to get that last word in and he did and that's what everybody remembered because I'm president and you are not\nNow\nThe reason I bring this up is not to just you know law does performance at the point out what he did but to show you how that performance

respected there almost meticulous ability to stay on message however false that message is\nNot in the era of Donald Trump they cannot do it\nThey are so overtaken with rage at everything this guy represents the anti swab rhetoric the anti media rhetoric when they go out there and they spout off untruths them straight up live they cannot they simply can't contain the rage\nHe's got them talking about\nBruce thing in Senate hearings he's got a Cory Booker declaring he's a sporadic is from the or at least just silverstone clueless movie\nHe's got Elizabeth Warren releasing a press release I'm One one thousand Native American jobs by the way to Fox on in the background the Cherokee Nation just responded\nAnd and in a brutal brutal response to this basically full laying her statement Elizabeth Warren who what was she thinking the answer is they worried this is the era of Trump the gas lighting is not working anymore\nThat guy's got what forty million followers or something on Twitter he goes out and give speeches all over the country the media is forced to cover his soundbites he re frames questions from the media and turns it back on them\nHe and he gets the last word and just about every interchange even with the sixty minutes thing over the interview making sure that's the soundbite everybody remembers any talks like normal Americans\nThis is constantly has the liberal media and the liberal focus group folks and they're swamp brat Democrats back on their heels because they don't know how to respond anymore\nThe standard arguments are no longer working there are collapsing they're falling on deaf ears\n\nYou know I said with his fair share stuff that I was talking about before the break that this argument that Trump is Don apologizing\nFor taking money out of the pockets of the government and putting it into the hands of the earners in this country even if the owners happened to be successful and wealthy everybody used to apologize in the past oh no no we're not given tax cuts to the rich why\nWhy are we not doing that why well because it'll look bad well is it good for the economy yeah it's good for the economy so who cares that make the case something it's such a was\nMake the case Trump does see\nI told you the numbers before the break this one I Can't get this number out of my head\nThat do fourteen hundred wealthiest taxpayers in the country pay the same percentage of income tax three percent as the bottom fifty percent of income tax payers this whole\nCountry\n... do you understand the gravity of what I just do the fourth team hundred taxpayers who are successful and wealthy pay the same percentage of the income tax load as the bottom fifty percent of income tax orders in this country can't flip a delusional\nLiberals who are one percenters themselves Bernie Sanders Elizabeth Warren\n\nJohn Kerry John Kerry used as a as a one percent of one percent or\nWill still insists you don't pay your fair share of they have no idea what that even means it requires you to be a sucker to do no further analysis of that\nFolks turning your money over to the government you might as well turn it you might as well burn it you're flushing it down a toilet\nMilton Friedman I haven't brought this up in a while either [noise]\nSo it's worth bringing up again the great Milton Friedman the late great milk treatment he had this thing about the ways to spend money but she used to tell people what you hear it you can never on here and there's no turning back\nThis way to spend money summarizes completely why the government giving the government money is a total complete epic disaster [noise]\n\nWhat are the most efficient what's the most efficient ways to spend ... way to spend money right new spending your money on yourself or your family you on yourself why because\nThe cost of the product you're purchasing matters if your money\nBut the quality of what you're purchasing matters too because what you're buying you're buying for yourself or your family you want a good car you want to go home you want good clothes you don't buy crappy suffers going to fall apart cost and quality matter when you spend your own money on yourself and your family\nWhat's another way to spend money less going down the efficiency scale you spending money on other people Friedman would make the argument there that when you spend money on other people the cost of what you're buying matters because it's your money but if I'm buying a product for Mr producer\nDoes equality matter well I like rich so maybe but let's be honest it doesn't matter as much as if you were buying it for your wife or your family I Know richest feel a little insulted right now but don't take it the wrong way when you spend money on other people the quality of what you're buying a\nMatter so much it's not yours\n\nOther people there's another way to be even less efficient\nOther people\nCan't spend other people's money on themselves you go on a work trip you your job is is a is paying for the hotel that's other people's spending other people's money on themselves you're spending other people's money on your hotel room there's quality matter yeah you're damn right is your hotel room you want the best hotel room out there but the cost\nThat no no it doesn't matter that's the jobs money you know yours give me the the\nThe the top floor of Trump Tower I'll take it cost them matter you may say wow that sounds like a really an official way to spend\nMoney all around it gets worse it gets even worse [noise]\nOther people spending other people's money\nOn other people\nThe most inefficient way to spend you can never on here this folks other people's spending other people's money on other people's ways that it's the government it is the ... pool of government taking your tax dollars to think about the government's taking your money and spending it on other people\nDoes it cost matter how low it their money they don't care what they're buying this equality matter if they're not even spend it on themselves they don't even care they're just giving\nPeople money while we're going to pay for their health care yeah but it's crappy out we don't care it's taxpayer money whatever just go down there spend that just keep spending\nThat's government it is the worst possible way to spend my the government's\nBetter off taking your tax dollars and buying themselves lamborghini's at least they look for quality car and boost the economy or we need we need quality you're not going to care about the costs when they take your money and they spend it on the people the cost or the quality none of it matters nothing\nFreedman was a genius a genius\nYou know understand why it is an imperative to not fall into this gas lighting Trump that we're not paying their fair share your fair share as much as you can keep as possible because every dollar over that amount to fund our military and the constitutional role of government\nIs wasted by people who don't care about the cost or the quality of what they buy beer essentially flushing your money down the toilet bowl\nThat's a fact jak we need the Reagan days ... when Reagan made the argument that government is the problem in Trump's doing that right now you're just force their hand in Congress to get a lid on some of the spending we'd be a okay All right I

literally at a was one of the great projects in my life I really enjoyed it [noise]\nBut there's been a break in that case a real break in the case over the weekend I shouldn't say break a revelation to break in the case happened a long time ago actually but the revelation over the weekend by Congressman John Ratcliffe has been doing a tremendous job um exposing along with Devin Nunes ask Mark Meadows Jim Jordan and various others\nHave been doing a great job of exposing the a disgusting\nGovernment corruption in our intelligence community or department of justice and at the upper level management of the FBI in this scandal to get Donald Trump now folks ah here's what happened this week and let me put it in context for you for a moment for those who\nAre seemingly missed the story somehow I don't know if you've been on Mars or whatever for the past maybe your space travel and\nIt's like that Bruce Willis movie you say with Ben Affleck where they're drilling into the asteroid you've been gone [noise]\nThe Donald Trump tea was spied on by the United states government there were Pfizer warrants issued to spy on the Trump TV may miss some of that but that is what happened in the FBI is given conflicting accounts repeatedly of how exactly this investigation started that sit in a nutshell it's a very wonky case\nMy book as extensive footnotes audit even buy a use liberal foot notes that way the liberals camera phew what they said in the past on it but\nThe case is very simple in its essence opposition political party from Donald Trump Brock Obama's White House weaponized the intelligence community and in some cases the law enforcement community in case and the FBI the upper levels of their management chain\nTo go after the Trump team that's it\nNow why am I bring that up now not to give you go what what's great what else is there a lot to talk about them bringing this up so the break this weekend makes sense [noise] Ratcliffe unleashed they just the port of information to Maria barn Romo show on Fox News and that at Arizona on the weekends\nAnd he said that there is some potentially exculpatory\nUriel hanging out there about George Papadopoulos why does this matter folks and what the heck is going on [laughter] remember the FBI's reasons for starting this investigation the most critical counterintelligence investigation possibly in modern us history\nAgainst a suit to be president Donald Trump at the time a presidential candidate the explanation as to why they did it has changed so many times that they cannot seemed to wrap their arms around why they did it themselves\nIt started as a whole was all about Carter Page that it was all about George Papadopoulos then as I explained in a ... show which was all about alpha bank\nThat's in my book lays it out alpha bank oh you haven't even heard that story and I'm sure you I promise you\nFolks the reason the story keeps changing it's because they were constantly looking for new reasons to spy on the Trump team because the ovaries kept falling apart [laughter] this is what's going on they tried the alpha bank law that didn't work let's try Carter Page oh there's no evidence he's a spy either let's try George Papadopoulos all man up is working out there\nNo shocks what do we do now\nThat's the reason the story keeps changing now here's the problem here's the problem they're having the last story they settled on that was advanced by the New York times back in December of last year\nAnd that they've stuck to since you hear the liberals Paris this to\nYourself George Papadopoulos that George Papadopoulos is low level Trump advisor met with Alexander down or this Australian diplomat in the United kingdom talked about this Russian dirt and that's what did it he passed on the information and there you go bingo we got\nAll these gentlemen what's the problem with\nIs\nThe problem is when you go into a fight that court there's a verification process for the information that you're supposed to present\nExculpatory information to at some point if it be indicates that the the target let me give you an easier example this ... sometimes a little complicated may have been a federal agent [noise]\nIf I Walk into court and swear in front of a judge for a search warrant then I Believe there's probable cause at a prime a crime has been committed that there's evidence of this location and I fail to put out there evidence that indicates that the person I'm targeting in the house we're looking to get a warrant on\nIs in fact not the place and I I felt to include evidence that that person may not be guilty of the crime\nLadies and gentlemen the chances of losing their job if not being put up on criminal charges yourself depending on the severity of the allegations\nAre significant\nIt's becoming clear as day now that the FBI according to multiple members of Congress you've seen this information had information that George Papadopoulos was completely innocent of this that this Russian collusion thing was a fairy tale is made up but the information they presented\nTo the Pfizer court was not that folks was not that it was only this stuff alleged basically in the ... and\nHere say based items that can never be verified now why is this important that there may be exculpatory evidence\nSupporting folks\nBecause of this whole entire case right
