Fox News American pastor Andrew Brunson now in Germany for a medical checkup after being released from house arrest in Turkey earlier today families folks enjoyed and secular\nIt's a celebration but it's also a time when you're going through a lot of emotions very quickly a lot happening this has been horrendous process as pastor Brunson set a terrible process for his family\nIt says sliding scale of morality and all told we only had our public opinion changed by seven percent that entire process that was at seven percent in other words most people are pretty stuck in their basic morality\nTimes people will go you know how is it the best friend I've had over a year turned around and stab me in the back\nWell that's all part of the sliding scale morality\nAnd I'll tell you how it's playing out you've seen in your own life no doubt maybe with your friends certainly with anybody you discuss politics whether you might disagree with and just the overall frustrations you might have about politics in this country let alone\nThe moral outrage still moral outrage by the media on back of ... a visiting President Trump\nHere's how the sliding scale morality words\nUnless you're potentially responded Satan you're probably not evil so how hold out the possibility I dunno ... so maybe you know as long as you're not to the sponsors say nor oh maybe Chuck Schumer you're not pure evil and none of us are perfect\nSo out of steel wanted to say though one is evil ten is perfection we're all Tuesday nights and therefore at our best were really having a good day and where our best versions of ourself\nWe're going to be at the upper end up whatever our morality is let's say you have a really honest in decent person really honest a decent person might be an eight\nMaybe on their worst day there are five now what does that mean well it means that\nI'm not going to hurt you even when I'm at my worst I'm not gonna hurt you because I'm a decent person more than that but let's say that you started out and on that sliding scale morality your sex\nAnd so you're a decent person throughout much of your your life but when adversity strikes when something goes south what happens you slide back three not just suddenly were three oh sure you're going to hurt somebody if it means taking care of yourself if it means putting your interest force you will take others down that's\nHow the sliding scale morality wars that's how people will stab others in the back when you have thought they were your friends are right kind of get the idea here so let's talk about the\nSliding scale of morality a little bit so many people so many people have been reaching out been frustrated how is it still\nThat you have people\nThat defend Christine Ford how is it that you still have people that will say that Brett Kavanaugh's rapist when he wasn't even accused of rape by the way well I mean by anybody other than I have an idea I guess\nThe answer comes down to the sliding scale of morality if you don't have a real moral compass you don't start out in a high place them around to begin with\n... you can make it up as you go every day you view things through the prism that you create\nA little bit later in the show I'm going to talk about UN's climate science and what frauds they are along with Medicare and the fraud that is Medicare for all its financial fraud the conversation\nThe reality it's fraud bunch of people lying to you\nBut it's all part of our morality today to where I Can't lie to you\nIf it suits me and when politicians do it and it works you're going to get more of it and people will embrace it to the extent that it makes them feel good or to the extent that it justifies their existence and I'll give you an example\nI've always had this rule that if somebody reaches out to me and they don't use profanity I'll get around and and respond to them this was a listener talking about Christine for\nAnd I mentioned that hey she committed perjury\nAnd see I Believe should ultimately be tried for it\nNow I add somebody said well her witnesses the ones that ended up feeding her claims maybe maybe they were the ones who weren't being honest and this list there said\nThere may be many reasons why they refuted the claims one of which beat ... could be they didn't remember another might be that they didn't want the death threats to their families oh okay cool cool so you can committed felonies\nWhenever you feel like as long as your reasons are good enough\nIf a sliding scale of morality\nAnd when we're talking about the sliding scale morality and we're talking about Kanye West and the moral outrage by the media are you kidding me are you kidding me Twenty years ago today\nWhat what are we talking about and what do you think of when you heard Oval Office\nIt certainly wasn't about the president of the United states it has something to do with what was on that blue dress\nAnd so for the very media that sucked up to William Jefferson Clinton to have moral outrage over profanity being utilized by Kanye West in the oval office that is one heck of a sliding scale of morality and that is the world we live in today\nMore than ever before it's important to know where your moral compass happens to be or you five or six or seven and eight where are you where\nWhen you're at your best where are you when you're at your worst when you are inviting people into your life who are they do or they are they six is not a good day and three is not a bad day\nYou know last week I was talking bad about beating your head against the wall a lot of folks want to know how do you become more persuasive how can you convince people\nOf things politically\nAnd I mentioned the unfortunate reality which is you have to find people who are open ... to information the first place and the problem is you don't have a lot of open minded people out there as I pointed out with a cabinet deal there are only seven percent of folks top to bottom ... ever had their opinion changed about him seven percent through everything that's it\nSo you got to find people that are open minded and open to information as I pointed out a lot of them happened to be younger\nBut at the same is true when we're talking about who are engaging in in our lives if you don't want to be frustrated\nIf you don't want to be stabbed in the back if you want to find people that can make you feel better about yourself an add something positive to your life you got to figure out where their morality is because any more\nA morality is on display each and every day and it's being perpetuated by a political party each and every day including by a former attorney general who happens to now be saying well go ahead and kick the opposition that's the world we now live in\nSo ... for ... and well look at how far we've come and just Thirteen Years\nRemember the last time\nWe were talking about Kanye West and the president well that was a little bit of a different story\nAnd over the past Thirteen Years a few things have changed and ... who is working right now and a few things about this economy and that's where we're going to pick up next right here

fulfilling prophecy which again you might think George W. Bush was a racist no did I go\nDuring the country in the relief effort when we did have the ... George Bush doesn't like black people yes was aye ms memorized by Michael Meyers in what his reaction was as that everything was taking place yes\nIn fact actually I went back in and watch that but a lot of uh the the little series there earlier today and it's amazing it's as entertaining today is that was the moment it happened\nAnd maybe more so because that just came out of left field so you didn't necessarily understand what was happening until it happened because the George Bush doesn't like black people that was the culmination of everything that had been building up for about two minutes and Michael Meyers the entire time\nHe's looking he'll look at gun yet you look at the teleprompter elected gun yet and then at one point during Tanya is kind of ran\nHe said Red Cross and Michael Meyers nuts [laughter] but yeah\nIt is bad you know we got George Bush doesn't like black people and Michael Meyers\nPicks up and start treating the teleprompter and all the time moment anyway no I I don't think George Bush was is a racist but what I Do think that he and many establishment Republicans engaged in is the belief that you know what we can't win there and if you don't try hard\nIf you don't try to introduce policies that make that big of a difference if you aren't willing to have the politically incorrect conversations well guess what\nMaybe you're not going to have the success you Nate and I'm not talking about politically because again if you want to have political success with somebody what do you have to do you have to prove to them\nThat you can make a difference and as we're talking about record ... minority unemployment rates\nEspecially with the black community at the Donald Trump story so you can sit there and you can say Donald Trump is is a racist Donald Trump is or whatever but you know what Donald Trump is responsible for and the economy\nThat has more black adults at work than ever before that has hundreds of thousands of your families on welfare it's providing a path in an American dream for people who didn't think it was possible and told you had to sit here and collect government assistance\nWhat Donald Trump is doing never forget I've lived many lives even though I'm I'm not all that old I a pack a lot into a given day [laughter] [laughter] it's an understatement given that I Do to morning shows and you know keep going\nBe [noise] I I um I had to smooth the company had a manager there one time\nAnd uh end up getting a call and call came from government office during a unemployment verification jak verify the employment and then they wanted to talk to the employee\nLike OK so hand the phone over to the employee and conversation takes place and I could tell after a couple of minutes that it was ... she was getting upset she's getting really upset\nWas like OK gets off the phone and she tells me you know what to do just happen Senate making too much money single mother she's a single mother\nAnd she was being told that she was going to end up losing some of her government assistance unless she worked less because she was making too much money\nThey were actually telling her to earn less and she was telling them that she wanted to make something out of her life now we're going back nearly Twenty years ago now what do you think takes place in today's environment\nThat's why it took a sea change that's why it took ... catalysts that as a gang James like Donald Trump in so many different respects to break through how many good economies have we had we had a great economy in the eighties into the nineties\nWhy didn't we have record low black unemployment back then\nThe economy was good and the early part of the two thousands why didn't we have a record low black unemployment then\nBronco bomb I mean come on now well of course open change when I was a bunch of bull crap\nBut I mean he he cares about black people right I mean come on look at them well yeah he he cares about having their vote which means you need to keep 'em on government assistance keeping the economy that's mediocre keeping economy that will not allow people to have upward mobility boom you're gone right where you need all okay so now we have Donald Trump\nHave record low minority unemployment rates across the board but what do you say you see somebody like Tania who obviously is not an ideologue was not a Republican\nAt least not traditionally somebody who thinks that George Bush doesn't like black people but somebody who loves Donald Trump you see what goes on there and you see why the media and the leftist are so scared of this man because he did what couldn't be done\n... by my son to the humane society of the United states in the outcome so [noise]\nThis is the sound of salmonella ... rating

Obama's among likely voters his approval rating happens to be right now three points higher than ... three points higher\nNow imagine this for about a president with Ninety two percent negative coverage Baird your president with forty six percent negative coverage\nAnd yet the one with Ninety two percent negative coverage among people who are likely to vote does that are most informed those that are most engaged\nIt it's a rather incredible story that's often emitted and here's the bigger point I've always said that you can lie to people about what they don't know\nBut you can't lie to them about what is or is it in their wallet this was true of Obamacare all the lives that were thrown out there were perpetuated while that whole deal was going down it was guaranteed not dorky was guaranteed to fail but hey we got a bunch of people\nDon't want it to believe they bought into the hope and change okay it's Obamacare is going to be great okay and here we are in eight years later or the same insurance coverage you have\nNinety two percent higher premiums Ninety two percent more expensive eight years after Obamacare you can't lie to people about that well you know about the you know if you like your doctor and keep your doctor and all the rest of that\nSo people understood as soon as they had to pay for it we're in a similar place in this economy a lot of folks get upset about media coverage law folks get upset about the way things are portrayed but remember that if the media media generally had the type of influence\nDo we think they have if they\nHad the type of impact in elections\nAnd that and many will still assume they have there's no way that Donald Trump is your president and again\nThey get mental they want the people know that they're making more money people know that they have a job people know that their life is getting better use are all things that are facts and it's why the most informed and engaged are more likely to approve of President Trump\nIt's why we might actually be one of those inflection point in American political history the kind that might actually lead and Republicans not\nLosing and this presidential election cycles [noise]\nThese are all the things are on the table something else\nThat you can't lie to people about\nYou can't lie to people about financial fraud [noise]\nWe're gonna talk about that and Medicare for all coming up next because Medicare for all is the biggest financial fraud\nEver for such a way I'm Brian mud and for the gray one more glued to\nBuy time the most iconic brand in the booming canon based industry just went public joined me I peeled now my time as we mean bastard dot com dome is your chance to be part of his Purina making busy at high time investor dot com Ben lifetimes investor dot com\nHigh times holding corps offering will be made only by means of offering circular which has been found with unqualified by the U.S securities and Exchange Commission the security's are highly speculative investing and shares a common stock about tenfold and corporate votes significant risks the investment as suitable only person who can afford to lose their entire investment furthermore investors must understand as such investment\nCould be a liquid for an indefinite period of time to public market currently exist with the securities and if\nA public market develops following the offering it may not continue to get a copy of the offering circular which contains information about high times told the court the offering and other related topics including the risks of investments please visit high times investor dot com that's high times investor dot com I ... media and its affiliates are investors in hard times holding court but are not associated with his offer ... media and its affiliates\nAnd not responsible for the information contained with his message be information include the hypocenter better dot com\nOr the information filed with the securities and Exchange Commission\nI may have taken the comedian bringing you see them to bring in ... cats from Frank for the media made in America [noise]\nImmigration stories told they need to them in conversation with me when you came to America was anything different than you did not expect\nI think ... or ...

according to the federal trust the Medicare we hit insolvency in twenty twenty six as it is twenty twenty six eight years from now now what happens in year one nine percent of Medicare benefits to party\nGone first year nine percent Medicare see\nAnd it gets worse every year from there currently you got Fifteen Percent of Americans that are on Medicare Fifteen Percent that's it you got a huh\nThey're presented the workforce contributing to it but you do the math on this one real quick Fifteen Percent on Medicare insolvency in eight years what happens when we put the other eighty five percent of the population on it\nIt is financial fraud that's is bigger than Bernie made off you at a political party that's perpetuating it in Florida we got the Democratic ... a gubernatorial candidate that is running on it\nFinancial fraud running on a platform of financial fraud and by the way\nIf you're not paying attention to order discriminatory all race and you're not in Florida that's okay\nThat's okay but guess what if Andrew Gillum if the socialist when's\nWhere we've gotten much bigger problems because it's coming to a state near you one of the most important elections in the entire country this year is what's happening right here in my home state of Florida where we have run this day and just it was the Trump candidate who is running as the Republicans will replace Rick Scott\nWho was term limited in running for the Senate\nAndrew Gillum is the Bernie Sanders candidate\nI Want you to think about this for a moment because you're used to for being the purple state the swing state we tend to have you know fairly moderate politicians ... no\nYou won't have the most liberal in less just governor and the entire country if Andrew Gillum wins and he got well that sucks to be a win for to know it sucks to be you everywhere because here is what will happen\nWe've already seen it start start to take place Andrew Gillum was not backed by the Democrats in our state\nHe was one of five candidates running the establishment on the left ended up backing Gwen Graham within the daughter of former governor of Bob Graham in our state\nShe finished second to Andrew Gillum Andrew Gillum rode a wave of the Bernie Sanders support he ended up winning the Democratic nomination would just thirty four percent of the vote that was enough to get through\nWhat's happened is they now consolidated around them of course the Democrats the party Soros came in here with his money Michael Bloomberg\nJust came out to South Florida held an event for Andrew Gillum cut him a check to a ... year Michael Bloomberg felt like he said that the populist the sensible guy he's backing somebody who is a democratic socialist for governor and the state of Florida\nBut what's happening now that they're getting behind him and that he's running at this point a race to where he is a slight favorite to win\nThere watching closely and they're saying hey he's getting the young people young people typically don't vote in mid term elections\nAnd so what happens in Florida rarely stays in Florida but this ... is critical and again there is one platform piece of particular\nThat is really important to watch and it is the Medicare for all which by the way is all that much more ironic what you're talking about governor trace because Medicare federal program that doesn't really matter Andrew Gillum has also run on impeach him President Trump a kid you not\nThat's part of what's going on here\nNow this is why it's important to educate\nIt's why it's important to inform simple concepts like this\nIf Medicare is already set to fail in just eight years and benefits will be cut and you've only got fifty per cent on it it is impossible it is a financial fraud is out and out this honest is that you could put everybody on it and it's got to get better\nThere is no way without massive tax increases massive benefit cuts to be able to achieve what they're talking about\nBut if it wins politically than what\nWe've got much bigger problems on Iran's here's something that is one of the biggest challenges we've got today financial illiteracy\nOne of the things that drives me crazy the average adult average adult it financially illiterate if you really want to be afraid of the education establishment be afraid of this the average teacher by the way it also happens to be financially illiterate\nI'm not getting a ... not making it up it's according to federal the finger up as a basic financial literacy test\nAnd right now more than sixty percent of adults fail it up basic financial literacy tests and that's part of the problem we have with conversations and concepts like this\nDoesn't matter how educated one is\nGenerally if they are financially illiterate then these concepts might be bought and sold kind of like hope and change and Obamacare\nSo having these conversations making sure that your financial informed making sure your kids are financially informed pretty important not only for their everyday life but when it comes to concepts like this because ultimately it's not complicated\nBut it is brought its financial fraud is dishonest and it's guaranteed to fail\nWe'll come back and talk about another\nBig time fraud perpetuated on us the minimum wage who earns it pretty much nobody and that's the dirty little secret talking about that next I'm Brian mud in for the great one month\nHim mused bombs in conservative dong dong ding dwelled on during\nYou know what's not smart job sites

those moments but President Trump is like okay what do I do hear you talk about role reversal because he is usually the people may person making people dumped herbal but you gotta gotta feeling better once you got a dose of his own a kind of thing there\nAnyway uh talking about some of the financial fraud that's been perpetuated Medicare for all is a financial brought again if you miss what I had to say about a half hour ago it's a complicated and and this is the way the shutdown drop the Mike argument you have\nA Fifteen Percent of Americans on Medicare right now it's pasted insolvency an eight years\nFifteen Percent ... percent of folks do work or on our contributing to Medicare insolvency in eight years what\nHappens when you but the other eighty five percent on back to you okay so that is the greatest financial fraud that would ever be perpetuated on this country and it is a disingenuous dishonest argument that is\nPerpetuated on people by virtue of the average adult being financially illiterate and again now my opinion\nProven by the NRA sixty percent of adults are financially illiterate all part of the problem that we've got to overcome informational year but he or something\nAs many as a frog that is perpetuated on people I talked about the benefit of the tax cuts and how the average person net take home pay this year\nUp six point seven percent which by the way when you run into somebody well I haven't seen any benefit from it well that's just because you probably haven't done anything about it most recently we've seen in a report that came out showing that about thirty million Americans never made any adjustments either their employers didn't they didn't put the tax cuts\nIt's all going to be reconciled when they file their taxes but they wouldn't be seeing that money right now if they had actually made the adjustments with their employer so that's what's going on with almost everybody so I haven't seen it well it's because you haven't done anything now the next poured that fraud comes in with companies\nYou hear how awful the tax cuts are because\nEvil corporations you know the the ones we worked for the evil corporations they're using it to buy back all their stock and you know do what rich corporate fat cats do to screw the little guy\nYou know that that stuff except that that's a fraud as well is dishonest to its ally the ah seem to be saying you know the the vast right wing media CNBC [noise] they have the CFO council and they get research from them constantly\nOn what's going on with any number of different issues and so on the tax cuts\nCNBC what their CFO council\nHave found a a few things that are interesting for example what is the the most common way to has been the biggest beneficiary of the corporate corporate not the first of all the corporate tax cuts\nThe share buybacks right this horrible shareholders of what you probably are one\nActually the employees get this according to the CFO council CNBC is now thirty five percent thirty five percent\nOf all tax cuts savings has gone through a combination of bonuses and employ you raise is\nThirty five percent twenty percent has gone to debt reduction which makes sense we've seen interest rates rise companies that have dead they should paid off that helps the company become more stable lessons their debt burden with rates rising\nFifteen Percent Fifteen Percent on share buybacks ten percent upgrading software five percent upgrading ... uh upgrading equipment and five percent have increased evidence so all in the combination of sheer bat buybacks in David in payouts twenty percent that's it\nAnd even then you probably benefit because once again something that is not perpetuated informational ... by our friends and media generally\nFifty two percent of Americans own stocks and by the way despite the volatility of the past few days way with the greatest wealth creation machine the history of the world is your United States stock market so I don't apologize for that anyway but the biggest beneficiary is you\nNicole was a member of the shelter pet group that's right\nA group known especially for the sunspots sleeping bowl chasing laid

Lewinsky thing that yeah that was okay oh that was\nActually part of the Nineteen Ninety eight midterm election at all and beach minute effort which is interesting because really the number of different comparisons you could actually make between that midterm cycle in this one but are they talking about some of the\nMisinformation out there for all that is Medicare for all talked about\nHow much more money we're really making that take home pay up six point seven percent year over year and then you get into this recent study that was really just mind numbing it's why we have the broad being perpetuated that is Medicare for all survey\nRepublicans believe us economic system is fair to most Americans Democrats don't came out earlier this week Republicans believe us economic system is fair to most Democrats don't\nHere's the irony of all this success not exactly being part is a good guy you know is not exactly you're right wing Republican conservative type\nBut guess who else isn't like all of your richest self made people in this country for a few names of the richest Americans for about\n... pesos Warren Buffett Mark Zuckerberg\nBill Gates you happened to notice a trend here they all happen to be left to ease once again two sides to stories one side effects so why is it\nThat with the richest the most successful the wealthiest individuals in this country actually bean ... than most Democrats feel the euro us economic system isn't fair\nDoes gets back to what I pointed out earlier this hour sixty percent of adults being financially illiterate\nBut here's the more important point and this is another shutdown argument if you want it you'll have people talk about how much more fair it is elsewhere well guess what the median world per capita income\nIs ten thousand two hundred Ninety eight bucks\nAnd the United states you can even legally work fulltime and earn less than sixteen thousand dollars a year since the minimum wage in the United states which as I pointed out a little bit ago only point six percent of the population orange is approximately sixty percent higher than\nThe median income around the world so to all the folks who said that our economic system isn't fair nobody's keeping your ear to let's go to Ryan and California Ryan go\nHey uh as soon as the tax uh\nThing went through I've paid attention to my paychecks and right when it went through I notice thirty dollars more and I went to all of my co workers where I work at a Bush and all those guys they're like well I've got thirty it so it was like thirty to thirty five

devastation you might even has some of those images in your head and one of the things that\nI ended up noticing\nWhen we're taking a look at some of the imagery come back from Mexico beach ground zero for hurricane Michael\nA lot of pictures that looked an awful lot like what we saw with Hurricane Andrew you heard a Rick Scott\nSay there's like a tornado or this you know in hurricanes a lot of people but the focus on the category and the tops of state when\nVery rarely is the wind the issue and hurricanes but I Know that sounds weird if you're not used to have having to deal with them wow good hurricane be about almost anything but the went just as you saw what boards and the Carolinas just as you saw with hardy\nIn Houston last year it's still flooding storm surge flooding\nResponsible for the overwhelming majority of damage and death and hurricanes rarely is it about the when now Hurricane Andrew was about the wind\nWhen you get to a certain level you are not just talking about a tornado you're talking about a hurricane that around its core is a tornado to give me an idea you got that scale you know you've got the F. one through the F five tornadoes go right\nTops Hussein wins in a hundred and fifty five miles an hour\nHurricane Michael was three miles per hour away from being an F three tornado I'm very for Jim I got my my family has been trying to ah\nTo give me a heart attack I was saying\nI Am I got my parents and my sister my brother in law veteran Naples the last year or ma I hit them directly they ended up being alright ironically and I'm On the other coast um southeastern Florida um I was without power for five days we had a little tornado came through tore up some of the power lines near us\nThey were without power for like going to say actually fared better where Hurricane Irma truck directly than than we did go figure\nBut I got a brother in Panama City beach use all of the reporters through Michael that were on PC beach give me an idea and he will as a ... about ten miles from ground\nZero and really about four to six miles outside never lost power and bill without cell service pretty much for the past couple of days boat in the marina basically fine\nRight they are back close just a matter of miles and that's because we're talking about a hurricane that went through as Governor Scott said like a tornado\nThere's something else that it was kind of a an important and the cons contacts in the conversation and this is a a meeting you for anybody who could be a long any coastline you'd be in the northeast could be anywhere in between you could be on the Gulf and take a look what happened in Mexico beach\nI ah I had an idea there's one silver lining that came out a Hurricane Andrew was building codes we have what's called the Miami Dade code that is rock solid you don't do anything but concrete anymore\nIn affected areas and it makes a difference every now and then you see the pictures of Mexico beach you'll see structures that are still standing right next to whole areas that are just completely wiped down nothing but to bring and you'll what's the difference there\nHad an idea that a lot of those homes ... well before we had the Miami Dade standards after Hurricane Andrew in Ninety two went back and took a look the average home that was built Mexico beach is Nineteen eighty three Nineteen eighty three\nWell before those standards would framed homes and so the media you is your in one of those types of homes and you're at a point to where you could be impacted by a hurricane\nYou know you you might want to think about your situation or because if you get a hurricane that's like a tornado comes near you know think about the impact in your home the ones that are standing",
