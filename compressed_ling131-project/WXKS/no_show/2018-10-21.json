often the most popular and best selling games every year just as the most popular and best selling films tend to be quite violent but at the same time just as though there's a lot of violence at the cineplex\nThere are also the local our house theaters showing great thoughtful quiet contemplate of films video games work the same way there are an enormous number of really beautiful smaller games are independent games made by individuals who are just trying to get some idea across\nUrban says it's important for people to see video games as more and adjust violent he says there's so much more to the vast library of games then just first person shooters\nVideo games can teach empathy they can teach social skills video games can teach high level of problem solving they can be as maddening in some regards is the most difficult crossword puzzles they can teach us motor control in some regards\nThere are frivolous video games they're our video games that are as junkie as brain candy like as the worst Hollywood spectacles\nBut there are also video games that are\nAre working at a deep intellectual level and making us rethink the world and our own assumptions about it\nAre being says that as a child in the Nineteen seventies the light bulb that video games could be more than just disposable entertainment wind off in his mind when he was just a kid\nOne of those experiences that right now we take for granted it's so mundane that we no longer think about it there was a game called adventure on the Atari twenty six hundred and this was the first game where there was an avatar on the screen that represented\nAs players and of course this is obvious now we have avatars and every game we play where all these characters and all these games\nBut the first time that we saw that I saw that was this little innocuous square on an Atari twenty six hundred that all the sudden that was me somehow on the screen and I'm also sitting on the floor the living room with a controller the joystick in my hand\nThat represents a fundamental shift in what it means to be human and that sounds like a grand statement but I think it's true that Walt Whitman famously said I'm large I contain multitudes and he was speaking about how each of us as an individual\nHas all these different voices and personality is an attitude and we are complex difficult creatures\nWith that little square and adventure for the first time it wasn't that I contain multitudes it's that I Am multitudes I Am more than one thing at one time\nAnd as time has gone on bourbon says that experiences become even more engaging as the video game industry has grown more and more vast\nThe greatest strength of the video game medium is that diversity of games and kind of games and that goes along with the diversity of the players themselves everybody plays games now every demographic every age group it's a very exciting thing\nAnd I think that speaks to what makes this medium slightly different from books which I Love obviously I've written a book there's an inter activity to read and there's an indoor activity to watching a movie I don't think we're merely passive viewers\nBut when we play a video game there can be a social aspect that is enormously rewarding and I think that communal experience of telling and sharing and experiencing stories together is very exciting\nUrban says that ultimately like films before them video games have transcended their status as a technical achievement and become something more powerful\nThe general idea that I started with is kind of videogame be a work of art\nHas the definition of what we consider art broadened enough or had video games progressed enough as a medium that they've become artful and what I've discovered is that the ladder is certainly true that there are video games right now that are\nDoing all the things that great movies do and great books do great TV does we're seeing that more and video games now\nAcross any platform you might

there was very distinct rash I'm On his face um and also on his knuckles and on his knees and his elbows\nI'm weird basically went down a few different paths trying to explore this because it was it was pretty odd I'm so we didn't know what we were\nExperiencing or what he was experiencing in what it meant um so we went to see a lot of specialists um and\nThe uh the physical uh symptoms began getting worse um she'd actually gotten to a point um before diagnosis where he could not\nGet himself off the floor he couldn't a dress himself he couldn't get out of bed on his own way to carry a
