professional mobs squad on the left but other Democrats are in the Senate and on the Judiciary Committee\nAnd\nI don't think for for as far as flake is concerned he voted today for\nKavanaugh in us it's not technically a vote for Kavanaugh to vote to go to a final vote\nAnd the rule of thumb always says that as these procedural votes goes so goes the final vote but but but you can't make book on that simply because of the abject real frightening threats these people are getting\nAnd I think the vote for flake today was really hard I'll tell you why he went from being a yes vote to being harassed on the elevator\nTo becoming a yes vote with the FBI investigation he got what he wanted there still leaning on him he's leaving the Senate this is his final term uh the\nEasy thing to do

percent of millennials\nIdentify as democratic socialist according to a study that has been taken uh [noise] your you'd like to not believe this by the facts on the ground is just what you see\nEven though maybe anecdotal evidence indicates that a lot of them have fallen for this millennial men were far more likely to identify as some kind of socialist than women a total of forty percent responding of formative late to the question now how would that help can that be\n'cause there's one thing or something just doesn't drivers socialism you know what it is self reliant self reliant taking yourself seriously standing up for yourself believing in yourself relying on yourself\nBeing a man just does not jibe with socialism\nSocialism does not work well with self reliant people socialism in communism attempt to her race self reliant people self reliant people people do not need do not depend on anybody but themselves their immediate circle are a huge threat\nTo social is in

has had as one of its target the the masculine as they should have men and they've been very open and honest about that they've even conjured up terms for it toxic masculinity\nDangerous masculinity they are doing their best to erase mailed natural male characteristics\nPurpose many young guys as they can and since guys want to power around with women whatever women want is what many end up doing on balance I mean you have individual exceptions of course\nYou got Clint Eastwood's or you've got James cons tell everybody to go to hell when they're told how to live and how to act but on balance men do what women want them to do if the big book as famous and hot women did get men are going to go say they're reading it or try to become conversant\nAt just the nature of things and so they're being\nHighly highly successful and targeting America and its founding not just ...\nAre getting capitalism it's targeting the concepts of individual liberty and freedom and targeting the concept that

Kaiser on trying to get her to possibly change your testimony yeah uh she she's the same person that the boyfriend or Dr Ford mentioned in the letter he sent him talking about how\nAre those coaching going on but Dr Ford on trying to get somebody to handle a polygraph\nProbably yeah that's another story by the way to boyfriends letter has yet to be reported in\nMainstream media nor has the story of Monica McLean pressuring Leland Kaiser to change your test of those two stories have not been reported ABC CBS NBC Washington Post New York times Associated Press people have not heard either of that\nAnd there's other things like for example a Dr Ford mentioned in her son it I mean on her and the test of mine she she mentioned ... Delaware was where she was that and that's the last known address of oh this Monica McLean\nCorrect yeah there's a ... absolutely that's when they wrote a letter when when when ... Ford wrote a letter that's where she was she was in ... ... a Delaware with McLean yeah\nHere's my question there's there's an emerging picture that there might be a lot going on but beyond that behind the scenes here that hasn't come out yet I I'm Wondering is not is it is the Democrat oddly enough or not better off holding this vote now before more of this comes out\nIt's\nGoing to go through at the last minute change one of the people that things are going to vote changes it was certainly it goes down and a quarter and then because all this is about to come out\nAnd it's not about to come out that's the whole point\nYou know it but it's not going to come out it hasn't come out yet it's not going to come out now one thing it has the lead when Kaiser a pressure to change your testimony that is in the FBI report the Democrats have seen that Grassley reference to the end Grassley said there's a lot more\nThere are many more examples of ... witnesses being pressure to change your testimony and Democrats have seen all that it doesn't change and it's not gonna change anything this is not about the evidence\nIt never has been about the evidence and if those two stories miraculously made the front page of the New York times website in five minutes and it ABC CBS NBC began to report on this if it wouldn't change one Democrat Senate about\n\nDemocrats can't delayed about anyway that's up to McConnell the turtle well\nThe question is why wouldn't Republicans make make a greater effort for it to come out\nWhy was it made the effort to uh uh [noise]\nUh it's in the FBI reporting to Republicans and Democrats can see it it's the the the Monica McLean aspect is in the FBI report they discovered it\nTo my to my knowledge none of the senator grassroots so forth are not mentioned but we were just talking about\nYou know they know they're not I can't tell you why they're not mentioning it\nOkay thank you you bet I'm Wondering myself um well\nI Know your questions are entirely legitimate and they're rooted in pure commonsense\nYou're sitting there thinking yes but we all know this it would change everything it shows that the ... the foreign side is willing\nTo commit perjury supporting perjury pressure witnesses to change their stories which then couldn't be standing to conclude that there's not anything that ball Z Ford is saying it's reliable\nBut those two stories have not been seen by the American public at large they've not showing up at Yahoo News the Associated Press New York Times CBS NBC CNN and they want for ...\nIsn't the stories are being

today\n\nTo uh I I I guess he sent it to Schumer remind US Senator Feinstein and in this letter he calls out Mazie Hirono the senator from her by e M Feinstein by name\nAnd let me read just a portion of grass all his letter indeed if the evidence supported your clients allegations you will surely would produce it as quickly as you could\nBut you have repeatedly refused to produce this evidence to the Senate in doing so you are preventing the Senate from considering the evidence most\nDr Ford's allegations I don't know what other infringe we shouldn't draw from your refusal but with the withheld evidence that the withheld evidence does not support Dr Ford's allegations in quite the way you've claimed\nThis is the polygraph he's talking about the notes with a polygraph and the therapist notes Feinstein and the Democrats have not produce those even though balls the Ford admitting that she took a lie detector\nWell her warriors did and that she had seen a therapist\nAnd the grass when he's been asking for that evidence and Feinstein and the Democrats have not produced it and he's saying you have repeatedly refused to produce this and in doing so you're preventing the Senate from considering the evidence most crucial to Dr Ford's allegations she passed away in fact we want to see it\nThey won't let him see it\nI don't know what other infringe we should draw from your refusal but that the withheld evidence does not support her allegations wiped away you have claimed\nIt's a reasonable thing to say they're out there saying she's not gonna lie detector that she passed the lie detector that she told all these details to her therapist let's see that stuff and they won't produce\nAnd Grassley said you're must you must have something to hide then he writes I urge you once again now for the third time in writing to turn over to therapy now it's the polygraph materials and communications with the Washington Post said Dr Ford has relied upon as evidence\nIn addition to the evidence I requested in October second letter in light of recently uncovered information please turn over records\nAnd descriptions of direct or indirect communication between Dr Ford

the violation\nAnd I shouldn't call it that these are this is the kind of decorum that you you don't see broken senators don't challenge each other and they don't call each other out that's almost the Senate rules\nAnd and Grassley yesterday during a joint Republican press conference he kept running back to the microphone don't intend to the Senate or are they\nThe media people as [noise] using by us and so forth in fact grab one of the aisle soundbite number five\nThis was [noise] I don't know if this was at a press conference or not it may not be exactly what I saw but it is an example of a grass with his finger on the pulse here this is I'm not it's not what I've seen this this\nMorning and washed but let's listen to what we have learned is the reason is that has existed since the day after the November twenty sixteen the election is centered right here on Capitol Hill they have encouraged Marlboro\nWhen you hear things about get in their face bother people at every restaurant where you can find a cabinet member coming from public service that ought to set an example of civility in American society and it's been made worse by what has happened to judge Kavanaugh I Hope we can say\nNo to a mob rule by voting to\nConfirm judges Kevin on the floor\nThat was during his ah southern for remarks today in favor of capital he was he was singling out by the way Maxine Waters\nFor promoting this as he called the resistance but he's he's calling them out here\nAnd\nChastising them for encouraging mob rule and that the resistance leadership is actually right here on Capitol Hill and he's right the leadership of the resistance is the Democratic party the resistance is over the Democratic National Committee\nAnd in various Senate offices and offices of Congress members of the house and so forth he I've I've never seen this before I've never seen these guys on our side call out the Democrats like\nThis fit to be tied now I think I have something that might relate to it I got an email\nLast night from Salinas Ito who has made a name for herself\nBy traveling through all of these blue states during the election campaign season of two thousand sixteen she went to all of these places in blue states that were going to vote for Trump and she learned anything about these people she could\nShe took them seriously\nShe went and met them and talk to them learn about them nobody else in the drive by media has done anything like this\nBut she wanted to find out who they are she lives in Pittsburgh she had a sense that something was happening out there\nThat the Washington establishment didn't see\nAnd rather than gas she actually wanted to find out who these people are she went to a lot of small towns\nMedium sized town spent serious time they're getting to know these people she has stayed in touch with them ever since the election she has written a book about it if the Democrats in the media wanted to know who voted for Donald Trump all they'd have to do is go get her book they haven't they don't read it they don't care to know who the Trump voters are\nThey're not interested in appealing to them they're trying to find out ways to make Trump voters irrelevant or keep them away from the polls they want to separate Trump and his voters from themselves but they're not interested in finding out who they are so as to maybe convert them\nTo ah never Trump or his or anti Trump presents an amazing display of arrogance\nAnd by the way the same can be said of Republican political consultant so they don't care who the Trump voters are all that matters is that they are left at impugn didn't made fun of so I get a known for her last night\nAnd she is explaining to me what the Kavanaugh hearings have meant and what has happened out there in these areas she has study\nAnd she made essentially two points\n\nOne that something has needed to happen after the two thousand sixteen election to keep the coalition that voted for Trump together\nNow a lot of us of assumed that if people voted for Trump in two thousand six saying that they did sell for very specific reasons among them Trump is alone in fighting the Washington establishment that Trump is alone in in in pushing back\nAgainst Democrats and the so called Washington conventional wisdom and then the assumption is that if people knew that in two thousand six day and that they would not forget that and if they would realize the need to continue to vote in ways that would continue to support and unable Trump to be successful\nAnd she makes the point that it doesn't work that way sadly\nThat after a single election with the known result something needs to happen besides just another election of party members or Trump is not on the ballot something needs to happen to make those people as eager to vote two years later as they did in two thousand sixteen\nAnd that\nIs the Kavanaugh circumstance in her mind the conservative populist coalition\nThat elected Trump\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe whole thing required her to come to Washington for this to pull off she had to come to Washington\nSo\nWe look at Hillary Clinton's email server investigation and the Trump Russia collusion or what do we find a woman who happens to be helping balls the foreign defeat Brett Kavanaugh and his nomination to the Supreme Court\nWith every Democrats saying within minutes of Kevin all being nominated they're going to oppose it\nWith every Democrats that they believe her even though she doesn't have any evidence in time magazine just put her on the cover new covered time magazine was a gift like ...\nOr ... she's she's she's seen taking meals um [noise] it's pathetic\nThis whole thing is going to set up is my point and the people that set it up are the same people that have been running the silent coups against Donald Trump\n\nAnd every Democrat on the Senate Judiciary committee knows everything I just told you but rather than it'd be a problem they're telling themselves how well organized they are and how brilliantly they pull this off in their world\nThey've made the American people really believe that this woman was minding your own business one day when she was Fifteen and this nominee to the court came in ... and she's just\nA woman that she\nLikes to children in fear of bees here\n\nI think what a masterful Dwyane Wade pulled off we got everybody in this country thinking hey but summing it didn't happen did that we have nothing to do with it when this whole thing is an orchestrated screenplay\nAnd that's why ... won't turn over any of the cycle or the therapy Emily a polygraph information for the Judiciary Committee to look at\nAnd the Republicans notice too but the power of the Democrats is look at the Republicans that are quivering and a little afraid to go ahead and can confirm Kavanaugh this Democrat machine is a scary scary bunch Democrat machine includes the media\nAnd all of these psychological deranged protesters that are out there threatening and in some cases committed violence\nThe

Tennessee and it's the bread\nAnd Aubrey just wants to win and so forth but this he expects this to pay off for him in his campaign this is obviously a reaction and reflection of public sentiment for Kavanaugh in the state of Tennessee\nPhil Bredesen is by the way we're starting to lose ground to Marsha Blackburn in polling data this is for Corker is Steve And Corker by the white has also tweeted today that it is outrageous\nTo punish somebody who hasn't done anything to anybody for all of these some pose an actions other men have engaged in against women but his point is we have no evidence\nKavanaugh did anything to anybody we're going to design a seat on the court because of that and then the next day we're going to die because of the judicial temperate temperament and then we're going to deny because he committed perjury and I've been going to deny it because if your eyes in a bar back when he was in college\nBut Corker made a plan that he doesn't think\nKevin all
