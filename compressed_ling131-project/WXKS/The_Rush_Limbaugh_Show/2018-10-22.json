live at the White House\nHas thousands of Central American children and parents attempt to make their way to the U.S Mexico border President Trump resumed tweeting about the migrant caravan asserting that criminals an unknown middle Easterners or amid the crowd for which he offered no evidence he also said Democrats are to blame for not working with his administration on immigration reform\nAnd here's what I found today CNN is spending almost eighty percent of their time on the show ...\n\nEighty percent middle ... even if it's just sixty percent of their time on your shoulder you better not focusing on the care of him\nThat tells me\nThat if the caravan wore a Democrat idea\nDesigned to embarrass Trump that they would be covering it and building it up and with people down there interviewing these people creating sob stories there'd be there'd be man on the street interviews with a mean guy Trump is\nAre they just want to come to America and that may yet happen down the road but CNN is is not wall to wall but they are predominantly\nFocusing on the show Gabe\nAnd of course whenever CNN does just to try to damage Trump let's blood and the wife CNN is so ticked\nOff because Trump's approval numbers are higher than they've ever been now\nAnd there are higher than Obama's war at this stage in the ah in his mid terms of the same point in his presidency after two years there just beside themselves none of this\nIs happening the way it was supposed to happen now there's more and more stories about how the blue wave may not happen hint hint it never was going to happen I don't think anybody has ever known whether it's going to be a blue wave they've been relying on polling data but nobody knows for sure that was that the media narrative\nIt was a meeting that was not born of any evidence there could be any evidence for a blue wave or a red wave the election as an happened yet everybody wants to rely on polling data to suggest is going to happen but the polling data hasn't been accurate either starting in two thousand six dean of the presidential race\n\nSo we've got this caravan chugging north and I think you know put sort of things in perspective on this again the way to look at it is is as a\nA microcosm of what's happening every day and our border every day this is what's happening\nNot seven thousand a day but but but every day this is what's been going on for decades and it needs to\nStop\nAnd Donald Trump is the only person that's ever talked about working to make it stop now the Democrats if there are behind this one of the strategic ... besides getting somebody hurt\nAnd blaming it on Trump maybe what they're hoping is a Trump actually won't do anything about it\nMaybe they're hoping that Trump will be all huff and puff talk about sending the military down they're talking about setting a National Guard but not actually doing anything they might be rolling the dice that Trump isn't going to do anything because they think they've rattled Trump\nWith their stories earlier this year about how he separated families the border and how Trump didn't all white the network infant didn't want it to last and so he did what he couldn't to change it I\nI Do know this despite everything that you think you would know the common sense there are still Republicans elected Republicans look at this caravan and their solution is to let them in\n\nAs elected still mayor ... year about peace yesterday they are so scared of this issue they are so scared\nThat when ever the subject to legal immigration comes up Democrats automatically when Republicans think they've got their show they're not cold hearted mean spirited and all that let them at their not publicly saying this but I Know that there\nMay be the Democratic gambling is too is is is a wild guess at Trump's actually not going to do anything after huffing and puffing and I'll tell ya\nIf Trump doesn't do anything if this caravans allowed to get to the border and come into the country what do you think that would do the Trump there's one\nIssue that could separate Trump from his voters or at least make his belt voters began to\nI don't doubt\nIs the right where they would be my totally disappointed particularly after Trump has said over and over again that this caravan is not going to get it\nIf if if if some\nRepublicans are behind this than than it is obvious uh but I just somebody has to be\nSomebody has to be making this happen folks we're talking we we've got how many two thousand miles\nStop and think of this from Honduras\nTo the southern border of the United states assistance Arizona is around two thousand miles\nSeven thousand people one day\nJust decided to start walking to the United states\nTo thousands of miles\nI also think if you're looking for people behind this you have to look at the drug cartels and if you want to start trying to analyze will what their politics in this be that opens up a whole new can of worms but I don't doubt that they are playing a major role in transportation\nBut there has to be political involvement here too because the money has to be available there has to be money being spent on this\nSo you've got seven thousand people who all of a sudden and decide all of a sudden because nobody saw this coming and there was no advance word of it\nSeven thousand people decide to start walking to a thousand miles we don't see\nPictures of of of where they're using the bathroom we don't see pictures of them gathering or getting food and eating it\nI mean look at random video you might you might see some people throwing things I mean we don't see how this is being handled we don't see the port a potties we don't see and are they just urinating and rivers and streams and what would the environmentalist wackos think about that if that's happening\n\nWell it [noise] I guess you you may have a point welcome to San Francisco they could already be accustomed to it especially the deaf occasions in the street and they got maps in San Francisco for the tourists because boy and the piles of human feces\n\nSo how long would it take to walk two thousand miles along with a ...\nRemember they're vowing to get married just hit the southern border of Mexico they're vowing to get here by mid term election day\nSo I don't walk enough to know\nHow many miles a day you could walk if you just start walking and you take a periodic break and after twelve or Eighteen or whatever you stop and slow down and rest for the next day\nThat people tell me that they would have to be walking something like twenty miles a day\nFor one hundred days I mean if it makes sense to a thousand miles twenty miles a day for a hundred days without any rest\n\nA hundred days for those of you in a real Linda that's over for three months\n[noise] and the objective is to show up right\nAs the polls open on mid term election day [noise] so if they had been walking for what two and a half months have we seen video of the walk and it's beginning remember the caravan was originally thirty five hundred or four thousand people now it's swollen\nJust seven thousand and the word is it may become ten thousand [noise]\nAnd then of

motivation of some organizers of the care of it by the way the [noise]\nThe details on that story are from the uh oh here's one\nFrom NBC and they are literally outraged over what ... saying sectarian

also they're inciting violence under the influence a politically motivated leaders\nHow was it raising the state\nTo point out what is happening what is the secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes Sunday night how was it raising mistakes to point out what's happening\nEspecially when\nWe have a party a political party that believes in open borders a media and the party that believes in open borders they will never report anything\nNegative about these invaders\nRight mind would want this who in their\nRight mind would want any of this illegal immigration who in their right mind would promote this didn't want this guy who won a mob an invasion of seven thousand now eight thousand people to storm the border in the world would want that and why\n\nIt makes no commonsense under the umbrella of what's good for America\n\nWhat ever motivation for the people who want this to happen it's not for the good of America it's got to be for something else so Pompeo goes down and promptly identifies what's happening here NBC says raising mistake what stakes\n\nWe have somebody finally pushing back on this because remember the Republican Party up until Trump never didn't push back on this they they came up with their own reasons for wanting\nAmnesty for illegals and for you know having a fall squash on securing the border on Sunday night pump pale who met with the Mexican president went on the offensive alleging in a statement that many of the migrants were criminals themselves\nBy definition they are if they intend to cross the border illegally they're all criminals political world is so damn hard to understand about this\nI think it's a classic illustration of how soft discovery is getting in one of the reasons this country is getting soft just because the elderly or senior generations are turning over everything to the young who haven't lived long enough to know what's best\nFor being driven solely by a motion govern stolen by a motion\nNot any ... any kind of common sense and because of some odd Kirk that's happened\nIn our sociology adults today seem unwilling to teach young people right and wrong or to help them benefits from the wisdom comes from having lived a bunch of life and having I may I ask a bunch of experiences\nThere is no way under the sun and this makes any sense what so ever\n\nWe may as well not have any border if this is something that people want to advocate for permitting and allowing males will just to raise the border and said to the world come on in\nBecause that's in essence the impact of this if it's not stopped if it's not dealt with\nThe people of the world do not have an entitlement to the United states taxpayers back pocket but the Democratic party assumes or seems to think that they do\nThe Democratic party is calculating that there are more people who want to get in to the American taxpayers back pocket than there are American taxpayers\nAnd saw the Democrat Party is siding with the people around the world who have nothing who thinks that because the United states has a lot they should just be able to come in and get whatever they want\nAlmost as an entitlement we have a political party pushing this we have a political party promoting this this political party ought to be no where near winning any thing\nIn the next elections\nThere is not a single reason to vote for these people under any real breakup commonsense\nTake a look at the things they advocate take a look at the people they try to destroy take a look at the things they are promoting it defies common sense to support this\nAnd frankly I don't think they have as much support as the media narratives would indicate\nI don't vote somebody to tell you right now I don't believe and I haven't been here

Administration is attempting to eliminate the whole classification and I'm going to tell you why I agree with that but all of that coming up here is the final Louie Gohmert bite again bill hammer\nOut we're concerned these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who would exploit them were also concerned\nAh there's Pompeo saying this we're concerned about violence promote by some members of this group\nAll of these people trying to force their way and\nIt's called an invasion and thank God we have a president that will stand up to an invasion of like this but under our constitution that Governor thing call out military troops to stop an invasion and I've heard people on TV so called experts say\nWell you can use the military because a positive comments out of ... that normally prevent some military from being used against its own citizens\nIt has nothing to do with using the military to stop an invasion from another country so there's nothing unconstitutional illegal about the president knowing what window Wilson did put tens of thousands of people on the border and make sure nobody forces their way and\nIt's a no brainer folks get is a number of the president can do that and has committed to it you did you you you\nHe may not send the military and I may call as a as a congressman Gohmert says there but there's no law says he can't this is what is one of seven thousand Russians were about to force their way into the okay what uh seven thousand Russians are about to force their wife or the southern border\nTo try to affect the mid term elections what if we can make that case what do you think people will be demanding Trump do stand aside and let the seven thousand Russians in so they can hack our computers and make sure the Republicans win them in terms of it's a joke folks at the junk you never know who's listening I'm just asking you what if it's seven thousand Russian\nCommunists thank God I was trying to get in an invasion either\nWay you look at here is Mike in Youngstown, Ohio getting a call in here in the first hour welcome sir how are you\nGood good Russian I Hope you and your family's all doing good\nListen I I think this has all the makings of a bad set up for Trump\nBecause of the optics are I don't care if you're militarized was the border that if they bomb rushed the border like that down in the southern side of Mexico where they tried to stop what's our military is supposed to break out the times or water hoses or\nTear gas that's just going to look so bad that Trump is going to take the brunt of it but he needs to do is call a\nA house and the Senate back into the emergency session and doing national address and put everybody on the line not just try to deal with this self\nSo bring him back in for a special session or do what pass legislation specifically saying that this mob is seven thousand can't come in\nSomething though that sort\nI mean are you using Trump needs to share the burden of providing the obstacle that if Trump sends a military down and they started cracking the heads and it looks bad for Trump exactly so you think that's what the actual intention here is by the people playing this thing\nExactly and that's where he can try to deal with this on his own she leaves to put everybody else or but on the line get them on tape on film or whatever what should we do what what do you like to do if they come across\nActually like that in a way I like making Schumer and Pelosi stand up for letting these people in any way it's a good point it's a it's it's it's a it's a

doesn't even show the people ... through the parking lots to get in there was a mile long line of people to get into the Trump in Mesa, Arizona the media is not reporting this aspect of the Trump rallies\nThe media is not telling you how many people want to get in are trying to get in how many people are showing up and standing in line because if they did\nLocal media may I don't know\nNational media CNN PMS NBC ABC NBC CBS are not showing this because if they did it would put the lie to the notion of the all the energy is on the Democratic side meanwhile there's not a single

contrast here is striking and that's why you do not see any news coverage of the size of let me tell you something\n\nThe ... the number of people the size of crowds to get into a Donald Trump rally is ten times the size of this mob that is invading the country currently coming up through Mexico you've seen those pictures of the media is happy to show you those pictures\nThe media can't wait to show you this so called caravan of seven thousand people soon to be a thousand people and they claim might end up being ten thousand they'll show your pictures those people all day well here's what you need to do when you see that\nPicture seven thousand people or what is said to be seven thousand people multiply that times can that's the number of people trying to get into a Donald Trump rally in Mesa, Arizona and even more than that at a rally in Texas\nI Wish they use AT and T. stadium is Jerry Jones palace where the cowboys play put a hundred thousand people in there so you think\nThe

thousands upon thousands standing outside lining up twenty four hours in advance to get into a Donald Trump rally and I'm telling you that kind of thing does not happen to people losing elections were about to lose elections who are losing favor with the American people it does not happen\n\nHow many of you by the way how many of you wouldn't joined a crowd\nOkay back to the phones we go to a certain voting\nIn Macon Georgia great to have you with us on the E R B network Hi thanks for having\nMe on Russia appreciate you about Wilton it's great to have you here\nHe thinks the reason why I called I spend a lotta years military are retired from the gory interesting although we are very good a lot of things we're not good at basically civilian type a non lethal warfare we've gotten much better at it\nSince Afghanistan and Iraq started but that is one thing throughout the years we not be good at so this situation that look I'm One hundred percent for putting the military before but this one does perils and we have to be careful\nWell when when you said the military is not prepared for an invasion you're talking about ... this is not a military invasion of talking about a ... a human way of uh invasion of people that are largely are going to be thought of is starving thirsty poverty stricken this kind of things simply demanding\nLife what am I gotta let it play in the military is not used to standing up to people like that certainly not in Flint thing and yeah the harm on them is that what you're saying\nYeah I think the difference is you know when it comes to ... we're very good when it comes to less lethal we that's just not something we do that well we're individual what you're sort of very good at it but that wouldn't be enough\nOkay what about this what about just the president's here's the U.S military standing at the border you will not cross\nOkay what happens then if they do and and\nThe problem that's the peril is part of the problem\nWe're but you don't you and your ... your ears bullet you use ah one of the dummy is called I forgot that the use you use some kind of force but not lethal\nWe'd have a quality of the things you but you know all it takes one person going down and squeal and like a pig and then it's all ... we just have to fold up I don't see anything good coming out of this but the president would be tremendous\nBut the presidents would be okay so there's ... you think the military showing up is let me just put\nWords in your mouth and you tell me if I'm right or wrong and interpreting you you think the military showing up as a Lowe's Lewis proposition\nNo I think initially is a great idea but we have to be prepared for the next step\nWell but you say we can't take the next step because the next step is not what they're good that they're not used to it don't know how to do it\nNow that's the power you know I ... I think we should but we'd have to be prepared politically and militarily\nWell then what is it what's the preparation it'd be ... we'd have to be prepared to use deadly force like\nOkay well let's let's let's let me give you a scenario then okay I'm just doing this in the interest of time I'm not that may it may sound insensitive don't mean that\nThey hold the line I hold a line provide a visual presence a visual obstruction they send the signal not welcome do not cross there will be constant warnings but somebody dies and they have to shoot one or two then what happens\nWe'd have to shoot one I'll tell you I think you'd see a lot of people fall in line at probably with Bush which I'm Talking about members of the the immigrants illegal aliens but we'd have to be prepared to take that one or two it's terrible but that's what it\nTakes you don't think if one or two gotta hit them with storm that caused the mob in rain storm the military just in and and and it it essentially stormed the bullet storm that go out and do you think they would cease and desist\nI think they will cease and desist I'll tell you there's a lot of times you guys have a tendency to fold up when they are met with equal strength and we just have to\nEven if there is a casualty or to the drive by their story Trump Terry fires on harmless or an armed hopeless people\nAnd there's the peril yeah\nOkay so the alternative is to let them in\nNo I have to hold the line and and like I say if somebody is what Democrats are always saying hey somebody's\nBut if they want to change the legal sleep it's unfortunate but what they what they take it all but it can there's just\nYour own okay right shoulder responsibility for what happened to them has to be on them you think the media is going to love the fact that this is I'm a ...

America to be then you've\nGot to vote Democrat because that's what the Democratic party of today wants to happen\nSuccessful America needs to be punished whatever else is going on it's still boils down to an age is old argument over philosophy and it's this\nAre you better at running your life or is the government better at running your life\nThe Democrat Party believes your not capable of running your life and they don't want you to learn that you can\nThey don't want you to learn that you can be self reliant and achieve great things they don't want you to realize that you can be happy and content on your own the Democrat Party wants people to believe all of that is only possible\nIf government makes that happen or let's have happened but more and more what leftist actually want government to do is punish\nThe Democratic party has become a party of groups\nOf victims and these victims have turned over to their own futures to the Democrat Party they have decided that life is
