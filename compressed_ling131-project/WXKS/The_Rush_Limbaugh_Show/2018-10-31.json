noticed today and again he's talking the freight formal about all the recent shootings in mailed the pipe bombs and ... says there was another have filled criminal just last week in Kentucky\nAnd other white man in custody for shooting and killing two African Americans in a grocery store we barely had time to cover\nWe have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terror threat in this country is white men must have been radicalized to the right\nAnd we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them\nYou know they have a Muslim ban there is no white guy ban\nNow John Lennon uh ... what is your reaction to this I mean the folks I'm telling you this is not a one off this is I mean there's specific of a white guy Bannon but that may be something that he individually holes but the idea that the opposition\nAs far as the leftist concerned is white men predominantly white Christian man that's that's data on the money that's right exactly where they are aimed\nIn the perversion view the Americans left is white men who created this racist and bigoted unfair unjust immoral country do not consider me to be exaggerating here\nThat is what we are up against and this all of this from the from the ... days all the way up through the Obama administration and a real objective has been\nTo transform America away from\nTraditions in institutions of the founding based on the fact that it's all racist and it's all bigoted and it's all unjust an unfair they continue to point to slavery\nAs the primary evidence the primary example are exhibit\nOf their claim that America is unjust or unfair of course pay no attention to the steps America took to end racism that gets no credit gets no mention whatsoever as far as they're concerned racism and slavery still exist in prisons on the caravan and immigration policy you name it\nAnd so this is what's animated and this is certainly what has energized and Phil ... of women all over this country with rage leftist women it's being utilized\nTo what a great effect but that's the single organizing purpose is racial or I was gonna say racist but it's racial in uh in its origins now it covers much more grounded in terms of its objective but that's their target that's what they're using and had been for a while to energize\nEverybody who is not a white man they're using victim allergy and victimhood to a tea\nThey are making people think that they have no chance in America as long as white men continue to run it and be a white men or continue to be the majority and they just continually enraged people they ratchet up the anger there has to be an outlet for it\nI think they are if you if you want to start attaching if you want to start a tax\nDoing media responsibility to the actions of people and notice how quickly they want to do that\nNotice how quickly on the left at people who commit crimes are not really responsible for them they're always the result of environmental things\nAnd so on the left telling us that these guys are being motivated by Trump they either love Trump or they hate Trump but whatever Trump is making them do these things I think it's day\nIf you're going to if we're going to go down that road never going to start attaching blame the people who don't really have any responsibility for making the bombs or pulling the trigger on the guns who is it the raging them like I say you cannot turn on the news today and find a single thing positive about anything\nYou can't you you cannot find any reinforcement anywhere in public media for the good innocent decency of America it's quite the exact opposite\nAnd since these people are of a vast majority immediate you know they exempt themselves from having any role in all of this while they are eager to try to find anybody else in media who might be to blame for this\n\nDon Lemon said this is a Monday Night also that he doesn't see Democrats killing people over politics you mean Don like

cops murders have been defended\nAnd explained away by people like you\nIn the sense well cops and they mistreating they're racist they deserve it\nBut don't try to tell me that Democrats are killing

[noise] at least\nConsumers that any other business out there\nAny other retail business I think the news business has people that know the least about their customers and consumers and I don't know

their consumers are customers like the news business does\nBut the news media has a habit that it was is assuming\nAn operating on the assumption that whenever I think they can wherever they care about is what everybody thinks or everybody cares about so I'm not so sure that all that momentum got interrupted\nIf that momentum was interrupted ... imaging level declined and wire Trump's rallies still so over the he's got one in Fort Myers like it's Fort Myers\nYeah Ford myself ounces of people already wind up Trump's got six rallies planned between now and election day you've got all the way up to the night before the election\nAnd he's pumping a series of themes and one of the themes is how great these past two years have been for the U.S economy reviving moribund industry is bringing back employment bringing back wage increases bringing back a economic confidence\nConsumer confidence in the economy\nUh he's talking about how\nAll the things he wants to do to slow down the illegal immigration but he was having to deal with obstacles put on his way by both parties always messages\nAnd he remains is upbeat and optimistic as anybody ever has in circumstances like this so whatever is out there in the daily news media's not affecting Trump doesn't affect his mood doesn't affect his uh\nAttitude or anything of the sorts I think a lot of it as wishful thinking I got a lot of this idea that\nAll of this momentum that the Republicans had has been kinda stopped because the pipe bomb and the synagogue shooting this was you know I I circle back to I really don't know what's gonna happen on the lecture today and I don't believe in the hills does because we don't have fortune tellers\nAnd all we have is polling data and then yeah that's a toss up you want to believe what do you not want to believe it is it is it accurate is showing these close races really\nClose to me that we don't know we never know until the aftermath\nHere's Trump tweeting out at Paul Ryan Paul Ryan will be focusing on holding the majority rather than giving his opinions on birthright citizenship something he knows nothing about our new Republican majority will work on this closing the immigration loopholes\nThis is about this is this a classic Trump comes out gets a conversation started on a lemon dating birthright citizenship and Paul Ryan is one of the first opponents to speak up criticizing\nTrump saying why you can't do that that's unconstitutional but\nYou know it's ... I'll tell you what's frustrating to me there is all kinds of great news in this country economic news all kinds of a rebirth and there's evidence that everywhere and the Republican Party itself is not even getting that message out\nI don't know about individual candidates an individual races but the national Republican Party apparatus\nIf it weren't for Trump and his tweets\nAnd his his rallies the American people wouldn't have anywhere near the idea of the decent good things going on out there because Trump's own party is not joining the PR parade on this\nThat's one of the reasons I'm never going to join this crowd and people thinks Trump should stop tweeting and Trump should stop all these uh incendiary things he says why let me ask you\nSome people it's horrible what Trump said about Paul why\nIs it why is it why is it\nA problem the Paul Ryan took the first chance he had to disagree with his own president about this and by the way all this this is a conversation starter right now\n\nIt's it's mandatory it's necessary that we have a conversation as we don't get a handle on this immigration problem you can say goodbye to America is you know it\nWhich is the design that's one of the reasons why the supporters or what they are Mollie Hemingway it was a great piece today [noise] speaking of cabin on it's just right on the money and let me ask you a question during the Kavanaugh hearings\nRemember all the Democrats question and Kevin I remember all of the allegations we had balls the forward with her allegations of whatever capital I did that led to the fact that capital spiking punch with drugs to set women up for serial rape we had all of these women that were dragging forward\nClaiming they have evidence of it none of them ever present at any but the media and the\nDemocratic Party were hell bent on convincing everybody the cabinet was such a rotten guy that his life and career deserve to be destroyed\nSo\nAfter Kavanaugh was named to the Supreme Court he is he passes it gets ... gets ... give a confirmation vote and is in sworn in why did the media drop it\nIf Kavanaugh was such a rotten S. O. B. Y. has the media stopped its investigation\nRemember all the Democrats are yeah yeah I Would have Kavanaugh's confirmed we're going to a piece you were going to throw out of there we're going to get rid of those guys are represented serial rapist where is all that just it's gone is it not\n\nMollie Hemingway if the media and other democratic leaders wanted to have any credibility and all that the post hearing release of multiple allegations was not a pure political stunt\nFor which they were willing to destroy a man why they continue to fight for justice everyday wouldn't they they'd still be out there trying to nail Kevin all if all of that was legit\nIf if everything capital was accused of being was actually true as they would not have stopped at him being confirmed on the Supreme Court they would still be out there right because of justice\n\nThey would be out there asking every democratic candidate whether he believes Ford and supported impeaching Kevin why are they doing that there is a big campaign going camping I was a big rally in point Kevin always a reason to deny the Republicans continued leadership in the house\nSo why isn't the media asking every Democrat candidate running for office their opinion\nIf Kavanaugh did you believe balls the Ford and if you did do you still support impeaching capital where are these questions the reason those questions aren't being asked of the reason why the media isn't doing is just because it was\nAll trumped up it was manufactured none of it was true it was a classic Democrat operation like every damn one of these is\nNone of what they were saying about capital of his true it was manufactured they didn't bring balls the Ford up until the very end as a Hail Mary if balls the Ford were actually telling the truth she would have been one of the first witnesses\nShe would have been one of the primary ways the Democrats ought to get rid of Kavanaugh but they had this little requests from her not Jimmy made humbling terrify do here and so they had a built in excuse not to use it that was convenient\nThis whole thing was manufactured the whole thing was made up\nYour Republicans running for office have you ever debates left you need to start asking a Democrat opponents they still opposed Kevin all don't let them get away with dying they ask you ask them if they still support Kevin ... or oppose Kevin I asked them if they are going to demand that he'd be impeached if they win\nReelection or election\nIf this Kevin all thing is going to work it's going to have to be turned back on the Democrats the Republicans running for office are going to have to keep bringing this up either in campaign ads we've got a week it's not too late to include this in any ad campaign if if it's been decided to leave it out\nNot too late to cut some new ads and re inserted\nPeople need to be reminded let's pretend that some of the momentum was lost and okay we've got plenty of time\nWe got the E R B network got all kinds of ways to remind people what happened to Brett Kavanaugh who did it what its purpose was and the proof that it was a series of lies and made up charges as evidenced by the fact that now there's not a single story about it\nBecause the media lost the Democrats lost\nIn their effort to destroy Kevin ... they lost in their attempt to use Kavanaugh to hurt Democrat hurt Republicans in the in the mid term elections\nHere's another one is that cabinet confirmations circus\nWe're about justice for his alleged victims the women instead of about killing his nomination by any means we'd still be getting updates on the story when we I mean if it was really the purpose about getting\nJustice if it was to make sure that these women that were sold on the line and so abused in Seoul rape by Kevin ... is the point of all that wants to get justice\nThe time I get more calls over and over and saw one game\nAnd on leaks out on ...\nOn the on the\nFox News on Chris posture President Trump tweets

Minnesota this is a Ella image great to have you here with us Hi\nThank you so much for taking my call I was a twelfth grade American history teacher for Twenty years and I finally had to\nLeave because the regime was becoming more than I can handle I started writing my class called courses because I couldn't handle how they had revised American history the reason I called was the topic on immigration\nImmigration and if it's in the book probably gets about one paragraph\nWhat most people don't understand is when these millions of people came over\nTo Ellis Island we didn't just open our arms and say come on in the way the Democrats want to get him now these people were given a thorough examination by the ship especially looking after I used to take a device him like open up\nThe upper eyelids and if you had a disease called trick karma you were automatically let go they made you walk up and down steps to make sure that you were strong and we're not when that\nNo one to ship doctor perform his examination you were put on a ship and you were sent to Ellis Island where they gave you a second examination doing that trick coma exam once again\nWalking up and down the steps and if you didn't make it you were sent back about two percent of the people were sent back and the reason why it was so low is because the ship doctor really did a thorough exam\nIf you were sent back the ship had to pay for your passage back to Europe so they wanted to make sure we did not want any one that could not work\nWhich are not healthy and what's not strong\nYou realize that what you're describing is factually correct there are people listening to you today who think my God America was cruel back then where am I that's what people are thinking listening to you tell a story\nSure they probably are because they've never heard it and we were compassionate to those who could work um there was a saying that said I heard in America they had streets then I heard the streets with tape\nBut the gold and then I found out I was going to be the one page Street's but we did not want people would be on welfare we did not want those people we want it only strong healthy she thought that's been totally left out of history books and\nI Can't tell you how much it frustrates me to listen to these Democrats talk about how wonderful and we will all how a lot of fighting not true\nI have a nine year old grandson and I'd just shudder to think about the kind of history he's going to feed learning it's um I don't get on giving him for Christmas one if you're ...\nOh wow man very ...\nBecause I think that where's he going to get it going to learn it probably was on his ... all the fights they can't even a paragraph to maybe Benjamin Franklin home\nI'll Try a paragraph Abraham Lincoln you know I I John Silver Boston University at Boston University of way back in the nineties did a survey of the most popular\nHigh school history textbook and found one paragraph in reference to Abraham Lincoln one paragraph there were pages devoted to Bill Clinton for example in an American history the name that you want to know is Howard Zinn Howard\nZen as a textbook writer as a as a as a as quite as I socialist Marxist and he somehow has been a gold the vast majority of text books purchased for use in American public schools have been written by this guy but you know you remind me of your story about Ellis Island I Need to tell this story again\nBecause immigration has been a subject for as long as I've been hosting the program\nSo over Thirty years in one white thank you very much I'm Ella for the call I really I'm I'm Glad you got through to remind us about Alice Alice I not only by the way we're checking people's health\nThey were determining whether or not people actually wanted to be Americans it was a restrictive process\nWe were much newer and younger country them and we had an entirely different attitudes about immigration and growth and it was required that immigrants assimilate and it was required that they be healthy we we're not going to open the borders to illness\nWe we're not going to expose the American people to things through accidents or or design but more importantly the immigrants who were allowed in\nHad to demonstrate that they wanted to be Americans they had to demonstrate that they love America\nAre you ready when apple announced that the new ... book air is made of one hundred percent recycled aluminum\nThe young people in that in that room\nErupted into a game a standing ovation\nAnd I said to myself well it's all over the environmentalist wackos with this age group have one\nMore than any technical advanced what're achievement more than any cool aspect to movies gives most of the fact that it was a hundred percent recycled it just these kids have been told that climate change is destroying the habitat that there may not be\nAway for life to be sustained when they hit sixty five you'd be amazed at the number of young people have been brainwashed and propagandize to believe that and so the fact of Apple's introduced a little bitty computer units made a one hundred percent recycled aluminum was the big news of the day\n[noise] holy smokes\nNow let's go to the audio sound like this this folks I talked about this earlier here's the evidence first up Jake Tapper CNN with Erin Burnett last night\nThe president of the United states making a controversial visit to Pittsburgh today after the deadliest attack on Jews in American history\nPresident was greeted by hundreds of protesters singing this land\nIs your land protesters with signs saying the president's not welcome as always stop what they perceived to be his assault on immigration and refugee the protests are not surprising\nOf course not after you protests are not so ... what what does immigration refugees have to do with this event anyway why are these protesters there okay so here's Jake Tapper\nThe protests are not surprising it's totally understandable nobody wanted Trump here Trump is hated Trump is reviled everybody wishes Trump would not come in every did come they wish they would just leave\nSo now we go to the University of Pittsburgh Medical center president\nTrump first lady you Monica Trump Jared course they're walking through the halls to visit people wounded in the synagogue

him but the purpose of it is to start the conversation Trump is done them that's what conservatives and was as a form of movement back in Nineteen sixty four\nA and there are those examples where were you know that that somebody's going to lose either at a local race or a presidential race but in mid term elections I can I can show your countless in in two thousand ten\nWhen the Republicans picked up sixty three seats nobody forecast that the closest I remember to anybody forecasting a massive Republican takeover was none other\nThan the prince of darkness in himself Robert Novak back in Nineteen Ninety four predicted I think to within two seats the Republican takeover of a house in those elections I think we one fifty four seats\nAre forty something out of he predicted was off by two but nobody predicted the Republicans are going to pick up sixty three seats in two thousand ten\nI mean the media didn't want to think anything was even possible because it's so much love and devotion respect for Obama and then when it happened you should've seen if you remember\nThe bottom fell out the window and it\nJust totally came out of their sales\nIn two thousand two everybody thought everybody that Democrats were going to walk away with the house of representatives because everybody hated Bush\nBush was not duly elected Bush stole the election in the Florida recount with the help of a twisted Supreme Court and Democrats did the Wellstone memorial and that was going to galvanize Democrats all over the country to show up and vote and there was no way\nAnd what happened Republicans gained ... seats\nThe left was done to the drive by media couldn't believe it so they're\nExamples even when people are dams certain what's gonna happen\nThey end up being surprised the brightest minds the greatest go rose the most heralded analysts\nAnd it's all about presenting an image of making it look like you know what you're talking about more than anybody else does\nI have here is from a ... a real clear politics by one of the written down their poll\nAnalyst and data analyst there is Sean ... day and I got to read the whole thing in print town to four pages bought the headline here on certain days in the womb as men terms and her final stretch\nNominate tell you what this long piece says I can do this long piece in three words we know nothing on certain\nDays alone as Mitt in terms of their final stretch\nTo twenty eight ten midterms are working their way toward a conclusion in a week we should find Leno who will control the house although at the outcomes close it could take weeks to finish counting ballots in California\nThe consensus view is that the Democrats are favored to take the house of representatives analyst disagree on just how large the majority they're going to win is\nAnd how likely that majority is if you are split the real clear politics toss ups\nIn half that's much polls it results in Democrats gaining about twenty five seats\nFor a narrow two hundred and twenty to two hundred and fifty majority\nI tend to think says Mr trend day that the toss ups will break disproportionally toward Democrats\nAnd see something more on the order of a two twenty five to two hundred and ten Democrat majority but this is here splitting to a certain degree okay so here he says and the second paragraph it's all over and it's a Democrat's two hundred and twenty five seats the Republicans with two hundred and ten\nNext paragraph at the same time\nThis isn't the only way to read that thing the Democrats pick ups could be larger but they could also be smaller\nHere are some things that shouldn't bother\nAny sober minded elections analyst in the final week of the election why we just concluded here and as the Democrats are gonna end up with two hundred and twenty five states and the Republicans two hundred and ten so why do we analyze any bird because the truth is we don't know\nThose are my words not in this trend days [noise]\nHis words resume here will there be a late break as we learned in two thousand sixteen and in a less dramatic fashion in two thousand fourteen a late breaking the races can alter the landscape substantially this year there are a lot of undecided voters remaining\nLook at the most recent house polling from the New York times Sienna in some races and get to the gym membership numbers\nThis adds up to a situation where a slight break in the undecideds toward one party or the other could be the difference between a healthy Democratic majority in a slim Republican but wait he's already predicted to twenty five to ... I'm not harping on Mr trend day here\nIs we don't know he's given you here's Beth gas but now he's given you every reason in the world is ... ... to ... you can think of where they're not that way\nGiven the closeness of many races and the president's improving overall job approval it is also unclear\nHow about your weight all of this in the current cycle well then how did you get to to twenty five to ten if it's really unclear how to evaluate all this [laughter] but that's just me you know being smart alec or in New York's\nTwenty second congressional district Sienna college places the president's job approval at fifty three percent so Republican representative Claudia Tenney as possibly in better shape than her polling numbers suggests\nBut what about the nineteenth representative John Faso is up by a point that the president is job approval is at a forty six forty nine split\nThat suggested very close race and there are likely a lot so\nTrump's on the ballot or he isn't\nIsn't going to matter what Trump's approval number is in some of these house races or is it not [noise] anybody who thinks Trump's not on the ballot here\nNeeds to reexamine things and then the next burger how many votes are Democrats wasting one of the biggest news stories this cycle has been the massive influx of money\nAnd to Democrats campaigns this initially showed up and marquee races like Beto O'Rourke challenge of Ted Cruz but it has since filtered down into more marginal races like Indiana's nines\nOr California's first or a outer Mongolia of seven\nAnd all of this is relevant because Democrats right now have a roughly seven and a half point lead and the generic ballot\nWhich asks which party would you prefer to have control of Congress now normally this would be enough to flip the majority but if Democrats run up the score in districts that are unlikely to win suddenly that seven point margin translates into a closer than expected seek but then there's another consideration and that's how heart related army errors\nMeaning how reliable aren't the ... thing and then\nThe next paragraph are we're relying too much on one poster oh that's a pretty straightforward concern and then the next one is early\nVoting telling us well the pet response is nothing but that's too simple early voting returns usually tell us something but unfortunately they can only be deciphered in retrospect meaning we don't know the early voting is\nStill it's over we're not counting votes yet so all we now is party turnout but we don't know how these people have voted nobody does the only way you can determine early voting is after the election\nIs over but yet we're still going to talk about it [noise] so the final paragraph what else is lurking out there and this is probably the biggest concern and the what else is lurking what yet to happen that hasn't happened that could swing a bunch of boats [noise]\nWhich renders every poll prior to this day largely irrelevant\nWhich is why I continue to\nRail against polls about congressional midterm races in November the year before or in August of the summer before because the stuff that's going to determine the way people vote hadn't even happens so it wasn't going to the polls but here at the end of this four page story what else is working out\nVery well that's probably the biggest concern we've we've gotten good polling on the\nCandidate go competitive districts but take argument to and then realized that in some of these districts Republicans might be caught napping we've seen some examples of this such as the open seat in Florida Fifteen or the incumbent Rob all in Georgia seventh film [noise]\nWe don't however no how big a problem that says right now or even if it is a problem I suspect we'll have a surprise or two on election night but\nWhat if there are tens of surprises regardless of whether that happens we're well set up for such an eventual out on the bottom\nLine I happened to us\nI just idea what's going to happen but my job is to tell you how it all looks to me [noise]\nAnd this guy is one of the best and I do not anybody misunderstand what I'm doing here this
