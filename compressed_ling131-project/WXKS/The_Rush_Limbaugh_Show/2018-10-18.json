make this happen there are a lot of kids by the way and the magic of the camera pan is the children\nAs it always is there are children in the caravan and that it's kind of like the baby on board

anti Trump is Phil Mudd ... former intelligence official US government now CNN commentator\nBut who who is it that would think if you're on the left to think this massive caravan arriving in the United states at our border close to the election who thinks this is going to help Democrats how would it help Democrats\n\nIt's not just Trump separating him as Trump not let no man\nI go there has to be what it is these people actually are figuring that a massive ... they don't understand that this kind of thing is why Donald Trump was elected\nDonald Trump was elected to stop this kind of thing to stop this invasion and that's what this is this is an organized bought and paid for invasion and it's growing so obviously the plan is for this group of people including the children to arrive here\nVery close to the election and for Trump just sick I saw them and the border patrol on them and to deny them entry or\nTo separate the children from the adult so that's a\nDrive by media can then kick into gear with stories that are\nAlready written that are all ready taped\nInterviews with people on the caravan already in McCann where these people will say they're shocked they came

nearing completion and then it is ready to go\nI went through yesterday what the what the hope here is uh the hope here is to revive the Trump colluded with Russia narrative and to make people think

Blitzer said do you think that Muller is preparing new indictments\nThe really interesting part of this is a potential report a draft report and narrative if you will from Mali going over Rosenstein let me play this out Washington Rosenstein gets the narrative that says not only\nThis is what we found that my violate the law this is my picture of what happened during the investigation there's going to be some dirt in there so in addition to the indictments I really want to see what's in that in there to report\nOkay so this is one of the business going the Mueller report is going to be full of supposedly horrible stuff Trump is none none of which\nIs probably going to be in ... none of which is going to be impeachable although the Democrats win the house they're gonna make moves in that direction anyway\nUm but he says the important point of the smaller report will be the dirt dirt not the indictments which\n\nThere's nothing for it less they make it up there never has\nBeen any Trump collusion and never has been the evidence or less they make it up so the smart money is that it's going to be filled with things that are accusatory\nThat blamed Trump's incompetence ineptitude essentially blame Trump for being so in over his head that it looked like the Russians have worked with him to steal the election despite the fact that there is any hard evidence it's hard to refute the idea\nOf going to make it look like Trump is in over his head doesn't know what he's doing threatens the country with his presidency because of his incompetence that's what it's going to be but

Clinton\nThe Democrat Party moderate elite has been overtaken by the left wing radicals and that's why some are scratching their heads anyway\nFrom two thousand one or two thousand Eighteen to share a Democrat voters would describe themselves as liberal has grown from thirty to fifty percent yeah well you don't want to know something else the percentage of Americans that call themselves liberal is shrinking now into the high mid thirties\nThirty five percent tops the American people identify themselves as liberal he doesn't say that [noise]\nI'm adding that the percentage of Democrats who say they are moderate has fallen from forty four and a thirty five percent percentage of self identified conservative Democrats has gone from twenty five to Thirteen percent that here we go now this is a long piece but this next grab this is the money\nGraph ready well educated whites especially white women\nAre pushing the Democrat Party decisively leftward according to Gallup their share of white Democrats calling themselves liberal on social issues has grown\nSince two thousand and one from thirty nine sixty one percent of because of this gross white liberals are now roughly ... percent of all Democrats voters\nWhile a substantial percentage of Democrat minorities identified as liberal those percentages have not been growing and anywhere near the rate they have for white Democrats\n\nWait a minute into those are the level of white working class was totally go to hell\nNow all of a sudden the white women are the majority of the party ended the percentage of the Democrats represented by\nMinorities is not growing\nYou mean\nI guess that's why Trump's approval number amongst Hispanics Latinos and African Americans is that a record high\nFor Republican candidates\n\nWhile a substantial percentage a Democrat minorities identify as liberal those percentages have not been growing anywhere near\nThe rates if they had been for white Democrats so blacks and Hispanics have not contributed significantly to the rising percentage of self identified Democrats liberals\nIn fact says Mr Thomas Bee ends all white liberals are well to the left of love black

emphasis them African Americans\n\nNow wait because earlier this week we have a story but the Republican Party owns white suburban women\nRight we do so\nRepublican district teacher is Liz mayor said yeah yeah it's just another Trump tweet in an on going pattern\nWhen you constantly behave in an outrageous fashion people get immunized and numb to it and in fact [noise] [noise]\nRight on cue I have a piece in the wall Street Journal they're written Mr certainly the name of Lance tomorrow ring a bell to you\n[noise] Lance Morrow used to practically run time magazine back in this I Believe is the premier journalist not was not an executive buddy practically ran the place [noise] [noise]\nI met him at Mr Buckley is home here in ... you were good birds but Lance Morrow was a a\nTypical turtles which means means weapons so far he's got a piece in the wall Street Journal\nThat is the headline is we've grown accustomed to Trump always concern is that Trump's outrageousness\nNo longer fuels anger on the left as it should give people just got used to it\nUp the anger subsides it's bad because that's the only thing the Democrats have to get their people\nThe polls\nAnd here comes ... mayor a Republican strategist making the same point but she's not doing it in a positive way yeah you know what this guy's been a river bay for so long and just people who have gotten used to it\nShe says\nI don't believe the headline Trump attacks fuel report well maybe the headline is true the Republicans fearful about losing suburban women but I don't think Trump's comments stop and think\nFor a minute here there may be an isolated case I'm a suburban woman thinking that I Can't support this guy he just called a porn star a horse race\nBut\nThis election is really important and people that are involved in this election now how important it is and people that have voted for Trump in the past and have voted Republican know how important it I just don't I don't think the media's learned his lesson yet this is not the kind of thing that is going\nTo cause Trump to lose an election you mean there's a few votes here\n\nIt may it may have caused other Republican candidates to it'll lose maybe holy elections but but but not Trump\nI just think it's all part of the equation in which Trump critics still don't get it they don't get the bond between Trump and his supporters they never will understand it because they're not curious to understand that\nAnd so they take these things that they think are just outrageous insults just so totally permissible in American politics and they\nAssume this has it dead zip Trump's finished this has to be it and not even the Access Hollywood video than it\nThis isn't going to do it\nFrom the ... dot com Trump threatens military action of Mexico does not stop this immigration onslaught\nPresident\nTrump today warned that he may take military action to stop immigrants from crossing the southern border into the U.S may just not take action to stop me on this is the caravan\nThat's headed our way Trump railed against Guatemala Honduras and el ... saying that they have almost no control over their population I'm watching the Democratic\nParty land because they want to open borders and existing week laws I'm watching a Democrat Party whether salt on our country by Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador leaders are doing little to stop this large flow of people including many criminals entering from Mexico to the U.S [noise]\nThese people I don't I was talking earlier I'm ... I Know that that the Democrats somebody has to be paying for this there is somebody out there and maybe a lot of them who really think that somehow this is going to help the Democrats get votes\n\nBy sending a caravan of four thousand illegal non citizen Americans on a caravan all the way up from Guatemala and Honduras through Mexico\nRight before the midterm elections as we discuss somebody's paying\nFor this that somebody they have to eat they have to be drinking things they've got to be using\nFacilities somebody has to be buying the gasoline to transport vehicles to power the vehicles that are being used here but I guarantee you these people are not walking every step of this thousands of miles journey\nSo who\nThinks that this caravan arriving within a week say\nOf the mid term election date helps Democrats by itself how does this help that this is what got Donald Trump elected\nThis is what turned out the giant Trump coalition the invasion at the southern border that neither political party took one step to stop so what's\nThe calculation here well we had a caller earlier suggesting that the calculation and may well be that there has to be something go wrong you put four thousand people on attracting it's gotta be somebody gets sick\nThere has to be some fights break out somewhere somebody on this gang of people got to have a gun all it's going to take is one little incidental violence\nMaybe an allegation of sexual abuse and maybe start in by Trump law enforcement personnel\nI wouldn't put it past them if that's the that's the game plan but I'm struggling to see other than just\nThe general chaos it's creating and maybe the Democrats thinks that people want to stop this chaos and that this chaos is only because of the Trump Trump weren't there none of this will be happening and so let's get rid of the Republicans Republicans are the reason we have to put up with chaos every day\n\nIf that's the calculation they are going to blow this\nWhy they haven't blown much else in politics that's not at all what the conclusion average Americans are going to have if this caravan getting closer and closer to the border\nUp Lennie head back to the phones
