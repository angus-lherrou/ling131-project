at the event last night\nIt's going to be a red wave Russia and listen to you every day and I'm telling you it's going to be a red white but I said I Hope you're right but let me\nLet me tell you what we're up against forty\nFive Republicans have announced their resignations forty five I mean that is a huge number many of them are\nCommittee chairmen not all but many of them are committee chairmen and they are resigning are retiring because they don't want to go back to being jumps you know just regular house members it's a it's a big come down so we want to try to parlay their years in the house\nInto private sector success I spent forty five seats incumbency has has incredible power\nReelection power certainly old back me up on those these are students the incumbent in house races windows Ninety eight percent of the time what we've got forty five Republicans who are not incumbents we've got forty five Republicans who've never run before\nNobody knows I mean there are districts they're known but they're not as known as incumbents are no not as well known so that that makes some of this somewhat iffy\nI and and then there is the traditional statistical aspect which says that the party that\nHolds the White House in the first mint terms after a presidential election all ways ... seats so forty five seats they caved in\nTough to defend\nAs opposed to if those forty five had not resigned and we're still in the house you can count a lot of those is reelect that you can't count now is reelect and this is what the left and the drive by as are counting on\nIs that many of those forty five will slip\nAnd then you've got a contest of all races are in other parts Senate of course now they're saying now I mentioned this to all of these people they didn't care and they said they're aware of this they knew about the resign\nResigning all members of Congress retiring they ... they didn't know the number of them did\nBut their attitude was and it doesn't matter it doesn't matter uh the American people are fed up and they are sophisticated\nAnd the people who are elected Trump know exactly what's at stake they're not going to sit home they're not gonna twiddling their thumbs they're not confident they're not sitting there thinking that job was done when they went and voted in two thousand sixty and it was kind of pleasant to um\nTo what the here although there was a lot of emotion and I'm like I Can't deny that night interestingly I ran across a piece today have a website called America dot com and it's by Dr Gerard Francisco slum arrow expert on forecast models [noise]\nUm I'm not familiar with his work by his headline is ran wave coming in the house and the Senate\n\nMy forecast for the twenty eighth congressional elections he says there will be a conservative red wave in the house with two hundred and twenty five a two hundred and twenty eight Republicans elected to office\nAnd in the Senate with fifty eight to sixty Republicans elected to office let's look at some of the reasons that went into my forecast Dr Lynn Merrill rights\nAs you remember from my book great news for [laughter]\nWhen my mother my great book grading the presidential election of two thousand sixteen was both an historic and critical election that ushered in a new American constitutional era\nThat I called the conservative era long range trans as well as short range trends came together to cause a fundamental shift in uh in each of our two major political parties in addition the other major changes took places well those were predicted unexplained\nUh in addition to lower Democrat voter intensity\nAmong democratic voters Democrats have another major problem there are movements of democratic voters that are abandoning their party and voting for conservatives\n\nAnd it's all being ignored he says by the drive by immediate these free movements of democratic voters abandoning their party are the walk away movement the reading pill movements\nAnd the great awakening movement\nAnd he goes on to describe what these what these are I've I'm no I'm unfamiliar with the red\nPill a movement but\nHe says he's got eight productions here that will happen in the near future and they appear to be happening as we approach the mid term elections\nWe've witnessed a series of fall surprises including the capital hearings October surprises caravan of crisis mail bombs to some Democrats synagogue mass shooting we've seen outstanding economy tempered by considerable volatility a Wall Street we have seen extreme by it but that's another thing you know what the consumer confidence numbers are over the top\n\nConference board consumer confidence numbers over the top these numbers are not the kind of numbers you see in the ... electorate thats unhappy and angry and looking for radical change\nAt least that has been the case or in\nIn the past question comes down to just how important a factor is\n\nThe economy in elections of um [noise] candidates in this in this climate\nOr the drive buys would like you to believe the economy doesn't matter hill of beans but they always say that when the economy is going great with Republican\nAdministrations ah\nThe effort to give credit to Obama the attempt by Obama to take credit for the economy however would argue that Democrats in the media think it\nIs a problem\nThere's talk all over Twitter that Hollywood leftist are promising blood in the streets if Democrats do not win the house\n\nAnyway back to our production here from this doctor Dr Gerard Francisco alum arrow what has been the impact of these false surprises and the other events this is his personal thinking and again these these events these false\nSurprises he calls them we call them October surprises that Kavanaugh hearings that was that we know what that was the I mean that was totally trumped up\nMade up charges to derail Trump's Supreme Court nominee along the way it toward the railing Trump or we have the October surprises the usual the caravan of crisis mail bombs or some Democrats synagogue mass shooting what's what's been the impact of\nThese false surprises and other events while intended to hurt President Trump and keep Republicans I'm holding the house all of the above surprises in advance have worked to enhance the conservative\nRed wave according to this guy instead of creating a building and blue wave with a red wave continues Republican voter intensity exceeds the much heralded\nBlue wave by the way this is your what a blue wave would be what we need to properly defined a blue wave would mean the Democrats win everything they take back the Senate they'd take back the house by a large number if the Democrats win the house by two or three seats for and it's not that's not a blue wave\nA blue wave means a massive massive realignment and it doesn't look possible they're gonna they're gonna win the Senate they don't win the Senate there isn't any blue wave I'm Talking about unreality not in terms of media lingo they'll call it whatever they want\nIf they emerge victorious\nBut all of these events\nWere designed to cause this blue wave weren't designed to create this massive voter intensity and the turnout\nBy Democrats and even now in the early voting Republican turnout is much larger than Democrats turnout unheralded that's unprecedented Republicans seldom show up this while in early voting\nIt's hard to explain it away\nWell my\nBox News I'm Chris foster the funerals are today for for the eleven people killed in Saturday's shooting at a synagogue and Pittsburgh Jerry Rubin of its Daniel Stein and two brothers the sewing David Rosenthal President Trump's traveling to Pittsburgh this afternoon vice president Pence says this was

I I have at times I marveled that this country is held together the way it has for many years as if has\nGiven the only thing that really holds us all together as a piece of paper or a series of pieces of paper the U.S constitution the honor system and the reverence the respect for that document is what's held us together\nIn all of our years we have never elected a desperate or a tyrant who want to literally rip it up throw it away and establishes on tyrannical dictatorship it's amazing\nBut we're getting dangerously close to the same thing happening when one of our political parties refuses to accept\nElection results for whatever reason it make it up well it was stolen Russia's this or that if it doesn't matter when they refused to accept\nIt means that there really isn't any unity around the premise of our country and we may not unify issue to issue to issue\nBut we always have been unified about the premise of America as founded that's what's under assault today and that is what is in my mind\nThere is and we are raising him have been since the seventies generation after generation of students who have been taught things that have nothing\nIn common with the founding of the country we have not taught children we've ... we've ... you go back to the days when we learned that are in junior high intramural football and soccer ball that nobody won\nThat there were no outs in baseball you know no kid ever struck out the kidney hit until they hit the ball put it in play there were no losers there were no winners\nOutcome based education two plus two was five if you thought it was by we weren't going to humiliate people were wrong the people who are really smart and scoring a slow them down we're not going to service their superior ability to learn or going to slow them down so it was not to offend anybody else\nAnd we have now gotten to this point where kids have been raised cobbled\nThey had been taught phony notions of self esteem self esteem today does not derive from achievement an accomplishment it derives from I have a right to help self esteem parents have been\nTeaching little kids your perfect little Johnny you're perfect little Suzie I'm In it and not prepared for adversity and so when nobody has been raised to deal with adversity which in this case is losing an election we have temper tantrums and we have a child light snowflake behavior on college campuses\nAnd we have a political party that's behind all of this\n\nRight now it's rooted in the failure to accept the results of an election that is on going\nAnd now on Twitter as I said you can find posts Hollywood people promising that there will be blood if the Democrats do not when\nThe house back there will be blood so people are being threatened\nIf not directly but in a generic sense all of it is designed to limit turn out I think it's having the exact opposite impact on people I think the left and the drive by media continue to understand misunderstand\nWho Democrats are Trump voters are why they are Trump voters and why they aren't going anywhere [noise] uh let's see if we were also here being being told that we need a new kinds of civility that the Trump\nPresidency and all of his supporters are promoting all this in ... and the violence and so forth\nWhen it could be said that it's the exact opposite I ... I I think\nReasonable am harping on the fact people refused to accept election results it's profoundly indicative of who they are\nAnd it's\nA large explanation of why they're behaving as they as they do and it's ... refusal to accept is not just because Trump one it's not just because they hate Trump it's more than that it's because they lost they were fully expecting to win and they didn't and so they simply refuse it because\nIt's not a matter of thinking as a matter of feeling they don't feel happy don't feel good when they feel bad and something's not right and that's also been part of the education system\n[noise]\nSo we'll get some headlines Tom ...

phones week oh this is Dan in Manchester, Connecticut welcome sir great to have you here\nThat could rush I wanted to thank you for telling people about the truth intent of sexual on an amendment for team because I've been trying to do the same thing for years and people are running the miss impression that it simply means if a child born to illegal aliens in this country automatically becomes an American citizen\nYou can't blame 'em it's been the case since the sixties and it's it's it's um\nYeah it it it's your we're we're dealing with mass ill education that's taken place on a lot of things in this country that's why it's so important that we've got a president willing to push back on it yet because what's causing this is causing any discussion of it this is how it happens\nI've told everybody that this is what pushing back is going to look like so\nWhat you were talking about Dred Scott as a reason why the fourteenth amendment was ratified which was actually on July night Eighteen sixty eight but\nAnother reason why it was ratified is because it goes back to the thirteenth unlimited abolish slavery well the southern states weren't going to accept that so they passed laws are codes that were so restrictive the plaques that it's actually made them slaves once again and they were called the black codes so then Congress said okay you want to play that game\nThen we're going to formally recognized former slaves of citizens which will make them subject to all the privileges or immunities to the citizens in several strays per article for section two claws one\nSo after that they do sweat coach were abolished and that's why we have a ... you know the fourteenth amendment\nAnd matter of fact you know the one of the ... the the guy is considered the founding father to the Fourth Amendment was represented by the name of John ... from Ohio\nAnd he made some remarks about the fourteenth amendment if you're a few years later and you can find that in a house report number twenty two dated Eighteen Seventy one January thirtieth\nSo it all explains how this joint committee passed the fourteenth amendment so President Trump with all due respect to him he wouldn't be not be ending birthright citizenship because it never happened he would be appalled in the U.S constitution\nWell that's the point that is exactly the point that I made is why you shouldn't do this\nAnd that's his point people have looked into this may have found different rationale than you did but the point is if you look at the original intent of people who are involved in writing the fourteenth amendment all Trump is doing is enforcing the constitution and taking it back to its original intent\nThe fourteenth amendment was never intended to confer citizenship on people here illegally or the sons and daughters of ambassadors are foreign\nIt was expressly\nWritten chicken first citizenship on slaves and now it has been expanded and again that you can trace it back to the Nineteen sixties\nWhen this began which coincides with the Democratic party wanting to re open immigration you know I still run into people who do not believe me when I tell them that as a nation we suspended for the most part I mean ... there's always been\nA people being granted citizenship but we suspended mass immigration from the mid Nineteen twenties to the mid sixties\nPretty express reason of allowing all of those who would emigrated starting in the late Eighteen hundreds all the way through the Nineteen twenties to assimilate\nThat's what immigration was people were coming here\nAmericans and they wanted to be Americans\nThey didn't have to give up their birthright they didn't happen and they they settled in ah in in neighborhoods\nAre Irish had their neighborhoods in New York and Philadelphia the Italians ... ditto but they wanted to become Americans they learned English uh and they became part of American culture of which there is a distinct in unique American culture which is rooted in western civilization\nThat's what's different now there is no interest in that we don't even make a serious effort have assimilated we're Balkan icing\nIf they use this term tribal but we're Balkan icing our population because modern arrivals don't all seek to become Americans people trying to get them on the on the legal immigration side of course are\nBut this this mass illegal immigration has an entirely different purpose behind it and political support is entirely different for it then for standard or immigration so what Trump is doing is simply with his executive order if he does this\nWill be reestablishing the constitution and re asserting it so yeah no you're exactly right about that so two calls to great points but the guy who from Pittsburgh who asked a question he lives there and he watches the news and he's been blamed\nFor the Senate God surely [noise]\nWe've got to tone it down and we got to come together we got to do this we've got to do that\nAnd if it's being set up that's being said in the media you know it's all aimed at Trump and his supporters appreciate the call again Southampton in New York build your next great to have you with us or Hi\nThank you Russian thanks for all that you do for us yes you appreciate it with the ... um with regard to the fourteenth amendment why not take it to the Supreme Court or is that where this is going to end up actually show that they can decide oh it'll be their language says it'll get there and I'll get there okay yeah\nIt'll it'll have to get there that no Senator Graham is going to offer legislation that is in the Senate ah look we're way way far away from this\nWe're just getting the conversation started here which has to happen there there there needs to be a pretty big re education of the American population in general on the whole subject of immigration and so Trump and his\nI don't make the solution to this is enterprise zones in El Salvador or Guatemala\nUh maybe long term a economic relief for any nation having problem is a greater dose of capitalism but\nThere isn't the political climate for ... and many of these countries there their dictatorships of one degree or another and\nThis is an immediate problem that's going to have to be dealt because if it's not they're just going to keep coming and it's and there's and\nWe're not going to stop these caravans if we start implementing a tax free enterprise zones nominees nations where American companies can relocate and hire them there instead of hiring them here 'cause that's these people aren't capable\nBeing hired anywhere yet but\nI understand it if you want to talk political theory and economic theory it makes no sense in the world and otherwise\nYou know quote unquote normal circumstances but this is a short term political movement here this caravan [noise] I\nKnow a wise or George Soros I think George Soros his name has become a like a bogeyman for everything people mean far left wing radicals when they mentioned George Soros I don't know who's behind somebody is and their\nPurpose is to destabilize the United states the purpose is not to improve life from these people\nThis caravan whoever's behind this is not really trying to do something for these people to make their lives better isn't being done to it to invoke damage on the United states protect generally Trump into advanced the political advantages and notions of a particular political party\nWhich wants to welcome these people in as dependent voters a jam in Madison, Virginia great to have you with us You're next on the E R B network Hi\n[laughter] Hi yes fresh uh ten years I got my husband and I adopted for an extra ...\nWho were in foster care and we had him for a couple of years and then they cannot fact option their parents go by the healing Gulf of Mexico they have slipped over the border at least four times illegal a one on each time they had children here too and then they come back to my left on my grandparents came back\nI had two more went back and got him\nA long story short is that even today I had you know they were came to as thanking Trump was horrible and that he would send them all back home and and you know now they love Trump and they think this is kind of stop and have an escape because I saw this entrenched I'm twenty eight year\nOld mother fled to Mexico not of course that's\nA nice thing about this kind of ... awful crimes against their own children\nAnd you know I just think everything Trump can do to stop that he's got to stop it because they they come up and they have these babies\nAnd I have another situation I can tell you that way I Know our country has caught where they had a Fifteen year old girl at the border seven months pregnant and teen they let her across they sent the other six Jean King with our back on my stomach\nSo I Can't say we don't have hot they do see a situation they now need help\nBut you know even Hispanic girls that Trump was horrible that he has to send all these people that they realize now that he is doing what the country\nWell we'll take them you know whenever I realize this is a is is is fine with me of course it's it's\nA\nOnce you understand what's going on it's impossible to support\nIt's it's just\nIt's impossible support on a little less you have particular political notions of

Nineteen Ninety five when Bill Clinton blamed Rush Limbaugh and talk radio or for the Oklahoma City bombing you have to be very careful that you don't start to tell people that their political speech isn't allowed any more because there was a direct connection between political speech and violent that's a very serious thing to do that\nJihad as terrorists lone wolf carries out an attack we always ask what radicalized and what inspired him to go to violence we have to ask the same thing about right wing terrorists of whom there are a lot more in this country right now than there are as long as terrorists\nAnd you could not divorced the actions of the second to the ... from the sick rhetoric that you're hearing\nThat's max boats Max Boot used to be as conservative as anybody you know uh in the Washington establishment something you may think that's a very conservative but he's certainly wasn't this\nWe have to answer the same thing\nAbout these right wing terrorists and boom there are a lot more in this country right now than there are ... llamas\nTerrorists you can't divorce the actions of the sick people from the sick rhetoric that you're hearing\nSo what he's talking about is you have in a jihadi who walked into a mosque one day was a perfectly innocent young guy had no ill intent toward any buddy walks into a mosque starts listening to your mom preaching and comes out of their Osama bin Laden junior\n\nAnd he's saying that's exactly what's happening in the ... so somebody Donald Trump is is radicalizing people Donald Trump is encouraging this\nThe moms are telling people what to do and how to do it they're being taught how to make bombs how to explode themselves with bombs that are being nobody on our side doing this as we get Keolis\n\nIs the comparison alone and it comes from never Trump ers who are frustrated that they have been able\nTo diffuse Trump they've been unable to dispatch Trump and it's always\nA one way street we never heard about Bernie Sanders radicalizing the guy that shot up the Republican baseball practice we never hear about the whoever it was radicalized\n\nAny of these leftist so Hillary Clinton right it's always this one way street there's always you know what it's rooted in folks it's rooted in the belief that not a single conservative can make up his or her mind but what about anything one of the first criticisms of this program\nDating back to Nineteen eighty eight was that you are a bunch of mind numbed robots\nAnd I am yours has been golly and I\nAm telling you what to think every day because you're too stupid to make up your mind on your own I'm telling you what to think I'm telling you what to do I'm telling you how to vote I'm telling you why to go that has been the criticism and what does that rooted is rooted in\nThe presumption of superior intellect to people on the left and the belief that you are literal idiots\nWho cannot make up your mind on anything what they never understood and they made no effort to understand that and the fact that they make no effort to understand it or understand Trump and his voters is what's largely doing them in\nThey never understood that you already believe what you believed you already thought what you thought when I came along\nAll I did was repeat\nWhat all of us had been saying to each other but you ... you were not hearing it anywhere in national media what you believed was always laugh dad or criticize made fun of mocked but you were never\nGiven any respect whatsoever than this program came along and it reflected what you think and what you say well you were talking about with your friends and that's why you're glom onto it\nNot because you were sitting out there in your relative ignorance day in and out all of a sudden started learning things so the presumption is that you're so stupid and you're so mindless\nThat's been golly you can tell you how to think or tell you when did it go start blowing things up or window started shooting

Trump tears Boston [noise]\n\n\nLet me explain what I meant I'm suffering here I'm In the last two callers have been speaking a mile a minute and I've been unable to hear enough of what they were saying [noise] to comprehend so I had to put it together after they hung up the most\nRecent caller I lost her when she just how families will gas light a the weakest number of the family I I've never seen that so I'm rolling it back and forth on my head but then I finally heard when she was talking about her definition gas light\nA I got ...\nHer point was that the Democrats the media and get to define everything they get to define that get to decide everything and what they say is is what is in anybody isn't that then of course as abnormal or what have you and that that\nThat has been my point it's just a different way of saying that\nIt irritates the hell out of me too I watch the media that my my favorite example of it and I'm Sorry for being redundant here Indiana and there are countless examples here Indiana passed a religious freedom Restoration Act\nThe media hated it was\nIn response to people not being allowed to tell gay couples no I'm not going to bake a cake for your reception I my religion doesn't allow me to do that so these gay couples but then they would target these places hoping for that reaction and file lawsuits trying to put these bakeries and photo shop businesses out of business\nAnd the media would come right along and act like that was entirely justified\nThat these bigots what repeal is to bake a cake or take photos at a gay wedding reception or what have you uh so when ... when when Indiana passes along pension is the governor the media was outraged and they began\nTo report on this as though the whole country was outraged that Indiana was somehow a loan out post of racism and bigotry and homophobia\nAnd it's this this this attitude\nAnd all things that they do wear what they report in the way they report it what they say is what is normal and they get to decide who the big it's are and who the uh the racist are and once that happens your tag you're it and then they ran around and they started knocking on doors\nAsking businesses\nWould you bake a pizza when you when you make a pizza for a wedding and they found a little girl Twenty one year old woman a running a pizza shop for her family you know we wouldn't it would be against the salt they zeroed in on this Twenty one year old woman and they wanted to make her out\nTo be the typical Indiana ...\nAnd she was just answering their questions naively and in his leash she was just trying to be honest with them she bought that they were really interested in what\nWere asking about they were looking for a victim they were looking for a target and she fit the bill and so for however long the reporting that went on Indiana was odd the people in it are odd weird racist beget sexist ... I Know exactly what the caller Mitt Democrats get to decide well let me\nTell you something folks\nNot true anymore that may be the way they report it and they met that may be what they try to create but people rebelled against they've called Donald Trump people rebelled against that the Democrats since Obama had been losing elections don't lose sight of this\nStarting in two thousand ten the Democrats have lost over a thousand maybe it's closer to twelve hundred electoral seats at federal state local level\nAnd there's a reason for this they are being rejected and the media is being rejected as as well\nAnd sell gas if if if what the media dead due to the state of Indiana is gas lighting is if that's what the definition is now heartily endorse\nIt and er and accepted and it's this arrogance and just the primacy of superiority that goes along with that kind of coverage and it's it's everywhere it's\nYou have a the synagogue shooting wildly the obvious the obvious explanation is that Donald Trump and his conservative media posse are radicalizing and this becomes the narrative this becomes just the way it is and everybody thinks this\nIs crucial for the maybe the weather report these things to make it look like they are the majority and they are what's normal went increasingly they aren't and what really is happening here is that people who know they're not by definition\nSplit numbers normal are trying to turn everything upside down so that what they are is normal and what everybody else is is the one that's odd ball abnormal the media's right in their facilitating this I'm telling you\nIs isn't it used to work like a charm\nAnd on many people still does we still have a lot of people in our side still want a cow town of the media still wanted to find whether or not conservatives or Republicans are succeeding\nBy virtue of one of the media as being nice to them or not it's frustrating to know when when I run into people like that and they're out there but the\nElectoral results just in the past two years ah indicate that people are more and more aware of this and pushing back\nAgainst that\nUh just to see what's [laughter]\nI didn't see this I didn't watch Fox News Sunday on Sunday but apparently Chris ...
