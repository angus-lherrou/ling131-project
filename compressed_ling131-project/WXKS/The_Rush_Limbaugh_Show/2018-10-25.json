instead of blaming the president take a cue from the president\nDidn't leadership yesterday called for the country and come together instead of attacking one another with partisan politics time stand behind the president shameful I Will add that the New York times today tell us to publish an article tend to pick the fascination and the president of the United states we're twenty four hours from the thigh convened delivered and how painful and the New York times\nI now I mentioned that through your toward the tail end of the hour they actually did they published a fiction piece by a writer fantasizing over a secret service agent\nTending a Russian agent his gun to assassinate Donald Trump not the president not just the president none of no names that are Donald Trump you've got a Russian agent trying to assassinate his gun does that go off\nAnd so a nearby Secret Service agent hands but Russian assassin his gun sincere use mine the times runs this story and they excuses by saying well\nWe must published stories that really three I don't live with the Mueller investigation of Trump and put what does that got to do with Trump being assassinated anyway even if there was something to it which there's not\nAnd and then they're preaching to us why publishing that story they're preaching to everybody about civility and why you need to dial back what Donald Trump is saying under Donald Trump needs to dial it back in Donald Trump needs the training to Donald Trump\nDidn't meanwhile they can call him and not suiting call him Hitler they can lie about the things he says and does all day long with no recourse that's what Mac and then he's talking about here now is Natasha on a top response\nI think that the president controls ten thousandth ethic I laugh at it has rally that he was poking fun at the whole idea of oh I'm not going to talk about the things I'm going to be a presidential which is essentially saying to the audience you know what I'm thinking and and this morning so Twain and that it was CNN fault\nWhich basically is they can tell if a woman gets actually thought that was her fault for wearing a short time has been completely\nIn a

blaming her for the assault\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nI mean that's that's that's the logic that's the analogy she used okay so so um the conversation continues here now you'll hear the senior writer

you to hear this we have to buy your number one\nWe have a caravan coming north we don't want all those people coming across our border\nAnd there are ways to deal with it I Believe that if we would check those who are legitimately in need of asylum could be vetted before they even get to the border but you know what we're born in America you know how lucky we are to be born in America and not be born in Guatemala where they would say to your daughter\nYou know if you don't do what we want we will rape your daughter or we will kill your son if he's not a drug meal\nNow they're marching north

dirt\nAh and condemn that and do our best to spread our way of life around under the belief that it's good and decent but they're way too many people don't they were the good guys and they think that the American way of life is an imposition\nTo others we don't have the right to impose our views on people but somehow we ought to stay on the side and let everybody who wants him in\nBecause of our guilt and he\nSays I'm you know ... they're marching north it could easily have been all of us that we're in the caravan that we're marching north trying to save our families and save our children\nOr
