that these kinds of things no longer\n[noise] bother me other than the I I I Do get concerned that there's so much genuine ignorance existing now in positions that influence the thinking of other people I mean feminist studies\nAt universities I firmly believe has destroyed the futures of way too many women\nIt has just distorted the life it's distorted gender differences in has distorted the concept of happiness victim ... it has just started the whole concept of America the greatest place to live and grow up and seek opportunity in the world\nAnd it's to and feminism is just one of many elements of liberalism that is doing the same thing too it's other constituency groups for example\nLet me ask a generic question we had Eric Holder out there\nWho is campaigning for somebody to be governor of Georgia holders supposedly going to run for president himself in twenty funny or Eric Holder the attorney general for Rocco same\nAll involved in many scandals himself and I'm\nSeeing a lot of people on our side ... so called conservative intelligentsia shocked that Eric Holder would say what he said you know Michelle my bell Obama's out there saying no no my motto is when they go low we go high and holder said screw that when they go low meeting Republicans when they go low we get them\n\nSo people's mind God these out their inciting violence and he said no no no no I didn't mean it literally I was saying\nThat we can't take it anymore we after Scott being a nice guys and stopped taking it and he didn't mean it\nObama met him when he said they bring a knife we bring a gun Obama met at sodas Maxine Waters when they're both encouraging people would get in our faces they mean it\nThey are already inciting violence they inciting violence inside Capitol Hill buildings and elevators\nThey're engaging in bullying tactics my question is why why are the Democrats doing all this why are they inciting violence let's look at the things\nThat they think\nAre supposedly on their side things that are helpful to them we start with the fact that they are convinced that they're going to win control of the house\nIt's already done the blue wave it's just a matter of the day is on the calendar passing by until we get to a ... day where we can confirm that the Democrats already won that remember we had a poll from CNN a sound bite John King couple of weeks ago\nHe responded to poll indicated the house races or over their poll said the Democrats are likely winners of the house of representatives over in their minds they won the house in their minds they all most won the Senate they have the Mueller report\nAnd the mullah report is going to link Trump to Russia right\nThey know that Mueller's got the goods all they can taste it fall fall\nBecause they can scratch their bags with it they just can't aid and all that Mueller has secretly collected the goods they know that Mueller is going to issue a report and it's kind of tight Trump and Russia and it's going to prove the trumps stolen the election from Hillary Hillary shouldn't be president that should make them happy right\n\nWhy all the desperation CNN engaging in full fledged one thousand percent racism directed at Kanye West\nYeah Kanye West is what happens to one negro when he stops breathing\nThat's what they said on CNN with Don Lemon laughing in New York and get all up wasn't that long ago the cover of time magazine\nWhen was this a\nTwo thousand five the drive by media proclaimed Kanye West the smartest man in pop music\nHip hop's class act the\nFiring the rules of rap Kanye West\nGoes his own way so what would I be Thirteen Years ago Kanye West was the future Kanye West was the hero but now Kanye West is having lunch at the White House today with Trump as his Jim Brown\nBy the white Trump is funny that Trump Trump photos and why did you do that rally why did you do that rally with a hurricane coming and climate change destroying and why do you can Trump said you know what\nYou have a point but there were people that have been a lined up for a day and a half to get into this either I couldn't disappoint them I had to go and it was a great time Trump to slam dumped him on a number of things in the short little press availability at the White House so now\nA CNN handle calls Kanye West a token negro\n\nListened black folks are about to trade Kanye West and the ratio draft don't ...\nSaid all of a sudden cognac because he's put on a ... hat and he is\nHe's an attention horror like the president he's all of a sudden now the model spokesperson he's a token negro the Trump Administration is a ridiculous\nSays the CNN paddle fighters so mad folks\nWhy all the desperation they're going to win the house are going to win the Senate Muller is going to prove that Trump colluded with Russia\n\nBetween inciting violence is launching a racist attacks we're witnessing an attempt to bully the American population of surrender that is what's happening\nHere they're soft coup failed\nNow it's time for the second phase the soft coup that swear Rosen staying in the rest of the guys are going to wiretapped Trump and going to wire Trump wear a wire and get Trump indicting himself a certain things he was saying they're going to get rid of Trump the FBI the deal Jay the Clinton Administration the soft coup it didn't work\n\nRemaining silent

almost killed ... and the Democrats didn't say anything about it\nIn the media didn't condemn it there wasn't any condemnation there was there was an overwhelming silence that shouldn't have been and it was to me a clue\n\nTo the Democratic depravity American countries and now we've got Hillary now we've got Maxine Waters Eric Holder is what is the lead directing Democrats\nTo physically attacked Republicans\nWith CNN going full racist on a prominent black Trump supporter by the way they can see the polls Trump approval\nCafe acts for instance has a robotic coffee bar and they have three

that the president of the United states involved in this now Trump is being open we asked about it\nAnd it has to do in many ways with with our new found relationship with Saudi Arabia based on the fact we no longer depend on them for oil\nNow ... is Saudi I don't know if he is related to add ... not common ... is is a as a Saudi or Arab name and then your show he was a famous arms runner made famous as a celebrity by a\nA lifestyles are the rich and famous but the guy was an arms merchant he was an arms dealer and that the source of his wealth it would just made it look like a jet setting

the crown\nPrince in Saudi Arabia his father is the king king sol ... he is the brother of the late deceased king king of double their father grandfather uh start at the house of Saud they are the royal family\nThe crown prince the each of these guys have many sons there are constant battle for power with in the royal family the crown prince is the chosen son he is the air\nNow Mohammed bin Salman is not the oldest son of king Solomon but he hasn't been designated the crown prince meaning he will be the next ...\nAs such Mohammed bin ... mom has been trying theoretically to reform the soul of the the Saudi economy and to take it away from being strictly petrol and oil focused\nBecause the world is expanding in ways that the Saudis are not involved in one of the things that Mohammed bin Salman has been doing has been traveling the world and making friends\nIn the United states you spend a lot of time in Silicon Valley he's gotten to know he's winding dying the Google guy he's winding dined Facebook guys but a lot of time an apple he wants to build a brand new city\nOut of nothing in Saudi Arabia and make it a tech center he's thirty two if\nTakes off the Arab garb he looks just like your average run to the middle guy\nA very attractive short little stocky but he represents\nIf he is being truthful major reforms he is the guy who has opened up driving to Saudi women\nHe is the guy who wants to relax\nAll kinds of cultural rules on on Saudi women and open up speech to them all but not being able to drive a go places on their own without male a company but\nThis made him quite controversial he\nAlso last summer not this past them last night and it was this past summer\nHe arrested the elite of the elite\nOf Saudi well some of them even among the royal family and took over\nThe Ritz Carlton hotel in Riyadh and that became a giant jail and he put all these guys in jail demanding a certain percentage of their wealth on the basis they had stolen it\nDo the corruption and connections in someone's he made a lot of enemies well Jamal ... has as a journalist doesn't buy any of this and has been running around openly criticizing Mohammed bin so I'm On\nEven running stories suggesting that Mohammed bin ... father ... king has grown so upset with his son the crown prince that he's taking toys and power away from it this reportedly has not set well with the crown prince Mohammed bin selmont\nDespite the reforms in Saudi Arabia you still don't get to run around and criticize the government and keep your head\nYou don't get to run around and criticize the government and keep your knees for example\nJamal ... wanted to get married he had to get a wedding like a marriage license he was in Turkey in order to do that by the end it before the hearing supposedly had been targeted by the crown prince and and others in the Saudi royal family\nBecause of his open criticism of these reforms that other things so he goes into the Saudi consulate or

voter\nWell I'll tell you how the Democrats have so poison their voters\nDemocratic voters want revenge not a job not raise not a bonus they want rooms range in age eight Trump\nAnd so anything that Democrats can do to harm Trump why the Democrats will vote for who ever will promised to make Trump suffer you think that's a majority of people you think that's the kind of stuff that creates a blue wave I don't [noise]\nI don't believe that the country is that it ranged but the Democrats are counting on the fact they think it is okay to the phones ban in Fresno Europe first today great to have you with us or hide\nThey rash thanks for having me on Yes sir I\nSo I was there I was in the for the three days of the nonsense last week I saw the the them screaming and yelling and attacking us and and the folks and and so what I Know was\nThis is all they have the reason that they continue the reason that John Lennon saying the nonsense she said on CNN the reason that they just continue with this game plan if it's the only game plan they have\nAnd they're hoping that the American people are dumb enough to still buy it but I Believe that the American people even in California where I'm at the American people are seeing this crap and they're like this is an old game we don't find any more\nAnd and and they have nothing else to play there's nothing else for them to but they just keep doing the same market and the book in our eyes it was like they know they're losing they know that we're not buying it anymore but they've got nothing else to say\nNow that hold on here that's an interesting point because if they do have the maturity of the presence of mind they do have to realize they're losing Trump one Trump is getting elements of agenda his agenda a pastor implemented\nKavanaugh was confirmed everything they've done to stop Trump\nEverything from the judges to the court's travel but not much has worked and so I think you're right they do realize they're losing\nAnd you think they're in a fit of desperation that they've got nothing else to do that's why they're not proposing any ideas to counter Trump's that's why they are not proposing in a new policies to counter Trump's 'cause they don't have any\nAbsolutely they let loose when they're both the right lose it when we're silent and they they for so long they've expected us to just shut up and go away it\nWell that's true too I I think they have become accustomed to Republicans caving and Republican voters will certainly conservative media uh well so conservative caving as well I think they've they've gotten accustomed to bullying working the rats lying\nYup threats flying all of that and and and they're hoping that it's going to work together and the only way it works\nIs if we don't go up that's why that's why you see the polling data still showing them winning that's why it showed Hillary was going to win in a landslide because they know that if they can to sway does that they can discourage jumping up enough to make us not show up that's the only way they win but if Republicans conservative stand up\nWhen every single time we just have\nTo show up we have to convince

you know that they just settled the IRS just settle that case a holder is they've got some problems\nNot used to be intelligent like this in the old days Eric Holder can say whatever you send them to Republicans in Wimbledon away or not even acknowledge or are they would say\nWe strongest term ... we'd denounce\nRhetoric go out and buy a attorney general holder or it was about ... but much although totally totally uncalled for and we we routinely unilaterally condemning\n[laughter] Trump says [laughter]\nYou better be careful [laughter] he's wishing for [laughter] [noise] that I can tell you that I can you better be careful\nWhat he's wishing now the stock market's been kind of the song has been a roller coaster ring\nAnd Trump is suspicious as he can be up and let me just tell you something folks there are a number of wealthy Democrat Wall Street types investors people that run hedge funds who I Am convinced\nWould willingly take a bit of a financial hit to their wealth and businesses primarily their businesses not their wealth but they would they would David in person pain if it meant\nLowering economic activity on enough to hurt Trump I have no doubt that there aren't enough looney tunes on the left who willingly do this I think they're that desperate as a previous caller said\nAnd of course it it flies in the\nFace of the Democrats in the media tried to say when it was a new age ah yeah the economy's doing well but the president's not going to get any credit for that people don't even leave it there believe it looking our polling\nData people obviously that's not true I think they're terribly worried that this great economy is going to be greatly beneficial not just to ... but the Republicans\nIn the midterms and so there's some monkey and going on with the interest rates is the point it's calling causing the stock market the roller coaster and here is Trump was pointed out to him yesterday was not a good day for investors\nThe Federal Reserve is getting a little bit too cute that so when I took over this economy this economy was ready to crash\nWe were at one percent GDP now or a four point two percent it was ready to crash it was the worst if you look from the great depression that was the worst recovery and the history of our country and Obama tremendous money at it [laughter] don't\nForget Obama was playing with zero money so he was playing with funny money he was it was very easy [laughter] I'm paying interest at a high rate because of our fed and I'd like are fed not to be so aggressive because I think that making a big mistake\nTranslation he is worried maybe accusing the federal\nReserve of raising interest rates because the economy's chugging along so well that traditional inside the beltway Washington gets very worried when the economy's going great\nMy whole life I've noticed this and my whole life I have been perplexed by this I've asked myself why\nAnd let's look at the fed here as the establishment in this story\nWhy\nIs a great performing and growing economies so frightening\nTo official Washington and it is because every time the economy starts talking what does the fed do they leak they leak that they are thinking of raising rates and what does that do that kills activity in equities markets\nIf these people think the fed is going to start raising rates people start selling rather than buying and investing what Trump is saying that he thinks this is being done purposefully to slow down the economy\nAt the time and totally unnecessary Ford right before an election and he's calling them out he's caught it's another thing previous Republican presidents would not do he's calling out the fed Mr Limbaugh doesn't Trump from the ... no you may appoint the Federal Reserve chairman but know day to day no way\n\nAnd the Federal Reserve German the odds are that the number of the board of governors are going to be you know a bunch of\nTommy leftists as they are as many financial institutions are not going to pretty strictly crazy about Trump despite how much wealth they are earning the\nCause of drunk so Trump calling them out on it he says there's no reason to start raising rates right now right before the election soybeans down so they react\nTo it and and this rollercoaster stock market day actually ended up being only a one day roller coaster I think there's positive action today I Will I Will check it's ah let's see one more thing here we have yeah a ... heart\nSo your wife recently had an interview she said there are people in the White House she doesn't trust people you don't trust that you have to watch your back is that true and if that is the case why are these people you don't trust still in the administration\nWe have great people right now are more kids\nAre there are some that I Am a not in love with us and we'll weed them out slowly but surely\nTurban and some other embarrassing leaks are you any closer to figuring out who these people are\nWell let me get my legs I think a lot of the lake so not only that made up by the newspapers the meat is very very dishonest beyond anything that anybody can understand now even the letter written to the times\nThat there is a chance there was a very good chance that that was written by the times I wouldn't be surprised because at times is totally corrupt and dishonest\nWhere did you first hear that right here\nWho was the first or maybe the only person to suggest that the times itself\nWrote that piece that memo that pose a memo written by an angry staffer\nIn the Trump Administration claiming their up close and personal lives of president doesn't know what he's doing but don't worry there are adults in the room and we're doing everything we can to stop this guy we're conservative they we love business\nAnd they started a massive manhunt to find out who did this\nAnd they couldn't find anybody and I think on the first day on the first day would ever go back

not gonna sit here and tell you right now but I Will accept the results of the election I'm not going to do that until the election columns we've counted the boats\nThey want it\nI think what was the objective was to be able to create a soundbite Trump acknowledges he thinks he will lose elections that's what they were hoping for\nThis or what have you with knowledge that you'll accept the results of the election oh of course I'm a great American yes that go sit at that time everybody thought that Hillary was gonna win in a landslide then they the soundbite would be on the head like we trumpet knowledge is likely defeat in upcoming election\nBut Trump cross them up they said no\nI don't know what kind of shenanigans if people are gonna play I'm not going to concede anything tonight Hillary

probation officer\nRight and and we all know the reason why she was a Democrat nominee their jobs and futures end the shenanigans they had pulled\nRequired her to win burn them to stay employed and
