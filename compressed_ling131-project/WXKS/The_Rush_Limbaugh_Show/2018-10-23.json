think for the remainder of the time\nFor these next two weeks and it is Trump's spreads lives and stalks fears head of election I thought when I got in here and saw that\nOne time I figured it was just you know a graphic car ride and graphic to represent what they were doing at that time but every time I looked up at the TV over the next three hours I saw that that that manner\nIt didn't matter what else was being discussed it didn't matter who the guests were then I saw the Washington Post thing and so I checked the New York times and there it is spreading fear\nTelling lies a hand of election\nThis caravan thing you know I\n[laughter] I continue to study this\nAnd try to pick it apart bill analyze it and and make sense of it from a political standpoint and I still can't find anywhere in the media any concern about it I Can't find anybody concerned are worrying or thinking that it's anything abnormal about it's\nFact what you find in the drive by media isn't tired total miss characterizations these are desperately\nPoor people wonderful people fleeing poverty in their homeland and that's not an oil what they are they are part of an organized mob\nThere is no question about this is an organized mob in like everything else the left is behind some point in the future we're going to learn exactly how this thing was pulled off we're going to learn who did it we're going to learn who paid for it we're going to learn who scripted it\nJust like we've learned how they did the cabin off thing with Dr balls the Ford how that was structured how that was planned how it was kept in reserve\nPart is that nothing that appears spontaneous or organic where it benefits the left is spontaneous or organic is all structured it's all planned it's all scripted it's all paid for its all focus grouped it's poll tested from their\nPerspective and the the obvious you know there there there's no ... you look at this you look at this caravan and it is\nIt ought to scare everybody is exactly the threat this country has faced for years we now have a focused concentrated microcosm of it with seven thousand\nPeople and maybe a thousand or ten thousand if they get here by election day there's still a thousand miles away yet vowing to get here by election day at the drive by his claim they're walking there not walking they can't they'll never cover a thousand miles into wakes up and walking it\nPhysically not possible so when the cameras aren't there some of these people have to be being driven but it is all\nOrchestrated none of this is organic none of it is real\nFrom the standpoint that individuals totaling eight thousand people decided on the same day or in the same week or even in the same month just start walking from Honduras\nTo the United states that just didn't happen and it doesn't happen somebody is making this happen somebody set this up\nIt obviously is a bunch of left is to set this up and when you look at that and examine it from that standpoint you've you've got to wonder what it is\nThat makes them think they are going to win the massive elections and it is clear to me\nNot only examining the caravan the mob see there I go I even got caught up calling it what it is it's not a caravan it's a mob it's bought and paid for and structured scripted mob\n\nThe Democrats clearly believe and they have believed since the two thousand sixteen election\nThat the way to win back their power is to stoke and create Trump hatred that they think organically naturally exists in either a majority of Americans or close to it and that's what they're trying to capitalize on his massive\nTrump hatred massive Trump resentment\nThey're not doing it by talking about issues you know an individual campaigns you'll hear Democrats promise to repeal the tax cuts and roll back things that have led to economic prosperity but in terms of the national message from the Democratic party you're not getting one you're getting\nTrump feared Trump hatred promoting the exacerbating it or what have you and it's\nIt's silly it's not the way you build a movement now\nLet me share with you a couple of uh stories today on the polling leading up to the mid terms because it is all over the place and it is contradictory as it can be five thirty eight this is the adored do and the\nIndispensable and the eagerly anticipated Nate Silver\nWho has now said the Democrats have an eighty five percent chance of winning control of the house of representatives the Republicans have only a fourteen and a half percent chance of keeping the house\nThis is almost identical\nTo five thirty it's forecasting two weeks before the presidential election in two thousand six Dan where Hillary Clinton had anywhere from an eighty eight percent Ninety two percent chance of winning the presidency and Trump had\nWhat twelve percent to ... percent chance of winning which was effectively zero and even on election day throughout the day and that is how five thirty eight and the New York times reported\nAnd we all know what happened Charlie Cook considered the dean of political analysts\nAnd this company analyzes races individual house races and Senate races and

election the non partisan election forecast and there is no such thing\nAnd Charlie Cook is not nonpartisan Charlie Cook cares about the outcome of this stuff Charlie Cook is not nonpartisan but that's how this stuff gets reported\nThe non partisan election forecaster Charlie Cook Political Report rejected Democrats will have an edge in key swing districts following the party's massive

disappointing people next month if it arrives at all [noise]\nNBC News has looked at early voting day and it provided by a company called target smart in eight states and found that GOP affiliated

doctor if you don't like your health plan you get to keep your health plan\nWith Obamacare your average annual premium will be reduced by twenty five hundred dollars those lives were told over and over and over again to do\nOn winning Americans into believing that Obamacare was going to\nA centrally be cost free that it wasn't going to cost them very much for anything at all and that if they want their doctor in plan that wasn't going to be any change and we later found out course we knew from the beginning he was lying about it tried to tell everybody was\nLike about a people didn't want to believe the first African American president would lie about such things so much hope was invested in Obama\nMisplaced as it turned out those why is again and they were just the tip of the iceberg those lives were meant to deceive people\nThose lives were meant to make fools out of people they get them to agree with Obama's Davis takeover of one sixth of the U.S economy\nFor the express purpose of being able to control people's lives if you control their health care if you control people's access to healthcare you control them\nYou can determine what there'll be allowed to eat or not you can even determine what political party gets preference if there is a line at the doctor and this is exactly what Obama and the Democrats were doing it didn't get a single Republican vote did the media

somebody nobody ever heard of cause the unrest that led to the riots in men gossipy knowing all along that it was a pre planned and executed terror attack that the Obama administration did nothing to defend\n\nThose are lives designed to mislead to deceive and to protest\nAnd Hillary Clinton and everybody else that was in on that damn full decision about the law is Obama told about drawing a red lines in Syria\nThe Obama administration was a series of lies upon lies and deception upon deception and the American people quickly saw through it and began defeating Democrats the polls in record numbers starting of the two thousand ten ...\nThere's an Obama is outlying today he went out and get his own little rally in Nevada and he tried to tell everybody\nWell where did you think about it ... you remember who started or remember\nWho was and he had his phased in his head up in the air looking up over everybody like God that like you got to look up seeing him but you're you're so far but neither me can't see you you just look it up like this over everybody\nKnew just remember you just do you remember where it has greater companies ... for rock Obama according\nTo create these economic circumstances have his wife depends on it because he doesn't know how and he doesn't know how because he doesn't believe that what has happened in the last two years was possible but beyond that he didn't want this kind of economic activity he didn't want this kind of robust economic growth\n\nHe didn't want it demonstrated that people have more control over their destiny acting on their own behalf that if they stand aside and led government take care of things\nThis guy was a walking talking disaster for eight years\nAbout Obama colluding with Russia on getting rid of American nuclear weapons an open Mike after the twenty ... right before the twenty twelve presidential election Obama's overheard\nTalking to ... number one the aid he says you tell Vladimir to be patient I'll have a lot more flexibility after this election flexibility meaning I'm up to run again and so I'll be able to even get rid of more nukes and our stockpiled than I could be for\nThe guy was just an honor disaster that the American people quickly realized as soon as the American people were able to get past the idea\nThat it was okay to vote against\nThe interest of the first African American president than the country began its recovery\nThe American people when it came to voting for Obama they couldn't pull a trigger not do it but when they came to voting against Democrats they did it in droves every chance they got starting in two thousand ten\nSort of picture up we got a picture for you to general camera going to send us up to Rush Limbaugh not can we have to picture side by side make the switch on the left is Obama in Nevada on the right is Trump last night in Houston\nThere's something really really off about these people and I think they've been driven to various degrees of

truth that they're on the table do except to Jim Jim Jim Acosta having the president whip people up at a rally\nAfter rally he says is the most depressing thing he's ever seen as a journalist this is it the citizens CNN conference yesterday in New York City\nIf you want to ask me what makes me the most depressed about my job\nIs covering the rallies and it gets to the larger point of what it's like covering the president United States and in particular Donald Trump in many ways the danger is not what Trump is doing to America the danger is\nHow America is changing under Trump and I never thought I Would see the day where I Would go to a political rally and you know people would give you a hard time I'd you know people yelled at me that Hillary Clinton rallies during the to those make campaign\nBut at a rally after rally after rally\nHaving the president noted states where people up into a frenzy got attacked the press to me is the ... the most depressing thing that I've ever witnessed as a journalist\nMan oh man where has this guy been to the Trump\nWhipping people up at a rally after rally in having people get mad at me as a journalist is the most depressing thing I've seen as a\nGym you can give you got all kinds of 'cause you could go be a waiver you obviously listen well\nMr Acosta however was not finished somebody needs to walk the guy back from the ledge here you know thousands and thousands of\nPeople who are willing to join in and do the same thing I'm at the rally in Montana the other night when President Trump praised grudging unfortunately for body slamming Ben Jacobs I remember looking over to the supporters in the crowd and there was one guy one young man\nWho was doing these body slam moves you know and and he and his buddies were all getting good laugh out of it and then he looked at me and he goes like this\nLike I'm gonna cut your throat and you know it just it I I went up to him after was over and I talk to them about it and and he was a sort of laughing about it and I I guess he wasn't serious about it but to me that the Trump effect on America\nWhat do you make of this so it it's it's no different than when Trump is onstage hey Russia hey Russia maybe you could find Hillary's emails and media is looking for um nobody can maybe you can find Hillary's missing thirty pounds name was let the media and they'd love to hear from me\nAnd everybody on the left in the media has a heart attack thinking Trump is asking the Russians to hack Hillary server Hillary's already done the hack Hillary's already done whatever she has something to hide the emails\nNo sense of humor these people have no ability whatsoever to relate to people as they actually live so Trump praises guy for being able to body slam somebody they see no humor in it they don't have any idea how to relate to that they see that\nThey think Trump they really do they think Trump is promoting violence\nThey think they Trump is recommending and praising gr violence ... but they just I I have never seen\nA group of people this large that is so distant and absent from reality from day to day life and how people talk to each other he goes up\nTo this guy
