don't remember what you did with your with your watch story I said you mean about\n... said yeah I said well what do you mean you blew up\nThe entire intelligence community excuse or a story or having evidence of how your shoulders died they were out there saying that there were probably going to get proof of his interrogation and murder\nIt does apple watching here you come blowing up the whole thing pointing out how it's\nTechnologically not possible\nYou blow it up and you didn't even know it did you I said well no because I wasn't aware of they were using the watch as that central if at at elements\nProving their case but then when ... said this to me I have the pause I had to contemplate and then I have to consider he has a point but there was one of these things I wasn't contemplating or calculating at the time I just I Know it's impossible\nThere is no way that ... watch could have recorded anything can happen to women there's no way it could have\nTransmitted or

to do that most people don't even have a watch don't even know there watch will work on why most people think they got to have the phone right next to watch in Ninety nine percent of the time they're right\nBut if you're a watch learned was a wife and I work like at your home that your phone logs into regularly then the phone to watch can access that I find that work independently of the phone if

there are more stories today two or three more about the dissipating blue wave\nIncluding none other than the door yeah I'm a Democrat National Committee cheating and election and bringing down to Brazil\nWho strangely enough showed up on Fox that I shut up a bill hammer down to Brazil did not go to CNN did they get rid of her because they found out she was sending answers to Hillary [noise]\nThat's right so see and I got rid of Fox willingly open our mid to late ... had done it Brazil on and hammer was asking are all about the blue wave and other Democrats are planning to do this and that is well you know twenty days is a long time in politics bill\nAnd I don't scramble my ... before my chickens hatch I said who is listening to hear Dan Rather I don't scramble my eggs until my chickens hatch she said naming\nThere's so much she left it couldn't happen we don't know that could affect the outcome here\nExactly my point the impact\nOf the election the events are they going to do that may not have happened including cabinet although although there is even more survey data now that the cabinet story was a one way benefit to the Republicans that he has not benefited the Democrats and the Democrats are seen as the angry\nParty\nAnd that the Kavanaugh scenario as it played out benefited and continues to benefit Republicans\n\nHold a media is getting a little worried the Elizabeth Warren focused on this thing blows up to the point they can't continue to carry the water for her it's dead\n\nBut rock Obama is refusing to hit the campaign trail the drive by Senate Democrats are stunned shocked where he was burnt rock where is our savior they're asking for Iraq's nowhere because you know what but rock knows he doesn't help people on the campaign trail\nHere

or why are you still hear me [noise] oh yeah I got a ... couple stories Democrats said where's Obama they're asking where's Iraq at least villain Hillary are going on a stadium tour nobody wants that\nThey can't find Obama I'm telling you Obama's not going to GO Campaign in a situation because the blue wave is not a lock and that's the only way he would show up for Rocco mama doesn't help Democrats go take a look he doesn't have coattails\nIt's during Obama the Democrats lost those twelve hundred seats and in right he campaigned for Hillary two thousand sixteen remember how he did it\nDo you want a third term of mud and others brush if you want me since we continue you know do you vote for Hillary at what happened ...\nJust Trump was the Mac you laid it not Hillary Rodham running them\nAnd so he's not there\nSo it's all falling apart and these two or three stories here on this on this dissipating blue wave and Donald Brazil's I'm I'm not sure you know it's a long time twenty days\n\nSo the AP pulling out all the stops Trump tells a piece he won't accept blame of GOP loses this is not what he said and this is why Trump is in the media all day it's the only way he can counter the fake news in the lives that they tell about it\nHere's how the story begins facing the prospect of bruising electoral defeat in congressional elections\nPresident Donald horse faced Trump said during the day that he will not accept the blame if his party loses control of the house in November and a wide ranging and is there any other kind of interview the wide ranging\nDo you think that's not a cut and paste job in every media is how about a narrow scope interview we ever had one of those you know they're always in a\nWide ranging interview with three weeks before election day Trump dismiss suggestions that he might take responsibility as his predecessor Denver midterm losses or beauty outcome as a referendum on his presidency said no I think I'm helping people\nI don't believe anybody has ever had this kind of in fact that's what he said he never said don't blame me\n\nCan I read the transcripts of the interview this is CNN's transcripts of the AP interview and their headline Trump tells a pie he won't accept blame a GOP loses house\nReady [noise] three to one\nA reporter okay so my question is if Republicans were to lose control of the house in November sixth or a couple of days later\nDepending on how long it\nTakes count the votes do you believe that you'll bear some responsibility for that no I think I'm helping people\nLook I'm forty eight and one in the primaries actually it's much higher than that because I endorsed a lot of people that were successful\nThat people don't even talk about but many of those for the aid is you know where people that had no chance in some cases we look at Florida you look at Donovan in Staten Island he was losing by ten points I endorsed him he won I can give you a long list of names look at Georgia

counsel Robert Mueller is expected to issue findings encore aspects of this Russia probe soon after the November midterm elections as he faces in in the fire the pressure\nTo produce more indictments or shut down his investigation according to chew as usual anonymous unnamed but we don't even know if they're alive U.S officials\nAnd I can imagine the pressure from Democrats to produce something anything it has got to be in tents\nEverything has blown up autumn folks Kavanaugh has blown up on them focus hottest in her latest blew up on them Hillary blow up on 'em Stormy Daniels blow up on them\nEvery attempt in October surprise this year alone previous October's is blown up and now you know they've thought all\nAlong that lower is going to get the goods on how Trump's totally election by keeping in colluding with the Russians\nAnd when this story broke that Mahler is not going to deliver your key findings adult after the election you mentioned me anger and frustration not so much with the like the Democrats 'cause they know the they know the games you\nBut they're there and look to take\nThe reins psychologically screwed up base is probably beside itself because this is really ballgame for this is what they have been counting on they have been\nThey bought it they drank the Kool Aid that Mueller has the gorge that Trump treated with Russia mother has got it he's going to announce it trumps finished after them in terms wait a minute why\nNow there are two things about this books\nThe rules of this game which are going to be a baby here\nInclude that air report such as this from a special counsel will not be released\nWithin this close proximity to mid term elections it's an unstated rural it is a it it's an establishment or deep state rural and frankly I'm I'm surprised that it survived\nI Would not have been surprise surprise to me it's a it's a it's one of these unwritten rules of gentlemanly Washington procedure\nThat a bombshell report if any nature will be held until after the elections I thought that would blow up I thought that they would somehow find a way to release this thing wrong if not that leak yet if it's got things in it that they like which the ladder is still possible\n\nSo Mueller and his buddies and the drive by media\nRather than break the rules and release the report prior to the election they're going to do the next best thing\nThey're going to start talking about it all the time such as this story Muller ready to deliver key findings in his Trump probe\nSources say\nSo each day we're going to get references to the fact that model is done rollers wrap it up mother his mother is gonna be releasing at any\nMoment they're going to be talking about\nBefore the midterms in hopes in the hopes this is what they're hoping they're hoping\nThat the acknowledgement that Mueller's report is done we'll be perceived by voters as the proof that Trump stole the election is\nImminent that is what they're hoping they are hoping that you and well I don't think they think you're going to fall for it but they were hoping that the great on washed up near the ill educated under educated on educated miss educated are going to believe\nThat it's only a matter of time\nBefore this report is made public proving that Trump colluded with Russia and that well then he influenced the way they vote that means they will vote Democrat that's what the effort here is they will create\nThis cloud of suspicion this cloud of\nDanger that port\nHandles disaster for Trump they'll referenced this each day leading up to the mid term elections\nAnd you'll hear people in the media speculate oh it could be Trump will be removed after the midterms when mullet\nReleases this report it could well be Trump's going to have to be removed to report might all of\nThis is going to happen to one degree or another to second thing this\nTells me is that Mahler himself is waiting to see who will be running Congress before he decides to really end\nThis because his report goes so Rosenstein\nWho is technically is bosses at the department of justice and to Congress and there is decided whether or not\nThat it is made public certainly the Democrats do when the house they're going to insist that Muller not conclude\nDuring the primaries are during the day after he won the nomination\nPrimary primary okay against a seven anyway he um I became a a Trump supporter one of the reasons was because she's got to be so good for the country and he is and I'm ashamed that Democrat my whole life\nThat these people aren't happy to see the country doing well that's what amazes me the most I mean I was always brought up the Democrats for fair and my dad was a Democrat by mom and that they sort of the country\nWhat you thought the Democrats for for the little guy looking out for the little guy in trying to help the little guy make it economically and overcome obstacles Republicans wasn't away\nExactly and so so I'm very proud to be a Trump supporter but I'm about to pack it in I'm going to tell you why frustration is so high\nRight now for not only myself if you put in a neighborhood because she said it before with Stuart gardening\nUm he said the Trump ... and he says is the only reason the only way I can get my message out well his tweets are good but not that many people really hear it and I can understand why he is not addressed the nation I don't understand [noise]\nWait a minute when you say when you say packing it and you mean you're about to abandon from\nThat advantage Trump but I'm really losing a lot of energy in frustration I really am because so many people don't know the good things that are happening they're not gonna learn preaching to the choir which ... most of the time\nAnd it fresh prince ... they skew anyway so if he addresses the nation and he should it should be proud of what he's done this is the greatest time economically that I can never remembered I'm sixty six I can never remember anything like this\nIt is amazing in it but you know you said something here very by I Want to I Want to circle back to something you said an observation you've made in the modern day Democratic Party that they don't seem to be happy right now the country's doing well they don't they don't seem to be encouraged or want to be included in it they don't want to even\nTry to get some of the credit for the country doing well in that shots you write\n[noise] you know not anymore it's a ... year and a half ago but I'm starting to realize they don't care about the country\nThey they really don't care about social issues they care about taking this guy down who I think the strongest guy since Reagan I've ever seen how we can take the bullets day after day I mean he's ... guy\nYour frustration is noted and I think it's shared by a lot of people what you're you're really\nYou you made it sound like your frustration is with from because he won't do a national impressed and try to reach people that his tweets don't read your audience that he that he doesn't rage but your real frustration of the U.S is with a news media and many people are in the same boat\nWho were doing their best to hide all of that and make sure people don't know it's\nIt's a joke amazed the frustration I've never been so frustrated in my life I Can't ... it ... me it was me out of the country so it was so well and so many people are going to go out and vote and they have no idea your newscast and they\nWell I think that you are a well why do you think you're one of the few people that let realize how great the country's doing if you think about why why do you think more people have\nListened to you if the reasons\nBut the economy you you said you've never seen anything like this in your life you don't need me to tell you the economy's doing well you see this on your own\nThree point seven unemployment are you kidding me with all the jobs and all of them a ... wage is going up on my machine aging my\nPoint is I think you can be a little confidence that you're not alone in seeing all of this\nAnd that more people are aware of it than you may know and of course you could be a it'd be understandable if you fear people not to the media is doing everything they can to hide it or even worse lie about it\nAnd you are of the impression that most people get their knowledge information from them\nIdiot but I think what happened with a lizard Warren here they could not cherry district Tobar surprised they could not cover for the fact that she's bogus they used to be able to do that they're not able to there's a reason for that I think it's also helping get the truth out about Trump's achievement\nTo take a break but it has to have much to say Russia's probably by being met

journalism is now this is not about contemporary events there's nothing in this series about Donald Trump or Theresa May or anything current\nIn either country it is a\nModern era of generic peaks

tabloid anything\nDon't focus on celebrities the other one is nothing more pure trash and it's the one that wins it's the one with the biggest building is but one with the more employees they're reporters are stars and so forth but you know what this does it's flat out amazing how honest it is\nIn terms of what people who do journalism think its purpose is destroying people\n\nBoth of these papers in this in this miniseries end up targeting the same targets the same powerful people some of them in government some of them out\nOr some of them not but it makes it clear that journalists think their job is to destroy the\nPeople powerful people rich people there obviously has to be something they're doing with breaking the rules and the guns\nBreaking the rules there has to be something there miss treating people they are sexually abusing people they are stealing from the public Dole they're doing something and the purpose of journalists ...\nCall 'em out and and and ruin them\nWhich many many years ago\nWhen I first began to encounter the media\nAs a target\nI was never I had a little taste of it when I was in Sacramento there were a couple of reporters at that paper that that that that have me and their crosshairs simply it was it was liberal versus conservatism but I mean I I didn't really get a full dose of it until this program started and I remember sitting talking\nTo some people about it and they said you have to understand what journalism is\nI said you mean the bias welders that but that it's it's it's more than that it's about ruining people it's about targeting and destroying people how do you think resumes are built journalist and these little medium size markets are small markets don't target somebody and they if they run a profile or a or a or a piece on somebody\nThat can be made to look accurate that nails them as guilty of this transgression or that transgression particularly against the little people in that report or is going to get noticed and that's how that's how that reporter climbed a ladder if you go back to the early days of sixty minutes it was all about that\nAnd it remains so today it's just\nIt's it's evolved to

what could happen\nSince they've decided to lead that Mueller is about finished since they've decided to leak that the report is eminent let me get that headline again just to [noise] not have to

Brian style turned Jake Tapper any of these are the start demanding this I mean if he knows what it is why can't we not insured affect the outcome of the elections will be told I\n\nThink the odds are that are pretty good or not what about you play the game what's hypothetically say that that pressure is brought to bear it's not up the Mahler it's going to be up to Rosenstein and the president to an extent Congress that's who gets the report what are you\n[laughter] [laughter]\nI Can't see this happening but what if\nThere is a lot of pressure brought to bear on mother to rebuild this release

Democrat turned out\n\nA couple of weeks from now three ... what do you think that does that's why I don't think there's anything in here on collusion\nI don't think there's anything in it on

than our time with\nThree of the past six presidents at the same point in their first terms he is currently tied with Obama at forty four percent he's above Clinton at forty one percent Reagan at forty two percent at this time in his presidency\nBut there's a broader point here Democrats in the media keep describing Trump as a hugely divisive figure but the polls show that his approval is starting to line up with previous presidents and what's more\n... low numbers are almost entirely because Democrats are universally opposed to him\nAnother poll quote\nAt this point in Obama's
