bustamante couldn't find any matches for Warren using only empty and DNA so he felt the need doing expanded\nTo include South America when other reason\nThere isn't much in the DNA is because they are very very wary of\nThe Indians themselves the Cherokee tribe leaders will tell you they don't use DNA to determine the lineage they use junior logical trace\nYou know who has one of the best junior logical trace apparatus was in this country in the Mormon church out in Salt Lake City has one of the most advanced respected documented Ginia logical praise organizations that you'll find\nI have I've seen their work and it is [laughter] it's amazing and that the\nStory I get is that many Native Americans have been very leery of granting DNA be cause they're leery of how it's going to be used\nThey already feel like they were discriminated bunch of people but on the same token there are some benefits that have been extended to them as a result of this\nAnd they just don't want to upset the apple cart so they don't even realize or utilize DNA in any of this but ... the media of course has a role here because everything they reported about this turns out to be an abject lie except British inclusion by the Boston Globe that there wasn't any Native American DNA\nAnd by the way this is not what Trump that her anyway Trump about her that she wouldn't have to take a test from a little kitten ... wandering around you can you can do a very rudimentary DNA test\nAnd he wanted to present her ... take the kids take the take the test of this kid's using it in a debate\nA future debate and that's what he meant that she wouldn't do any better that she wouldn't show up as the Indian if she did do it\nBut you talk about talk about a meltdown and its Trump that is causing this Trump is literally causing these people lose their cookies compass causing them to go in the same and I think it's happening\nThroughout the Democratic party and ... out in the American left and I have I have developed\nAn even greater reason for it and it all in all relies on things that I have previously known and told you about\nAnd most of it is related to my curiosity here and my suspicion and my my dubious a nature when it comes to this blue wave business\n\nWe've been hearing for the past how many months that there's going to be a blue wave there's no question about it there has been no question about it\nThe Democratic party is poised to retake everything they can and this next election why well the media tells us the American people are fed up after two years of Donald Trump they realize the mistake they made they wish they could do it and go do it over\nMaybe take back their vote for Trump and this was going to be the first chance they've had to actually do that until the Democrats are going to retake the house at a massive landslide and at one point that we are going to take the Senate but then if you look at\nThe reality of voting patterns just in the past eight years let's say ten there's nothing in the world using common sense\nThat orders for a Democrat sweep or blue wave the trend in the past ten years is Democrats losing elections left and right\nAnd it all started with Iraq Hussein all in two thousand ten do you remember how many times I reminded you that during the first six years of Obama go through the two thousand four team in terms\nOf the Democratic party lost over twelve hundred seats nationwide seats in the U.S house seats in the U.S Senate state houses a governorships\nAre you even go to a local often like mayor or town councilman if you if you factor all of those races\nNationwide the Democrats after six years of Obama had lost well over\nA hundred seats they were losing everything after the two thousand sixteen election\nThey continue to lose even more and the and the dance that lock to women in a landslide Hillary Clinton got beep in and near electoral landslide electoral college landslide [laughter]\nI'm not I'm not sure where they were going to sweep big never going to wipe out the Republican Party once and for all Hillary Clinton was going to be this winter they had they couldn't they had it any better this guy Trump won the Republican nomination\nSomebody did know when he was doing a gigantic buffoon a walking set of gaps they thought this guy would be easily swept away they believed all our polling data\nAnd we know what happened they continue to lose to the point that after the two thousand sixty\nEight elections the Democratic party had the least amount of power in terms of elected office is held in Washington DC since the Nineteen twenties\nNow the two thousand sixteen election was only two years ago so from two thousand ten the first chance people had to vote after\nHaving stomach two years of the Obama administration which you want to talk about people wanting to get their votes back you want to talk about people wishing they can do it over you want to talk about people wishing they haven't voted the way they had go take a look at the two thousand ten midterms\nIraq Obama singlehandedly\nMy friends has destroyed the electoral prowess of the Democratic party nobody knows it because of the things I just told you are never reported instead what people hear every day is this coming blow away this gigantic Democrat landslide on what evidence is this going to happen\nWhat is it that has stopped the trend\nThe people in this country have been voting against Democrats in ways unprecedented I mean the having the fewest number of electoral seats\nSince the Nineteen twenties is pretty astounding it means a lot of people had been voting against you so what is it that's happened that is going to cause this gigantic one hundred eighty degree shift\nMake people stop voting against Democrats and vote for them why it's none other than Donald Trump so says the media so says the Democratic party\nWell on the basis of what if you take a look\nAt Trump's agenda and the economy and policies and so forth there is no reason to vote against it\nIn common sense there is no return peasant done anything to worsen anybody's lives quite the contrary\nAnd in fact there's a story from CNBC today that you're not going to see widely reported let's see if the [noise]\nProbably put CNBC ... survey soaring economic optimism points to no blue wave in two thousand eight team is this the CNBC polar survey America\nIs experiencing a record breaking era of good feelings economically speaking optimism about the ... do you know that there are seven million jobs open in America today actual number seven million one hundred thirty six thousand job openings in America\nFor context the U.S never had even six million vacant jobs open until April of two thousand Seventeen\nNow we have an historic seven point one million jobs open that means employers are looking to hire that many people\nThat you will say roaring economy that equals no problem getting a job if you want one with that\nMany job openings it is an employee ease market if there's that much demand for employees the employees can set the\nTerms based on their level of expertise and experience or whatever it is they're applying for\nNone of this in the world of common sense suggests that people would\nBe unhappy by or about it and want to reject it and yet that's exactly what we're being told that the American people are sick and tired day hey Trump they despise Trump they're embarrassed by Trump they were barest by their vote\nAnd yet\nThere isn't a federal Lincoln bits of evidence that people

J. you know the balance\nSo just as the scales that justice are blind the department of justice does nothing including indictments that would impact and election now\nThe Hillary cases that I had to exonerate hurt their futures dependence on up\nTheir careers depend on it and she was a Democrat nominee they're not going to be in the business of charging and pursuing and diving the Democratic nominee again ... the unwritten regulations not impacting the elections so it does exist\nAnd it probably is a factor in smaller report not being released\nWhat I expect to happen well I don't know what could happen\nSince they've decided to leak that Mueller is about finished since they've decided to leak that the report is imminent let me get that headline again just to\n\nNot have to paraphrase this Mahler ready to deliver key findings in his Trump probe\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nNow you know and this was going to drive the left literally batty\n... ... ... they're not going to be able to restrain themselves\nHow long do you think it's going to be before somebody on that side of the aisle starts demanding that Mahler revealed is how long do you think it's going to be before dawn lemon or little Brian ...\nJake Tapper any of these are the start demanding this I mean if he knows what it is why can't we not insured affect the outcome of the elections will be told I\n\nThink the odds are that are pretty good or not\nWhat about you play the game what's hypothetically say that that pressure is brought to bear it's not up\nThe Mahler it's going to be up to Rosenstein and the president to an extent Congress that's who gets the report what yes\n[laughter] [laughter]\nI Can't see this happening but what if\nThere is a lot of pressure brought to bear on mother to rebuild this release it are are Rosenstein or whoever\nAnd somebody like Trump says well okay All right if you want to see him and they release it and there's nothing\nThat indicates Trump what do you think that does the Democrat turned out\n\nA couple of weeks from now three ... what do you think that does that's why I don't think there's anything in here on collusion\nI don't think there's anything in it on obstruction because folks at one of the week they're sixteen never Trump anti Trump hate mongers on Mueller's team if they had the gods yeah what a week and it would be leaking right now and it would be used to guarantee a blue wave\nIf Mueller doesn't have any of that than there is no way they want this released before the midterms that's why", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "city": "Newton", "day": "20"}
