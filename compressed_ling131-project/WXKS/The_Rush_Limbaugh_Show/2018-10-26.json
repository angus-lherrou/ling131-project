the way our Cory Booker\nIn New Jersey senator and the former director of national intelligence James Clapper\nWorried the recipients that I also saw Fox News is reporting that law enforcement is telling them that some of these bombs none of them have gone off but some of them have been detonated because they were judged to be so unstable\nThat they couldn't even transport them to a Quantico, Virginia FBI lab to study them they had to go ahead and detonate them a blow\n'em up because they might have blown up in transit although none of them have gone off none of them if they were ever intended to then there's still a lot that isn't known here and a lot of people are rushing in trying to fill in blanks\nAnd this is typical during events like this everybody becomes a journalist that everybody wants to have the first\nNews on every everybody wants to be the first to learn something the first to pass it on\nAnd on to law enforcement says what they're going to say about this at all is a speculation law enforcement's undoubtedly going to be leaking\nBetween now and two thirty to various members of the media that they light trust or what have you so there's going to be a day or use of information of what happens during these periods is that the first thing people here is what they ended up tending to believe\nThe first thing they hear the first thing they see is that it makes the first impression\nAnd that is why during this whole week some of the some people have been concern that the media without waiting just went ahead and signed this guy as a pro Trump anti democratic guy identifying the\nThe people as Trump targets they make America Again a great again bomber the mad go bomber\nBecause it creates first impressions it it's created this worldwide presumption that the bomber was an angry Trump supporter\nSet up at the people Trump is this is this is the uh\nThe narrative if you will as Dr buys attempted to establish before anybody knew anything because everybody knows first impressions are\nWhat are matters of same thing is happening\nToday with the economic news we have the GDP report today that growth was three and a half percent but that's\nBelow what was expected and so the drive by reporting\nThat economic activity has slowed down it's not nearly what people thought it would be trying to create that first impression\nAmong the people in their audiences that there's something wrong with the economy\n\nThere's nothing wrong with three point five percent growth the reason why the economic growth\nIs it didn't come into the into predicting three point eight to four percent is guess what the tech stock sector is taking a bath specifically\nGoogle also notice alphabet and Amazon have reported earnings and every ended a stunningly disappointing\nAnd it's causing sell off it's causing a big problem on the NASDAQ which is where many of the tech stocks report where they listed in\nAnd saw the same thing is happening now and with intensity because we are now at a period of time or less than two weeks before the midterm elections and what better time for the drive by us to report that the economy is slowing down\nEven though it's shocking to ride along jobs are still being created everything's my three and a half percent growth nobody ever saw that in the last eight years of Iraq Obama we didn't see that much before Obama wait and see it very often this economy still struggling right along with the Dr wiser reporting today\nThat it has a slow it down there could be trouble on the horizon and then there is this from the media light\nA headline Trump unfortunate lifted bombs stuff is slowing Republican momentum going into the midterms\nNobody talks about this yesterday this was a I thought a left wing media narrative that it created but apparently Trump to sign on to what President Trump today\nComplained about the pipe bombs being sent a prominent Democrats lamenting the scare has distracted from

loss of momentum or all that and then nobody nobody has\nYou know like this is I sadly I Wish you weren't the case I think Trump is half right here I think it is a reflection of what's in the news\nAnd what is it\nAnd if there isn't any news about the Republican early voting dwarfing Democrats than the perception is that it isn't happening or none of this stopped or it's not\nNewsworthy enough anymore so the bomb thing has come along I mean it ... the caravan that news stop being reported but more and more importantly all\nOf the news about the heavy Republican turnout dwarfing the

there's going to be a red wave\nOr a blue wave I'm Sorry ... and I think I think these folks know that there's no red ... I think they know they're in trouble with these elections I honestly beginning to think that the Republicans are going to gain seats in the house or or you are not nearly going to lose as many as people are thinking they are\n[noise] and I think it's all goes back to what like Jordan saying about that ...\nYou know and this and this whole cover up\nBut if they don't we take that house once the elections are over I think the real investigation is going to move forward\nOn that side of the document and that the CIA and I think these people are terrified the deep state I mean they cannot let that happen\nAnd I think the ... I think this package bombs are means of disrupting these elections to the point where they can then say between ... between these crazy right these these national right groups planting bombs and the Russians conspiring we cannot legitimize the win in the selection for the for the Republicans\nAnd I think they're going to try to throw the whole thing into turmoil I really do\nI so you think that as we sit here today the deep state thinks they're going to lose their ... they're going to win the house back Democrats in them and they've stayed thing not going to win the house back not going to win the Senate back so\nAll of this is designed to create so much chaos that whatever the result is him and Democrats in the deep state laws as they can say\nThe election in Balad too much was going on we can't we can't start democracy can't function this way you ... and you really think that the the deep state here set this guy or prevent he's part of a flag operation designed to make it look like a Trump supporters gone nuts here and have the left\nWhen in fact they orchestrated you think that\n[noise] do you do for the FBI and CIA and the Justice Department could have been corrupted to the extent that been corrupted over the past four or five years I mean like I said rush three years ago I Would have said I'm Crazy I mean I I I can put nothing pass them of course when you think about what the repercussions could be for them if they don't\nFrom a Dell and similar artist now on a Delray area for a while I\nYour smart speaker ... play Boston's talk twelve hundred on our hearts radio getting talk one\nFast pace and some I hurt me [noise]\n\n\nReadings welcome back Rush Limbaugh to cutting edge of societal evolution\nTo Alexandria, Virginia this is Tammy Ron open line friday welcome great to have you with us ...\nOh my God what a privilege I could imagine if I can remember that very much for me to have you here too so what shaking\n[laughter] um well I wanted to let you know I've been listening since Nineteen Ninety One when the federal judge I was quite a few for introduced me to your program um and so it's so great to be on here so many years later I wanted\nAnd I love that pedigree look at where you come from view come for you you have a federal judge was working and that's who recommended you are so that that that that's a wonderful pedigree that's a that's a like a great resume that we've got you into the Institute\nAnd by the way I recently gave them a gift of a twenty four seven subscription [laughter] I'm sure he's listening today\nOh that's awesome that that is that what I Can't tell me how sweet that is you know what you bring\nThat up I have to tell you we we we are ...

the sea is not technically of responsible for that but he is responsible for not just allowing the chat than I'm stuck at his rallies stoking\nMaking clear that he likes and all you need is one forgive me crock pot\nAnd we've been saying this for two years\nAnd looks like one may have emerged and that is the danger and that is the reason why leadership is the way it is and you can have an enemy you can have a political discussion you could have political discourse but when you've crossed the line\nIt is extremely dangerous and that has what has been giant mission and everything we've heard from anybody at the White House\nOkay so in CNN's as that's Trump's van and its Trump's bombs\nAnd you know in a\nIn a vacuum and in a narrow world what Dana Bash just sent here would be perfectly fine\nBut the thing that really irritates me about CNN and the rest of these people in the leftist ... is that they permit themselves to say all of these incendiary things about anybody they want\nThey permit themselves to attack the character and the intentions and the decency and the honesty of any of their targets\nAnd they can call every president Hitler like they did George W. Bush like they do Donald Trump\nThey can accuse these people have some of the most outrageous things in the world and of course there's never any danger\nThat at one of their crackpot ... going to take action except the theory is crock pot CNN viewers shot up a Republican baseball practice crock pot CNN viewers storm buildings where there are Family Research council members and think about letting loose with gunfire\nWe have example after example\nOf attempt didn't violence against conservatives and right when he was in fact one of the one of the central elements of Democrats strategy in this campaign is the public threatening and the public bullying and the public harassment\nOf Republican elected officials in restaurants in public places and these are genuinely threatening people\n\nAnd they are confronting people and demanding that they leave\n\nAnd and there's not there's never any condemnation of the ... you never hear CNN condemning any of this\nKind of behavior they chalk it up well you know this is what Donald Trump has Raj is just what Donald Trump's presidency is meant there says what Donald Trump is doing to people he's making them insane is creating all that so it's it's a one way street with these people\n\nAnd I believe Donald Trump is reacting by the way\nCNN starts this with their unfair biased coverage and unlike other Republicans who just sit there and take it\nAnd ... the stuff well this is politics you know it's hard wall you got to be able to take it and I'm sure that people will see under find people's data that Trump fires back at them\nAnd that's what hasn't been done before Trump fires back at him and a lot of Republicans are very excited about this fighting back because for ... for too many years we've had to sit here and watch powerless\nLate as CNN and others in the media have taken potshots of us and our issues they have lied about the misstated the miss characterize them damn attempt to do with you and the character in honor of conservative people spokesman\nPolicy people and so forth now all of a sudden\nWhen an actual Republican get shot by a gun and a bullet there is no ringing of hands over what's happening to our\nPolitics\nBecause the shooter was a Bernie Sanders supporter\nSo chalk it up where of course yeah I was ah mentally unstable Trump wouldn't do that to anybody comes down to Trump\n\nA lot of people separate Russia or something like two wrongs make her I'm not talking about two wrongs make a right I'm simply I I'm not talking about who started it I'm Talking about these people that want to sit here and hide judgment over everybody else while exempting themselves\n\nWhereas they said Donald Trump is perfectly capable and responsible for any behavior on the part of his supporters CNN is it\nThey're not responsible for how many of their viewers act or how any of the people on their side of the ... act and then there's this demand that they have for insulation\nAnd to be exam\nFrom having any impact on people that frankly offends me but this is Dan I mean if you [laughter] if you wanted to decorate\nAnd dress up a van that says notice me and if you wanted everybody in the world to know that you\nAre a Trump supporter who is unstable and a little over the top are major over the top [noise] this is what you would do\nSo [noise] my two cents for now here's President Trump at the White House today\nAs he convened a meeting black Leadership Conference a young black leaders from all over the country this has not been done before in in this in this manner\nUm [noise] and he's talking about the rest in these bombs here\nI'd like to begin today's remarks by providing an update on the packages and devices that have been male too high profile figures throughout our country and a media organization I Am pleased to inform you that law enforcement\nHas apprehended the suspect and taken him into custody\n[laughter]\nRight up on the job by law enforcement we've carried out a far reaching federal state and local investigation find the person or persons responsible for these events these terrorizing acts are despicable and have no place in our country\nNow I Want to again remind you of Trump pacing if if if you think Trump is not as on point this is your\nBaby or selling out just hang on I Want to remind you of Trump's first reaction after ...
