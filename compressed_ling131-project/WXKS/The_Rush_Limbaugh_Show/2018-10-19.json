Democratic party was going to get rid of\nDonald Trump and yes folks I mean get rid of Donald Trump I I don't think what this has been about is simply waiting until Republicans lose an election and such as the midterms I think they've actually sought\nTo have Donald Trump for being moved from office since the day after the election I guess what Mueller's about that's what the collusion thing is about that is what every one of these stories has been about\nIs somehow magically forcing Donald Trump out of office and effectively canceling the results of the two thousand sixteen election this is not about been not been about setting the table and making a case for removing Trump\nSay at the ballot box and twenty twenty or having the Republicans lose the house in twenty eight teen this has

the Democratic party leaders to the enraged abnormalities that make up a Democrat base\nAnd I mean that specifically I guess one of the reasons why the range and anger is now so out of control is because usually these people are able to accomplish most of this kind of thing\nAgainst any other Republican they want to destroy Mitt Romney or George W.

a long time\nThere are Fifteen seats that are now gone nine of those are the open seats there's another twenty five to thirty that our our seats that are in play and only about two or three Democrats seats are in place totally on the defense everything has to go our way to basically break even\n[noise] let me run through them and say this is stuff that I'm going to be honest with you I I Do not get into this stuff this is this is walk or stuff and to me this is totally abs and are\nThere any any what what's the word personality or I mean this is just raw numbers are based on data that is the result of polling and\nI Know as well as anybody that polling sometimes is right sometimes it's wrong and and I just sat in the bite\nI'm just suspicious of of polling units because I think I don't think these people can take their passion and their desired outcome\nOut of their work and we know that they know we look in the presidential polls in two thousand six day and I mean that those people were literally caught short there was no way Donald Trump is going to win it was just not possible Hillary was going to win a landslide maybe not the biggest ever but Trump didn't have a prayer\nAnd there was one maybe two polls that showed that he was really in it and couldn't win at ras my son was one neighbor ignored\nAnd we've got a replay here's what informs me what makes me make these kind of predictions is reality and as I also mentioned\nLast night since rock Obama was elected in two thousand eight starting in two thousand ten including the midterms in two thousand twelve\nAnd the midterms in two thousand fourteen ... election or two thousand sixty in the Democratic party has lost twelve hundred seats\nThe trend is people voting out Democrats\nAnd that was happening while the Democrats work in the White House with Obama there that could be a factor\nObama's gone so maybe the anti Democrat ... is not as high as it used to be when he was there because I Do believe he was a drag on the Democratic party but\nThen I asked myself what has happened in the last two years to make\nPeople all of a sudden I Want to elect Democrats again\n\nAs everybody's telling us is going to happen house is gone rush the Senate yeah we're probably pick up a couple of houses gone\nAnd then they say because rush these house races have nothing to do with any of the way you're looking at this these are really local races and they are have have to deal with things that are not on any national radar will not true if these races are being nationalized by the various candidates in them [noise]\nBut anyway what has happened to make people all of a sudden stop rejecting Democrats or the Democrats have they done a one eighty are made now performing and executing and behaving in ways that make people love them again\nWell no not in a just an insane world the Democrats aren't doing anything that would grow\nSupport their promoting rage and anger there promoting\nInsanity and the lunatic behavior so then okay maybe as a Trump is there's\nThis much opposition to Trump from people who didn't care one way or the other two years ago has the media succeeded in creating a bunch of anti Trump sentiment\nIn a mid term turnout profile of voters well that would have to be what it is because the Democrats are not the Democrats\nSay the justice associated with the Democrats are doing as landslide defeat the Democrats are not responsible for anything good happening in this country\nAnd they're not even trying to be associated they don't even trying to claim credit for the economy they did for a couple of weeks they've tried on Obama out rumor Obama's trying to say the economy was his\nWell that went on for like a lead the balloon and they died with it so they abandoned Matt and outside of that there hasn't been one\nAttempt by the Democrats to associate themselves with anything good happening in America they have in ... dad continued to try and portray America as this unfair\nOn just on deserve\nExceptional superpower\nThat discriminates that violates\nThat ... that [noise] it's all negative so I'm just so where is this body of evidence that suggest the trend of voting against Democrats is reversed again I acknowledge house races are\nNot the same as a presidential race with a national issues of national turnout on balance Shannon Bream last night Fox News at night with Shannon brim a wonders what my strategy was in predicting what I predict\nMust know calling says that the Republicans are going to hold onto the house so where do you think different coming from with Rush Limbaugh what's the status of\nI tend to agree with him um and I think what we could be saying is again the predominant ... the Pony Express called the spiral of silence the shy Trump voted to the shy breakfast votes as a kind of people who know that it's not a dumb thing necessarily to support a particular view but secretly in the polling booth that's what they do\nThat Steve sheltered and who has a weekend show on Fox and he was instrumental in the Brexit vote in the u._k. and so a reason to Len Wein was Limbaugh getting this I mean there's not a single poll out for the shows this happening precisely my point it's not a single poll not a single poll shows\nSo from this where to conclude and these people live and die by polls I'm telling you folks nine out of ten of people in D.C living die by their gospel and I really think\nUm if I Lived in Washington each and every I don't\nI couldn't I I wouldn't it be ostracized after not too long I just couldn't get with

businesses and just talk about\nHow they're doing you know and what are they are\nYeah yeah you don't we don't want that was you know you you what you remember there was a a it was it was a period of time it was the early nineties folks\nAnd white collar employees were being laid off executives and magazines and newspapers like USA Today we're happy\nThey were running stories how wonderful it was that if people are getting laid off it's finally executive it's finally white collar\nPeople and not blue collar people and so I decided we did three days of this we took calls\nA ... as as best we can manage it from people who had been laid off in their forties white collar managerial people laid off in their forties or earlier and asked what they were doing about it\nRight and that's what you remember hearing was all these people calling saying\nOne version or another of this is maybe the best thing that ever happened to me because I'm finally focused on doing things I Love I finally have because of necessity I'm I'm I'm looking at at the kind of job I've always wanted to have starting a business or what have you and they were\nThey were all amazingly upbeat and positive about what had happened to them not depressed and down the dumpster angry or any of that\nRight now it was it was just it was just I mean with my my second year in business\nSo I remember I remember it well because there was work if it's in January one or or or at least one maybe with another a rip off from the other three day things that are right I just I just think it'd be a good a good thing it a try you

calling in describing how great the economy is before they'll believe\nIt is that why you want them to hear it so that they'll believe it or you ask what are you thinking some people don't believe it or doubt it\nNo I just I just think it's a Brotherhood and I think that it's a way to support one another that run an operator own businesses and I don't think that we get enough credit for what we do

and we're the people that make make this country work\nYou know so that's all I mean it's it's it's a it's a simple as that way I see it\nWell small business small but there's no question that small business is uh the vast majority of of employment in the country and some could say the backbone\nWell okay I I Do remember that we've we've done a couple of instances of this and it is inspiring to listen to individual stories of people describe how they started their businesses and why and how they're working and why\nThey they are working so I appreciate the suggestion I really do other hosts\nWould maybe get a complex and think GMI failing if the audience is telling me what I but I'm not that week and I'm not I don't have any self doubt so I can take any kind of criticism from any

focused on trying to demonstrate that Trump has a phony is not who he says he is\nAnd they want to distance Trump's voters from them and that's all the callers theory was\nHell I don't think that could happen needs done too much into a little time\nOh I don't either get and the leaders but it was it was his theory as to what the purpose of this caravan is\nUh I I Know that there have been a little incremental appropriations aimed at building the wall but his point was how many\nContinuing resolutions if we have independent budget deals if we had and then there's not\nAnd we have control
