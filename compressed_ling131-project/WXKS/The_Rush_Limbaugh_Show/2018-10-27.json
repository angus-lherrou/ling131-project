{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WXKS", "content": "Can you you know a guy told me Thirty years ago there was nothing perfect for home there's always something you guys do a great job but what ... what do I choose how do I make the choice which one do I want to do I want to water back up on battery backup\nYeah very good question it's really a matter of preference and you know we've talked quite a bit about the battery backup system battery backup systems going to cost a little more okay 'cause you have a batter and you have more parts in pieces and an ... an electronics to it\nUm in fact is probably going to cost ... about three times more than your water power backup ... elders and maintenance involved to not as much as there used to be with technology and the other hand I'm much any more but yeah they're going to watch the battery and make sure that the batteries charged and everything's good to go\nOn the water powered as less maintenance significantly less maintenance\nI'm ... less less moving parts so to speak slow is that is that connected to your water line ... ... it did is actually yeah it's actually powered by why you should have been very principle of us is water okay up to 'em and then there's a pumping a well\nUh it's it's a yeah technically upon not a traditional type bright bugs that uses the jury principle uses water to to push water and moves that out doesn't perform as well\nWhen I was gonna say it's got to have less pulling out\nRightly about half OK more than half of where we're at today okay started called ... maintenance\nThat should improve because ... years ago it would be like twenty five percent yeah yeah so\nThat's getting better and we're actually um we're we're looking at coming out in an saying we call that product right now the home guard max and we're actually I'm looking at um coming out with another product in two thousand Nineteen that'll built on that\nOK more so what would ... why would they not want one because it doesn't pump as much I mean you've got to look at the the performance I'm asking for water pressure with the with\nYou know because you're connected to the to the water line the water pressure ... depending on what that is coming into your house can be a little maybe a little sensitive\nWhat do you need like sixteen years UPS or in that range okay yeah so you can't be putting it on the thirty five PSI Waterloo\nGates you know you can't have the wide yeah can't have one of the spectrum or the other day I got to kind of being that sweet spot and how long would run [noise] uh it it'll it'll run for a long as your water pressure right Enron okay so that's an advantage yup that way\nSo it's really ... comes back to you know what your or you know if you want that performance\nUm you want want a maybe a little more uh durability and pay a little more of the battery backup systems where to go but if you want to pay a\nLess and less maintenance of 'em\nBut if you got to run and all the time in this probably not a good choice there I'd be its Achilles' heel yeah right okay All right All right\nWe'll talk a little bit more about some pumps ... time as usual one of the nice features I don't know which one it is I always forget your numbers\nBut how big of a pump do I need is that where the plumber gets into figuring it out and then you got one where the ... this I think is the coolest thing in the world I get excited about really stupid things look plug glows so I Know myself pumps on that's the one I have a my home out of it right I can always tell ...\nYeah so that the standard typical some palm I'm is either have forced power or a third horse power and um what you're referring to their areas in the last couple years our our product development folks in engineering has done a really good job has come out with what we call our premium series so we took\nA model fifty three has been our bread and butter pomp and it's kind of what we in the ... category what we cut our chief telling about how we built the business but\nUm we called our model sixty three and it has it's the same principles same fundamental it's right on the palm but we've added some features and benefits\nWe've enhanced the switch a little bit engineering took some heat out of the switch which is the enemy of the enemy of it ... or electrical mechanical device so did a great job with that or put some more girl a seals and for harsh applications\nUm comes with a five year warranty some kind of differentiates are a model fifty three to three are warranted and looking for a little longer to my mind or whatever security you got that and then actually I'd like to say we uh you know this was like the first thing on the drawing board but it was kind of last minute\nIsrael like hey it'd be really cool if we had a a lighted I Love ... love right so I started off orange yeah you have your standard orange blog run our vendor did a great job ... can you make it now or green right answer green\nSo he ended up but they ended up making a big range so when you plug that ended a brilliant the rule it glows and you could tell there's power to pop which doesn't sound like a big deal you'd be amazed at how many pumps we get back at the ... at the factories are talked about\nIn the beginning here um that that just reported in Iran and what happened was there was just there wasn't any power at the or\nThere was that there was a ... out what that was probably ruin the road that trip yep yep well we're we're probably done to admit it or to mark but I I mean real quickly we're going into the winter season a lot of people start putting in basements\nAnd remodeling and the the quick John ultimate is a very cool pope if you don't want to be digging through a concrete floor ... waste water looks\nYeah so are quick John all to my is uh the ... the sewage removal system or a flush system and um it's perfect for basements remodeling for cabin for remote locations report will put a lot of them in a or or or\nOr ... or um the distributors of cell quite a few of them in art and contractors installers put quite a few in in what that\nDoes is that it's

yeah her eye on lower pumps dot com there you'll find all the information and again\nThese are sold through the plumbing industry but to recommend your plumber he probably already uses him if he does

... a mass shooting in Pittsburgh it happened at the tree of life synagogue in this world hill neighborhood local media now reporting eight people are dead is Pittsburgh Police official saying a short time ago\nIn the forefront of his supporters minds so I've been studying the media to try to get a handle on who actually might be behind this\nAnd here's what I found today CNN is spending almost eighty percent of their time on the show ...\nEighty percent may okay even if it's just sixty percent of their time on the show again not focusing on the care of him that tells me\nThat if the caravan wore a Democrat idea designed to embarrassed that they would be\nCovering it and building it up and with\nPeople down there interviewing these people creating sob stories it'd be there'd be man on the street interviews with a mean\nGuy Trump is are they just want to come to America to and that may yet happen down the road but CNN is is not wall to wall but they are predominantly focusing on the show Gabe\nAnd of course whatever CNN does just to try to damage Trump let's look and see wife CNN is so ticked off because Trump's approval numbers are higher than they've ever been now\nAnd there are higher than Obama's war at this stage in the ah in his mid terms of the same point in his presidency after two years there just beside themselves none of this\nIs happening the way it was supposed to happen now there's more and more stories about how the blue wave may not happen hint hint it never was going to happen I don't think anybody has ever known whether it's going to be a blue wave they've been relying on polling data but nobody knows for sure that was that the media\nNarrative it was a meeting that was not born of any evidence that couldn't be any evidence for a blue wave or a red wave the electric hasn't happened yet\nEverybody wants to rely on polling data to suggest that it's going to happen but the polling data hasn't been accurate either starting in two thousand sixteen and the presidential race\n\nSo we've got this caravan chugging north and I think you know put some things in perspective on this again the way to look at it is is as a a\nMicrocosm of what's happening every day and our border every day this is what's happening\n\nNot seven thousand a day but but but every day this is what's been going on for decades and it needs to stop\nAnd Donald Trump is the only person that's ever talked about working to make it stop now the Democrats\nIf there are behind this one of the strategic ... besides getting somebody hurts\n\nAnd blaming it on Trump maybe what they're hoping is that Trump actually won't do anything about it\nMaybe they're hoping that Trump will be all help from the puff talk about setting the military down they're talking about setting a National Guard down but not actually doing anything they might be rolling the dice that Trump isn't going to do anything because they think they've rattled Trump\nWith their stories earlier this year about how he separated families the border and how Trump didn't all white the network infant didn't want it but last so he did what he could change it I\nI Do know this\nDespite everything that you think you wouldn't know the common sense there are still Republicans elected Republicans at look at this caravan and their solution is to let them in\n\nAs elected still ... they are so you're about peace yesterday they are so scared of this issue they are so scared\nThat when ever the subject of illegal immigration comes up Democrats automatically when Republicans think they've got their show they're not cold hearted mean spirited and all that let them they're not publicly saying this but I Know that there\nMay be the Democratic gambling is too is is is a wild guess at Trump's actually not gonna do anything after huffing and puffing and I'll tell ya\nIf Trump doesn't do anything if this caravans allowed to get to the border and come into the country what do you think that wouldn't do the Trump\nThere's one issue that could separate Trump from his voters or at least make his do voters began to\nI don't no doubt is the right where they would be my only disappointment particularly after Trump has said over and over again that this\nCaravan is not going to get it if if if if some Republicans are behind this than than it is obvious uh but I just somebody has to be\nSomebody has to be making this happen folks we're talking we we've got how many two thousand miles\nStop and think of this from Honduras\nTo the southern border of the United states assistance at Arizona is around two thousand miles\nSeven thousand people one day\nJust decided to start walking to the United states\nTo thousands of miles\nI also think if you're looking for people behind this you have to look at the drug cartels and if you want to start trying to analyze will what could their politics in this be that opens up a whole new can of worms but I don't doubt that they are playing a major role in transportation\nBut there has to be political involvement here too because money has to be available there has to be money being spent on this\nSo you've got seven thousand people who all of a sudden undecided all of a sudden 'cause nobody saw this coming and there was no advance word of it\nSeven thousand people decided to start walking\nTo a thousand miles\nWe don't see pictures of of of where they're using the bathroom\nWe don't see pictures of them gathering or getting food and eating it\nI mean look at random video you might you might see some people really think we don't see how this is being handled we don't see the port a potties we don't see and are they just urinating and rivers and streams and what would the environmentalist wackos think about that if that's happening\n\nWell it [noise] I guess you you may have a point welcome to San Francisco they could already be accustomed to it especially the ... in the street and they get maps in San Francisco for the tourists come voided the piles of human the fate [noise]\n[noise]\nSo how long would it take to walk two thousand miles along with a tech\nRemember they're vowing altogether I just hit the southern border of Mexico they're vowing to get here by mid\nTerm election day so I don't walk enough to know how many miles a day\nYou could walk if you just start walking and you take a periodic break and after twelve or Eighteen or whatever you stop or slow down and rest\nFor the next day that people tell me that they would have to be walking something like twenty miles a day\nFor one hundred days I mean if that makes sense to a thousand miles twenty miles a day for a hundred days without any rest\nA hundred days for those every unreal Linda that's over for three months\n[noise] and the objective is to show up right as the\nPolls open on mid term election day so if they had been walking for what two and a half months have we seen video of the walk and it's beginning\nRemember

as\nThousands of Central American migrants\nInvaders\nHeaded for the United states as they marched into may go claiming they were inciting violence pump pay also they're inciting violence under the influence of politically motivated leaders\nHow was it raising the stakes\nTo point out what is happening what is the secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes Sunday night how was it raising mistakes to point out what's happening\nEspecially when\nWe have a party a political party that believes in open borders a media and the party that believes in open borders they will never report anything negative about these invaders\nRight mind would want this who in their\nRight mind would want any of this illegal immigration who won their right mind would promote this didn't want this who won a mob an invasion of seven thousand now eight thousand people to storm the border in the world would want that and why\n\nIt makes no commonsense under the umbrella of what's good for\nAmerica what\nEver motivation for the people who want this to happen it's not for the good of America it's got to be for something else so Pompeo goes down and promptly identifies what's happening here NBC says raising mistake what takes\nWe have somebody finally pushing back on this because remember the Republican Party up until Trump never did push back on this they they came up with their own reasons for wanting\nAmnesty for illegals and for you know having a fall push on securing the border on Sunday night ... who met with the Mexican president went on the offensive alleging in a statement that many of the migrants were criminals themselves\nBy definition they are if they intend to cross the border illegally they're all criminals one of the world is so damn hard to understand about this\n\nI think it's a classic illustration of how soft discovery is getting in one of the reasons this country is getting soft just because the elderly or senior generations are turning over everything to the young who haven't lived\nLong enough to know what's best for being driven stole my by a motion govern solely by a motion\nNot any ... any kind of common sense and because it's\nOdd quirk that's happened in our sociology adults today seem unwilling to teach young people right and wrong or to help them benefits from the wisdom comes from having lived a bunch of life and having a may I ask a bunch of experiences\nThere is no way under the sun this makes any sense what so ever\nWe may as well not have any border if this is something that people want to advocate for permitting and allowing males will just a race the border and said to the world come on in because that's in essence the impact of this if it's not stopped\nIf it's not dealt with\nThe people of the world do not have an entitlement to the United states taxpayers back pocket but the Democrat Party assumes or seems to think that they do\nThe Democratic party has calculating that there are more people who want to get in to the American taxpayers back pocket then there are American taxpayers\nAnd saw the Democrat Party is siding with the people around the world who have nothing who thinks it because the United states has a lot they should just be able to come in and get whatever they want\nAlmost as an entitlement we have a political party pushing this we have a political party promoting this this political party ought to be no where near winning\nAny thing\nIn the next elections there is not a single reason to vote for these people under any room breakup commonsense\nTake a look at the things they advocate take a look at the people they tried to destroy take a look at the things they are promoting it defies common sense to support this and frankly I don't think they have as\nMuch support as the media

ally of Osama bin Laden I never said any such thing I sending in fact the exact opposite so yeah\nYeah a lot of people worked up about that here on the other side of the glass I'm going to get to it or in due course same thing on this transgender business the Trump Administration is attempting to eliminate the whole classification and I'm going to tell you why I agree with that but all of that coming up here's the final Louie Gohmert bite again bill hammer\nOutward concerned these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who would exploit them were also concerned ah there's Pompeo saying this we're concerned about violence promote by some members of this group\nAll of these people trying to force their way and\nIt's called an invasion\nAnd thank God we have a president that will stand up to an invasion of like this but under our constitution that Governor can call out military troops to stop an invasion and I've heard people on TV so called experts say well you can use the military because of ...\nThat normally prevents military from being used against its own citizens\nIt has nothing to do with using the military to stop an invasion from another country so there was nothing unconstitutional illegal about the president knowing what window Wilson did put tens of thousands of people on the border and make sure nobody forces there way\nIt's a no brainer folks get is a number of the president can do that and has committed to it you would dare you you you\nHe may not send the military and I may call as a as a congressman government says there but there's no law says he\nCan't this isn't about what is one of seven thousand Russians were about to force their way into the okay what uh seven thousand Russians are about to force their way through the southern border\nTo try to affect the mid term elections what if we can make that case what do you think the people would eat demanding Trump do\nStand aside and let the seven thousand Russians in so they can hack our computers and make sure the Republicans win them in terms of it's a joke folks at the junk you never know who's listening I'm just asking what if it's seven thousand Russian communists think always trying to get in\nAn invasion either way you look at here is Mike in Youngstown, Ohio getting a call in here in the first hour welcome sir how are you\nGood good Russian I Hope you and your family's all doing good\nListen I I think this has all the makings of a bad set up for Trump because of the optics are I don't care if you're a militarized border that if they\nBomb rushed the border like that down in the southern side of Mexico where they tried to stop them what's our military is supposed to break out the times or water hoses or\nTear gas that's just going to look so bad that Trump is going to take the brunt of it but he needs to do is call a a house and the Senate back into the emergency session and doing national address and put everybody on the line not just try to deal with this self\nSo bring him back in for a special session or their wife passed legislation specifically saying that this mob uh seven thousand can't come in\nSomething though that sort\nI mean do you think Trump needs to share the burden of providing the obstacles that if Trump sends a military down and he started cracking heads and it looks bad for Trump exactly so you think that's what the actual intention here is that people are planned this thing\nExactly and that's where it can try to deal with this on his own he leaves to put everybody else or but on the line and get them on tape on film or whatever what should we do what what do you like to do if they come across\nActually like that in a way I like making Schumer\nAnd Pelosi stand up for letting these people in any way it's a good point it's a it's it's it's a dangerous situation but it is in a whole lot of different ways will be back my friends that we will continue as we always\nHave to get away with

worked\nTo destroy Republicans in the past and to make you abandon them they've got it down pat they've perfected the various attack plans to various schemes to make you distrust and by the way Republicans in the past them kind of helped out in that regard by campaigning to promise\nTo do this that and the other to get into office they do just the exact opposite so it's been a perfect storm for the media\nThey've had Republicans who are elected properly in Tampa David they've been able to persuade you to various Republican stink not worth your support we've been able to get rid of pretty much whoever they want it to\nTheir Jim Acosta in Houston, Texas last night twenty five thousand people outside Seventeen thousand people inside\nRoaring and cheering and having the best time they've

afternoon show\nAt some conventions setting in New York City and here's Jeff Flake\nBy onion on this to me now it's just gone so far beyond you're not expecting the president to pass it anymore but what is troubling as to look behind it and see the reaction of people to what he says and that's what's more troubling to me how as as to who believes [noise]\nAnd he does it I think because it still works instill rile people up\nThat divides us horribly yeah oh it's\nJust it's very very dangerous it's very bad out there Trump spreading lies stoking fear and the election there's Jeff Flake or who himself has been rejected by people like you went to Arizona voters in Arizona couldn't get reelected saw\nHe now says what's really troubling the look behind Trump to see the reaction of people to what he says and that's what's more troubling to me now\nWho believes this\nHe does it I think because it's still works at sea so Trump Trump as he pretty smart Trump knows what he's Trump knows that you're idiots in Trump knows that you're fools and Trump knows that you'll fall for anything\nAnd so Trump is ... is working his son got like magic on you and and and people like Jeff Flake in the

his left shoulder and he's now ... for him\nHe's telling everybody who they are\nAnd what they want and why we must let them in and that there are different people and all they want is a better life and that we as Americans we owe it to these people don't let them in all they want is what we want we all\nHave these various humanitarian objectives in common and I ask myself how would the world can this guy vouch\nFor whatever it is now eight thousand people but there he was down there vouch in trying to tell everybody watching him\nThat these are ... these are the prince and princesses in Central America these people are beyond reproach\nHe doesn't know them he has no idea who except I think he does I think he knows what the political objective is here and I think he supports it and is doing everything he can to advocate for this bunch which intends to be disruptive and destructive\nBut to sit there and to try to vouch for eight thousand people and to tell his audience who they all are and why we owe them\nAlthough Democrats remain strongly favored to win back the house overhead TV pictures of thousands marching north have the Democrats spoke\nAsked if the timing worry them a

persuaded relatively few of those polls to vote Democrat\nOn Monday Trump unleashed an explosion of immigration focus statements warning on Twitter that he made the point the military to the border

nonstop about the care of him because it's going to help him with immigration well\n[noise] [noise] who did they think is behind this\nSome of the stuff in the media is literally mind boggling that that the the attempt here to be on attached to it or disengaged from it\nWhen when you get down to brass tacks most people in the media would be supportive of the people is caravan being allowed the lead in the country because they are everyday anyway whether people show up and groups to tour five or ten or in a Bob up seven thousand the left as in favor of letting them in\nAnother worried that this is going to be a boon to Trump right before the midterm elections which it is\nThat's [noise] [noise] [noise]\nBut when you stop and think the Democrats are behind this has to be democratic donor money behind those and the reason I say this it may make no sense of ... because this report is right this is helping Trump's so why would the Democrats do this book they're not rational right now\nThis group of people throughout the media the Democrat Party itself and and all of their social media base voters I'm telling you are so poisoned\nWith hatred and resentment all of these emotions

a political experts cite constantly what what real clear politics does among many other things is average all of the so called response civil polls out there into something called a real clear politics average of polls\nAnd political experts from across the aisle site real clear politics and trusted as\nAn unassailable source so combat and cofounder of this place was on ah the Fox Business Network today\nHe said that if there was a blue wave that it would be cresting at this point meaning it'd be building we'd be we'd be seeing the top of it here and Tom Bevan sat in all the polling data that they have a real clear politics and analyzing\nIt's not there is no crafting there is no blue wave if a wave was coming it would be building he says and it isn't but on the other hand the generic ballot is holding meaning the\nDemocrats are not running away with it they still have a ... depending on three to five point lead in the generic ballot but they're not expanding it there's no growth there is no Democrats pulling away as what happened with a blue wave Trump's job approval is rising\nDemocrats are in the advantage ... says but they're not building on anything there's no way that's got to wash everything away and leave only Democrats standing\nHe says the house races are really tight they are race by race real battles hand to hand combat is how he described it he forecast that Democrats might win the house\nThat they do have an advantage right now because they have a range of Seventy competitive races and the range of pick up as they look at polling data now\nIs anywhere from Democrats picking up ten to forty one seats\nThey're projecting a democratic pickup of twenty five and a half seats which give him a slight a bed Democrats need to pick up twenty three that's the magic number anything above that Democrats have an advantage in the house the range of the pickup according to the polling data real clear politics takes a look saddens anywhere from ten to forty one seats\nThey project a pick up a twenty five seats twenty five an absolute two and a half seats more than they need\nBut with even a tiny shift in just a couple of races there GOP can hold the house so all of this synthesized and stripped away and they went to bear essence there isn't a blue wave\nThere isn't this blue wave that's going to sweep every Republican away and leave only Democrats standing\nThe generic ballot is not moving and Democrats favor Trump's approval numbers are rising\nOver on the Senate side Devon and real clear politics project the Republicans are going to gain two seats\nTwo weeks ago they were predicting no change Republicans wouldn't gain or lose any two weeks before that the Democrats were going to pick up seats in the Senate so in the past month we've gone from Democrats picking up a couple of two Republicans gaining a couple and that's the momentum and that's the trend\nAnd he made the point that it's a whole new world with Trump\nGender gap
