would have to be somebody in the media or the lawyers for Christine Blasey Ford who had seen the letter\nAnd so some senators began to say that it could well be Senator Feinstein and she sat there and

on what she was in such pain she was so so shaken by what happened\nAll those years ago you could say yeah because she really knew how to make it look like that\nI don't think\nFor me I don't think any of this has been genuine I think it's all orchestrated I think a lot of its focus group that I think it's scripted\n\nAnd I just I'm because none of this passes any kind of a smell test well anyway back to mark pencil very quickly\n\nAmericans believe her and both believe Kavanaugh if the FBI finds no corroboration of the charges sixty percent believe Kevin all should be confirmed according to a weekend harbored a Harris Poll of the thousand three hundred and thirty registered\nVoters sixty six percent of Americans support the decision to have the FBI investigate that includes eighty percent Democrats sixty nine percent independents with only forty five percent Republicans who are the smart ones\n\nHuge numbers in the weekend poll reported seeing parts of it or reading about forty percent thought she alone was credible\nTwenty three percent fought Kevin all was twenty seven percent said both ... if you combine all that the poll findings indicate sixty seven percent found her credible and fifty percent found him to be\n\nWhat the credibility their testimony doesn't appear to be the decisive factor instead the question comes down to cooperation as the standard for tipping public opinion on whether Kavanaugh should assembled the high court in terms of the overall needle after the testimony was heard thirty seven percent\nSay confirmed the nomination forty four percent say rejected Eighteen percent remain undecided Democrats going one way Republicans the other but but but what about the hang on no get depressed\nOnce the voters are told that the named witnesses deny any knowledge of the allegation that ships from forty four percent of fifty seven percent in favor confirmation meaning\nMeaning the people in this poll do not know did not know many of them did not know that the people she places in the room have denied being there\nAnd when the pollsters told them that in fact the numbers of people who thought he should be confirmed jumped from forty to fifty seven percent and then up to sixty percent in a hypothetical question if the FBI\nAfter a week agrees there is no cooperation for her story and they've already done that but now we've got combing entering the picture\nNow we've got to call me urging the FBI to keep digging the same FBI that's been running a silent coups FBI leaders trying to get rid of Trump\n\nI Want to grab a phone call because this guy has a great point and I want to add something to it this is a jet Jason Muskegon, Michigan Jason thank you so much for waiting I appreciate and how are you doing\nThing no problem and thanks for letting me be part of the excellent [noise]\nWell I appreciate that you are you are here as part of the excellence by association\n[laughter] yeah I was thinking on that uh there is no better way to um motivate a group by attacking them and by attacking Kevin uh they're basically essentially attacking the entire Republican base we\nShowed up and sixteen and voted Trump and I'm part\nOf that reason was for the Supreme Court nomination and here we are Democrats are going to make the midterms about a Supreme Court vacancy and they think that they can last year twenty twenty so they're not really pressing issue as hard as what Republicans could\nAnd knowing that if we want to get our guy in there you know we're gonna have to show up in midterms are going to they're going to have an adverse effect if they keep the ...\nI've heard people say this I I'm a ... Jason here thinks\nAll of this is gonna backfire on the Democrats and motivate\nRepublicans to show up and vote not just now two thousand Eighteen but again for Trump in twenty twenty or let's go to the audio soundbites on this Jason thank you much we're going to start here this is a boxing friends weekend on Saturday morning\nRachel Campos Duffy was one of the hosts is talking to the B. M. political corresponded David Brody\nAbout all this\nAnd she says well we know the Democrats all ready then really energized about the midterms I don't know how much more energized naked get but I'm sensing that Republicans have become very energized this week this hearing has really fired and the Republicans\nOffer my reporting and from that deplorable evangelical base I can tell you they say the Democrats dirty tricks have riled them up like never before and I know Rush Limbaugh has talked about how if Kavanaugh is not confirmed it's going to be real tough for the Republicans actually if Kavanaugh is not confirmed\nThat would even rile up at the plural evangelical base in the jail the base I Believe even more at least the people that I'm hearing from and so what I think that that's a big part of what's going on here\nNow look you can't blame David Broder you for being fifty percent of informed because\nI I pulled back that original production afterward and gone viral all over the\nDrive by media that's why it's still prominent in people's minds and my retraction of that production has barely received a whimper because it doesn't serve the drive by it's any good when the drive by here me predicting Republican\nDoom they can't help themselves they got to put an all over the world in the media Rush Limbaugh says Republicans are going to lose ... capital not confirmed that production was based at a specific point in time on if the Republicans caved\nIf Republicans didn't fight for ... for Republicans just went bird out I predicted that what happened but once this began to unfold\nI retracted that predicts shouldn't set it could end up being the opposite here but of course that prediction didn't go viral\nAnd I want to Jason in Muskegon I Want to thank you for bringing it up so that I could make the case here is one more a bite on this is a CSPAN Washington Journal Saturday morning Jess Holland is talking to a correspondent at the Weekly Standard\nAnd Andrew anger about me\nThere's been several conservative including Rush Limbaugh who warned that Republicans could lose their majority if they don't get half a mile from farm to the Supreme Court is that something that Republicans in Congress are really thinking about mid term consequences\nArguments like the one that Limbaugh makes our little convenient on whether or not having to get through I think that whole situation is really fired up Republican voters\nNow once again somebody else you can't blame 'em folks don't get mad at him because my original production\nTheir people and stories

that's what lake was a short I don't know how it's Fox is running as a source they've got [noise]\nThere's nothing to find the FBI has looked at Kavanaugh this'll be the seventh time folks Christine Blasey Ford does not have any evidence for them to track down she can't even tell them where no walk she can't tell them when\nTo look unless she starts suddenly remembering it now and I guess they

sending him a jail\nThat would have been found long before now\nSo remember none of this is about what it's about this is about delay delay delay the leg that's all the Democrats want here\nSo whenever the FBI producers are results and what ever results are the Democrats have an answer for it\nIf they exonerate cabin on the investigation was not thorough the Trump told the FBI to overlook it much but can they can accuse Trump capital of anything and be confident the media will carry the water that allegation\n\nIf the FBI find corroborating evidence well people are going to have to ask\nWell how come you missed it six previous times over who knows how many years you've been looking into this guy how can you find any evidence which she didn't tell you where to go look\nAll well\nAnd and did you talk to Michael ... the FBI didn't talk to his client and they didn't want the ... I'm telling you no matter how this if the FBI exonerate Kevin all whenever they do it do you really think the Democrats because okay fine what we we we we got what we wanted number prepared to go about you think that's going to be the result it will not but [noise]\nNow folks [noise] one of the thing here\nWe just had a caller who said that we don't want to become them but it's time to start playing this game the way they do I made the point you don't have to become them to beat\nThem at this game we didn't have to become Hitler to win the world war two we didn't have to become the Japanese emperor when World War two and the\nPacific theater\nThat's always been a bogus we cannot go after these people at risk ... coming who they are with Pam what a crock that's nothing more than some\nLimitation that's in other denial of people who are already\nFound the bay of a fine character you you can you can you can enter into tough battles without losing your morality and your moral character and so forth\nBut as an example of how we own most do it now and then but then we pulled back I call your attention last week the window Lindsey Graham on loaded on the Democrats\nThe on loaded on him and he was a thousand percent right in every allegation he made a couple of other Republicans echoed gram but with no passion and with no energy they just echoed ... grams said\nIntellectually now\nAccording to our caller that should have been the starting point people should have been picked up on grams opener and run with it and it shouldn't be calm\nThe daily identifier of the Republican Party they should have been throwing back firing back right at the Democrats in their faces every hour of every day exactly what Graham did make that the ongoing about put them on the defensive may media repeat these charges ...

occurrence has yet to happen that will affect or seriously effect the camp\nI was curious to hear if you think this Kavanaugh's nomination that's gone sour is that incident\nWell could be I mean the but the point was ah I didn't have anything specific in mind it's just that we get a poll in June or a poll on may or even July and it tells us what the\nPublic is thinking of doing and the November elections in my point was this is silly this poll doesn't mean anything there's anybody remember the pole in July of two thousand sixteen or in August that doesn't mean anything because it's not when the election is and I said the the the events are going to shape the midterms haven't happened yet I said that in July\nAugust September\nA and this is exactly the kind of thing I had in mind but there's going to be something beyond this oh dear this is going to get\nResolved one way or the other depending on how it's resolved yeah it's going to affect turnout it's going to affect votes\nIf the Democrats lose this uh if Kavanaugh gets confirmed um\nThan what a democratic voters going to do they get us going to be really enraged didn't show up and vote are they going to be mad depressed\nThan at home who knows what this thing is going to get rid of this\nThis is not resolved before the election and it's a defeat anyway because all the Democrats won a year's delayed delayed delayed\nBy my only point was that those pools in the summer are largely irrelevant because there are things are going to happen much closer to the election nobody can predict that are going to have a

information we need more yeah what's wrong with more information\n[noise] what's wrong with more information is not the question why do we need to give the Democrats more time to make up a bunch of other information ought to be the suspicion here okay so the Trump soundbites these are from the oval office was during a\nAnnouncement ceremony for a new trade deal eliminates the NAFTA getting rid of it brand new trade deal\nThe drive by eyes were under orders not to ask questions about Kavanaugh which meant they ask questions about capital and Trump after making sure enough time was spent on NAFTA started entertaining the are the questions and what we have a one through four of them here\nAnd here is a Trump ... this is this is not actually in response to question he's just riffing here during the\nCeremony talking about the uh mid term election fake news Kevin ... things\nWe have Senate races that weren't even in play six months ago as you know there are a lot of repression polls are polls that are on very accurate we had areas and we had congressional seats to\nWhere I Know it's got to be a positive outcome but you look at what's going on and it doesn't seem to be broadcast that way but I certainly had that with my election\nThey were telling me I was you know in trouble in certain states that end up winning like in a landslide and I knew I was going to win them in a landslide but they wouldn't reported that way you know why fake news\nNow during the Q and a Cecilia vague go\nABC News the White House correspondent said in a tweet this weekend as you said it's incorrect to say that you're limiting the scope of the FBI investigation into Kevin what your own statement on friday made it very clear you said this investigation must be limited in scope so which is a\nThis is our seventh investigation\nOf a man who has really you know you look at his life until this happened what a change he's gone through what his family's gone through the trauma\nFor a man that's never had any accusation any he's not a bad statement about him he's led I think he was number one in this class it yeah he was number one in this law school and yeah and then what he's gone through over the last three weeks his incredible so\nI Want the FBI this is now the seventh investigation so it's not like you know just starting I Want them to do a very comprehensive investigation\nLet me explain that answer let me let me these soundbites and got to be yeah number thirty coming okay [noise] ... this\nWhole FBI investigation started everybody knows we we heard flake\nDemand a week for his vote one week\nSo that's how the committee vote in eleven to pen and paper Kavanaugh with the provides though that flight was not gonna vote well I'm a floor vote for final confirmation silly FBI had spent at least another week long handled this\nSo that NBC runs a story out of nowhere fake news claiming that the White House intends to limit the scope of the FBI was a set up it was a it was a trap\nThey lay in a trap NBC News which is complicit with the Democratic party in most things later trap accusing Trump and the White House of trying to limit the FBI skull because you see there are things to find and Trump wants to cover it up Donald Trump who's had so much control over the FBI the last three years\nSame FBI that's been doing is level best to get Donald Trump thrown out of office somehow Donald Trump has been able to walk in there and tell those guys to limit the scope of their investigation\nSo Trump person I'm not limiting the scope of anything I've told the FBI the look at whatever they need to look at\nOh OK thank you Mr solve it needs to go two weeks ago two weeks so the White House is not claim there aren't any limit to see how this\nWorks it was a trap it was set up and Trump tweeted out he's not limiting the scope NBC is why course they're lying it was a set up\n\nAnd so now it's out there but we may not be enough now Fox News is reporting along with Fox Business news at the FBI is saying they might have this wrapped up tomorrow\nBut then the question becomes what to do with that if the FBI just finished talking to everybody I talked to\nThat one of the Republicans do with that so they hold on to it till friday and art art art or do they move on it will just tell you if this ends tomorrow if this is all accurate\nAnd the Democrats here but the Democrats are going to be fit to be tied to the thing didn't go on till friday and they're going to demand they're going to start saying that this thing is rigged they knew what was going to be ... and they're going to demand even more time\nTo fix the fact that it was read they're going to do that anyway they're not going to let this thing and on friday if we let them have their way this investigation isn't going to end on friday\nIt won't be long enough\nBesides Trump said he's not going to limit on the FBI so why are they stopping now it isn't possible they could have found everything there is to find on those labels to which the response as well they found nothing you know hundred thousand or more Hillary emails and a couple of days\n\nOr

story NBC does claiming Trump is limiting the investigations withdrawal I'm not that fake news\nSo then they've got a record Trump not limiting and best which means you can go on and on and on and on and now they're broadcasting and everywhere White House tells me I interview when he wasn't necessarily [noise] and rice on schedule\nCNN reports that the Democrats have submitted a list of twenty four\nPeople they want the FBI to talk to\nThis after Fox News had an earlier today that the FBI is about to wrap up tomorrow\n[noise] this is going to have to be shut down at some point this cannot go on all this is\nIs delayed delayed delayed the way and I'm going to tell you what needs to happen\nThere is an assumption operating out there that needs to be shut down and that assumption is that the investigation that has taken place since Kavanaugh was named is somehow insufficient\nIf somehow incomplete\nSomebody needs to stand up and say if the exact opposite that this is the seven now Trump has but somebody besides needs to make the point\nThat this has been a thorough investigation that every last minute Jack in the box that's popped up here has been looked into and the effort has been made but there's only so much you\nCan do with a woman who doesn't remember where or when what ever happened to her happen and there's only so much you can do when the people in the room she says we're their claim they weren't\nThis investigation somebody needs to stand up and vouch for it somebody needs to stand up and promoted\nIt needs to be spoken for\nThis has got to be stopped because it's not real\nThe Democrats are allowed to make it up as they go\nSubmit names they want the FBI did talk to they dug it investigations don't work that way FBI follows evidence leads and when they don't find anything on my Bob Mueller they stop\nMueller's been looking for collusion with Trump and Russia for two years in hasn't found any but he's still going and that's exactly what this is going to be if somebody doesn't stand up and stop this\nSomebody on the Senate Judiciary committee needs to stand up or Mitch McConnell needs to stand up and start vow Jang\nFor the investigation is taking place there are six separate FBI background checks of Brett Kavanaugh somebody needs to speak up for him somebody needs to vouch for um somebody needs to stand up and say they haven't been thorough and they haven't found anything or you wouldn't be where he is now sitting on the DC circuit court of appeals\nBut that's not happening somehow were letting the media get away with the idea that the investigation here in the Kavanaugh has been half baked lukewarm and incompetent\nBecause of Christine Blasey Ford coming around at the last minute with no evidence no collaboration and nothing yet she's credible Kevin O's not somebody\nLook we got a caller earlier how do you stop a bully you smack 'em in the face somebody needs to stand up until the Democrats the shut the hell up that they've gotten everything they've asked more in this thing and there just isn't anything there and to go home\nThe idea of this investigation is not thorough is incompetent is incomplete or has been Rand is absolutely bogus another making things up the Trump is going to limit it he did no such thing but he sure Fela\nFor the bait why not limited and the thing I have told the FBI to take us wherever it\nTakes them properly Democrats while you're Twenty one people we want you to talk to\n\nIf you called the FBI say there's there's some people in my town here really really screw on the porch and I need to get something done about an IRS in when you go talk to them but it doesn't work that way does it\nWhat rush rush this was the United States Senate clearly that can happen to know is that\n[noise] and one of her thing you know one of the one of the movies I have recommended over the years that people rent they haven't seen a go go watch it's called the lives of others and it's a movie about East Germany during the Cold War essentially\nHow the government literally spied on every citizen\n\nThe German chancellor of the time was rich hunter\nHe's the guy but you know drug the East German women Olympic teams anyway it's a it's a frightening a movie in terms of what gigantic police state with the", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "city": "Newton",
