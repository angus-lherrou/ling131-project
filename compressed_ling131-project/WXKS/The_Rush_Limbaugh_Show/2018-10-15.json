Russia ball behind the golden E. I. V. a microphone great to have you here [noise] yeah\nWe're going to be discussing them in terms of the media is now flooding the zone with polling data showing that it's hopeless for Republicans just bumped steel yourselves for this this is predictable\nIt was going to happen and they're also going to say that it's all based around Trump it's all based on Trump hatred it's all based on people rip regretting their vote for Trump\nA reading the direction America is going in all of that I just saw it happen on CNN a\nIndependent voter is switching master laser Democrats in the run up to mid term elections and if I were you I\nI hold off on on believing it and as we get closer here I Know there's early voting going on we're going to tackle some of this\nI you know in an added to it in a way I Can't wait until the week before the election for a full court press because of the early voting that that is uh\nThat that's happening out there so\nIt's just it's an ongoing effort to try to dispel people of popular myth that the left bands together or you don't ... I think one of the most effective ways\nOf getting people to think about this how many people have you heard people say this is the most important I'll watch it on our lives and that's why it's not it's just not the most important election of our lives to thousands sixteen was\nIf Hillary had one in two thousand six that that's what we need to focus that the kinds of stuff we need to ask people to consider what would be happening in America right now and the past two years of Hillary had one who would be running\nVarious cabinet posts and agencies what do we know today that we would not know if Hillary had one including names of people and what they've been doing\nIf you hit people between the eyes with what would America be today if Hillary had one\nIt's a different way of getting people to focus on the importance of the election is uh the the the drive by have their formula\nIt's rooted in the desire they habit everybody hate Trump and so that desire becomes narrative and then that narrative becomes the result of polling data\nAnd says the media so hates Trump they want everybody else to therefore the trend is pro Democrat in the mid terms in their polling data because people have a wake up and realize what a mistake they made voted for Trump none of that is true\nExcept on the hard left where it's always been true there's nothing new about it and it's not confined to Trump patronage hatred of everybody to visit them\nLike I say just based on the last two weeks of the Capitol hearing the Democratic party today as constant deserves to lose in the biggest landslide in a history of landslides the Democrat Party deserves to get by\nFor the tactics they have engaged in for the actions\nIt can buy beer lunatic and pay ... supporters\nAre just outrageous the kinds of things that they are engaging in and then the decent world and in a sane society they wouldn't be punished greatly\nIn the midterms I still hold out hope that they could be my point is we will get to all of this as the day is unfold\nIn this weekend in coming weeks but here we go with Donald Trump and Leslie stall on sixty minutes provide providers that are soundbites work I'm not confident now so the only way to know is to give it a shot the first one is Leslie stall\nTalking to Trump about the supposedly the hostility that he has created between the European Union allies and us\nWell I I mean what's ally we have wonderful relationship is a lot of people but we don't teach us much worse than the European Union the European Union on line was formed in order to take advantage of us on trade and that's what they've done is hot and yet they shot hostile sounds hot he always has some of the way they treat us\nWhat somebody can't ... Danley went in one of them in this country for so many years I Am willing to get rid of that western alliance now I like NATO side\nBut you know why we shouldn't be paying almost the entire cost of NATO to protect your and then on top of that they take advantage of us on trade electing a don't any more they understand okay\n[noise] so what once again we have here the concept but it's just so hostile hostility it sounds so hostile it sounds so mean it sounds so it sounds so it's this is confrontational and of course in the eyes of the left we\nWant to be Europe they want us to be Europe they want us to be western\nSocialists they think still functioning at a democracy but\nBut that's that's what they want us so we should be forthcoming and tolerant we should be welcoming we should be in ... ourselves and this by the way this is just Donald Trump keeping a number of promises\nWhich say what you want this guy has kept more promises probably all politicians in the history combined\nFrom Dallas in similar artist now on a dollar eighty hours for I doubt that I\nSaw people are talking about calorie she's like my daughter and a Katy Perry world\nBoston conservative talk\nWill not making\nA minor correction it's a it's a variety in which the effort\nBy Leslie stall this ripped to shreds not Vanity Fair is six foot one and a half dozen varieties not so much a celebrity focused ran against Vanity Fair is a but they are both left wing entertainment oriented and they do comment on left wing entertainers actors\nActresses TV so called journalist and so forth and and it it's just a little minor correction I get them confused occasionally here is just another sample from last night Trump\nAnd Leslie stall\nIs it you know general Madison tails the reason for NATO and the reason for all these alliances is to prevent World War three no it's not true but frankly I like General Mattis I think I Know more about it than he does and I know more about it from the standpoint of fairness that I can tell you finish high one more time\nOkay yeah I Know unless you're not to try it again I Know and my answer is this\nI Will always be there with NATO but\nThey have to pay their way I'm totally in favor of NATO but I don't want to be taken advantage of\nWhite general manager so I think I Know more about it than he does I Know more about it from the standpoint of fairness that I can tell you\nHe's talking about the fairness of do is the fairness of all the NATO members paying their own way he's also talking about people like Angela Merkel making a side deal with Russia and potent for natural gas shipments\nExplosively into Germany ignoring other NATO allies and you'll notice a sixty minutes isn't going to Angela Merkel and asking her\nWhy she is undermining NATO\nTrump already called her out on it for doing this the Trump supposedly in the pockets of the\nOf the Russians but Trump knows what sixty minutes or less missiles trying to do here that's what they don't get\nThey can sneak up on people anymore particularly Trump he knows he in fact you know one thing he says I don't know if we've got at the roster coming up probably do but he said something to her that is as as honest and true is anything he's ever said\nBecause I Know Donald Trump I've known him a long time I played golf and I've known him a long time before he ran for office\nAnd he would ask me about various Democrats asked me about Obama and I can tell that sometimes when I told him what I mean he didn't agree especially when discussions in the media came up\nHe thought I was maybe just a little bit over the top exaggerated in some of the things I Would tell him but my opinions with the media he said to her I had no idea and I'm being really serious with you Leslie I had no idea how dishonest the media is until I ran for president\nI had no idea I being really serious with you he said\nAnd I I think that's probably true as a New Yorker and immersed in New York media where he was a star\nWhen he wasn't running for office it was a local New York's by you know he made fun of him and they laugh but but he was a big get he appeared everywhere and they loved him and he was great front cover back cover of the tabloids the daily news and the post\nWhen he ran for president that's when all of the good vibes about trauma there were some bad things too I mean he didn't get universally loved praised coverage but it all vanished when he ran\nAnd he was surprised in a way kind of like McCain was\n\nSo when he said to her last night I had no idea I really telling you Leslie I'm really shocked that was really surprised\nBy this honest that's the word he uses instead of biased and I can tell you that that's true now what else has he learned that heat\nDidn't know but he knew before he ran for office and I think a lot about the left a lot about Democrats particularly liberal Democrats but he hadn't thought of in ways you an idea but now since he suffered the treatment is full\nRush Limbaugh\nYou ought to be met for\nFolks the IRS does not mess around you know that they have the power to take everything your bank accounts your paycheck even

intersection now to come straight out of Marxism Marx said that at every one is either on a presser or oppressed they're either bourgeois or ...\nAt its later it's now being adopted to the idea of being able to declare ... so what you are how oppressed and how much of an approach where you are it's called intersection nowadays because instead of just being one camp or the other\nGets spread across race gender sexual preference and other variables\nYes okay that's it intersection out will be for me great on wash\nYour you're talking uh you're you're\nSpeaking in language of people formerly educated on Marxism many people aren't that's why it's so successful\nA scanner intersection out I mean actually has basically something that has been constructed by these marches\nJust saying that all of these different leftist organizations Meek somewhere they all intersect with each other the feminist taboo this strain about them that that that I'm\nA cohabitation with that with militant Islam is that then with illegal immigrants and their activist and we're all of these people intersect is where they unified\nYes but it also applies to the individual because of these let's say five different dimensions you you are on a different scale and all of those and\nThey intersect into a single number quantifiable says that this is how much of an oppressor or oppressed you are this is where you're on the scale\nOf course this is the root of all this recent white privilege stuffed ... absolutely\nRight so now Elizabeth Warren because she wants to uh justify her cultural appropriation of a Harvard professor ... has to claim a particular percentage of intersection now or the oppression\nTo speak their language so she is saying that she is an old press she's asked him anyway she's a woman therefore she's impressed by the patriarchy and now as a one thousand twenty fourth Indian she is oppressed by the white man\nWhich is a a again a resurrection of the one drop rule this percentage is so low as to be a joke you know I if I could say I took a DNA test about four years ago and of course you don't normally you'd never see me but believe me I'm whites\nHowever when I discovered was zero point eight percent sub Saharan Africa\nWell that doesn't mean I'm going to Harvard and going to claim a professorship in African American studies but I have what is that almost eight times more a sub Saharan African black heritage and me and she does Native American just\nPray just submitted sub Saharan is not automatically quote unquote black\nWell that that's right in in this instance because we've identified the ancestor for the Afrikaners are not black\nUh I well\nI I I understand what you're saying I Am referring to black skin\nOkay All right I just want to mess up because that sub Saharan this is somebody what are you in sub Saharan what is it what it was it and then you start talking the sub continent and some people really get confused you're jumping from I'm from India\nOr over to sub Saharan Africa is below the Saharan desert a which is where most of the population of Africa is most of it\nThere is some north of this arid desert as well and I get I I I get your point a and her reason for doing this\nAll of that not withstanding the accuracy of it not withstanding the left is pretty upset that she chose this particular time to do this because they think it is totally self serving it does not do anything but distract\nFrom the mid term elections which are three weeks from tomorrow a away and so there are some people who are on the
