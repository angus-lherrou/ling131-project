ago and you didn't have anything to oppose them they're just so you imagine how they feel about this\nThat many they're fools to believe this was real and the first place but they're so damn desperate [noise] uh [noise] one let me I Need to go back I Need to find Sheldon White parent is number nine Sheldon Whitehouse this guy's money this is a Democrat who on friday morning the morning of the vote held up one of the enlarged\nPages of Kavanaugh's ... said that he had figured out how to translate it and the date in ... he figured this could be the date where the incident Dr foreign described happened and he thought to try to translate some of the nicknames and phrases that capital used on his calendar\nOf course in incriminating ways a toward Kavanaugh so\nOn good morning America today George Stephanopoulos of the Clinton war room is talking to Sheldon Whitehouse is a demographic Rhode Island are you satisfied with the scope of the FBI inquiry can they finish this by friday\nI think I'm satisfied we don't know how all the details yet clearly if they have been given free rein to interview marble they won so that's a very good sign the last thing we want as a sham investigation\nI also think that there is a fairly small universe of witnesses here on a very big FBI so yes I think they probably should be able to ah get this done by friday of really\nPut the effort into it now wait a minute [noise] that just makes too much sense that just doesn't fit\nWith Chuck Schumer today on the floor of the Senate who we have grab audio soundbite number eight\nThis is Chuck you he went to the floor right after the turtle did\nAnd basically made the uh the case that\nWe're nowhere near ending this FBI investigation as the turtles that the Schumer and the Democrats are moving the goalposts\nWe are looking at what judge Kavanaugh says at age fifty three not what he did at age Eighteen\nWe're looking at his credibility now is grown adult and if you believe Dr Ford\nJudge Kavanaugh\nNot telling the truth just yesterday NBC News recorded that either judge Kavanaugh people close to the judge Moore in communication with his classmates\nTo get the robot allegations by Deborah Ramirez it seems that judge Kavanaugh was at least very misleading to the Judiciary Committee about ... story\nSo now it's about capital lying if Kavanaugh\nPerjuring yourself and that means he's not quite on what they've got to make up their minds first he's a serial gang rape is\nNow the throws ice on people at a bar Denise negative fall down drunk and now\nHe is a a liar their flailing\nBut Sheldon Whitehouse totally out of character with his majority minority leader in the Senate Chuck Schumer\nYeah are they friday's fight yeah there's not too many people to talk to hear that but you guys got a lot of shore or we can get this done that's just to central maybe White Houses out their\nTruck in the spirit here to be the public face of a reasonable Democrat Party while everybody else stays insane\nBut they are moving the goalposts but\nAnd yes for a delay but they're also trying to move the goalposts as a target where they can catch Kevin ... in anything\nUh there's one more [noise] that I Want to play and I'm looking for it and I just found it I Want you to go to audio soundbite number twelve [noise]\nThe question of who leak Dr Ford's letter to Dianne Feinstein you\nKnow this this is of leaking this letter my memory and this is kind of fuzzy but I remember Feinstein during a press conference or either on the foreigners ... judicial committee or I remember her showing the letter\nHolding it up or talking about it I remember I don't know if that was the week but she clearly talked about it and said that she'd had it since July and that she told us all about\nIt that whoever Senate didn't want to be named and didn't want to go forward and she didn't want to do with it she's holding this thing I don't know what I don't know what to do with us\nI was
