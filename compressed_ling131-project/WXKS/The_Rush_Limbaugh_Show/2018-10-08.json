life professional life or in protest then what are we to do\nAnd here is the brilliant answer from Rebecca Traister\nAre we angry that it has to be white women before we take they started seriously or or I think it's an do we also acknowledge that we need to wake the white women and if their power their products more power can be useful in revealing the degree to which women are still\nOppressed

let me just ask you point blank right since\nYou have talked to was willing to address the issue do you think that this insurgency as you've described it which is this behavior but just we've seen the last two weeks do you think that kind of behavior which was widely\nPublicized Democrats loved it the media loved it they tried to make he rose up for these people they didn't try to hold them back\nWhere they want to disrupt the Senate vote they disrupted the Senate vote when they wanted to get in the halls of the Senate Russell office building they did so\nThey got an elevators they shouted these people now the Democrats have not once called out that activity that never once told outside their side to stand down do you think the American public watching that\nIs going to be turned off by it and want to vote against it or do you think the American public\nDoesn't care one way or the other and doesn't even really notice it\nI think it's largely going to be turned off but like you said they they've completely changed their base now they've given up on the working blue collar class and they're now they're now trying their hand and see if they can somehow\nUm increase the numbers with women on these type of issues but I think largely that that the American people are going to be turned off and\nI I think it's all going to come down to who who was able to get out get out the vote in a month but that had\nWell see my point twenty twenty\nLet me okay this is my I don't think given what we've seen the last two weeks among people in the public who watched it I don't think the Republicans need to do when he got out the vote this was that\nIn my scene and just world the Democrats just succeeded in getting Republican turnout larger than it's ever been for a mid term I Know I'm probably wrong about that but\nThat's how I look at it that's how it ought to be and I'm the king of books titled the way things ought to be it ought to be that people are outraged by then\nIt ought to be that people can't wait to go punish this much ... for the way they have treated this country the past two weeks alone the Republicans ought not have to spend the time getting out the vote based on this but I Know that's not the reality kinda frustrating to me but that's the case [noise]\nDemocrats thinking they're going to have turned out here that dwarfed anything the Republicans have to\nShow up on election ...

people to dwarf whatever Republican turnout there is\n\nAnd they've got new stories predicting that very thing so people are going to be reading it people can be reading Republicans don't have a chance\nYou may replied\nNo I I agree and um I think they energy I think they energize the base and they did exactly what needed to be done and I think they have the issue that you were speaking of a month or so ago\nThat the the event had happened and what twenty nine days but it it happened\nA true yeah I when I when I said the events that were going to shape the midterms hadn't happened uh

Bush and Republicans in memory of Paul Wellstone\n\nRepublican senators who were friends of Wellstone who's doing if we showed up\nAt the arena they did this arena place it holds Fifteen thousand people if my memory serves ten Fifteen thousand people\nIt was some time after ... Muslim died in the plane crash and it was some time after that but this was the official memorial and it was I don't think it was ever intended to be a memorial I think it was a political event from the get go disguised as a memorial\nAnyway Republican senator is not knowing up from dominant I'm Trent Lott into boys all showed up thinking that they were showing up to a memorial\nA religious memorial ... their former colleague Paul Wellstone\nThey worm food and bullied and harassed out of the place within thirty minutes of having a riot but didn't sat down\nIt was identical to what we saw the way Jeff Flake and others were assaulted in elevators MBA hallways of the Senate office building\nExcept this was after memorial and this was a Democrat voters going up to the worthy Republicans receded in getting in their faces and pointing fingers at 'em and Boeing after they thought they were there\nTo participate in a solemn occasion they got up and they walked out and they left\nAnd this memorial turned in to a hate fast a hate fast aimed at George W ... a hate fast aimed at George W Bush's policies they couldn't even set aside what had happened on nine eleven for this memorial\nThis boy all took place about fourteen months after nine eleven\nTook place so then the men terms a curve\nAnd I remember I was invited to the last time this happened I was invited for election coverage on NBC Tim Russert asked me to join him and Tom Brokaw\nI Do to fully accepted and I went and I was not on camera all night maybe four or five times while they they\nCycled other people through and they brought me and after it was clear that the Republicans hadn't gained the seats on heard of\nThe Democrats just like now we're supposed to win big because\nDemocrats told everybody hated Bush everybody of resented the wave of Supreme Court stole the election for Bush\nThat Al Gore had won the popular vote just reach and the the American people felt betrayed by Bush and the Supreme Court and nine eleven and Bush's general stupidity and in confidence\nAnd as such couldn't not wait for the Democrats didn't take back control of what is rightfully theirs Washington DC\nExcept it didn't happen to Republicans gained ... seats\n\nTim Russert was great broke all brought me out and so what do you think happened here I said well stone memorial but Wellstone memorial is what happened and I went on and told them why in a truncated version of what I just said they knew they were shell shocked\nThey were shell shocked is just not in the formula the party in power does not pick up seats\nIn mid term elections the first ones after a new president is elected so that's a formative experience for me and if it's\nI like ... if it's happened once it can happen again something it hasn't happened before probably won't happen buddy of mine has then it can happen again and this is a replay of that except this is a replay of even\nMore outrageous behavior the Wellstone memorial took place on one night the Democrat Party has been insane on display four to four years\nAnd actually longer than that but in the in the context of Trump's election it's been two consistent ears of public the
