I I understand Republican senators saying what they're saying oh my God this is only acceptable or you don't know why president that\nHe did it for some reason\nEverybody's pointing out that the Trump just last week was saying she was very credible yeah he did and we knew when he said that why he said it\nHe had to everybody has to before\nAll this is a investigated and put your but you can't run out there\nAnd start ripping on her even if it deserved even if it's warranted last week you could not read up on Christine ball the board there was nothing there is no upside to doing it no matter if you were right\nEven if she was lying through her teeth and you can demonstrate last week was not the time to do it so Trump joins of course I find a compelling I find her very credible will now\nShe's not so critical she never was but now she's not so credible all kinds of holes in Trump just pointed them out all Trump did is pointing out the flaws in her story which should have happened\nDuring the hearing last Thursday but the Republicans were not going to go there and they were not going to challenge her because it just wasn't\nSmart especially with that voice that she was affecting to go after her in any way that would seem like an attack or like you didn't believe her\nWhether or not been politically useful but in a in a normal to the rational hearing committee hearing\nHer allegations would be challenged in tests that they were not that's all Trump did Trump pointed out the mistakes or the ... orbit differences the prevailing occasions she can't remember where when who the people she says ... says they weren't that's only ...\nRepublican senators should have done that last week but they could\nSo Trump's given uncovered Trump writing shade for them and let them go out and rip him for doing it if they want to understand that\nThis time we have to assume Trump knows what he's doing when he goes off script you doesn't step in it it might look like it but he doesn't but that's not the big takeaway [noise] the big takeaway for me is this\nOne year the New York times has been investigating the trumped for forty years they've got tax returns going back who knows how long\nAnd guess what's not part of the story guess what is not part of any income tax story on Donald Trump guess what one word you do not see in the report anybody want to take a guess\nWhat I often just say no that's not the word what one word is not in this entire New York times story I'll give you a hint\nIt was the sole reason the left I wanted to get their hands on Trump's tax returns\nRussia at ten Ford bad yet\nThey want to Trump's tax returns because their tax returns they said would prove Trump polluted because his money came from Russia because his wealth was be causing due to Russian connections that's what everybody on the left was convinced\nWas true and now here's the New York times story\nYear long investigation Trump's taxes going back more than forty years and they're not able to find any Russian mommy\n\nSo now they didn't find any Russian money and I guarantee you they expected to\nThey're the ones that said this\nThey're the ones that said I'm Talking about everybody on MSNBC CNN and go back a year ago back to the two thousand sixteen campaign when everybody was hell bent on proving\nThat Trump was they put in storage\nTrump was Tony Trump was compromised by Russia because it was Russia that enable Trump to get rich\nAnd his tax returns would prove it they said so I guarantee you when the New York times got these documents for the first thing they did\nWas make up the line key word search however they search it looking for Russia Russia and Russian names answer big fat zilch zero not so now they're on to something else now they're back to what's always been said about\nA bottom line and I know what had happened to a woman for political\nNow what grams point is there's a lot of young people to Saudi answered don't remember the Clinton years in Nineteen Ninety two when James Carville was trying to destroy Paula Jones\nYou never know what you got to do when you got to be able to print it by ... what you want to come up with you but you're not going to you're going to come up by women like that it has not great but it's not a bill\nClinton and that's Hillary Clinton was right and they're trying to help destroy those women and Lindsey Graham was referring that these people in the audience didn't know what they thought he was talking about Ford\nAnd that's when he stopped and said I see that's actually a reference to something somebody said James Carville most of you are too young to remember this\nSo not only do they live in denial but it ever happened now they're trying to shut down anybody who brings it up you know the Clinton years in what they did the women supposed to go down the memory hall\nNow I have a transcript an anti Kevin all protester with confronted and I'm a Republican senator and he pushed back this was an attack or a confrontation walking down the hall\nOr any Kevin all protesters have flooded Capitol Hill and they don't want them to get into the hallways of the offices in Senate office buildings how does that happen\nBut what we all know that what happens but they're they're\nOne of these protesters approached Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana on his way through a Senate building walkway Monday\nAnd she said why are you supporting Kevin up where are you supporting capital Cassidy did not ignore her he took the chance to push back he asked her if she would like it if her loved ones were destroyed by uncorroborated churches\nCassidy why wouldn't I support Kavanaugh protester because rapist or bad Cassidy wait a second everybody there said it didn't happen\nRape anybody so why am I gonna so you're going to you're going to believe mark judge over a woman no I'm going to believe her best friend\nWho says it didn't happen she wasn't there\nHer best friend didn't say didn't happen her best friend said she wasn't told about it her best friend said she didn't remember it protester so you're okay as a doctor to harm a woman Cassidy\nWait a second you okay as a person to go ahead and do accept the non corroborated charge to destroy somebody's life\nIf you destroy your wife your son's life or your husband's wait a second answer my question if it was your husband your son your father whose life has been destroyed by uncorroborated would you like that\nProtester I Would support a full FBI investigation we're dealing with appropriate robots I'm Glad Cassidy pushed back but it's a lost cause on the protester the protesters not even hearing what he says she's got program dancers bought and paid for by George Soros\nAnd she hears key words in what he says knee jerk reaction causing things replies accordingly\nCastle you know would you like and on corroborated charged destroy I wouldn't marry somebody that was a drunk said the protester\nHold on wait a minute uncorroborated answer the question I don't think you're able to because you know it's unfair protester I Would stand up ... you know it's unfair protester I Would fight it would make sure women or heard clearly you're okay for rapist goes on the Supreme Court castle you know I'm not\nBut then on the other hand clearly you're okay the absence of evidence obviously means nothing view protesters no there is evidence look at the standard how many people are in jail for ...\nSo what this ... unless somebody like me gets hold of a transcript something like this and help people understand if it's a total waste of time to engage these protesters especially if you're trying to persuade them you can't persuade them I just like you can't persuade the media\n[noise] you know I'm I've told this story when I was first at this\nVery young wet behind the ears naive and the media wouldn't want to talk I thought there too they're really interested I didn't know nobody's ever heard of me a radio shows taken off I thought they were legitimately curious and that's how I went into early interviews I found out that not at all they were

Rachel Mitchell ask her some questions which now turned out to be brilliant by the time\nWe were all kind of curious what what's the purpose was um all\nTrump this is reminding everybody what she said she doesn't she doesn't know the people she says we're there say they weren't there\n\nThis is not mocking her and this is a sign of what really goes wrong in this country can accuse her comes forward and you can poke holes in obvious places\nYou can't point out obvious discrepancies you cannot reference or make mention\nOf the differences in her story from depending on the day she's telling it whatever it is it is it is not mocking Kristin balls the Ford\nNow Trump has a lot of people saying well this is crazy rush because last week Trump was saying that she was credible and her testimony

makes people kind of caught their head they don't think Trump can be that's fair I'm Talking about the meeting on the left Democrats they don't think Trump can be that that's a reasonable\nBut he does it to them every time it gives them the credibility later to be\nCritical and the step away he said yeah I found a credible I've found are compelling then as we learn more and then there's events play out Trump is able to parlay his original statements into what he really thinks based on\nWhat is not a knee jerk reaction if Trump were to heaven sent initially what he said last night at the rally why there would have been held up pay but now he can back it up now there's all kinds of evidence that her timeline doesn't make any sense\nWe've got an ex boyfriend claiming she is a polygraph expert and has taught people how to beat them\nWe have people challenging her account we didn't have that last week it is perfectly fine for Trump\nTo do what he did it gives him a credibility later to be critical of the step away it's a common technique you use as he does it on everything\nIt's why I've always told you don't take his first draft statement or his first tweet as a sign that he's caving or flipping you people you I'm sure you remember there haven't been many instances in fact I may have fallen for one myself that's how I learned that\nTrump will tweet something or say something it'll make you look like he's about late ... before he pulled out of the Paris climate accord\nWhat did he say climate change very serious thing to do with a look at it than we are looking at it than moving to the right\nTo oh so he's on record as being open about then later on when he's learned when he needs to learn comes out tells you what do you think's really thinks\nIt's a pattern it's a technique\nIt paid trumped developed I don't even know if he developed or it's just how he does it naturally and instinctively\nBut I call it pacing now Republicans have not built up this reputation\nSenate Republicans having Trump has Trump has a stab wished that after he makes that initial statement on something if he can make fun of things\nAnd what really irritates ... he gets away with it I cannot tell you how it irritates them to he shouldn't have survived the Access Hollywood video he shouldn't have survived anything they've thrown at him the fact that he has ... continue to prosper and triumph I cannot tell you how the lions Lee insane it has made them with rage\nOther Republicans have not developed the golden adds to do this\nAnd pull it off\nTrump has been attacked so much we're now if you go back to two thousand Fifteen when this campaign started this is two thousand they did was three years\n\nIn fact it's it's it's three years in three months Trump gets in in June of two thousand Fifteen Trump has been attacked so much he doesn't care anymore\nIt doesn't bother him anymore is my point he's not willing to take the arrows he's willing to take the hits for everybody else that's why he is needed folks he is willing to do what he did last night I Know\nMurkowski in Collins or shorter ringing cowering in the corner with the vapors\nOh my God it was horrible it was still it was a horrible everything he said is true\nIt was not mocking her the actress\nVideo audio we played mocked mostly for Trump didn't\nHe just simply boy she she can't backup she cannot corroborate there isn't any cooperation for what she said why is that not relevant why does that not matter\nWhy have we gotten to a point where any woman can come forward and accuse any man of anything and it's gospel\nAnd then be joined by a so called movement called me to wear all women can join ... can you imagine if there was something going on they can you imagine a man organized\nFor the express purpose of destroying women\nYou can't even imagine it can you\nYou can't even imagine the organized movement the male version of me too\n\nWell rush or a million women or nor do there should we be well\n... yeah that does happen but that's not the point this is not about even Bannon set it this is not just about sexual abuse this is about Raul power this is about female rage\nBecause of things that have happened to them the leftist women\nAnd they have organized all of these disorders into a giant political movement I'm just asking you to think can you ever can you envision\nA movement of men if if such a group existed\nAnd Oprah Winfrey had invited the leader on her show he'd been thrown off and the first ten minutes and they've been ridiculed and made fun of for the rest of his life it could not happen\n\nWomen are a minority and supposedly even though they're not uh in numbers\nBut it's so out of balance all Trump did\nWas say what everybody following this knows even the Democrats the Democrats know all kinds of holes in her story\n\nThe Trump doing what he's doing provides a lot to cover for a lot of people as one of the many reasons why he's needed Trump said guilty until proven innocent that's very dangerous\nWay fighting for these calls for ... to ... ... what can the chemical to find the maximum you can get some problem\nHang on

mean not work for your ear is the IRS the James moved up to the gym and\nGuarantee quote from a National Review um\nThe more time I spent covering politics the more I'm convinced that a significant chunk a grass roots political activist or not really arguing about politics at all\nThese people are actually struggling with personal psychological issues and projecting them onto the world of politics bingo I've been searching for that description for years I have no problem admitting that I was unable to put this together\nIt's one of the rare moments I was unable to this is exactly right\nWe're dealing with people who have suffered some kinds of psychological disorder they've turned to politics\nFor the solution or the ribs Ben is actually what they're looking for and they don't just want revenge against who ever did whatever to them they are now demanding that every representative of the group that that are the individual that did something could\nBe made to pay a price for it that's what the ... this this uh ... well\nThe me too movement in large part was never bipartisan it was thought to be said to be but it never was\nA and even if it if you okay even if it was it's been co opted by the Democrat Party look at look at the uh [noise] Occupy Wall street move but look at black lives matter or to take any left wing group that you want it's made up of people\nWho for some reason I think they have been unjustly mistreated by somebody and instead of dealing with that in their lives they enter politics and they demand that the Democratic party take up the cause of the Democratic party willingly has the Democratic party has become the party\nOf all of these disparate constituency groups\nWith their singular causes because the Democratic party realizes that they can combine all of these things into a singular assault on the concept of America that America is responsible for what happened to these people\nThey capitalism is responsible that the power structure that the founding is responsible\nAnd so people with psychological disorders are being granted the status of normalcy\nAnd then the big donors come along and under write them and fund their efforts and they become political movements\nAnd then they become victims and then of course allows them to blame everybody for what has gone wrong in their lives and then they demand reciprocity or revenge or what have you and I can tend to you that most people in our side have no idea how to deal with this\nNo idea whatsoever so we ended up in debates about whether\nBoys\nTo pretend to be girls so they can go on the girls' bathrooms and becomes legitimate\nAt ... ... in in many not that specifically but just the whole concept of what is happening here and it is a violent bullying intimidating\nMovement that has been constructed to push all of these disparate various agendas and the target is American\nThe target is America is founded the target is American Capitalism and so when our caller says that Kavanaugh is simply a stand in for men who have abused every woman out there he's right\nBalls the Ford will end up being supported by other women who have been abused whether she's telling the truth or not it doesn't matter\nBecause it did happen to them these women we do know that are out there watching as it did happen to them and by God somebody's going to pay for it in this case will be capital that's how they're going to be heard\nRather than just deal with the specific incident that happened to them it's the same thing I think with black lives matter or the NFL players kneeling for the anthem a all cops are bad every white cop is a rate every black convict is in is\nIn every instance here points to the country at large as being responsible in unfairness in bias in discrimination in racism all of this\nThe Democratic party is the organizing party the collection agency for all of these complaints\nDemocrat parties happy to make victims out of anybody who wants to be one and Democrat Party is happy to promise to these people that they'll fix it and they never do they never the rage Jimmy angered never ends it only gets worse because the Democrats don't fix anything and finally\nIt doesn't even depend on being fixed it just means somebody's got to pay in this case capital he's got to pay\nWhether he did it or not now\nSarah Sanders White House press briefing is going on she just lay the end of the press and she said exactly\nWhat I said if I don't mind saying so she said Trump didn't mock anybody last night he simply recites did the facts\nAnd he said all of this can be laid at the feet of the Democrats they are to blame for this none of this needed to have happened in public they had ... forge email or in a letter ... way back in July they could have done everything that's been done to investigate her claim\nOff record behind the scenes nobody knowing about it but they didn't do that they waited to use it as a Hail Mary\n\nShe dispute the idea that Trump mocks she said all he was doing was reciting the facts here it is again this is what the press the media everybody is out now ripping Trump claiming that he mocked Christine ...\nOf attacks from Trump trumped an attack anybody told everybody who the guy\nAnd here is Sarah Sanders from the press briefing just now exactly as I said she got a question from John Roberts and\nIt was all about do you think that maybe the president for the other marking her like that because he gets Collins and Murkowski it'd be the way they bowed means or what do you think the president for maybe should have not done it\nThe president was dating the facts and frankly facts that were included in special prosecutor Rachel Mitchell's report he was dating facts that were given during Dr ... testimony innocent it has to make a decision based on those facts\nAnd whether or not they see judge Kavanaugh to be qualified to hold the position on the Supreme Court every single word judge Kavanaugh has said it's been picked apart every single word second by second of his testimony has been picked apart yet if anybody says anything about\nThe accusations that have been thrown against them that's totally off limits and outrageous\nExactly right ya can't challenge her so Trump did for\nEverybody else who doesn't have to go ... to\nDo it Trump did it in yeah he's providing a little shade for some of these people hide under [noise] and I'll guarantee they may be publicly saying I Wish he hadn't done a Dutch outrageous what prompted their thinking everybody did it privately somebody has to say it\nIt's the freaking truth\nOkay I'll back to the phones and we go to Tom's river New Jersey ... is next and he is Fifteen Years old I'm ... I'm Glad you waited you're next on the program thank you for calling\nHey rushed great to speak to you again a right to have your back you\nGreat to be on again anyways so I'm watching this whole thing on me too movement watching the Kavanaugh hearings I'm I'm Fifteen I'm just regular straight guy\nThat's into normal but I think that I really cannot believe any of these women that pop up on TV anymore you can't believe any of them were coming old guy raped me the guy did this to me did that to me you know you had to draw on CNN while you're like a couple of months ago saying that a guy raped or because he asked her for her phone number [noise]\nCan't believe any of them and I think that what this this whole me\nTo kind of white ... ... ... ... that that is my exact point I Believe that woman\nI Believe she thinks she was raped when somebody asked her for her number that's how she's been conditioned\nWomen's studies on campus the the outright hatred for men you know I keep talking about it\nBut it's relevant Catherine McKenna and this was back in the nineties she was a professor of women's studies at Michigan She taught women in her class the oral sex is rape even the sex of marriage the women were lapping up and women have been taught for two generations now that men are basically predators and that their own kids are not safe from their fathers\nAnd it's not random it's widespread it is part and parcel of higher education today so\nYou have a woman and she could be acting I mean she could be making this up could be a political activist but it's entirely possible at the same time for him that the cause of what she's been taught\nAnd heard on the news and talking to her she may literally believe that memory I have no right to ask her phone number is the same thing is bullying her raping her\nThat's my point she may really believed it\nGoes well rush of you know the same woman that are screaming about how they've been raped or off the ones who want to have the right to having abortions it so they could have unlimited sex\nOr have you\nEver um [noise] uh you're right sex without consequences but you better not\nBut then they claimed that all men are predators but then they run to run hook up and and they want to have abortions for free\nWhen it's their idea then everything's fine you\nKnow look up at a ride by the way here's this ... you're\nAlso random it's not all women but it's been made to look like that isn't it\nThe me too movement supposedly include all women women on across America who do not think this way are being lumped into this movement against their will it's just an assumption that the Democrats and the drive\nBy media or making I think every time you're young you're growing up I think you're going to be OK finding a woman but you got to be real careful about it just gets written permission for every move you might get notarized after the date\nAnd your listeners do Rush Limbaugh big voice on the right ...\nThe backyard looking great Rob thanks man I was planning on adding a duck to no one could contractors why don't you just ask ... advisor\nHome what home advisor dot com you just tell them about your project match you with local pros that can do the job nice now how much does it cost ... home advisors totally free to use plus you can read customer reviews Chuck pricing and book appointments\nFor free what's the website again home advisor dot com or just download to bring home advisor at [noise]\nDoes your dog itch scratch tinker shed like crazy come to die to buy for help order Ninety Days supply of dynamite pick up two bottles of liquor jobs get the third bottle free\nNew improved liquor jobs for the mega six omega three vitamin E. and now it's six extra directed microbial even better for the digestive tract and immune system and dog loved try look all jobs by to get one free this is Heather Luke exotic for die by\nAn L.

B. I. D. O. J. people that were doing this\nAnd I think the objective of Christine balls before this whole thing not her specifically but I look I think she's an activist in on it but that's neither here nor there the objective of this was to get capital to withdraw his nomination\nOr to have Trump pull it\nNow that that hasn't happened this case is beginning to collapse you see stories all over the media but how all this so called evidence just isn't there\nThey thought that the mere allegation that that Kevin I Would not sit there and let his life to be destroyed like this they fought Trump wouldn't sit there\nAnd let his nominee need be destroyed like that because they think Trump's ego is such that he will not be allowed to be made to look bad because of what somebody else did or didn't do so they fought there would be a giant cave on this and there hasn't been so now it is panic and scramble time\nSo the zero in on flake\nAnd Trump couldn't hold it in any more last night at the rally he just on ... on the fact that Christine Ford doesn't have any evidence is changing her story\nAnd the media is all over the place now saying well you know there's just many screwed it the Murkowski and Collins they both think that Trump was horrible and they both now might not vote for Kavanaugh\nOkay\nWell ladies and gentleman I told you some things yesterday but I'm sure people have forgotten but there are no different today than they were yesterday\nDemocrats senators in red states are in heat being ... reelection trouble in\nFact there was news yesterday polling data late polling that we may be looking at a red wave and the Senate\nNot a blue wave in North Dakota which Trump carried by thirty six points Heidi Heitkamp is in deep doo doo after having come out against capital of the latest poll\nTaken after the Democrats began smearing Kavanaugh but before the committee fiasco last week showed that Kevin Cramer to Republican opponent the high camp has opened a ten point lead\nOver hype camp\nJoe Donnelly in Indiana is similarly nervous Claire McCaskill in Missouri is losing their her challenger\nJosh Hawley Joe Manchin of West Virginia they've all been hoping that McConnell when women out\nOr that some Republican senators wouldn't wimp out and not vote for Kavanaugh so that they would be off the hook and not have to\nKnow the words these free Heitkamp Donnelly my cat what's actually for Donnelly McCaskill mansion in Heitkamp have all been hoping that Collins caves that maybe even McConnell would cave and that Murkowski would cave and that flake will continue to flake and cave\n\nBut in their states there's hell to pay in their states people want Kavanaugh confirmed in fact in North Dakota voters back Kavanaugh's sixty to twenty seven\nPolling has been gun heading the wrong way for Heidi Heitkamp so my point is it may not it may not matters or matter what happens to Collins and Murkowski\nBut if they if they actually don't vote for Kavanaugh simply based on what
