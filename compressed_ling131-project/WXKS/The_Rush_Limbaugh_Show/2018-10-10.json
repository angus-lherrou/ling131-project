west side\nAnd then it gets a little lighter there's some great\nThen ... then then right ... and then he yellow and then can and then orange and green and blue on\nThe edges out these colors do not represent rain and intensity they represent cloud tops they represent the temperatures at the cloud tops which determines condensation and can determine the intensity of rainfall but\nMost people watching this have no idea they think\nOh my God look at that may look it must be raining a hundred miles an hour a look at that's black black right around and looking at dark right it's\nDesigned to scare you is designed to get your attention it's cloud top temperatures but my point is it solve all around the world the looks like the most intense area of this is due west of the eye wall which is where\nThe population centers are based on where the eye wall looks like it's going to hit now but even on the east side eastern northeast squadrons are where the strongest winds are\nAnd those are going to be blowing offshore toward offshore once they hit land on the north eastern side of the I Will but it's a solid eye wall and it's a large wall\nSo it's it's it's a very very intense storm and

fact they're going to be running the world in three weeks I'm finding a lot of evidence in security for example I have a story here what is this was in the hill dot com and it's a column by somebody named Brent Butowsky\nWho sounds like the captain of a bowling team ... says he thinks this guy was a legislative aide to who who do you think\nThis guy worked for the lord mention a a former senator

typing personal endorsements for democratic candidates for the house and\nSenate\nThis column is a code red alert I'm reading from it by the way\nThis column is a code red alert to Democrats or the call to arms\nAre the most popular in the respect the Democrats with America such as Michelle my bell Obama do leading the charge for all hands on deck at a critical moment for America and democracy\nIn my view writes Butowsky there is a twenty five percent chance of Democrats and the mid terms with the nightmare scenario what twenty five percent chance of a nightmare wife what you guys had it all locked up\nI thought you're pretty much had the house already done well she's already\nTalking about being speaker you guys are already planning to impeach investigate cabin on and Trump or versus my so\nNow there's a twenty five percent chance that Democrats\nAnd the midterms in a nightmare scenario\nThat's that's not quite the same\nAs a Ninety three percent chance Hillary wins the presidency at ... pm on election night\n... ... why are these people panicking\nMr Butowsky says this is not a moment for complacency or easy talk of blue waves it's a moment for ball the maximum action and turnout based on a powerful look urgent sense of opportunity in danger\nSays it's possible the Democrats win the house by a significant number of seats how ever it is also possible Democrats again only ... seats falling short of winning control that would leave the Republicans nominate\nWith a smaller but even more right wing majority of the leading losers\nIn the house midterms are comparatively moderate GOP house members Democrats could lose one or two Senate seats continuing Republican Senate does even further to the right and even more partisan than the GOP majority today\nBowed ... says it's a ... in this nightmare scenario for Democrats and America if it unfolds a vindictive and triumphant\nTrump having won a victory for the politics of hatred and fear and don't show up [noise]\nYou people on the Web don't understand unity when you see it you don't understand love when you see it you'd do not understand confidence when you see it you'll see love you see hatred\nUC excitement you think you'll see fear when you see\nThousands and thousands and thousands trying to get into Trump rallies you somehow see division\n\nOf vindictive and triumphant Trump will stand alongside Republican leaders of the new Congress feeling he's achieved but unstoppable dominance\nOver his party our country in every branch of government with all checks and balances destroyed this code red alert right to vote ... warns about the danger up so much unchecked power concentrated in the hands of a president who tried to criminalize his opponent [noise]\nMy point is again do\nNot fall for any of this hype that it is over and that the Republicans have no prayer and that there's going to be this gigantic blue wave because not even the Democrats in their private selves when they talk to each other in private and not even they really believe that\nThey want you to think they do they want you to be dispiriting hand or depressed\nThey are very alarmed in fact that the latest polls that show the cabinet effect on the Republican side is ... up the turnout ... up interest\nAnd they're really flux and ticked off at a bunch of polling data\nThere is an NPR poll out there there was a Fox News pull a couple of others but show some bourbon Republican women are saying in polling\nData that they have veil renewed interest and increased energy and intense desire to go vote this is not what we're supposed\nTo happen that's why all of these attacks lately in leftist media ripping in two white\nConservative suburban women and do we need them or not and we don't they say so this is not as we sit here today this is not developing as they want you to think it is\n\nBack in two thousand sixteen as you remember any pieces before the presidential race\nAnywhere in democratic media warning people hey hey you know what there is a nightmare scenario here where Trump good when you got a diamond back we've got to be very careful you remember any of that\nThere was none they were so solid sure they were definitely of of\nUh convinced that they weren't going to win every Hillary was going to win and the biggest landslide\n\nI mean they had Trump's chances three percent seven percent ten percent but nobody gave Trump a chance in fact some of the news even said Trump never thought he was going to win\nTrump never even wanted to win Trump was the most surprised guy in election night in the world when he won he didn't want to when they were all the press the Trump andme quarters that's what they want you to\nBelieve\nNow they've started out saying the same thing is no power is a birthright that every American realizes that Democrats have to be put back in power\nEvery American ... says the mistaken voted for Trump every Trump voter can't wait to apologize every Trump voter realizes embarrassed wants to fix the mistake can't wait to vote for the next Democrat on their ballot\nNow all of a sudden it's not just Butowsky by the way either there are others\nWho are raising red flags out there that this might not be developing\nAs they wish also from Fox News the homeland security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said yesterday that the Chinese coms are engaged in an unprecedented influence campaign leading up to the midterms\nThis is the Trump administration's latest warning that the ... are attempting to sway American opinion I head of the elections\nSort of a ... watt swim [noise]\nChai comes want the Democrats to win ... why do you think that is why why would a bunch of international communist dictators want the Democrat Party to win and they're trying to counter not our friends at trying calms want American leadership they can easily manipulate and triumph over\nThe ... don't want any part of Trump Donald Trump this this new trade deal getting rid of NAFTA you know what this has done\nThis has put China back on its heels\nLike nobody fought Donald Trump the United states now controls access\nTo Mexico and uh all of North America United States and Canada you've got to go through us you gotta make deals with us if you want to export you're going into Mexico Canada United States because Trump put together this new deal getting rid of NAFTA made the new deal the child comes never thought this was going to happen\n\nThey don't want Trump they don't want any more if Trump they would be eager for whoever the Democrats

floodgates to immigration I Need to remind everybody again from about Nineteen Twenty one and Nineteen twenty three through Nineteen sixty five we shut down immigration I Would not does eat row\nBut we put very strict limits on it and the reason was to be able to assimilate all of the immigrants that come into the country\nThe late Eighteen hundreds through the Nineteen early twenties assimilation was key to American immigration policy arriving\nImmigrants all wanted to be citizens by the way and there were things they had to do to become citizens they had to learn a language and they had to learn the history of America they had to be able to pass questions about the history of America on a test\nAnd they had to swear and plan their loyalty and devotion to the United states and they were eager to do it and they were happy to do it now they they maintain their ethnicity\n\nThe Irish the Italians unit but they wanted to become Americans and they did and it took a number of years to assimilate them all\nWell Nineteen sixty five is when Ted Kennedy who led the charge to reopen the immigration floodgates which then of course when to once that happened illegal immigration ramped up in an uncontrollable way\nAnd\nThat wave of immigrants starting in Nineteen sixty five came from third world socialist countries the Democrats\nRealized they could only when the White House

image and integrity of the court and that troubles me greatly Christie on and on for it saddens me because our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitutional to the F\nThe judicial system has been viewed by you as he lectured insurance the judicial system has been viewed by you and Mrs Clinton's the rest of the Democrats as your private refuge\nYou have looked at the court as a place you can stock like minded the leftist activists\nTo make sure things that you believe in which never could pass legislation somehow become law in America\nThat's why they want the courts if you want to really get frustrated you heard me say this and you probably heard a lot of other people but stop and think about this outside of Obamacare practically every liberal ...\nThe steak every liberal idea and belief that now is the law in this country would not have become law in Congress because it never would have passed liberalism and the Democratic party's ideas have never been mass popular the only way\nThat we have bastard ice pop culture the laws of the reality today is because Democrats activists judges have been essentially writing law when they take cases and

nearby we have thousands of people going tonight and they've already many they're already\nKnow a lot of people I just got some emails from this stuff happened you know you're falling for Russia just proves what a suck up you are Trump's not doing this for any other reason that he just he wants to brag he's just doing this for PR\nNo friends you may think that and I'm not going to try to just to ... but the president's doing this because if he didn't\nCan you imagine the stories that would be published Trump doesn't care Trump didn't convened a meeting Trump didn't ask very many questions Trump didn't seem curious Trump doesn't seem to have any real interest in ... doesn't have a home they're all this kind of stuff that they would say about him\nHe does this for a host of reasons but most importantly I Believe\nDonald Trump likes himself and he's very proud of the job he's doing and he wants to be able to see it and he knows that the primary conveyor is of information in this country do not convey proper information about him as his only smart here's here's Kennan Oklahoma City we're back to the phones great to have your er Hi\nHey it's great to be on Russia I'm not only argue el rush but but you are the lead voice of the mainstream media you should have the best stepping on gas\nOr should have the ... app and pop [laughter] hey my point is a today a\nWith Hillary's comments that are basically liberals don't need to be civil to conservatives anymore it reminded me\nOf a profound quote I came across years ago and maybe even you set it ah but here's the quote a society is either moving toward civility for Barbara ... and I see Trump trying to apply civil law and order to our society\nAnd it's apparent that the liberal left his embrace the barbarism again\nJust wanted to get your thoughts are so the but the question is do I do I agree that uh our society has always trending toward\nA barber is what what ...\n...\nWere trending one way or not in the middle of the ... eater trending towards the middle of the barbarism and half the clocks\nAnd the oh it's a constant blocks and so what what what what is your question more Trump isn't it well\nIt seems as if uh the Republican conservatives are taking the side of civility and working uh you know towards law and order or restoring it and it seems like the Democrats have just outright embraced barbarism\nDry ... with all of their a character assassination attempts on Trump Kavanaugh anti a violent shooting\nThere's no there's no question about that it's an active choice I mean Hillary Clinton's endorsing it\nYeah absolutely and uh it's it's sad to see because this is not the Democrat Party of my uh mother and father and I remember so well you know the conservatism here in Oklahoma where I live uh in fact most of the states\nWell let me ask you this was the Democrat Party the Democratic party girl what was it when that was all gotten fine and dandy one more thing that\nI think it was before the Nineteen forties\nNot all one word or whatnot went what were they what were they like when the Democrats were the Democrat Party over your dad or your grandpa what they want but they're doing\nWell um the Democrats at at that time the basic uh\nWas a labor laws and um when you know for what purpose\nMy part of the Democratic party hasn't changed that much is my point the Democratic party has always been rooted\nIn the modern era in our lifetimes of this century and the previous at the Democratic party has been rooted in\nAnti capitalism has been rooted in pro socialism in big government they've just now a band\nAny pretense of moderation about that and have gone all in on militant and violent socialism to achieve their means my boy they're not that different there just mess getting less today\nHere if you know read about it in the paper tomorrow ... be met worker\nHey I'm Brandt so there's this guy didn't Jordan either healthy guy he's a dad of

is that that not as many people are seeing them and and the last night this is such a contrast I have to tell your folks and I this is the kind of thing that you just if you have any observation will powers at all\nYou can't miss this these people at Trump rallies they are not violent\nThey are not threatening their not intimidating and and then they're not dangerous and they don't make anybody feel in danger or threatened these are people have a great time\nThese are people that are a beep and happy they are excited to be where they are\nThey are part of something that matters a great way to them\nThey want to be involved and they are the contrast to the the makeup of people and their behavior a Trump rally and your average ordinary Democrat protest is Dr King\nYou contrast the people

you do have some happy\nPeople in the Democrats sponsors of an audience isn't gonna last long because the Democrat on stage is going to get mad and outraged and get everybody else ticked off\n\nAnd I

there are left wing stories defining the word mob\nBoss or on dictionaries in a wicked PTO and trying to make the case that it's Republican crowds that are the mob and not Democrats they're really a bunch of Democrats elected Democrats aren't just in didn't end up and did that Trump is daring that call their supporters a mob\n[noise] they're just they're so used to having it throw in the right

Ronan Farrow reported on Deborah Ramirez on corroborated\nAllegations of misconduct by Kavanaugh out of eagerness to show a pattern up such behavior\nMayor told Elle magazine and her recollection of the Thomas hearings is J's yeah so having watched this before I knew the key issues would be whether the judge had a pattern of similar behaviors since that helps to stab me she was telling the truth when there's a standoff\nThere wasn't a pattern this is amazing\nShe ran uncorroborated story to illustrate a pattern\nI I'm almost speechless\nIn my attempt to explain this the first story that was Ron about Deborah Ramirez nobody could corroborate her story kept changing there was no evidence for it the New York times found that so bad that they wouldn't they wouldn't allude to it much less reprint aspects of it\nAnd so Jane Mayer and Ronan Farrow run a second story that isn't true just stand Bush a pattern in other words we're going to lie twice we're going to run a false story first that has no backup and then we're going to run a second story to show a pattern\nBecause I remember that with Clarence Thomas other women came forward it showed a pattern and it helped us persuade people at Thomas was guilty and so we wanted to show a pattern of behavior with Kavanaugh a pattern\nA beat you couldn't even substantiate uh single allegation we get from Boise Ford or be it for Ramirez or from Amman ... client\nWas her name sweat Nick I mean this is a flat\nOut admitting yeah we made up a second story well than use those words but we wanted to show a pattern so essentially they're saying we believe we can convince people that something happened just by writing a story alleging it\nAnd of course their buddies in the left will gladly accept an allegation is fact and an act on it yeah we needed to show a pattern here is that Chris Smith of Ohio your next I'm graduated high\nHigh right very very cool to talk to you thank you um so\nI was just wondering I was concerned and mine to get your thoughts you mentioned that fun of it yesterday but with this novel as it is and let's Hillary claiming that they're partying neatness civility right now I'm\nI just get worried with the mom and they left and the ... and then fattening or if things begin to help people\nUm it just has native worried about provoking violence um you know to the point where we don't do anything wrong fire but Trump stickers in our yard on our cars\nBecause we truly are the silent majority we're not out there showing it I mean I've been to rally but um it hasn't really scared and worried because you know living my day each day", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "city": "Newton", "day": "10"}
