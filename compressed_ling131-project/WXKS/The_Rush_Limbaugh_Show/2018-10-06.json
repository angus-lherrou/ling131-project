rose garden from Dr by me the I Would jump it but the things I Want to get to hear\nA and I can just as easily relate what the president said he just laying the Democrats out he was laying them out for the lying trickster present skunks that they are he is linking the media to the Democrat Party\nWhich uh\nWe do with all the time I hear but uh you don't really hear the president or make it that direct about me as\nHe has just if Mr rated the credibility of all of these accusing Democrats Cory ... book or to Richard Blumenthal the NIH and finds that uh what do you live with Feinstein\nIf you'll recall toward the tail end of the hearing on friday before the vote came\nSomebody raised the question of how the world that Christine ... forge a letter to Dianne Feinstein week\nBecause it was it we're\nMade to understand that the letter said that she didn't want anybody to know her name and she didn't want to come forward yet the woman had written the Washington\nPost she called the Washington Post tip line the New York times she has an op ed published in the Washington Post but all along we're told she don't want to go public\nSo people were trying to claim you know for all this talk about what Kevin O's none of this poor woman it's the Democrat Party and the Democrats on this committee that have put her for a busy you most a note ringer\nIt's fair it starts button light and it became\nObvious that there could be only three sources for the week because the limited possession of low water one would be Senator Feinstein end or her staff\nThe other would have to be somebody in the media or the lawyers for Christine ... for a new it's seen the letter\nAnd so some senators began to say that it could well be Senator Feinstein and she sat there and filmed while this was happening and I was all the other possibilities were mentioned she eventually ask her point of order\nThe German Grassley and and said a German wrestling I I Need to react I Need to respond to this outrageous allegations that I or my staff have lead\nThis letter or just for the record I just asked my staff I just asked my staff at any of them liquor and they have a short me that they did\n\nBut what we saw when she was she turned around to her staff sitting behind her\nAnd she starts now that we can't hear what she said 'cause it's off Mike but she's obviously asking them did anybody here to leak it she turns or did you look at the you'd look at ... she turns back to the camera\nA minute like Mr German we didn't Lincoln and Trump made fun of this and mocked it in his West Virginia appearance on Saturday Night\nBy say always this how we're going to determine who leak something she gets to turn to her staff and asked them and they deny it and that meanwhile Kavanaugh sits over here and has to undergo his seventh FBI background check\nHis accuser has no collaboration and no evidence and he's presumed to have done it\nAnd Dianne Feinstein gets to turn around and ask her staff hey did any of you read this letter and nice loan nor nor was it was with us she turns back around so we we didn't do it unless the German as though case closed it wasn't us they had done it\nIt was strategic just like what happened on friday was\nThe teaching strategic ladies and gentlemen I became aware yesterday\nOf a transcript\nOf a conference call that have occurred last week among and between Democrat activists who were planning exactly what happened on friday it's laid out in this thing now unfortunately I Can't reproduce this and put it at Rush Limbaugh dot com because I don't legally\nHabit but I've got it\nI'm not going to mention any names but the names of the Democratic front groups and organizations are here and the strategies that they use and it makes it\nCrystal clear that they were going to target Jeff Flake that he was seen as the most malleable and the easiest to intimidate the elevator\nIncident where it just happens that\nTo nearly insane anti Kavanaugh pro democratic activists ended up there in flakes elevator with us CNN camera right there to catch what happened and they started shouting and they started accusing and they started pointing fingers he got scared to death\nHe was all part of the strategy to turn him\nAnd it was ... there were there was a three point strategies a flake strategy was number three if the other two had bombed out\nAnd they made it they pulled it off they did it\nJohn Fund has that piece today at National Review who was behind the flakes set up\nAcorns tactics live on and the senators elevator confrontation with activists from George Soros backed group on friday morning two women raced past reporters and security officers and block the senators on the elevator and the capital\nThey cornered Jeff Flake who

for word\nMocking would have been to impersonator he didn't do that see this is what's wrong Donald Trump simply voiced what no Republican senator would have\nThese are the questions she should have been asked last Thursday by Republican senators heard timeline should have been challenged her allegations should have been challenged but they weren't the Democrats weren't going to the Democrats announced her and stayed at her\nTo be credible she's above and beyond reproach you cannot challenger she is the accuser so the Republicans they they they they\nPlayed right along in without having ritual Mitchell ask her some questions which now turned out to be brilliant but at the time\nWe were all kind of curious what what's the purpose was a\nAll Trump is doing is reminding everybody\nWhat she said she doesn't know she doesn't know the people she says we're there say they weren't there this is not mocking her and this is a sign of what really is wrong in this country and accuser comes forward and you can poke holes in\nObvious places you can't point out obvious discrepancies you cannot reference or make mention of the\nDifferences in her story from depending on the day she's telling it\nWhatever it is it is it is not mocking\nKristin balls the Ford now\nTrump has a lot of people saying well this is crazy rush because last week Trump was saying that she was credible and her testimony was compelling\nI have explained this before and I'm going to explain it again Trump all ways eventually will tell you what he really thinks about anything and he may not do that out of the batter's box\nI have a name for this I call it pacing\nTrump wasn't necessarily go out with a general opinion like on gun control after a shooting or the dreamers or in this case Dr ... for your caller credible testimony compelling and he'll even go so far to say that yeah if if she's telling the truth yeah they're my nomination might be in trouble yeah\nI'll agree with that that gives him credibility it makes people kind of cock their head and they don't think Trump can be that's fair I'm Talking about the media and the left Democrats they don't think Trump can be that that's a reasonable\nBut he does it to them every time it gives them the credibility later to be\nCritical and to step away he said yeah I found a credible I've found her compelling then as we learn more and then there's the vents play out Trump is able\nTo parlay his original statements into what he really thinks based on\nWhat is not a knee jerk reaction if Trump were to heaven sent initially when he said last night at the rally why there would have been held up pay but now he can back it up now there's all kinds of evidence that her timeline doesn't make any sense\nWe've got an ex boyfriend claiming she is a polygraph expert and has taught people how to beat them\nWe have people challenging her account we didn't have that last week it is perfectly fine for Trump to do what he did it\nGives him a credibility later to be critical of the step away it's a common technique he uses he does it and everything\nIt's why I've always told you don't take his first draft statement or his first tweet as a sign that he's caving or flipping you people you I'm sure you remember there haven't been many instances in fact I may have fallen for one myself that's how I learned\nThat Trump will tweet something or say something it'll make you look like he's about late ... before he pulled out of a ... the Paris climate accord\nWhat did he say\nClimate change her serious thing and we have to look at it than we are looking at it than moving to\nThe right to oh so he's on record as being open about that later on when he's learned when he needs to learn comes out tells you what he thinks really\nThinks it's a pattern it's a technique is a trumped developed I don't even know if he developed or it's just how he does it naturally and instinctively\nBut I call it pacing now Republicans have not built up this reputation Senate Republicans haven't Trump has Trump has a stabbed leashed\nThat after he makes an initial statement on something that he can make fun\nOf things and what really irritates ... he gets away with it I cannot tell you how it irritates them see he shouldn't have survived the Access Hollywood video he shouldn't have survived anything they've thrown at him the fact that he has ... continue to prosper in triumph I cannot tell you how the lions Lee insane\nIt has made them with rage\nOther Republicans have not developed the golden adds to do this\nAnd pull it off Trump\nHasn't been attacked so much we're now if you go back to two thousand Fifteen when this campaign started this is two thousand they did was three years\n\nIn fact it's it's it's three years in three months Trump gets in in June of two thousand Fifteen Trump has been attacked so much\nHe doesn't care anymore it doesn't bother him anymore is my point he's not willing to take the arrows\nHe's willing to take the hits for everybody else that's why he is needed folks he is willing to do what he did last night I Know Murkowski\nAnd Collins or shuttering cowering in the corner with the vapors\nOh my God it was horrible it was so ... was a horrible everything he said is true\nIt was not mocking her the actress\nVideo audio we played mocked multi for Trump didn't\nHe just simply probably she she can't back up she cannot corroborate there isn't any crop ration for what she said why is\nThat not relevant why does that not matter\nWhy have we gotten to a point where any woman can come forward and accusing any man of anything and it's gospel\nAnd then be joined by a so called movement called me to wear all women can join ... can you imagine if there was something going on they can you imagine of men organized for the express\nPurpose of destroying women\nYou can't even imagine that can you\nYou can't even imagine the organized movement the male version of me too\nWell Roche are men and women are no there should we be\nWell yeah yeah that does happen but that's not the point this is not about even Bannon set it this is not just about sexual abuse this is about Raul power this is about female rage\nBecause of things that have happened to them the leftist women\nAnd they have organized all of these disorders into a giant political movement I'm just asking you to think can you ever can you envision\nA movement of men if if such a group existed\nAnd Oprah Winfrey had invited the leader on her show he'd been thrown off and the first ten minutes and have been ridiculed and made up for the rest of his life it could not happen\n\nWomen are a minority and supposedly even though they're not\nUh in numbers but it's so out of balance all Trump\nDid was say what everybody following this\nKnows even the Democrats the Democrats know all kinds of holes in her story\nTrump doing what he's doing provides a lot to cover for a lot of people that's one of the many reasons why he's needed Trump said guilty until proven innocent that's very dangerous for our country that's what this is\nThat's what the Democrat Party isn't it\nThat is what Democrats senators have said that the accused test to prove we didn't do it that the accuser doesn't have to corroborate anything the accuser doesn't have to prove anything where in what civilized society is that\nIn ... ... people on the news or ... years and in\nFighting to\nWatch the News I'm Joe Shapiro the sort of votes\nAnd the Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation later today and he is expected to be

IRS the James moved up to the gym and\nGuarantee quote from a National Review um\nThe more time I spent covering politics the more I'm convinced that a significant chunk a grass roots political activist or not really arguing about politics at all\nThese people are actually struggling with personal psychological issues and projecting them onto the world of politics mango I've been searching for that description for years I have no problem admitting that I was unable to put this together\nIt's one of the rare moments I was unable to this is exactly right\nWe're dealing with people who have suffered some kinds of psychological disorder they've turned to politics\nFor the solution or the written bandages actually what they're looking for and they don't just want revenge against whoever did whatever to them they are now demanding that every representative of the group that or the individual that did something to be made to pay a price for it\nIt's what the ... this this um ... well\nThe me too movement in large part was never bipartisan it was thought to be said to be but it never was\nA and even if it if you okay even if it was it's been co opted by the Democratic party look at look at the uh [noise] Occupy Wall street move but look at black lives matter I take take any left wing group that you want it's made up of people\nWho for some reason I think they have been unjustly mistreated by somebody\nAnd instead of dealing with that in their lives they enter politics and they demand that the Democratic party take up the cause of the Democratic party willingly has the Democratic party has become the party of all of these disparate constituency groups\nWith their singular causes because the Democratic party realizes that they can combine all these things into a singular assault on the concept of America that America is responsible for what happened to these people\nThey capitalism is responsible that the power structure that the founding is responsible\nAnd so people with psychological disorders are being granted the status of normalcy\nAnd then the big donors come along and under write them and fund their efforts and they become political movements\nAnd then they become victims and then of course allows them to blame everybody for what has gone wrong in their lives and then they demand reciprocity or revenge or what have you and I can tend to view that most people in our side have no idea how to deal with\nThis no idea whatsoever so we ended up and debates about weather [laughter]\nBoys want to pretend to be girl so they can go on the girls' bathrooms\nAnd becomes legitimate that's sick\nIt ... it in in many not that specifically but just the whole concept of what is happening here and it is a violent bullying intimidating movement that has\nBeen constructed to push all of these disparate various uh gems\nAnd the target is America the target is America is founded the target is\nAmerican Capitalism and so
