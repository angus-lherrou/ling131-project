way so they reported that way\nIn their generic polled the Democrats have a mother back to a plus Thirteen margin advantage but then you look at individual racism and nowhere near a Democrat Thirteen

disapproved of the way Democrats handled everything compared to thirty percent who approved the\nIndependence also disapproved of Republicans handling of the matter but by and narrow or fifty three of

lotto looney tunes out they're incapable of seeing the country the way we do\nFor a host of reasons heavier heard ladies and gentleman that the Clintons are going to start a massive stadium tour bill and Hillary won again in want to get in on all of this Trump action now I\nI'm I've been wondering how long it was going to be until somebody in the Democratic party tried\nThis Trump's rallies dating back to the two thousand sixteen campaign and do not doubt me on this either the Democrats in the media publicly acted on concerned on interest in and would always say a variation of you can't\nJudge voter interest on the basis or rallies you can't predict how people are going to vote simply because of the size of crowds at political rallies\nThese Trump rallies they're not telling us that it doesn't mean anything he's or just rabbit people upset with their lives and they think Trump is going to kick all the people out of the country they don't like it's not saying it's not anywhere near representative\nOf the population is is what they all said that every Trump rally\nPrivately do not doubt me privately they were jealous if they can be and they were the thing\nBecause there's not a one of them on the Democratic side who could come anywhere close to ... that kind of excitement that kind of loyalty and knows sized crowds\nObama couldn't do it not in two thousand sixteen Hillary couldn't do it ever but certainly not in two thousand she couldn't she couldn't she couldn't draw flies\nTo her book signing ceremonies Hillary Clinton who couldn't draw a crowd any weren't good people knew she might not be able to stand up for a full twenty five minutes without some ain't coming out the proper up by the elbows but seriously I guarantee you they were looking at those crowds they were\nLooking at those Trump rallies and they would never say so publicly but they were scared to death by him they would never say so publicly they would never admit it publicly they would say just the opposite\nBut they're human beings in any kind any any time anybody in politics has that kind of popularity and that kind of loyalty that equals jealousy envy and anger and all things that attached to jealousy and that'd be\nThey have the Trump to begin with and the fact that Trump was turning everything they believe you an upside down the fact that Trump was being able to accomplish things they couldn't\nJust in terms of average Americans being interested in the campaign interested in the candidacy and those rallies twenty thousand Fifteen twenty five thousand as many people lined up outside who couldn't get an wanted to get in\nTrump with his airplane perfectly placed so that Trump in giant letters in the fuselage was behind him at every stop when he made a speech except for those events that took place inside actual arenas so I I've been wondering\nHow long it's going to be before somebody on the Democrats' side tries to get in on this action and I always thought you know who I thought it would be that would make the first Abbott trying it\nJoe Biden I really thought that Joe Biden would be the first guy that try to replicate this\nThen I thought maybe Michelle my bell Obama but then I thought no they've got too much to lose if it doesn't work\nMaybe Kamala Harris maybe some of these ... somebody's going to do this somebody's got to try it they've got to be able\nTo show the Democrats thinking they've got to show that there's as much excitement as much loyalty as much attention\nAs Trump can draw up till now nobody on the Democrats' side has even given it a prayer until the Clintons the daily wire has the story\nWashington Power couple bill and Hillary Clinton announced yesterday that their embarking on a nationwide stadium\nToured taking the Clintons stage show to Thirteen cities this fall it's going to be called an evening with President Bill Clinton and former secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton that's the actual title of the show

the headline Mr ... there are now\nTwo hundred nine seats either family or leaning in the Democratic column only nine shy of the two hundred eight team needed to win control this is what you were just felt like we write and you've got Republicans telling you that they think this is true\nSome\nI'm not asking for names but you've got some elected Republicans are people in their offices telling you they believe is okay so political says the GOP house is crumbling it's falling apart\nThere are two hundred nine feet firmly or leaving\nDemocrats I guess this is according to polling data to hundred eight team is the number of seats you need for the majority in the house or four hundred and thirty five total numbers there\nTo eight teams the majority so\nTwo hundred nine seats firmly are leading Democrat I mean this if the Democrats [laughter] nine seats with this this is a white\nBy the Republican Party would have to be a party of for this to happen a party of Adolf Hitler's\nFor this ... this is ... and yet they believe it now\nFolks I don't have an insider information on this I don't know anybody with internal polling get I don't know I don't know beans I I don't I don't really pay attention to that I never have but the people in Washington live and die by their stuff I'm telling you\nIt is their blood and water and food polling data it's how they get through the day every day pulling anything and if the Democrats\nAre publishing stories to each other that to nine seats are leading their way and if there is no blue wave I don't think there's gonna be an ounce obscenity anywhere to be found on the Democrats' side of the Iowa or in the media\nTo hundred nine seats firmly orange Leming in the Democratic column\nLet me ask you a question what could be causing this let's let's assume for a moment just as a as a hypothetical exercise let's assume this is true\nCan you tell me what it is anything one thing a series of things that have American voters\nSo ticked off at Republicans that day\nYou cannot wait to go out and vote Democrat so that the Democrats run the house what is it what have the Republicans done or not done that would warrant this kind of the nation wide\nDisgust with the party now the left will tell you the answer to that question is Trump that the people of this country\nDespise Donald Trump as a people in this country have been poised to send Trump packing ever since election night\nTo thousands sixteen they can't wait to get out there and showed their ... for Trump but the only way they can do it has to vote against Republicans\nAll right\nWell as I say we're hypothetically protesting this is true what has Trump done to generate that kind\nOf disgust other than be alive and be president what has he done no no I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm being serious what you want to take it\nAll started when he said he separated families at the border I'm Glad you reminded me of that\nIt's getting harder and harder to watch television shows what was I watching the other you know this this last week was premier awake for all the new network prime time shows I think it was law and order in ... yeah law and order and us you'll be or something and and\nUh the show started out focusing on a bad guy who had little kids in his basement in a cage\nAnd they asked me you cops are running around trying to prove this guy's a reprimand of the first order and\nYou know officer you know our\nGovernment money is separating the two parents that are born or I don't see them and the cops\nWe fought everything oh wow we don't have a pervert here we have a hero this guy and I watched and said well that's it for the show the level of idiocy and stupidity and ignorance that just permeates\nPlaces in this country where it ought not be there people ought to be more educated more informed as smarter\nBut that's gone we have replaced\nInformed people educated people learn in people with asthma so load block cab idiots\n\nWere not separating and

Sam Nunn of Georgia I'll never forget his attempt saving the reputation of John Tower\nI knew John Powell I think John Tower actually was forced to resign and it says uh one of these things was

here's what she says Anderson Cooper says look in your memoir you talk about an experience for a sitting Senator John tower basically tried to sexually assault you in the back of a tax folks\nJohn Tower would never be in a taxi that would be such a demeaning kind of car to be in senator you don't drive around on yellow cabs [noise] you have a car service a limo driver ... well anyway she starts to happen in a cab that John Powell tried\nTo sexually assault you in the back of the ... you didn't come forward them and you didn't come forward when the senator was nominated for ... that's what it was they nominated the guy for secretary of defense and that's when all this\nCame out but Sally Quinn didn't didn't Anderson Cooper wants to know why she didn't say anything\nDragnet rid of this nightclub and ordered brandy and wouldn't let go of may and finally I got away and rat out and gotten a cab and he came out and jumped in the cabin jumped on top of me\nAnd basically tried to assault

the time\nAnd a cab driver was going about Ninety miles an hour because he realized what was happening in the back of the carbon centers screech to a halt in front of our corners and I think than tower got scared because he thought maybe the general would come out with a shot got\nBut I went in the house at night I cried all night long I was absolutely traumatized I never tell my parents are

Turkey you ride this afternoon a joined base Andrews near Washington and deported immediately for an Oval Office meeting with President Trump boxes Garrett tend to use that the White House\nDemocratic presidential candidates for decades now the white vote has only then won twice that of last sixty years my husband being one of the two Lyndon Johnson being so it's not a surprise it's a disappointment that white women vote Republican and not for me but it is what it is\nAnd they're in Hillary Clinton stumbled\nAnd the swerve into a truth\nExcept for a very exceptional election year of Nineteen sixty four which was following the JFK assassination\nThe Democrats have not gotten more than fifty percent of the white vote in the presidential election since Nineteen thirty two\nNow when you look at it that way you can understand why in Democratic Party circles there's hatred for white people white people white women had been rejecting the white married suburban women had been rejecting them this is why the kind of Nazi movement sprang up this is why\nThe left as as it started contacting all different categories for non white suburban women to be plugged into so that they can then be said to be Democrats constituents\n\nThis and by the way this is again why in Nineteen sixty five Ted Kennedy and the Democrats re opened the floodgates to immigration I Need to remind everybody again from about Nineteen Twenty one and Nineteen twenty three if you're Nineteen sixty five we shut down immigration I Would not to zero\nBut we put very strict limits on and the reason\nWas to be able to assimilate all of the immigrants that come into the country the late Eighteen hundreds throughout the Nineteen early twenties assimilation was key to American immigration policy\n\nArriving immigrants all wanted to be citizens by the way and there were things they had to do to become citizens they had to learn a language and they had to learn the history of America they had to be able to pass questions about the history of America on a test\nAnd they had to swear and plan their loyalty and devotion to the United states and they were eager to do it and they were happy to do it now they they maintain their ethnicity\n\nThe Irish the Italians unit but they wanted to become Americans and they did and it took a number of years to assimilate them all\nWell Nineteen sixty five is when Ted Kennedy who led the charge to reopen the immigration floodgates which then of course led to once that happened illegal immigration ramped up in an uncontrollable way\nAnd\nThat wave of immigrants starting in Nineteen sixty five came from third world socialist countries Democrats\nRealized they could only when the White House if they changed the population of America they were losing presidential elections with the Native American population because they were losing\nWhite women and Mrs Clinton just admitted it here it's a Christian I'm poor up CNN it never occurred to them to change their policies what they have to do in order to attract white voters what they had to do\nWas change America so back to Hillary she said what was done last night in the White House meeting Trump apologizing for the nation to Kavanaugh\nWhat was done in the White House last night she said was a political rally it further undermine the image and integrity of the court and that troubles me greatly Christie on poor it saddens me because our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitution look to the apps\nThat judicial system has been viewed by you as he lectured insurance the judicial system has been viewed by you and Mrs Clinton's the rest of the Democrats as your private refuge\nYou have looked at the court as a place you can stock like minded leftist activists to make sure things that you believe in which never could pass legislation somehow become law in America that's why they want the courts\nIf you want to really get frustrated you heard me say this and you probably heard a lot of other people but stop and think about this outside\nOf Obamacare practically every liberal\n... the steak every liberal idea and belief that now is the law in this country would not have become law in Congress because it never would have passed liberalism and the Democratic party's ideas have never been mass popular the only way\nThat we have bastard ice pop culture to log on to reality today is because Democrats activists judges have been essentially writing law when they take cases and interpret them and then pronounce decisions roe versus Wade is the most sterling example of this\nBut there are countless others the simple fact of the matter is the Democratic party has never been capable of winning\nLegislation to implement the ideas they believe in because most of the American people when they know what's at stake don't want them that's the value of judges and that's the value of courts to the Democrats when Mrs Clinton says\nThat what happened in the White House the other night saddens her because our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitutional got B. S. not by you\nIn fact to Hillary Clinton and people like her the Constitution's an obstacle is well it's certainly not something to revere\n... did you see any way even a conservative state of college so I was speaking to yesterday said the only way to repair America is to try to get back to some civility to try to make it that even if we have political disagreements we're not going to go to war with each other we're not going to destroy each other\nHillary Clinton well certainly I Would love to see a return to civility Christian on for listening to one another working on our differences\nBut that is not the Republican Party that exist today that is certainly not the administration that we haven't power right now when the Republican Senate denied the right of President Obama to have his nominee for the Supreme Court Merrick Garland here we go off to the races again ms characterizing that\nYou're blue in the face\nThat's what Joe Biden rule the Democrats invented that rule that presidents don't get the name Supreme Court justices during vacancies that happened in the last year of their term that's a Democrat inspired instituted rule\nAnd she knows it\nBut the Republicans didn't destroy Merrick Garland the Democrats didn't have to fight battles defending his character and his life because the Republicans were not trying to destroy them as they did Kavanaugh\nAnyway the upshot of this is that Hillary Clinton says it's it's it's a time for instability in is it time for this kind of extremism because that's what we're up against Steve skill lease [noise]\nWho was shot by one of the believers of Hillary Clinton at that Republican baseball practice cannot believe that Bill Cassidy senator from Louisiana responded to Hillary at a time when the Republicans are being shot stabbed docks beaten\nRun out of restaurants and sent death threats Hillary Clinton urged Democrats to be even more uncivil what an irresponsible statement every Democrats should denounce they're not going to denounce or they privately publicly encourage written by applauded they supported that is who they are\nThis is the party by the way that has been railing against all this and civility for I don't know how long this is why\nI look at average American voters paying attention to this and I don't understand how any of them can want to side with what the Democratic Party is doing how they're doing it\nI Know what happens but it's it's a mystery to me and my hope is my faith is that this incivility this insanity this on the hinge Democrat behavior is negatively impacting the Democrats that the Kavanaugh effect\nPro Republican I Know that's real the polling data indicates that that's real if you want to believe\nPolling data but we're never going to get a poll\nOf people who this approve of Democrat Party tactics techniques that poll is never going to be run and if they did if somebody on the left did run that poll and the results came back then it was quite harmful of Democrats they wouldn't run the results\nThey would get hold of Democrat leaders the media was saying look this is not working you guys you better get hold of your people in dialing back the problem is that Democrats can't dial these people back the Democrats don't control these left wing radicals\nThat's why you don't see any public statements of disapproval\nGot to take a break
