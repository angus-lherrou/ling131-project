great sir I saw it with my wife on friday and we went in there was a whole row of forty something year old woman\nWomen are all coming in with a glass of wine a and uh\nIt wasn't pretty it it wasn't pretty uh you know they just wanted to him with his shirt off and uh it's just one of the day was thought and they drank and they drank and they drank and they drank and uh when we walked out I'm not going to give away anything but it it happens in his home in the garage with the last couple of scenes and you know it's\nIt's kind of the climax of the whole movie and a and you know it it kind of is a threat that we was throughout the entire movie okay and they were standing in the lobby and again the going\nOut on it that isn't what happened a garage\nAnd they and they are like and the other was like I don't understand it like\nOh [laughter] how did you eat\nThey were just so blasted but this is why you did see him with his shirt off so that was good for them to stay away from alcohol yeah I Know do some really good you should see it\nEr yeah er and er it did me doing very well\nOr at least as far as the reviews go people are talking about it as a big time Oscar movie have you seen what is it first in the first man first man have you seen that I haven't um do I'm fascinated by these sort of cultural controversy around surrounding the movie ... which I mean we talked about when the story came out\nThat they didn't put the scene of them planting the flag and the moon right I'm In the movie which is the iconic moment of the story\nI mean but the the the argument was it's not just showing it's making it into a global thing and I said if they have the patches or the flag on their arm yeah they have the usa on the rocket and the and the flag on the you know\nThe the lunar lander what's the problem\nRight it's it's an odd choice I thought you know it's the iconic moment of that movie why wouldn't you put it in the movie\nAnd it's kind of moment of that whole situation I don't think so I think the iconic moment is the one step for man that's another one yeah yeah I mean there's a couple yeah but um but we now uh now I have not seen the movie um but there's a couple of articles that are out talking about the flag and first of all the flags all over the movie\nI mean they they think insight you know Fifteen twenty examples of the flag all over the place in some of it is like the patch or yeah which which you kind of understand would be really obvious if they tell you I Would not even only just that for example\nUh apparently they don't show them planting the flag into the moon however in the scene you can see the flag planted in the mood in the background and already been planted in there and they show it if they were voting the flag they just don't have that moment\nNot good enough what if those forty year old women are they like\nHas hired a flag again there was there ... it is so yes ... and\nThere a couple of bottles or started hey you might not

Dianne Feinstein Hillary Clinton Stormy Daniels she's the one I couldn't think of it Elizabeth Warren\nAll four of them orchestrated damaging October surprise backfires for the Democratic party Elizabeth Warren tweeted white the different times yesterday about this\n\nNow I'm not a denizen of Twitter\nBut I Know a lot of people who are and in the Twitter verse that's considered a meltdown when you tweak twenty times in an attempt to persuade people\nTwenty times attempting to make your case it's considered to be a meltdown and again the big news about all of this is that the media is making fools of themselves right along the way by lying right along with her\nThe Stanford University researcher who studied focus on us this DNA did not actually use samples of Native American DNA\nThe Boston Globe quote to make up for the dearth of Native American DNA Dr\nCarlos ... samples from may go ... in Columbia to stand in for Native Americans now\nShe's out there touting that it's true or she is an empty you got one one thousand twenty fourth\nAnd there wasn't even any in the in our Native American DNA tested in which she could be said to have in common or compared to I mean it's laughable it is the static\nAnd I think this is what Trump is doing to all these people Hillary Clinton's making a fool of herself Egypt ever doubt they're saying that what Bill Clinton did with Monica ... no no no no no no it was not abused that doesn't qualifies me too because she was an adult\nSo Hillary Clinton is making it asks herself an absolute fool of herself in the midst of the me too movement she's on you're cutting it\nAnd selling it out in order to save both herself and her husband who are assumed to be a barking on what a stadium chore or yes\nBill and Hillary are going to mark a nationwide stadium to or where they're going to go and hopefully draw crowds of twenty and twenty five thousand to do the bill and Hillary show onstage\nBecause of course they can't let Trump upstaged that like this I mean if we can do what they can do it if Trump can do it anybody can do it they're going to try to get in on it\nThere's one thing missing one key ingredient missing nobody cares what they have to say not like\nPeople care what Trump has to say there is no interest in what Bill or Hillary Clinton are going to say\nThere is all kinds of interest in what Trump is going to say there's just the it factor\nThat Trump has the Hillary certainly doesn't they haven't never has had you could argue that Bill Clinton to an extent habit and I'm Talking about this type of charisma\nBack in the nineties when he was running for president in shortly after the first term maybe he had it and they believe they or I was expanded a bit by the fact that he was president but neither of these two are anywhere near\n\nThe wake of Donald Trump you know what this is why does it like the Democrats trying to come up with an answer to me in the first ten years in the spring and

and uh and they did the same thing and it never\nHas happened every attempt to supplant take over\nRelegate this program ... has failed abysmally and just like the bill and Hillary stadium tour is going to fail abysmally\nThey're going to end up having to pay people to show up\nTo get the kind of crowds that they will not you may think rush through enough rabbit Democrats out there that will show up just to create the image that there's all kinds of interest folks you may think that\nWhat we're going to find out common sense will tell you\nHillary Clinton could withdraw fly just do a book selling party she couldn't draw applies to a campaign appearance that's why she didn't do very many of them it would have been embarrassing how few people showed up the ones there were big crowds they did in fact most people\nIn the country's not clamoring to hear from the Clintons companies not waiting\nWith bated breath for what they have to say but look I Want to I Want to return just for a

destruction\nWhenever they want to take a Republican out they are guaranteed a Ninety percent chance of success\nBecause they have the drive by media working right alongside with them and if they set their their crosshairs I'm somebody there as good as gone or damaged beyond repair they habits lay the glove on Donald Trump\nThey're running out of weapons and then the process of running out of weapons they're losing their minds they're losing their rational sanity I Believe\nAnd this latest debacle over Kavanaugh don't doubt for a minute that this thing was orchestrated unplanned from the get go as a late breaking\nUse only if necessary event they didn't lead with this because they knew it was flimsy they didn't lead with it because they knew they couldn't prove it\nThey didn't lead with it it was it a central part of a Kavanaugh hearings because they knew there wasn't any evidence for it and they knew that ball the foreign could not pull this off under pressure\nI'm Still shocked that balls he showed up to testify I I think that took everything they had to persuade her to get there 'cause I don't think she ever intend to do and I don't think when they pitched her on this whole thing was every part of the plan that she would ever actually have to testify\nAnd does anybody believe that uh fifty one every year old woman literally talks as she talks that way in her classroom teaching students if she does\nThat mean that just\nAnd I guess it's possible I guess she does but I I I don't believe that either I don't believe that's how if you talk to the balls before

fear of being hit or damaged or harmed or yelled out or whatever [noise] ah\nAnyway the point is none of it has worked and by work I mean do two things the the real objective from the get go from all of this the cleanest way for this to have happen would have been able to turn the American people particularly Trump voters against him\nIf they had been able to do that get Trump's approval numbers ... thirties them to the twenties then they could get rid of him\nThey failed at that all they did with cement Trump's supporters to him even more firmly\nAnd in the process Kavanaugh saying they actually turns to the people who were sympathetic to them and the Trump supporters because people in the same portion of this country simply do not feel comfortable with watching\nThe most powerful apparatus of government unified at a line and for the purpose of destroying a human being and a life when there isn't\nAny evidence that one of the water it's such a thing but the Democrats type of care that there wasn't any evidence because they never have any they always relied on the seriousness of the charge working with the media\nTo create a daily image that whoever the Democrats are targeting is worse than poison and must be dealt with as though he or she is poison well none of it has worked\nAnd even in their own post Trump's approval numbers hover in the mid forties and Rasmussen Trump's at fifty one\nThey see the approval numbers for Trump of the African American community they see the economy ... I I'm telling you that they are teetering on the brink of being hold it altogether being able to hold it altogether and it's in this\nUniverse framework context I just I\nSee this mask blue wave that they do and I'm not sure\nThey even see it and if you're hoping I think it's a birthright to them it's the way things ought to be should be and I got to\nDo everything they can to make it reality but these are massive elections all over the country and it's going to be a challenge for him [noise]\nWe'll see I mean look it's possible that I I'm like Nate Silver I have no idea what's going to happen only difference between that silver and me is that I make no pretense of knowing what's going to happen all I'm doing with you today are sharing how I break this now using common sense\nI've got\n... two thousand twelve to six years of on the ground actual experience of Democrats losing elections of people turning against them Democrats having fewer seats\nElectoral seats in Washington\nThan they've had since the Nineteen twenties and I don't see anything is going to reverse that Iraq Hussein oh\nSinglehandedly made this happen rock Obama's presidency is what turned to people against the Democratic party\nAnd it was based on substance because Obama was a likeable guy and he was African American in check off a box I'm not racist look at this I voted for Obama and still when people had the chance they voted against every aspect of the Obama agenda they could\nWhereas Obama by the white campaigning for all these Democrats trying to retake the house and Senate\nWhere is the worst plugs\nBeto O'Rourke heard about this Beto O'Rourke is following the Obama a mold Beto O'Rourke\nRaise thirty eight million dollars in the third quarter\nHe has been asked by Democrats to share some of that money for other races which are closing Beto has told them\nTo go pound sand that tone has told them if you're a lecture that important when you go raise the money yourself I'm going to ... been this way I Want to use this the way I was not my job to raise money for you exactly what Obama's Obama\nPeople remember this he resented the hell out of having to GO Campaign for house races he thought it was sold but need him he had he wanted no\nPart of campaigning for house races and very little to do with campaigning for Senate races\nBecause it was but nice [laughter] the office of the presidency to go that low real reason he didn't want to do with this Obama didn't have confidence of coattails\nAnd ... is not going to want to share in any of his money not being good socialist got all this money it's not fair to back to oh who's by the white ones he down seven or eight points now the latest poll a it's\nNot fair that Beto has more than ... ... and won't share it with other needy Democrats but that's what he's saying that he won't do [noise]\nUm yeah outlook also have the um because shell game situation and there's some things about this guy but I\nDon't think are being widely reported exactly who he has been Dr\n... let me just tell you what the drive by purpose here is again\nThe drive by is are trying as hard as they can to link Donald Trump to show ... murder my the way just so you know there are a couple of CNN\n... pronounce it can cause show jeep\nBecause there's two genes in there every time I've heard the word the name pronounce it's always been ... ad ... pronounce his name that way Robin Leach who made a star out of ab ... is Yogi who was a saw the arms merchant\nAnd he was practically featured every other week and the lifestyles of the rich and famous\nHis name was pronounced ...

was wearing an apple walk\nHis fiance was outside in the family says Dan\nShe had his iPhone in the family sit down and she had instructions to call a man I've got his name here I'm not going to bottom look ended up she had instructions to call somebody if he didn't\nCome back out he was going to get you know divorce officially recognized sort of get married a fiance that's waiting outside in the family to them and she had the structures to identify mutual friend if he didn't emerge meaning he\nThought he was lord in there he bought something could happen reporting that his ... was recording everything that happened folks is not possible\nIn the first place an apple watch is a slave to the phone\nAnd\nApple does him that even if if we had a new watch the series for what she didn't because it hasn't been out long enough\n... but even if you get if he if he bought it in the United states and had it it's still not capable\nOf L T E operation in Turkey apple has not yet brought LT eve service to the to the I watch the apple watch in Turkey which means that there is no way his watch could have worked independently of his phone\nNow there is an app there are a number of apps\nOne of the best ones is called just press record and on your watch is just a giant red button that you press it and it starts voice recording and it ends up saving the recording on your paired iPhone but the phone has to be within range\nAnd I'm I'm here to tell you with the fiance and the iPhone in the car outside of the concept was no way\nYou know\nIts its maximum twenty yards Bluetooth that that connects watches to phones twenty yards twenty five are some that I got a golf course when I lose the range of phone stops talking to the watch\nIt's maybe twenty or twenty five yards and most of what should be Seventy five feet on the tops on the outside sixty feet more like it there is no way his watch was recording anything and\nTransmitting it anywhere so there there can't be a recording of what happened to it besides that the Saudis would have seen the watched by taking it off\nA and they would have needed the fiance is iPhone to find out what was on it\nThe watch is still not an independent piece attack even watches that can operate under LT they still need to be fair to the phone there's not enough storage capacity on the watch to store the data of a recording it doesn't start yeah it can store I think up to a\nHundred songs maybe more now but for the most part that has to stream them it's not an independent device so the there probably is no evidence on the guys watch or even on the phone\nIt [noise] well the [noise]\nExcept for his heartbeat stopping not even that the phone will still have to be at some point put back in ranging connected to the fun to watch would need to be back into close proximity the phone for his heart rate data to show up on the phone\nIt's simply ... it's simply not possible what they're saying\nThe way they're saying it it's not possible to watch is not independently capable of doing what they're reporting it needs an iPhone and and to remain paired to the iPhone you can't be more than\nI Wish I knew this exactly I'm I'm I Know when I lose my connection when I'm On the golf course and it's [noise] thirty yards\nNinety feet at the tops tops and this guy had walls to deal with in\nAnd the consulate or he couldn't have been that close to the phone which is in the car the families to Dan with the with the fiance now uh [noise]\nI've got the audio here of James okay if the secret audio taken of Claire McCaskill and her campaign aide Rob meals\nI this is\nThis is important because this new is just not being reported in Missouri which is Claire McCaskill state it also happens to be my home state that what we did hear we went and we did a Google Search\nFor new ways of the secret video from project beret toss it Claire McCaskill and we wanted to see where this\nParents' House news have been reported\nSo we got Washington Times the Daily Caller Daley wire Russia Today a PJ me the Breitbart News you know cure report back there is no way piece here why there's no New York times here there is no St Louis Post Dispatch here there is no Saint Louis globe Democrat\nOr even though they publish here in fifty years there's no Saint Louis penny saver here there is no Saint Louis TV

Google Search when you Google Claire McCaskill and project ferrets us every site running this\nWould be a conservative side or a conservative bloc there's not one mention of St Louis papers or TV stations here\nAnd what it basically is is McCaskill recorded on secret video admitting that she cannot tell Missouri voters and the truth what she really thinks about things like gun control because she might not get elected\nWe can't\nOpenly say that says whatever age we got to soundbites here the first one is McCaskill herself and her staff talking to the on identified project maritime us secret journalist and in this particular song by Senator McCaskill\nAre talking about in the end the project maritime ... secret journalist are talking about the second amendment\nFamously here I mean

her aunt okay All right let me let me read to you because I couldn't if it were I Would not be able to make sense of that or even though I've got a direct audio feed that just sounded like noise to me but here's the transcript she said\nIf we have the kind of the year I think we might have any Democrats winning big we could actually be in a position we can get my son this gun stuff on the floor and we can get sixty and McConnell knows he just doesn't want to put it on the floor because then it goes to the house\nAnd then it's awkward 'cause all those house members are total NRA folks\nThe Vera
