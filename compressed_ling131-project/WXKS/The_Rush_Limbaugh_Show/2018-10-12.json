hundred [noise]\nThanks [noise]\n[noise] I'll talk to you later part [noise] flown\nTo the program glad you're back I'm just talking to Steve off the air is fascinating you they're really really really a fascinating is one of those guys to his you know really walk through the fire for his principal hum and uh I I that's something I really respect\nI really like what he says about Donald Trump down from South problem\nNot just days of reflection of of us and he's reflecting that part of us that says get him when he's really he's really done his homework on on Donald Trump and and and how bright he is on reflecting the people and it really when you look at\nHow Donald Trump is reflecting a those guys do people will\nBe really shows how wrong the Democrats the the democratic leadership really is they're just they're off the deep\nEnd I think I much I don't know if I mention is off the air but there's a story in the New York times to visit the headline in the New York times Michelle Obama wanted Democrats to go high\nThey aren't so sure and it goes through the Eric\nHolder a quote or when they go low we kicked the Michael ... when they go a low Isay hit back harder um Hillary Clinton or you cannot be civil with a political party that want to destroy what you stand for\nUm when we when that's when civility can start again um there was another a Joe Biden if I were in high school I take them behind the gym and beat the hell out of him\nI mean this is as they sit there in the new democratic\nWhat's the difference between that and Donald Trump saying when they hit me I hit him back\nTwice as hard well I mean I I you know that that this is what\nThey're saying they are trying to oppose is Donald Trump yes right I mean I you know they're not they're not certainly not filling themselves at the new Donald Trump's mhm they're saying that Donald Trump is so bad we must act this way\nUm so I mean I you know I don't like it from anybody so I mean I I've been clear about that over the years but still I don't think that that it's it's an amazing thing I think because you look at Michelle Obama who who was the only one that I saw at all of the Democrats who came out and said the holder comments were bad\nThat's her phrase that was being criticized writing but she was she was saying like no that's not the right way now to me that is complete lip service the Obama administration played lip service just civility paid lip service to bipartisanship they paid lip service to a lot of times\nWhat made them almost unbeatable for the average person right they they won twice\nBased on that mhm and even though they were just as hard nose as any other Democrat just as hard nose they at least tried to hide it this\nWhich is now overt we are correct Maxine Waters were harassing people in restaurants harassed them go after them several Democrats have said this now it is the new policy seemingly of the Democratic movement as defined by Eric Holder who said this is the new democratic\nParty and it's amazing how they all claim to be the new civil rights leaders\nBecause they're all emulating Malcolm X. they are not emulating Martin Luther king yeah that was really the the ... that was his bail mhm I mean that's what that's what won the civil rights I contend if ... if if Martin Luther king would have swung back\nAnd it ... that they would have followed Malcolm X. things might have been worse for ... for a for blacks for a while\nBack very rarely does that does that tactic work right I mean people want\nDon't want to think of themselves as you know as you know animals harassing innocent people in a restaurant I mean that's not something that anyone wants to ... ... you want to associate yourself with those people ... right and you know you see that occasionally on the right with certain groups who who go down these roads\n... you know the all right for example if you will you'll hear from conservatives about the alt right generally speaking is either they're horrible horrible and the people in the totally wrong and all these issues or they don't exist\nRight like there's very few people were like you know what the right pretty darn great I mean Breitbart famously a you know and I don't know not to you know but the Bannon was the one who said that Breitbart was the platform for the alt right but really\nOutside of Steve Bannon you've seen almost no embrace of these groups are largely because no one wants to be associated with them right right like who wants to I don't want to I don't want anyone to think I'm friends with that guy right it's just a normal human instinct\nAnd that's not even not seats that's all right really nobody even knows what All right is I mean the average person\nThey just see them as people who are going out in the streets and you know a beating people up or torturing people or or marching you know against you know Jews and blacks and everything else and you're like I don't want to be part of that I just don't want to write a ugly I don't want\nThat I'll be ... there was an actual death in Charlottesville writer and everyone would say that that is horrific um but you know there was all over there right like we're just marching around with torches and saying horrible things do you want to be associated with any of them well no\nBut the left also there was ... the shooting of of our of our congressmen a year ago and it's like it never even happened\nNobody the guy who was arrested this weekend the I think it was CBS that was reporting this he was arrested because he had built a two hundred pound bombs going to blow himself up on election day they didn't even report that he was a leftist\nThey just won't recognize it uh and\nYou know who on the left standing up against that\nMoves that have gone or we don't want to be you know that's not us we don't want to be a part of that\nThey just denied that it ever happened\nAnd it gives them this ability just to\nSilently

hurricane Michael\nOkay so the point is this guy doesn't even know what he's talking but he goes to the next us database any figures oh Rush Limbaugh those are leaving climate change joke people with north but just rank amateur on professionalism but the reason I played this is is not not to mention this guy [noise]\nBut because while this guy is jumping all in my ... listen to this story this is from the federalist papers liberal professors says hurricane victims deserve what thank God because they support Republicans now do you think these clowns in\nBoston with zero in on something genuinely deranged like this no they're going to make up the fact that a bunch of people like me who know or the\nClimate change man made climate change as a whole are somehow responsible for people having lost everything and clothing risking their lives\nDoes University of St Thomas engineering school in Minnesota verbal and fluids scientist professor Dr John Abraham\nHe's a professor actually believe the Florida Panhandle residents deserve to get hit by a catastrophic hurricane because they elected climate deniers\nHere's the headline in an article written by this guy was published in the guardian not some of your little rag or penny saver this was published in the guardian\nOn Thursday victims of hurricane Michael voted for climate deniers elections have consequences denying science has consequences and we're reaping what are we so\n\nPeople just like this are teaching your kids and they're being paid a lot of money to do it\nThis is the wide chicken the reasoning that he is teaching any engineering school the guy is still range this is this is hyper political partisanship disguised as science\nHe thinks that voting for Republicans causes hurricanes to hit red states and the people in red states who voted Republicans deserved to get wiped out by hurricanes for voting for Republicans and his name\nIs Dr John Abraham a University of St Thomas engineering school in Minnesota\n\nDespite the lack of science to support his case Dr Abraham blames Michael's intensity on manmade global warming there isn't any evidence for it it's not the most intense hurricane to ever hit the panhandle\n\nYet he blames the intensity or manmade global warming are needing to his subsequent claimed that southern voters brought this upon themselves\nBy voting Republicans into office\nYou tell one or the other states like Florida which will get pummeled by Michael couldn't vote for somebody that denies climate change this doctor wrote\nPointing to governor Rick Scott andme to Senator Marco Rubio on the his argument is that in the last Republican climate deniers or voted out of office that more hurricanes will bring more death\nAnd destruction others op so this clown who is disguised as a as an engineering professor literally is saying that if you want to stop\n\nDestructive hurricanes striking where you live vote Democrat he literally this one is what he said\nIn an unrelated story a bunch of which is somewhere are putting a tax on Brett Kavanaugh this week and I'm not making that up and they are disguised as Democratic Party activists are hacks on Capitol I'd I'd I don't know what the nature of the ...\n\nI mean this [laughter] if it if it weren't so irresponsible that would be funny meanwhile you have the entire left now attempting to destroy Kanye West\nAnd what Kanye West Dan is simply venture off the liberal Democrats plan to shoot and that is a no no if you're an African American you venture off the Democrat plantation they are going to destroy your meanwhile idiots like this professor\n\nA professor of engineering literally tells people\nThat if you want to stop hurricanes from blowing up where you live vote Democrat it's because you're voting Republican and and denying climate change that these hurricanes are coming after you\nKnow do you remember after Hurricane Katrina you people might have thought that I was joking there were people\nIn the leftist medium who literally we're trying to tell people in New Orleans that George Bush wanted that hurricane to strike Louisiana\nHe wanted it specifically the strike New Orleans this is why there weren't any warnings it wanted it to strike New Orleans because Bush knew that residents of New Orleans would have to abandon the city\nAnd go to Texas\nWhere as Democrats they wouldn't be absorbed and wouldn't affect any political outcomes but in Louisiana you can turn the state Republican if you get rid of a bunch of New Orleans Democrats and so whatever people out there saying that Bush actually wanted to hurricane to wipe out New Orleans so that residents will have\nTo leave would have to go to Houston\nThere were some even saying that Bush was doing what he couldn't just steer the hurricane that Bush was responsible for it because Bush told the weather service to downplay the warnings\nWell I didn't want to mention it but I'll go ahead and mentioned there were some that now these were not mainstream media people but they did repeat this there were people out there\nTalking on a tax on the Internet who are claiming that Bush was steering the hurricane remember that that Bush was tearing that hurricane Bush himself the president was there in a hurry and and what this guy\nIs professor at the University of St Thomas is no different by claiming that simply the way people vote determines where a hurricane goes how stronger hurricanes going to be and whether or not the hurricanes gonna wipe you out and he doesn't\nKnow yeah it's the redneck Riviera and yeah traditionally the panhandle of more than a blow to both Republican but he doesn't know there might have been some democratic voters got wiped out the odds are there were\nBecause so many people didn't get wiped out you know we we we look at these events are these people do as one off political events\nSome of these people who had been wiped out you you look at that devastation and you say how are they ever gonna come back they didn't have much to begin with I\nMean it's just some of these photos that you see from that area do look like they have been leveled with explosives\nOr it is it's just heartbreaking to see what happens and the only upside as it was not\nYou know a densely populated area but that doesn't change\nThe impact on the ... the lived there anyhow there were some who didn't evacuated and I made up their minds themselves the media found them talk to them they want to stay they wanted to hang in they wanted to see what it was all like every hurricane has\nThose people who are hell bent they either want to protect the homestead or they're curious\nTo hear how devastating and how big it how\nRock is the Starman storms I Want to see it\nAnd they roll the dice thinking that they'll survive it or what have you\n[noise] it takes all kinds of people but this one I when I saw just today I thought it had to make sure this is not you know some satire sight and it isn't\nClimate deniers making these storms worse by stopping action on climate change so see\nIf we hadn't just not gotten out of the Paris climate accord and if if Trump ... trumpet stop making fun of the UN's ... plant and dental whatever it is on climate change\nThen the hurricanes and get their message in a hurricane to go somewhere else they're hurricanes wouldn't get so strong but the hurricanes no hurricanes know that they're attacking Republican voters who therefore don't believe in climate change their hurricanes are targeting people for destruction of wiping them out and these people need to know that they're making it happen because of the way they vote\nHow absurd how to pending\nHow I heard a leap politically partisan by the way it was it was getting ... book on it like clockwork\nJust today here come more intense report suddenly UN's inter governmental panel on climate\nChange we've only got eleven years this is it

women lie anyway and you are now saying\n\nThat a charge was dropped because a witness who came forward and committed perjury perjury before a grand jury\n\nDon't worry Harvey Weinstein Stiller creepy

Wednesday nights campaign rally in Pennsylvania Trump told the crowd there had been collusion he said well if you look at it when you think of it there was collusion between Hillary and the Democrats and Russia there was collusion\nThere was a lot of collusion with Russia and lots of other people by the way and he's right what he's talking about here is the Clinton campaign the Democratic National Committee hired fusion GPS founded by Glenn Sampson who's refusing subpoenas to testify to Congress claiming the Fifth Amendment\nFusion GPS took the money from the Clinton campaign the DNC and went to a law firm cut out called Perkins ... this was done to make Hillary and the DNC money to look like they were buying a legal advice and campaign advice but\nThe law firms then follow the money after

collusion between Trump and Russia to many of his old knows but that's what Trump's for learning to and Trump is exactly right the collusion here between anybody in Russia is the Hillary Clinton campaign the DNC\nAnd the route is Hillary Clinton DNC\nTo I'm a\nFusion GPS then on to ... and then just deals with the money still got went through a bunch of different layers before he got it but

would suggest a so called blue wave in which most house and Senate seats in play will likely till Democrat and it's in line with the twenty Jenna Republican numbers around now\nYet yet now we pointed out\nThat all of these national generic polls show this gigantic way would if you go race by race\nIf you go into the state's district by district you don't see this way you don't see the evidence in the polling and people\nI've been asked well how can this how can this disparity be how can you have a generic ballots that shows that Democrats plus proper plus Thirteen but then you don't find any

the media interested in the story even after he was charged and convicted and put on trial and the reason is that correct guys know\nWhat's the worst thing that ever happened to people who want to keep abortion thought of and\nCategorized as something other than what it is\nThe media wouldn't cover it and nor the trials very much there have been a lot of people who didn't covered Michele market was one of the leaders also people at the like and more see an hot air was was hot on the trail of guys and I think they wrote over a hundred and sixty\nDifferent articles so the trick has been how do you do a movie about this how do you get it made me ... movie equals Hollywood how do you get stars had to get people to start at how do you get money to finance that how do you get it made and how do you get a distributed and how do you find the theaters\nThat will exhibits that thing how do you do or and they they ran into every predictable problem that you can imagine but they persisted and they got it done and the way they got this ... this is a movie about the trial of ... guys now it's it's it's a\nIt's a procedural moving like a procedural crop cop show crime in a cop show on TV meaning it follows a formula\nIt doesn't get overtly political it doesn't it doesn't want to limit the audience by getting political even with a trial this movie has a rating of PG Thirteen and it's about wanting abortion murder there is not a lot of\nHardly any abhorrent Gore and violence\nIn the movie it's it's ... picked him in a in other ways it's not meant to shock it's meant to entertain and educate\nIt's an attempt to you is a movie\nIn a responsible way to do things that movies are supposed to do entertain entertain entertain enlighten maybe informed it's not the political movie that the left would make\nAbout a story like this it can avoid the politics but it is exceptionally\nWell done for the subject matter you're you're not going to be if you go see it you're not going to be watching people advocating for a\nCause you're not going to see a movie designed to separate you from your money in terms of political fundraising you're gonna see Hollywood professionals who happens to be pro life producing a movie about something that really happened a mass murderer\nHe was a mass murderer of people in the womb\nThat nobody on the left wanted anybody to know about\nWhat he did ... guys now was despicable but he was a charming guy even engaging smile and laugh and even and his trial it was said that he was charming people now are old buddy Nick Searcy\nDirected this and\nI don't know anything about directing movies but I can imagine\nSome of the challenges in in a movie like this you don't want to preach and you don't want to make your movie target but you want to be truthful about it and you want\nThe message to be delivered\nBut you don't want to turn people off you don't want people to think that you're being they're they're they're being preached or any of that\nAnd so the way I looked at it I didn't I didn't see Nick Searcy use a bunch of special effects or other things to distract you just let the story tell itself and it's basically the trial there some set up the story\nItself is all anybody needs to know the number one mass murder in America which he was never referred to as as because of course the\nLeft abortion is not even human it's a viable tissue mass or what have you ah it's got\nStars people that you know people who put their careers on the line to star in this movie the odds are that they're going to have trouble getting cast and other movies having been identified with is dean Cain has won\nThe ah the actor who plays a guy's now himself as a as an actor in a I think ... commercials name as Earl Billings\nAnd for somebody that's only widely known as an actor in TV commercial this guy does one heck of a job it's probably the finest\nRole of these players are the best performance that he's had a I Would guess a as an actor but I just want to let you know that if it if you're thinking about going to it's PG Thirteen we're not talking acts we're not we're not even talking\nOurs here so you're not gonna be immersed in a bunch of\nRepulsive Gore and again it's it's thought that they don't need to do that tell this story about the story itself tells itself\nThe trial of America's biggest serial killer there are a lot of people who have\nPut everything in their careers on the line to get the movie made they got it made a lot of people who put their careers and the line agreeing to appear and start even Searcy a
