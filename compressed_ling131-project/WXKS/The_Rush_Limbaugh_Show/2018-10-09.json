the size of crowds at political rallies\nThese Trump rallies are not telling us that it doesn't mean anything he's or just rabbit people upset with their lives and they think Trump is going to kick all of people out of the country they don't like it's nothing it's not anywhere near representative\nOf the population is is what they all said that every Trump rally privately\nDo not doubt me privately they were jealous if they can be and they were the thing\nBecause there's not a one of them on the Democratic side who could come anywhere close to ... that kind of excitement that kind of loyalty and knows sized crowds\nObama couldn't do it not in two thousand sixteen\nHillary couldn't do it ever but certainly not in two thousand she couldn't she couldn't she couldn't draw flies there her book signing ceremonies Hillary Clinton who couldn't draw a crowd anywhere good people knew she might not be able to stand up for a full twenty five minutes\nWithout some ain't coming out the proper up by the albums\nBut seriously I guarantee you they were looking at those crowds they were looking at those Trump rallies and they would never say so publicly but they were scared to death by them they would never say so publicly that would never admit it publicly they would say just the opposite but they're human\nBeings in any kind any anytime anybody in politics has that kind of popularity and that kind of loyalty that equals jealousy envy and anger and all things that attached to jealousy\nAnd that'd be they have the Trump to begin with and the fact that Trump was turning

headline\nFrom political [noise] just just today political story ready for this political race ratings than GOP house is crumbling here is the sub the headline Mr ... there are now\nTwo hundred nine seats either firmly already leaning in the Democratic column only nine shy of the two hundred eight team needed to win control this is what you were just telling me right and you've got Republicans telling you that they think this is true\nSome\nI'm not asking for names but you've got some elected Republicans are people in their offices telling you they believe this\nOkay so political says the GOP house is crumbling it's falling apart there are\nTwo hundred nine seats\nFirmly order wing Democrat I guess this is according to polling data to hundred eight team is the number of seats you need for the majority in the house or four hundred and thirty five total numbers there to eight teams the majority\nSo\nWritten seats firmly are leading Democrats I mean this is the Democrats [laughter] nine seats\nWith this this is a white\nBy the Republican Party would have to be a party of for this to happen a party of Adolf Hitler's\nJust did this and yet they believe it now\nFolks I don't have an insider information on this I don't know anybody with internal polling get I don't know I don't know beans I don't I don't really pay attention to that I never have but the people who are watching it live and die by their stuff I'm telling you\nIt is their blood and water and food polling David it's how they get through the day every day pulling anything and if the Democrats\nAre publishing stories to each other that two thirds nine seats are leaving their way and if there is no blue wave I don't think there's going to be an ounce obscenity anywhere to be found on the Democrats' side of the Iowa or in the media\nTo hundred nine seats firmly or leaning\nIn the Democratic column let me ask you a question what could be causing this\nLet's let's assume for a moment just as a as a

night two thousand sixteen they can't wait to get out there and showed their ... for Trump and the only way they can do it has to vote against Republicans\nAll right well\nAs I say we're hypothetically pretending this is true what has Trump done to generate that\nKind of disgust other than the alive and be president what has he done no no I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm being serious what you want to take it\nAll started when he said he separated families at the border I'm Glad you reminded me of that\nIt's getting harder and harder to watch television shows what was I watching me or you
