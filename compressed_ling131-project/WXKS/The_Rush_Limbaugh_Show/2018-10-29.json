now it's blamed Trump everything everything at all what ever it is blame Donald Trump\nBlame me blame you blame anybody that supported Donald Trump\nAnd frankly I Walk out with this reaction I have had it I Am fed up with it's been this way for years there were showed up during the Obama administration there were mass murders Emmett no time did the drive by media ever try to link any of it to Obama\nAnd yet [noise] people have forgotten\nWasn't inflammatory just say the Republicans were going to be responsible for millions of deaths if Obamacare was not passing it along anybody remember that because I sure as hell do because I was set up on it then\nWe're trying\nTo oppose a government takeover of one of the great industries in America better than anywhere else in the world are trying to take a to prevent a bunch of incompetence a bunch of government bureaucrats in the left wing politicians from taking over in the American health care system\nMeanwhile Obama is lying to everybody about it claiming that if they like their doctor keep their plan they didn't get get get to and that their premiums are going to be reduced by twenty five hundred dollars a year or lie after lie after lie not called out not reported\nAnd then the Republicans come along and try to oppose it on subsidies grounds and the Democrats and the media start running around talking about how the Republicans are going to be responsible for the deaths of millions of people you want to tell me that's inflammatory or not\nHow many years have average ordinary Americans had to listen to this like you and I have\nWhere every time something happens that Democrats politicize literally everything and that's why none of this stuff ever gets fixed\nIt's why none of this stuff is ever going to get resolved until this politicization of everything stops in other words you have some guy who's been mentally ill for ten Fifteen Years [laughter] excuse me\nThen decides to take action and all of a sudden it's ... it's the fault of a political party or it's the fault of a president's and and so predictable 'cause they hate the president will do and then they can to get rid of him they spent two years trying to get rid of him they fail to get rid of him they're fit to be tied over their failure\nThey're ratcheting up this this anger and if it were getting so far away from the notion that whoever did it is the person that\nWe're getting to the point where in this country because we politicize everything nobody's responsible for what they do whatever anybody does it's because of the politics of the Republican Party or the conservative movement\nAs far as the drive by meeting is concerned it's not because somebody is mentally ill disturbed who knows what's been going on in their lives the media doesn't care about that except to the extent they can link the Trump\n\nWell I I for one am am fed up with it I Am sick of this reaction to\nEvery freaking event even\nThough whether we can even get away from it from the women are extreme weather happens it's our fault it's the problem of the Republicans or Trump because we don't sign on to this asinine manmade global warming

against Donald Trump you may you must not believe like Nate Silver says eighty five percent chance that you're going to take the house\n\nNo you have to take these too sad unfortunate events in and build them up into somehow they are Donald Trump's fault and this is why you should vote against Republicans in the midterms\nI can tell you right now\nI mean a ... do not know it from\nA ... hands on knowledge I'm just telling my gut is that there are millions of Americans once this stuff starts they tune it out they're fed up of being blamed they're fed up with the people they love and support being blamed they're fed up with their country being blamed\nAnd so they just they just tune it out\nThey think about all of the mass shootings have cops\nBack during the Obama those and those were

Koch brothers\nThey're re Wichita energy from and family\nAnd David Koch in his lab Julia donated funny the five million dollars to some New York hospital the nurses association and other

donation wants to cover his racism and hide it so people didn't really see\nThis is who the left is so they even reject acts of charity as\nIll motivated why does somebody seem that way\nWhat wouldn't make those nurses think that way I submit to you that it is the drive by media\nI submit to you that it is their union leaders and maybe instructors teachers they have in school were not even\nA

change his mind about what he believes because you say it's really not about guns he thinks it is in his supporter but it's not really about guns it's about\nSomething much larger than that it's about

much anti Israeli\nSentiment among Jewish people in America that are predominantly liberal people scratch their heads and don't quite understand that\n'cause it's a ... because it's an anti that religion it's not anti Iran they still need the race in order to have racial politics\nBut it's in the ... air time the religion\nYeah because you can't separate the Jewish state from my religion I don't think you can and it you know any any time you're Jewish\nAnd you're in a you know you're in a liberal you're in a conversation with liver on Israel comes that no way that I said this flame or I'm Jewish\nBut I totally disagree with everything is there a feeling that ... that comes up and that it's really sad\nBut isn't that more disagreeing with the politics is associated with with Israel is a book because if they're inside the religion\nThat's big I mean the the Jewish religion I mean you've got the reform an orthodox and and the other branches how many\nDifferent flavor [laughter] um yeah but I\nI I don't I used I used to feel that way but I feel like it but yeah with a push toward atheist I mean you see that they're anti Christian Tito um I don't\nEven necessarily being seeing Islam but I you know but I did see it and I thought\nThis that's exactly right and this is where this is all headed this is all headed towards atheism anti God that's exactly what is a unifying the people on the left whatever they claim their religious views are the\nTrend is towards atheism and no God or at least agnostic ... because that removes any judgmental ism right it removes any limits on behavioral morality or anything else if there is no ultimate\nPower that can meet out approve or disapprove or for once X. men one is totally free correct\nAbsolutely\nWell I I just I'm so you have this of this event in Pittsburgh given everything\nElse that you say that you are\nAll the liberalism the creek in to Judaism and a rising anti Semitism you're right it's it's anti Semitism is rising in Germany and nobody's talking about it it's rising throughout Europe and there aren't very many people talking about it so this event in Pittsburgh did it did it\nAdds to any of the uh discomfort or on the eve you're having about things in general\nAnd I I don't\nI don't feel like that there's a ... million people out there targeting\nI'd choose and the way that they would want to go she got the thing that I think that that these are isolated is an incident in this country because of the country it's so good at that so many people I mean this guy is facing the death penalty he he ... he certainly wouldn't be facing the death penalty anywhere else\nAnd I I mean I Know I don't feel unsafe as a person who is Jewish walking down the street because I'm Jewish\nI and I and I obviously don't think I'd Trump has anything to do with it at that absolutely ridiculous and it's it's not going to make me not vote in the ... or anything silly like that\nI Am glad used because I'll tell you there's a lot of people that think and they're predominant by thank you thank you so much Rachel I purchased racial Thousand Oaks California [noise] um\n[noise] I don't think these events are going to have anything to do with the midterms [noise] a lot of people do\nA lot of people think it's going to dampen a turnout what you you think I'm wrong or you\nKnow I don't think it's going to have a thing to do with them in terms like ... now after Caesar say a dare I say this\nYear I put my hands together and look to the lord and do I say this\nCaesar sidewalk\nAnd his pipe bombs none of exploded what do you think the odds are that the drive by and the Democrats are thinking well I don't have to ask as we know what we had people talking about how that whole thing last week was suppressing turnout remember and even Trump alluded\nTo the fact that that story was maybe going to dampen some people's enthusiasm remember that OK well there were some people I'm sure not too unhappy about\nThat [noise] and then the second event happened on Saturday in Pittsburgh and\nIt was me to the people to politicize everything\nAnd\nThat's the people I'm Talking about and that would be the media and the American left ... people look politicized and of course you've got extremists out there in in the fringes everywhere who irrationally try to explain things away\nBut the people at politicize everything who look at both events through a political mountains\n\nHad to be thinking are right now this is going to this is going to really help us in the midterms this was going to dampen turns going to dampen enthusiasm for Trump I have\nI have an entirely different fits why I did the show open today that I did I don't think it's going to have that impact on people in fact\nI think the media in their natural state drives more people to Trump each and every day and I think they've been doing it since the Sunday talk shows yesterday with this\nThe attempt to politicize this the attempt to blame Trump for this\nThey can't help themselves they have spent the past two and a half years trying to get rid of Donald Trump they have thrown everything they know\nInto the public domain hoping to influence people do abandon Trump and it has who happens to these two events come along and they but I this is that this has to be what it is they're thinking [laughter] and they just can't help themselves they start blaming Trump for the synagogue shooting started\nAsking the president what he's going to do about guns as you have a different view on it as though he somehow responsible and what it does it portrays it gives away the fact that as far as the American the left is concerned everything centers around Washington\nThat Washington is the solution for everything and how is Washington disillusion Washington is the solution because Washington is where\nThe enemies of the laughter going to be punished\nIs where the enemies of the left are going to be dealt with that's the role of government as far as the leftist concern government as an agent of power to enforce punitive punishing policies on the enemies of the American left that's its purpose so a shooting anywhere it takes place Phillips says\nWhat's the president's going to do it by the president nothing to do with it in the first place\nThe president has nothing to do with gun control laws except as a supporter or opponent Congress writes the laws but the idea\nThat Washington should be able to command anything at any time is what the left wants with the White House that's how they want to use it that's what its purpose is\nAnd onto the bottom line last\nRacking my on\nFox News I'm Chris foster the medical use of murdering eleven people at a synagogue in Pittsburgh Saturdays now been released
