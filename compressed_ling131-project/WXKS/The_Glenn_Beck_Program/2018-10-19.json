people\nTo come up and try and get to the border election day\nFor your boss I was reading about the makeup of the care of it too earlier um some of them are children with their parents many of them are children unaccompanied by their parents so I Try to figure out All right out in that\nOccur at home did you did the parents just say hey you know what time for you to walk to the United states and I want you to walk in that group of people\nAnd here's a guy and paying seven thousand dollars to walk you know somewhere in the group with you and he'd get you across the border is that what you're doing or you just you're in trusting your children to who knows what ... where's the personal responsibility of the parents here yeah I mean there's gotta be something\nThere is and I think their case would be or at least the case the left would make on their behalf would be uh the you know things are so bad so\nBad in Honduras Guatemala I mean they can get a lot worse you can be killed or on the way here you could be molested on the way here somebody may not be there on the other side of the border you I mean there's so many things that could go wrong you talk about a helicopter parents I mean that's pretty much the opposite\nLike to say that we talked about this yesterday\nI you know letting my kid walk who step and walk the uh the dog up the street not the whole street but part of the street yeah I mean you know hawking over him the entire time makes me as a parent freak out\nI told the story a few times I you know we live in a neighborhood at the at the end of our a block in there there's there's a giant bond there in a green area because it's a common to the everybody in the neighborhood and when my daughter was sixteen she said that I'm just I'm going to walk down to the pond like\nAlone [laughter] without your rather [laughter] no [laughter]\n[laughter] what do you stop and think about how you know\nPretty protective ... yeah exactly I\nI don't let them walk down to the end of the block let alone hey why don't you walk to Honduras\nWith a group of people that I don't know [laughter] oh look there are situations you could argue right like if you were in a you know you're in North Korea right and you had a chance to get your kid out you probably pulled the trigger on that whether you ever see them again or not right there in certain level of this and and that's not to say that none of the people\nIn these situations are like this or is there probably are some but it it's just ... you try to\nIt's the same thing with the dreamers right they they try to give you the picture of ... everyone is a four year old who came across the border right in reality like most of them are teenagers most of them were sixteen and Seventeen years old\nThat this is a different it's a different story a and\nYou just wonder first of all why you would do this because it's a gift to Donald Trump if you want to talk about a hardening the borders\nThis is an easy way to get people together to do that mhm when people hear a story like that it it does not soften their hearts that makes people say whoa this it you know because the word invasion gets used with illegal immigration or sometimes from people who oppose it uh you know in a hawkish manner ... right\nAnd you know like I mean for a thousand people are kind of qualified right like four dozen people coming across the border it whether you like it or not feels like an invasion right\nIt feels like waiting does there just top like they're they're taught the only way they can do anything hears over running but we have right let the overriding the security\nThey they're they're you're coming in or do the right way or the overriding security and you see that Mexico does not want to deal with this but they know that they're they're not the end they're not the end location so they can let them into Mexico and\nSay well you guys to apply for a for asylum and in six months to come back for that for that hearing and of course they're just gonna keep walking north\nAnd it's interesting how other countries deal with this and yet the vitriol directed at us for trying to deal with it in just even a\nFairly reasonable way every time we do worry were hateful uh were uncaring were racist whereas Mexico certainly protect their border or do you remember what Felipe Calderon said when he came to the United states and he was trying to influence our immigration policy of\nCourse if somebody's snakes them from Nicaragua or some other country in Central America through the southern border of Mexico they wind up in Mexico they can go get a job they go and work\nIf somebody do that without permission ... that were sent back then\nThey ... they send back them they then back if they do it without permissions they send back them but we can't uh were expected to just accept everybody we don't know who they are we don't know what they're doing and we don't know what they bring to U.S Mexico has a pretty stiff immigration law they've got to streamline law\nThat insurers foreign visitors and immigrants\nAre in the country legally have the means to sustain themselves\nEconomically they're not destined to be burdens on society they are of economic and social benefit to society\nWeight you're you expect your immigrants to contribute their own good character no criminal background and their contributors to the general welfare and well being of the nation or they make sure that they don't have any sort of a\nCriminal record they make sure they do have visas they make sure they they ban foreign visitors from interfering in the country's internal politics\nAs I mean can you think of it I mean how many illegal immigrants protests have there been where they're waving the Mexican flags in our faces where they're demanding rights or that they think they have coming to them\nIn Mexico you can't even go can't interfere in their in internal politics plus\nIf they think that you're going to throw off the balance of their demographics may deport I mean that's a [noise] a\nLately racist right I mean like that is not yet so it's not an argument there\nWe would never know you can't do that you can't do that and know should you you shouldn't be like well I Would like this percentage of African Americans in this present we want to make sure we're still keep Seventy or eighty percent

amazing actors now remember I didn't realize to keep that it's not just El Paso and all of a sudden the calendar ... this is all over Texas is apparently what's true here yeah um and and one of the things I Would love to do today\nTo see to test this it\nIs it true that there is no example of someone named Robert Albert Gilbert or a baritone who was not named\nOr what they eat it looks so if you were Gilbert people call you Gilbert apparently to ... do you do not exist you were not a person you're not a it's like we just we have no evidence that you exist so if you happen to be a Robert an

ah we're here talking about a Beto O'Rourke at Ted Cruz and the Texas Senate battle\nA lot of people calling in and saying that they knew a lot of people who are white and not named Beto in the communities that he talked about on CNN last night and then there's ...\nIt could be a regional thing I Know there's a lot of differences between north and south I mean people look at you know figures like a Abraham Lincoln and better we leave and all these people who are uh you know from the\nDifferent cultures differently from where they are so I think that that's something that we can kind of

Hill now he had nothing to do with us at all\nAlthough surely if you watch CNN Today he will be you know blamed for it excoriated the hours are it's just something unrelated group running an ad in support of French ... which is part of our ridiculous campaign finance laws situation\nAnd where people when they want to donate more money than the the maximum which is completely unconstitutional to have in this country or when people want to do that they give it to super PACs and they run ads on the behalf of the candidate that has no control over those ads so this is an ad being run in Arkansas\nIt's a it's related to Brett Kavanaugh and it's being criticized I don't know if you can detect anything here pat I Would like to get your call and whether you can detect anything it seems a little odd to here and here is the ad from the group supporting French all\nWhat do you think about what's happening in Washington Congress may French and the Republican no but it's dangerous to change the presumption of innocence to a presumption of guilt especially for black me\nThat Democrats can do that to a white justice at the Supreme Court with no ... no cooperation and witnesses

that\nYou know we we one of the biggest reasons Beto is you know in the public eye in the in the United states and not just the Texas figure is because of this video he made\nAbout it's ... it's a great idea to Neal or for the national anthem and what's behind that story people like Colin Kaepernick saying that black people are being unfairly accused without evidence and being shot in the

I I think Ted winds up winning by maybe ten points or more I think it'll be a double digit\nI think that's a good chance of that um I wouldn't be surprised to see six to ten\n... you know um I wouldn't be surprised I think it'll be much closer to barely comfortable yeah for I think that's where he stands right now yeah uh Arizona is razor thin margin is right now but it's I think it's trending well for the Republican they're like Sally I think a ... you've got toss ups in states like Nevada\nAnd Missouri and Florida and ... mindset Montana seems to be leaning a little bit to the Democrat but I wouldn't even put that on the top ... yeah well I saw it's close but um they pretty much a toss up race but\nThose are I mean Florida is a complete ... reason for the Democrats to continually when in Montana I don't understand it I don't know how to do away for junior I mean I'm Talking about West Virginia here\nI think Joe mansion ah probably sealed his reelection with his cabinet vote which was for Kavanaugh the only Democrat who did that as young as ... they're all bumped up up the system when I have to\nUm I don't believe it I mean you look at his voting record he's worse than every single Republican think about this he complain about Mitch McConnell you complain about a Susan Collins you complain about a summer cold Lisa Murkowski\nJoe mansions voting record is much worse than all of them all of them yeah it's not even close I mean Mitch McConnell is like the biggest conservative of all time I mean for\nA Democrat he's he's moderate he's the most moderate Democrat yeah but I mean that's not saying much because I'm a crafts are now communist again or social listening communist yeah\nI mean the most part you think about Jeff Flake here's a guy who's getting flooded so so much by the White House and buy or the conservative media that he is resigning and not even trying to fight for head for that seat that the seat and mix Sally is running for\nA well he votes with the president and more often than Joe Manchin it's not even close yeah\nYou know again ... West Virginia is a state it's probably the most pro Trump state in the union\nHe won in West Virginia by almost thirty ... thirty I think yeah and you know this is like it's ... they would go for I mean I mentioned got a big name in West Virginia again if you want to pick a Democrat in the Senate\nOr you know you probably mentioned would be the guy you'd be most optimistic for he voted even more I mean high capable almost certainly is going to lose now in North Dakota\nBut I mean in in\nWest Virginia got mentioned you got his cabinet vote you have a couple of it but again this is a guy who voted for Obama carries he's uh he's he is a Democrat and this is not a\nHe's a moderate Democrat as compared to Alexandria Ocasio Cortez but is that what West Virginia actually once you wouldn't think so apparently cell though he seems to be leading in the polls it is an interesting development there\nAre but I did a winnable she'll be winnable seat in this environment or right now mentions leading that won fairly comfortable but even without the mansion seat you're in a year at a I think you can get to fifty three fifty four without going crazy and I think you can get two fifty to fifty one it would be a\nReal surprise if they lost the Senate at this point I mean I think there's a good you know eighty percent chance that they are I mean most models are showing about an eighty percent chance they hold it and I think that's a I think that's safe assumption\nYeah interestingly I you know when you mentioned Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota she's down by eight point seven now yeah the average is eight point seven points to the Republican Kevin ... so yeah that is looking pretty good yeah my pursuit there I think honestly you had two races decided\nBy the cabinet vote one was a mansion ... high temp her vote against that sealed it I think I don't think she's ... I don't think she can win that race so\nI don't think she can win that race I think she's going to lose it I think she's going to lose a pretty big I would not be surprised as you said a double digits situation happens there\nYeah look again North Dakota's conservative state ... are they are looking at high camp and you know I think a lot of people like to say well he's got this one Democrat this is one we've got the one good Democrat I think people like to say that you know I think states in general like to say well we're not partisan we've got you know democratic governor we've got a democratic senator\nAnd there's something there's some level of pride there to say like we're not only voting one way\nWhen you vote against Brett Kavanaugh in those circumstances would the arguments she used this is not someone who is a borderline Democrat this is someone who is embracing the same sort of standards you're seeing from\nCory Booker and Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi and all of these far left figures and good for North Dakota and for Jetta sing her as a a as a result of that it looks that way good yeah it looks that way yeah\nYeah there's some uh optimistic things there it could but the dangers there as well I mean this this is going to be an interesting one and ... and the thing that's really unfortunate is if if all that happens\nIs let's say the result is and I think this will be a good result for Republicans right now which is you get fifty three or fifty four senators in there and you lose the house but you lose it narrowly you look at let's say by eight or ten a seat you have a minority you might be able to get some stuff through in\nCertain circumstances but it's going to be difficult and I think there's going to be almost nothing they can get through\n... nothing with the exception of maybe some bipartisan spending bills which still find ways to get those ... I'm sure of it\nBut other than that you're gonna get any real advantage not going to need a tech stuff you're you're gonna ... tough times with any regulation\nYou're going to get ... you know none of this stuff is going to be easy as long as you keep renting a massive deficit you'll get all those bills through yeah chest just keep spending money and they'll vote for it yeah yeah it's not a problem to show you the house at how dramatic it is at least by the polls look and I know you're going to say well the polls got the last thing wrong well some of it they got right\nA and a lot of it they got rain including the popular vote by the way which is what they were actually trying to predict in the national bulls some of the staples were totally off though so we don't know well this whole we're not sure but right now the models are showing\n'em there is a like a point one percent chance that the Democrats could pick up eighty three seats now it's a point one percent chance to really unlikely like you say that that uh\nAnd then go and say the key is to use the pin update your software and only send money to people you know\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nFox News I'm Chris foster their reports in Turkey that employees of the Saudi consulate were journalist disappeared were being question today\nThat keep touching a transparent investigation into the disappearance of Jamal ... foreign minister ... saying we will shed the results but the whole world but he just missed reports claiming techie has passed an audio recording to the United states capturing the ...
