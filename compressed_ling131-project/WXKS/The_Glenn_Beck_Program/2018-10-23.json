first of all early voting um we're seeing this massive turnout in a you know in Houston and in Dallas uh ... what does this or what does this tell you and how's the turnout the rally around the rest of the state\nWhere this might be frustrating because the true answer is it's too early to tell right here is what we don't know and and that is is it safe ... running of what the overall vote total will be or\nIs it a massive wave vote for your listeners what we're seeing with regard to the turnout is a ... records are not just or mid term elections which is what the stairs up but in many of these locations are the first day of voting exceeds\nThe amount of votes that took place in the presidential election on the very first day and so all we know is this and that is a massive\nNumber of people are turning out to vote will know it was called but do mania orbits conservatives are saying oh we're afraid of this caravan that's coming up here and we want to make sure people who simply to stop it\nUh but here's all I can tell your audience and that is if you care about the future of Texas it would be clear about the future of America or you could not sit on the sidelines this election where because there are other people out there\nWho were casting those who might be hostile to you and your values your value must be counted at the ballot box if you're listening this me to make sure\nYou go vote because a lot of other people are going to vote\nSo a governor and a lot of times people have said this is the most important election of your life and I was thinking about this last night I always hated that praise\nBut in this particular case we are now seeing the masks come off now we're seeing people who say you know no to capitalism no to the constitution I'm a democratic socialist um this soon as a game changing a ... a election is it ...\n... e captured the U.S it was very correctly because it just to be here in Texas and maybe some\nPlaces are the Democrats are either ran under no label or they would call themselves a conservative Democrat and then they were a liberal and then they were progressive and now they're openly or lifting themselves as\nSocialist and and get this because it's not just in Texas are the leading candidate for governor in Florida a isn't out and now he says he is a\nSocialist and end the Bernie Sanders style of socialism is not even further to the left in the same things happening with regard to governors' races and other key races across the entire United States of America and even here in Texas or some people may not be\nCalling themselves the socialist but when you look at their policies such as the open border policies\nThat is so stupid as a a with a look at the uh wealth distribution policies that is socialism and these people don't realize and that is socialism is real out there that we see it in Venezuela where the reported inflation rate and Venezuela is over a million percent\nAnd so it's just crazy what's going on and that is why your listeners need to understand that they have the power to make sure the state in this country remain on the right track by going to vote cast your vote\nI don't I don't think people understand conservatives understand how close this state is to flipping blue\nThere's ... there's only a few counties that are really a a lynchpin here and uh the you know unbeknownst to most people is Soros has dumped millions of dollars into this state for a long term plan of of turning us into California\nWhere you're writing in so many of your listeners need to understand this is George Soros has been involved in Texas elections for the past couple of cycles [noise] uh two years ago he gave a ... million dollars\nA directly to a candidate in Harris County down in Houston but this year we paid a million dollars directly to candidates in San Antonio on top of that you\nAs bonded these grand games to get out the vote and so he is trying to turn Texas a into\nCalifornia and that's on top of all this money pouring in from California pretending as like that so uh but let's go back to the first part of your questions\nAnd listeners think about this all the large cities where the population basis or the state of Texas or really blew cities and counties you have a Dallas year after year and you have San Antonio you have ... El Paso and so you have these massive\nBlue regions across the state of Texas that makes it so much harder for people who are conservative people uh who are Republican to be able to\nCobble together

[noise]\nDid they finally find them murdered journalist body I'm Dave Anthony Fox News parts Jamal 'cause she'll get been found sky news reports and he stands all Turkey's president calls it a Savage murder at the council it's the Saudi conflict premeditated\nA I think the more interesting race those the ones\nFor attorney general in Minnesota we know this one because Keith Ellison is running and normally I don't think we talk about a specific attorney general race it's not necessarily national interest is one with Keith Ellison I think is\nAlison was up by five points in the last poll however that Paul happened right before all these sort of accusations started flowing against keeps that will not true though is it\nHim in the bathroom with the guy is that true [laughter]\nI don't know what allegations that is I don't there was a new allegations that I Want to repeat it I Believe you're thinking if Cory Booker there was an all of them in our area do yes yes you are a little bit or that one or not true is it I mean I don't as I think you should all these things do you are innocent until proven yet is the same in charge against Cory Booker right one person making\nYou know and then there's people making these things about every ... every month which is why by the way you don't believe all women and race I Believe it's a man that ... well we don't believe all women we don't believe all accusations correct particularly against powerful people because there's incentive there to make them for 'em so you know that's the way I think you're supposed to handle it\nI innocent until proven guilty is a thing\nA and I think with not only a Cory Booker but also also Keith Ellison I think you have to look at those things with some level of skepticism by the time these relationships break up and there's\nThings said and who knows there's much more evidence however with Keith Ellison delegation huge evident it's not even close to comparing what would they were talking about with capital and everyone you know half the country believes\nCabinet should be you know I don't put in prison for what happened so what's interesting here is the Democratic party\nHas completely abandoned their believe all women saying when it comes to ... they don't care about it he thousand can do it every once they've completely ignored these allegations so it was fascinating it's the people of Minnesota don't seem to be doing the same thing\nNow remember Alison was up by five points before these things happens latest poll came out he now trails forty three to thirty six he's now down by seven points soda wow this is a powerful Democrat one of the top people from the DNC a very well known is on TV all the\nTime and he's she's credible she's a Democrat she doesn't have an axe to grind Jimmy\nDated him for a very long time there's video there's witnesses\nThere's Dr reports at the time uh and she again is a very reluctant witness who doesn't want to hurt to the Democratic party she'd rather have Allison out in another Democrat when she doesn't right if I wanted to win for I mean it's just crazy yeah it's\nAn amazing wants to that one forty three thirty six is a surprise I mean that is not something that I think anybody certainly the Democrats when they felt they had Alison running for that post they thought they had that wrapped up\nA instead is forty three thirty six so right now we have the Senate control thing we can talk about real quick before we go\nAh there's a if you're looking at right now a forty a four seats are that are safe for Republicans at thirty seven for Democrats if you add in what you have a few it's forty six excuse me forty effect\nIf you add in the solid Republican seats in the leaning Republican seats you can get to fifty just by doing that you don't have to win any tossup races\nThat includes a Tennessee which is still very close to poll came out yesterday that had the Democrat up by one point though the overall it looks like a Republican is still a head there are black burn and then in Texas Phil leaning Republican though Cruz looks safer than you did a few ... a month or so ago\nIn the middle you've got to another six races that are toss ups that's going to give you if this holds up going to give you what is the levels of the advantage for Republicans if they can go three of six they're gonna be fifty three seats and expand their advantage if they if they can\nPull off six of six they're gonna have a big time advantage you get to get a lot of things past\nAh so you know at that level of whether it's ah him and they could lose it to that could easily still losing impossible\nBut that level of between fifty and fifty six is is kind of what we're talking about now and that you know that is a big difference uh so could be a major thing especially if you can hold on to the house which looks a little bit better than it did a couple of weeks ago but it's still on the unlikely side [noise]\nElection by numbers\nOn the ... that is that going back program\nAll right when I take a break and we'll tell you about our spots and then we come back and I'm going to tell you about\nI mean there's a real problem and you haven't even\nConsidered it to really know what you know that which is er out putting ... saw Donald Trump you know and which is our I'd ... did not know that you haven't been keeping track of all the ... the the which is that are putting X's on Donald Trump and\nAnd Ted Cruz and others and what are they what are the ... one of the ... actually intended to accomplish destroy them to destroy them yeah I have not seen this no oh okay well I've I've kind of brush set off myself I'm In I'm up on it but I kind of brushed it off I like I which is\nNo there is something else that we now have from a credible source that I think every American especially women need to be aware of what's coming up and just saying\nYou happen to see\nStories a [noise]\nA\nIMF financial warnings and the escalation in the ... in Hungary\nIs making the news ...\nHungary has increased its gold reserves by one thousand percent\nIn a due to increasing quote safety concerns this is the first time since Nineteen eighty six that Hungary's central bank is buying gold bullion and it's a lot of it up thirty one point five tons of gold\nAh they also have repatriated their gold from the bank of England to Budapest central banks in Europe are diversifying or moving in and repatriating to take possession of the gold in their own country\n... maybe talking about that for a while really ... those that\nAre hungry in Poland or the most recent central banks to do this but Austria the Netherlands and the Germans\nWere the first to do it uh they had been repatriating their gold from the bank of England and the Federal Reserve in recent months and years just bought it from gold but what about a lot easier right why us for it back when it doesn't really exist\nThe reason why repatriation of gold is dangerous is because of a word\nAnd write this down on no matter who do the very high path occasion thing again are you I'm just saying that brought it up when\nYou hear it your blood will run cold when you hear\nPeople actually talking about well the problem is ... that's when you had to the mountains [laughter]\nThat's when you know so that's the only reason why I bring this word up when you read about it in a serious way that they are now starting to discuss ... that's when you run for the hills okay\nRight now we're at the beginning of that possible wonderful thing by um you know everybody claiming their gold\nAnd who's gold really is it all and all of the central banks buying more gold\nShe ... what is it they know that perhaps you don't know\nMay I

marching with the Honduran flag\nIn protest that their Marxist government was ousted in Honduras\nWhat what do you call them is they're marching towards our border\nThey're not refugees they chose to leave their country they're finding their country\nThey were trying to get a do a political stunt\nSo what what are these people where did they get the money who's doing the supply chain how how do you even have the bathroom services all along the way who's providing medical aid so it's not a death march you can't march\nTwenty five hundred miles and expect everybody to be okay and in good

they're being trucked from place to place from ...\nA little opportunity to photo opportunity you pointed this out\nThere that I I didn't notice it initially but there's there's women walking with strollers and it's like well a stroller is not designed for a thousand mile walk down right like that's not how that happens in them or they're getting out there grouping up there for a couple of miles cameras get them then they get back in trucks and get an injury they drive\nLook at the ... video enroll at video again please tell me how many women use spot climbing into the back of the semi

I want to play some audio uh this is ... let me see if I can get the right one uh yeah I think it's a\nI think it's CNN and Cuomo can you play this here on what the military is going to do\nWhat we look it's not about whether you're going to have the right to do it that's why I waved away the idea about domestic law enforcement Rick if you put military down there we know what the God Forbid is in this situation\nHow was that good for anybody if cars you know you're not going to turn away thousands and thousands of people even if people start getting shot ... and what message does that send who wins and\nBut I don't think they're going to wind up in the country a wreck and can I don't think that it has to happen that way but I'll tell you what if you have if you have a must happen\nWhat do you think is is worse for America to have thousands of people come in that shouldn't be here and you have to chase them around and process in order to kill a bunch of people on the border who were coming in\nWanting passwords for America can\nYou give me your you're going to extremes here and I want to adopt something you said earlier which is the national guard approach National Guard troops are trained to deal with riots I expect to see military\nAnd National Guard and border patrol in riot gear that's how I expect this to be handled at the border if they're not coming in at entry points and to turn them away right there it's an invasion treated as an invasion turn way\nYou say this is an invading force these people they're not only legally [noise]\nNow the media is trying to say wait a minute wait a minute this is not an invasion invasion force and how can we turn these poor people away and I want you to listen\nTo all of the people on television that are now saying we are a

else a gang rapist\nWithout proof just recently\nNot a problem I thought that was okay now I thought that was fine and with him is Thirteen they are getting rapists wean no they are\nCertainly some of them are for sure well I think that's part of the anger and some of them are rapists\nYeah I think that's part of the thing of getting in you have to you have to rape to to join the rape and kill\nA

just\nTrump fever tree [laughter] nothing [laughter] it's not a big deal\nThey're killing people at four times the rate as of school shootings so if you think of him is Thirteen isn't an issue you probably don't think school shootings or an issue which I tend to hear a lot of people on the left speak very loudly ... about school shootings when they go on and what exactly is that cause\nUh for them so I mean I I like ... the real issue I mean and this goes to a deeper part of this which is\nYou it's not even if let's just say we thought they were all really good people we didn't know that there are any gang members in there that's to say that again come in that way you don't come in that way the that's the you have to have a process to be able to decide whether people should come into your country or not\nThat it's not are not hateful they've if you have a problem if you look at our if you look at you know a\nBlack Friday and say oh my gosh people are animals getting into a

going to be fascinating to watch because there was a good chance that you know as as Greg Abbott talked about that you know Mexico doesn't want to deal with the pressure from the United states and the ... issue they're going to try to find a place to settle them within Mexico so it's a good outcome\nThat are not on our borders cause you know what that is that's the Palestinian people yeah but we don't we don't know I mean I think the point of doing that it's uh not anger out right so you would think that they would do it in a way to avoid that and then you end is going to be very helpful\nAgain I mean the governor tech I I Know I Know that so I Know I I Know dumb reason to believe it's\nPossible but ... if it doesn't happen and they get here and try to over on the border this thing has got to be a mess because you'll have the media making it look like our our border guard are are\nAre National Guard of the worst people on earth and are not going to stand for it and I got a

being pushed to the side and and hidden by these tech company\nWhat platform you're keeping it all on buddy you what do you I mean you're going to Google Play I mean you're going going right into the hands of the beast or what are you doing to ensure that they they aren't um screwing with you and gathering information on on everybody else well\nWhat we were trying to do because I've heard a lot of people on our side say we need a conservative Facebook or we need a conservative Twitter yeah so what we're trying to do is find a realistic work around to the algorithm problem that's going on with some conservative content so we said you know if we can find all these great conservative publishers and say\nHey here's what we wanted to do we can all benefit from this by sharing content into one place on the video side everyone can benefit\nUm so yeah we will be at the mercy of Google Play and the apple store but I think this is a sort of the first step to be able to counter that suppression from YouTube and Facebook\nSo we have a conservative review we've talked to Breitbart we had a great meeting with Prager you last week they're on board obviously the blaze I Hope you guys come aboard as well\nAs the first time hearing of it but I Can't imagine we're not\nYeah so and what we're really doing is you know we're pulling the content from your Facebook page and from your YouTube so\nAh the blaze channel benefits because the view counts go back to you guys\nAnd the other thing that we wanted to do I'm In this where we're already starting to be introduced to other people so we have these great young conservative filmmakers who put out an amazing video content and no one sees it on YouTube or Facebook and so we said hey will be the platform for that you go out and produce it and then we'll work with our team in our network to make sure that\nUm you know half the country that wants to see this content can actually see your content so\nWhat do you think because I've done a lot of thinking on this uh first of all congratulations thanks um\nUh it is um [noise]\nUh this is something that I have wanted to do for about eight years and I think conservatives are just now starting to say\nHey wait a minute what was that idea about coming together [laughter] um because they're starting to see the writing on the wall a in many different directions\nOr so congratulations on doing that I fully support anybody who's trying to bring everybody together and protecting voices [noise] what do you say I'm to the objection that I have in my mind when people say we need a conservative Facebook\nNo we don't because that just puts us in another bubble right you know what I mean we need to be a if if it's known as a conservative thing only conservatives are going to go there\nSo how have you wrestled with that in your mind\nSo I think the first kick off for that was the Facebook documentary series that I did with the swamp so we had six members of the house Freedom Caucus and we followed them around the Capitol we talked about the big issues plaguing DC\nWe had a liberal and progressive groups sharing that Facebook series So Tim Canova who ran against Debbie Wasserman Schultz this is a Bernie Sanders ... light\nShared the swamp episodes and said I encourage all of my followers to see this and we did it in a way where we didn't put you know Republican or conservative next to these guys named it was all about the content\nAnd that's what a lot of these um younger conservative filmmakers are doing their libertarian leaning you know they're conservative leaning it's more about hey let's fix some of the big fundamental issues going on and then we can get into you know some of the more policy debates\nSo I think um that kind of content and then just presenting it in a really weak mobile application makes it easier for people to interact with the content\nHave you ah have you seen what's happening in Brazil with a with a young libertarians you know they they are looking at America going you\nKnow you can't sell that we can sell the libertarians to Staci into older and you know\nAll this freedom and talk that they're doing is not a not appealing to the the youth and they are making huge gains and headway because you know they're twenty somethings that have\nWho are are naturally attracted to freedom and said there's a better way to package this I think that's great and anything you're doing to encourage a you know twenty somethings to do that I think as time they take charge\nYeah I think so I think you know having the big conservative publishers on board um and does banding together you know with this program\nWe're going to find a lot of talented people out there who are you know frustrated who are amazing videographer isn't filmmakers who can go out there and shoot this content um and let them be the bridge to reach the next a conservative or libertarian generation\nSo ear the update dot com or let me let me I'm a switch topics with you because you know you have consulted a with candidates et cetera et cetera\n[noise] what do you think is coming our way to places first blue wave red wave no way\nYou might as well flip a coin so I live I it's funny I live ah three blocks behind the capital in DC so I Am I describe myself as being a spy behind enemy lines because D.C is Ninety\nFour percent Democrat so you know I talked to a lotta guys both sides of the aisle I'm In DC and you might as well flip a coin I mean there's Freedom Caucus guys who say\nRepublicans hold the house by but it's only by a couple of seats there's more people who have said oh it's you know it's going to be Democrats by a few seats\nI really don't know I I think what they are doing with the election is the media is getting so excited looking at this big national view but when you break down these individual races they are going to be far more competitive than what the media sang\nIt's always about local that as a the Kavanaugh saying coupled with Cortez coming out and saying you know capitalism is not going to be around forever the Democratic socialist the surrounding people while they're eating and shouting them down\nThey have the ... do you think the Democrats different than the leftist do you think the Democrats are waking up to holy cow who's in our bad\nYeah I was telling somebody earlier this week the orange he just needs to put out a video of all the people clawing at the door of the Supreme Court there is a big divide I think between like the old school you know Democrats all my parents' voted Democrat and I can you know continue to vote Democrats\nThan what's going on in D.C and people like Kamala Harris and Cory Booker I mean these are radical left is when I was filming a with a swamp out in Iowa I was in ... district and these are we went to a machine shop and these are life long you know Democrats a lot of them switched over to vote for President Trump\nBut I'm Talking to him and they go oh you know I
