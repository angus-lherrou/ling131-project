think that's your clean up after yourself there that's all you can do is clean up the mess afterwards\nAnd it's interesting too that the media is making a big deal out of every single time they talk about this guy they talk about him as if he's an American because they always say Washington Post reporter right or ... ... I think he just\nHe contributed to the Washington Post was he actually is he actually a staff member of the Washington Post columnist wasn't any or\nHe's written it's relatively new yeah because he had left there was a lot of problems over there he realized he might be on the wrong side of whatever internal craziness what's going on in Saudi Arabia so that that's fairly new and you know critics of Saudi Arabia I think have a have a\nFirst of all places in the American media that is just right like I mean ... that we are able to air those things are but also you know there's a lot of opposition to them\nAnd people don't I mean you know remember Saudi Arabia was like the main uh accusation made by Michael Moore in Fahrenheit ... was it for nine eleven was a feeling he's made like he's tried to capitalize on that so many times I Can't remember which one it is now but they're in it and I live in the first one the biggest political documentary of all time\nUp in that was just a giant conspiracy theory about how the bushes knew this guy like fifty years ago an all out of it and they're working with this group is working with the Saudis and was all about defending the Saudis and that's why you you know you don't know the truth about nine eleven um right so this is not a new\nAccusation and when it comes to Republicans working with Saudi Arabia but you know every president has worked with him for a very long time and it's something that we've been critical about for the business\nOur allies since Nineteen thirty three I think uh so yeah a really long time and this goes back to\nThe FDR administration so it's not just Trump who's been a\nFriendly I guess with Saudi Arabia certainly Bush was always always accused of that being too friendly with Saudi Arabia but Iraq Obama was plenty friendly with them to exactly I mean they've been allies for a long time and there is no way that Brock Obama would have done\nAnything a severe to Saudi Arabia by this point the announcer and wouldn't have done anything about this to a great point and it shows the problem with Ninety percent of the\nMedia coverage today the difference there is that they perceive\n... Obama as the intellectual deep thinker who is expensive right and we're never good I'm bringing Fahrenheit nine eleven again the big one of the other big criticisms of this was Bush was in school when he found out about nine eleven and he sat there and let the kids finished the book and then he he took the call and it took him like\nNine minutes before he ... he walked out of the\nRoom remembered this accusation and they they showed a large chunk of it and it was a big deal at the time you know like\nBut they saw Bush as the bad guy who who was who's incompetent Brock Obama waited what was it Seventy eight days when he knew were were Osama bin Laden was before he did anything and it was universally praised for this decision it was the most difficult decision and\nFive hundred years or ... or the way it was a decision made since Charlotte Charlotte me to go get the worst criminal on earth\nAh what is is a tough decision and in the minds of people who want to praise the decision\nBy the way we made a on about nine twelve two thousand one\nTo kill the guy right you know tens of thousands of military members signed up just to do that yeah they all knew I mean yes of course there was risking the mission like that but these are this is ... ... talk to any military members especially people who are serving at that time and they'll tell you\nThat was basically the reason I got into it yeah I mean you know a lot of people got in just to hopefully get the opportunity to take that shot\nSo it was not a difficult decision um but Brock Obama was an intellectual thinker he was a deep thinker that was just considering all these options and and weighing all these impossible choices and he finally came to the conclusion to go and and act on this\nThe opposite is what they feel about Trump now that the fact that Trump is going out there and saying wait a minute let's hold on a second let's get this evidence let's figure out exactly what's going on with investigate this before we act irrationally ... Obama was doing that it would be seen as he's a deep thinker he's not being reactionary with Trump is that he doesn't\nCare it's all about money and it's all about Saudi Arabia because Jared Kushner like Saudi Arabia or something it's just the you know\nThe the the overwhelming problem is that everybody seems to see everything through the lens of this one individual on our planet\nThey just are completely obsessed with Donald Trump yeah and and I just don't I Can't connect to that I think as as a person who is a a small government guy I don't want the president to have that much of a role in our lives\nAre just fundamentally whether it's ... or Donald Trump but ... you know CNN I think they made a decision and MSNBC certainly on the sport and and pretty much every other media source is that this is this is this is what we do\nAll we do is talk about every issue and how it relates to Donald Trump this is a man who was murdered\nA potentially cut up into little pieces maybe by him and say can fall in with your ... something half of their ... and all we can talk about is what ... why Donald Trump is acting the way he's acting well isn't fair and more of a story here maybe that's the story you run in three weeks when you're looking back at this incident but like\nIs it the story now much more about the details of the incidents\nAre and what happened there were still in the age\nYeah should be um breaking news now um Chicago Tribune is reporting the United states just received a payment of a hundred million dollars from Saudi Arabia uh actually we got it on Tuesday the same day secretary of state Mike Pompeo arrived in Riyadh to discuss the disappearance of ...\nUm Saudi Arabia publicly pledged the payment to support us stabilization efforts in northeastern Syria so I'm sure that this will be twisted into oh we're not doing anything to them 'cause they just paint us a hundred million dollars of course\nThere are always paying a hundred million dollars [laughter] that our relationship with them it is they send us a lot of money and we send them stuff that kind of\nI mean look at it it's not completely in significant to the relationship pride I mean that there there are these considerations\nAnd that is why when you're making a decision of the president of the United states your decision is not solely based on you know what the media wants you to do right like it's about American interests and that should always be the primary choice if what the idea at the end of the day of American interests\nAre harmed long term I'm by a decision you might make you have to take that into consideration it has to be your top priority your top priority is not a ... murders in Turkey\nRight like the beginning I don't know if anybody knows this but we ... we did a lot of countries that we're dealing with are murdering people all the time\nOr you know how often do we hear that we should talk to North Korea before when now that Trump is doing it no one wants them to touch the pre anymore so she studying like that's off the table now but this guy's been doing much worse things all over the world terrible terrible things are happening all the time the fact that this guy is a journalist or a column this is\nA big part of the reason why are you know I think the media care so much about it and they're prioritizing over you know some slaughter in Africa or some terrible thing that's happened in Russia\nRight like it's this is you know this is a a journalist that they knew that was from a you know that wound up are working for an American newspaper\nSo it is a big story and and the details around it are so crazy like such a twenty four storyline that I can understand why it captures the interest but it being patient and making sure you understand the actual facts of the situation before you act is not a negative\nAnd there's a lot at stake here a lot at stake I mean if you if you just start willy nilly throwing on sanctions on Saudi Arabia they are going to retaliate and it's it's going to cost a not us as much but the rest of the world is going to suffer in\nThe oil that's what they've already threatened All right go ahead and punish us and we'll cut off your oil supply while I think we get scanned little from them but other people get a lot Europe gets a lot of oil from Saudi Arabia so yeah you want to make sure you got all your\nUh T's crossed in ... before you take\nSevere action I Would think now look as a global market anyway yeah so it it it all effects are each part of it affects the other parts and you know it's something to consider though I mean I think making a principled moral decision outweighs that a lot of times but American interests are have to be facts annihilation we think we see that happening too infrequently\nOver the past few decades and it and and that should start again\nA AAA seven twenty seven back as the phone number are a sponsor this half hour zip recruiter or if you go to these job

Eric ... talks in France\nThat that that's a terrible direction to go and lead you don't all full roads where you're trying to judge things that you can't possibly\nJudge correctly yeah and it's\nIt's going to be interesting to see how this progress as a in a year or two or five for now with Brett Kavanaugh because there was nothing to back up or his accusers claims there was no corroboration there was no evidence at all of these allegations from thirty five plus years ago\nAnd yet uh\nI just saw an article today about from ... Democrats looking at other ways besides a impeachment\nOn how to remove a Supreme Court justice ... are just unbelievable I mean the ... so you're going to try to remove him from from the Supreme Court bench when there was no corrupt ration and no evidence\nYeah and you know wow first of all I think once we get past this election\nThat Brett Kavanaugh stuff has died down quite a bit because I mean you see what was the last time you see ... I Hope that's true Dr Ford or you know you don't you're ... occasionally you'll hear from Anita Hill Twenty years after right but it's more like a retrospective arts tongue into a new story\nYou know they'll be still hate Clarence Thomas in the lowest eight Brett Kavanaugh but I mean it never was about these allegations there was never a moment in which that story was about the allegations\nIt was always about the the opportunity to stop Brett Kavanaugh from sitting on the court can they thought they had a chance of winning the Senate and could block the block the next justice and maybe they\nDidn't have to deal with another conservative on the court would that was one hundred percent of of it for every for every single person involved with the possible exception of Dr Ford which you could at least say maybe she went through this and\nCertainly she only brought it up now because of the Supreme Court so that it was certainly part of her calculus there [laughter] um but you know if she really did go through this you know that that's a different story we don't know um but\nThe other people and Cory Booker do not care a lot for one second about what happened to this one not even for a second no he only cared about what happened to him so he could call themselves Spartacus a and eventually uh make himself into a twenty twenty Canada\nAnd the same thing with Kamala Harris and the same thing with all of this all of these people they didn't care at all um and it and it's and and look it's clear with things like Keith Ellison which is currently going on which actually has evidence behind it which is going on currently which actually gone to a the police and\nAnd again if if if what we find out is that there is nothing to it you have to just like I Would with anybody else say that he you know is not guilty and should be able to do what he has to do but if you're judging by the standards that they're putting up\nIt's totally different\n... let me put this and I I thought this was fascinating\nAfter I think of how recent this Brett Kavanaugh saying was an ... story back in your mind for a moment about what we were trying to find\nThat Dr Ford comes up and and testifies and says I Know these people are they were there none of those people say that they remember this this incident\nUh she didn't tell anybody for a very long period of time there was no she couldn't remember where the house was she couldn't remember who's house it was you can remember how she got there she went back what did they have as much of it it happened right none of it right [noise] um\nAnd we were basically the insinuation from the media was if let's say one of the witnesses she named\nInstead came out and said yeah I remember that party I remember hearing really shook up and she left in ... and and I remember being very strange and she was weird for the next three weeks she was just like\nYou know very distant and I didn't know it was going on and now I Know\nIf you would have had just that I think the media would have been in I mean they already weren't phone conviction mode but I don't think Collins and flake would have held on for something like that just one person\nSaying one thing not with as a witnessing the incident which just she heard about it in the general time period just one we're looking for one who even knew that the party occurred none of the incident happened just that the party\nOccurred listen to this this is from Nineteen Ninety nine from slate the hardcore right wing publication of late talking about the accusation of rape not sexual assault not sexual harassment but rape against Bill Clinton\nBrought her ex initial denials indicate only that she shunned publicity\nThat's why she never reported the rape rebuffed advances from Clinton's political enemies who in Nineteen Ninety two urged her to go public so they had asked Broderick about this in Nineteen Ninety two when he was running for president the first time and he said she said no I'm not going to tell my story\nSo she had an opportunity to take down this president did ... did not decide to do so she lied to Paula Jones lawyers about the incident to get out of talking about it\nShe eventually told the FBI the truth uh Nineteen Ninety eight only because her son a lawyer advised her against lying to federal investigators so she didn't want to tell the story to tear down the president she told the story because she thought she was saying like perjury charges or something against or\nFive people say ... five people said Broderick told them about the rape immediately after it occurred\nWow so now while for one person who is at the hotel or at the party in the cabinet case she had five people that she told about the rape immediately after\nIt occurred uh a friend and co worker named Norma Kelsey says Twenty one years ago she found a dazed Broderick with a bloody lip and torn panty hose in their shared hotel room broader he explained that Clinton had just raped her\nClinton is supposed to have bitten or on the ... right before raping her her current husband then her lover says Broderick told him about Broderick told him about the rape is well within a few days of the event\nBroderick did not remember the date of the rape that's the one similarity here\nSo she did supply the name of the hotel\nThe Camelot and the reason she was visiting Little Rock a nursing home seminar she also says that Clinton pointed to a ramshackle prison outside the hotel room window before he raped her and said he planned to renovate it he's so Clinton in the middle of a bunch of cooked for rape is like a by the way I'm going to renovate the prison over there are so work\nUm NBC News found a date and ... nursing home seminar was held at the Camelot hotel and record records show that Broderick attended newspaper reports suggest that Clinton was in the area and had no official commitments in the early morning when the rape is supposed to have occurred\nThere was a prison outside the hotel window\nWow that is a thousand times the amount of even alleged evidence that occurred with ah with Dr Ford and Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd yet that was ignored for ... and ... until the very second the Clinton family became useless to the Democrats and now yeah you'll see occasional people saying yeah we should have handled that differently or I'm with you guys that that's a total me to moment that only happens now\nAfter they never want to hear a either one of their uh stories ever again to them Hillary Clinton and the Clinton family is not guilty of this rape is not guilty of that they're guilty of blowing in election to Donald Trump and that's why they have no more used for them but I mean bill\nClinton goes on is still makes a big level speeches oh yeah he's able to do all these things this isn't a ... a much more credible accusation and Paula Jones had a lot of evidence to including corroborating witnesses of what happened there\nIt's it's a situation with with a double standard that is so bizarre and the fact that they that that the media actually thinks we should\nTake in their ... current stance seriously on this stuff is insane the stance is and always has been you should be taken seriously when your report a crime against somebody else that crime should be ... go go through the legal system with actual standards and if they're held responsible for this crime then we can all understand what happened\nI mean that is well that's the system we have it's the best in the world\nAnd the idea that we are now supposed to go through these kinds of records and and even worse than that I mean even worse than the kangaroo court it's like oh well I don't know kind of seems like maybe he could have done it\nIs now or standard that can sanity it's insanity and yet you have\nHillary Clinton speaking out against Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd defending her husband and they they just asked her what the difference with a was between the two and she said well oh yeah they're completely different because um my husband's improprieties were looked into for a really long time this was looked into for a week\nWell there is some ... Pancho evidence as you just pointed out into all of the claims made by other women and Bill Clinton and the other differences she went after him try to destroy every single one of the accusers\nThat was that was a big difference nobody's trying to destroy Christine Blasey Ford nobody's trying to destroy even the others that are making outrageous allegations against him that are completely uncorroborated or exception\nOf Michael ... which I think the Democrats are currently trying to destroy as they are so pissed off about that\nAnd they don't want him running for president and they do not want the circus there oh so they are they are today are very much trying to destroy him at this point but what a clown he is he is yeah I mean it's it's embarrassing you thought Michael Cohen was a bad lawyer and then Michael up and out of yeah introduced himself to you\nBut it's so bad that even Trevor Noah who's the ... I mean I I thought John Stewart was on funny this guy is on funny too about the one million to power but\nI'm Trevor Noah on Comedy Central the other night took on Hillary Clinton and you know to his credit actually said some some accurate things are about her and and whether or not she's the best person to be speaking out on sexual allegations here's what he said\nOK forced animals are coming into the forest and it's up to us to make that what is it a good one sparrow have your practice the most popular bird song for the year\nCatchy I like a river how's the temperatures are a freshman safety two degrees and I love it\nA turtle he's not here yet man he's late every morning okay squirrel the forest has been preparing just for you to learn more about cool things to do in the forest visit discovers a forest dot org brought to you by the U.S Forest Service and the ad council\nHis son Louis and blue eyed journalists present murdered the first thing the president has said he wants to hear about from his secretary of state the two men now behind closed doors at the White House falling Mike Pompeo's return from a trip which included Saudi Arabia and turkey that's where ... was last seen entering the Saudi conflict\nOvernight we still talk is investigating again touching the ... one of the council general's residence that's been a key policies that investigation on along and now they do continue to in the show he was killed tortured and just men but inside those diplomatic mission\nIs Benjamin hall and a woman's act of kindness going viral and employee at a public in Florida getting an unusual request\nI Want to pay for first birthday cake um but I Want to do it anonymously\nTurns out that woman was doing it to honor her stillborn grandstand\nSneak CNC sharing the story I see some\nGoing in one thousand dollars now\nThe key word money too and you'll get a tank confirming in three plus I hard\nRadio info state or data and Mrs rates apply that money to two hundred two hundred\nThey were actually ... is a rattlesnake infested ship\nAll over these people are going to be warm this swamp being dream and I don't know if there is a way to\nHave somebody in the White House saying by here in America has no comprehend purview\nPeople of the good work ... ... talking about it right here on Fox it's good to talk talk dwelled on drift off well sorry\nToday but it is really only in the low forties today and tomorrow we'll see one up again into the ... this report is sponsored by\nDEA take back de da de ...\nYour unused prescription drugs could end up misused or so\nShe sends safe clean them out take them down the aid that prescription drug take back that Saturday\nOctober twenty seventh and find a collection signed at the take back that time\nThe unemployment rate is that a forty eight year low most people that\nWant to work are working if you're trying to fill open positions that your business you'll have to find your next candidate from the currently employed I heart media can help you spread the word to Ninety two percent of the U.S population that's right Ninety two percent use this radio station defined your next employee driving to or sitting at\nTheir current job you'll have your pick of the most qualified candidates for any position you have available we can help go to I hard works dot com that's I hard work dot com adopt\nUs kids presents what to expect and you're expecting a teenager learning the lingo\nGoat G.

K. and whether Lucy case should be allowed back on stage ever ever\nUm well he did things in front of girls right after he asked him if he could yeah and that and they said yes that are part of the saga with him in particular is that there doesn't seem to be much of an alec ... much if any allegations of him doing something\nThat against you know motives will write like he would ask they say yes or or um there was one case where\nUm he [noise]\nAgain like this is the level of the accusation your ... he was accused of calling up someone and while he was on the phone with the woman the woman believed that he was pleasure and himself while on the phone with her\nBecause I guess he was breathing heavy or something and ... couldn't hang up because of the power dynamics ... absolutely the power to make you do all sorts of gay because as a comedian he's increase wields incredible out right in this country now like credit led to ever\nFired at any job in the nation at any job you're a sarcasm is just reality and the situation that they're going to go back to what they were saying they're saying they ... some of them\nPeople were other comedians and one at one point one of the accusations was he walked up to a another comedian er and they were talking and I guess he thought there was a ... there's something invited her back to his trailer to do his thing in front of her which apparently was\n'cause this is his shtick mhm and and she said actually uh you know you have a wife and a child and you should think about that and he said I I Know I I'm Sorry you're right I have issues\nAnd that's the center the allegation maybe he didn't do it\nIn force or to do after that he didn't do it and then they had that conversation he asked her to do this thing which is ... obviously ... right yeah but I mean again he asked her to do this thing she said no reminded him of his wife and child and so he said oh you're right I haven't either shoes I'm\nSorry but that is is that sexual\nA sort of in the accusation there are no matter what show which she answered\nA diet and he did not pursue it after that it's unbelievably there's you know so ... he admitted to being a dirt bag right now and he admitted in such a general way that people kind of\nUh making eight people he admitted to these things and he did admit to I I've done a lot of things wrong I've tried to figure out a way to make that make them right and I think\nThat that would I just described you is obviously wrong yeah like I was a wrong thing for him to be doing how is it a crime is it a crime I think the idea that clearly is no and and they and the idea that you know Lucy K because he's a famous a comedian\nCan affect other people other comedians careers is theoretically possible but that is that enough for a crime and the fact that he wants to have he wants to hook up with someone who is theoretically he could hurt their career if they say no but there's not evidence\nOf that he did this to anyone so it's a on what even do it to anyone right I mean you know again making a weird assumption there yeah and we just assumed the crime like this isn't sort of stuff that Minority Report was supposed to scares away from right you're not supposed to just a Seattle and people will commit crimes in the future\nSo down and listen to this this is the guy who runs the comedy cellar and the comedy cellar as famous New York comedy club like it's a tiny it's like a hundred people can watch comedy there and they're the if you go there you'll see a lineup of comedians every day\nAnd and but it's famous for people random people that are incredibly famous just stopping by you go in there to see them comedian you never heard of that probably pretty good but you got like a one in three

do this he's bounced around to several clubs around New York since and they let him on stage so the New York times there's an exhaustive report about trying to talk to the club owner but why you let

do you think he could come work that he's like never might never say never\nWell can you imagine any court of law handing down such a sentence never work again he says I don't care never misses an
