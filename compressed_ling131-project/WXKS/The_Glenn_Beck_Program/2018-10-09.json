system this one has been this one has failed us because it has been usurped\nThe constitution no longer a means anything the bill of rights no longer means anything why because it's not talk to anymore anybody who takes the oath of office in Washington Ninety percent of them are liars not even not even intentional liars\n\nThey don't know it they don't believe in it they will tell you they do as was told to me by a very powerful individual ones look blend we all believe in the constitution but you know you gotta do what you gotta do no\nNo\nYou do not to do what you have to do that the

Anthony you're on the Glenn Beck program\nSaying what are you good how are you\nDoing well so you know I'm looking at you you you mentioned earlier that are really the opposition are the people leading this leadership that the Democrat Party\nOr or we'll have this right Nineteen eighty four with the inter Korean out a party and what I see happening with my friends on the on the left is there out a party members they work every day and not involved in politics but they get sucked in on social media\nAnd they're being manipulated and it's a huge chunk\nOf the American population being being a cold or the left agree and I want to hear your thoughts on that\nUh I think you're absolutely right and it's why we have to be a difference in unusual and ... year people I'm On uh the Internet because if they see if all they see our people on the right punching back the people on the left and both sides suck\nWhile they're they're going to stick with what they know if they are seeing their side being unreasonable violin to see ... the way to answer and so far is not\nWith uh the militant people it will come out of the Nazis to come out and find them in the streets that is the moment before we lose our humanity that is the moment that Martin Luther king walks through and chest is peaceful and ...\nAnd ... and you don't strike back it works at this point but at this point is going to slip away quickly as we lose our humanity as they did in Germany and you no longer um are a Judeo Christian country\nWith those kinds of peaceful values\nYou miss the moment and then it just becomes you know either communism socialism what's really the difference oh well the leader says it's very different so I have to kill all of the other group you have to act while they're still is a

in addition obviously to the people that want to create a\nMachine thing they are running and there are certain things I just can't they don't like I'm being a ... a leak in her climbing in her house probably not going to do that\nUm as far as service obviously I think McDonald's is a great example where am I yeah I don't think people are going to be upset if they go into ... and not have to deal with anyone that chick fillet\nIsn't known for their service and I said that\nLet me ask you this let me ask you this first of all just a ... there's a don't mean any offense or anything I just want to know um how up to speed you are on this um ... or ... what books are you reading on AI what what are you just a generalist or have you dug in deep on this\nYeah I'm I'm more of a general if I could not than they work unless I'm so I'm coming just for you know different perspectives are having to sit there for a church that I Know that you have sure on that but\nYou know just my feeling like a a I was going to absolutely they will to diagnose cancer um quicker and more accurately than a doctor but are you going to want to sit in front of a robot and have the robot tell you that you have cancer and cleaner options\nCase so have there are there is a there and I can't remember the name of it on the ... on this particular subject but I Will look for it or there is a whole book based just on this uh nursing is probably one of the jobs that will be the last two go however\nThey are there are two companies right now that are doing studies on emotions the emotion of being able to detect it in someone and being able to reflected in face the reason why\nI'm a that that we don't connect with robots is because they cannot see\nOur emotions and read them and also reflect emotions in their eyes and in their face\nSo there are companies now that are specifically just working on cracking the code of emotional connection um it's going to take a while but it while is what ten years Fifteen Years in today's world ah and I think that's a long while\nI'm so there there are those are those the ideas are that are being worked on right now you have to understand that\nSilicon Valley is currently working on the utopian idea of one hundred percent unemployment that no one has to work\nThat everyone will be able to have plenty because robots and everything else will be able to manufacture\nThis is different than any other technological leap than we that we've ever made yes we are going to shed jobs and yes there will be other jobs that will be created\nThat is one theory the prevailing theory is there is nothing that a human can do that through a GI and especially a s I Will not be able to do much much better including breaking the news to people\nBecause the idea is that that system will be able to\nGo through every bit of information about the individual they're about to tell\nSo they will know everything that they've ever posted about let's say their mom just died\nThey'll be able to see everything they've ever written to their mom every text message to their mom they will know the exact relationship and they will be able to temper the message much better and much more personal than anyone else\nThe bigger problem is on a high end doctors is this will happen quickly\nAlready had I Can't remember the name of the system but it is in New York and you'll have to excuse me I read about this about three four years ago the uh New York board of medicine already has a computer on the board\nAnd what they're doing is they're feeding in all kinds of information\nAnd it it is not like a human doctor the best human doctor that has seen a lot done a lot really up on the latest research and all of the facts and studies and and history everything else this has perfect recollection of it\nAnd they have found that it can diagnose so much better it was I think it's\nFifty percent for the doctors and it's Ninety eight percent for the computer way in advance\nAt what point do we say I don't want a human to do the diagnosis I don't want the best specialist I Want the IBM please so you have to understand that\nThere is a fundamental shift that the world has never ever seen before\nAnd we're about to experience that shift between twenty twenty and twenty thirty and the world will not be like it is today\nYou started your comment about the section of the book where I Know there's a chapter where I talk about ... universal basic income I Am against universal basic income I Do not think that that is the way we should go\nBut we as conservatives must be willing to listen to the debate and I'm not talking about the people who are socialist in Washington I'm Talking about the people who are studying\nOr the culture studying humans and studying technology to gather that are now looking for what is it that will give people value what is it when we do hits high unemployment if your goal is one hundred percent\nMaybe see a little bit of I like him a little bit you don't have to like him personally so anyways I just really enjoyed that part of your book and being able to use a cause I can laugh about yeah we can laugh without food and\nSo anyway Kelly thank you [laughter] thank you very much you stay strong\nIn Oregon will send you a copy of the books on to you I'm\nListening to the ... the point I make in the book about McDonald's is it's one way you can tell if people are being disingenuous if you have nothing good to say about someone I mean nothing\nEverything is bad\nReally really\nI mean even even people who uh you know would trying to say something good about Adolf Hitler uh the Audubon the Audubon okay doesn't really our balance outweigh the other but a gay\nYou can't find anything and I compared the news coverage to a bunch of people who are just telling you that everything about McDonald's sucks\nEverything if they don't mentioned that they okay but I got to tell you the fries with the best fries ever if they can't admit that McDonalds fry is superior even if they hate everything else they're not an honest broker they're not an honest broker\nIt's called the nic nic muffin too by the way a
