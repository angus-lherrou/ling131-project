inspection by a qualified person that can look for those things but you're it does it come with a warning dog\nOr yes after they're finished and and that's probably is it a Ninety day inspection a one year inspection\nYeah I I Believe it or at least one year\nYeah well outside of looking at your architectural drawings and going through it and then looking\nFor missteps or whatever um that's one thing is certain you want to do um but in terms of um\nYou know doing the walk through the probably the biggest thing is knowing that they're going to stand behind at home and just checking stuff in keeping the list I mean I'm I'm On the board of habitat for humanity but a lot of houses\nAnd we train our homeowners um\nTo really keep that list and eat the day the inspection to get some blue painters tape and in you know put the tape where the problem is because they're gonna be problems I mean you're going to him now pops and things like\nThat a full day you know outside of that I'm\nQualified home inspector looking over the whole project that's not a bad idea um or then then secondary would be you just kind of walking through everything and\nSeeing you know I don't really have a checklist\nOkay so maybe maybe that you did have some kind of English yeah I'd underwear and get a qualified inspector right here are kind of a rural area\nRight right that I see that I see um so do you have the architectural drawings of that\nI I yes I have the plan I think they gave me\nOne of the things you can do is just check that the things you agreed to having that house are there\nOkay so you know the switches or where they are the floors type of quality it is I'm not going to say that you're really gonna find any real imperfections I mean\nYou you can take this as far as you want you can get a thermal imaging camera and make sure the inflation is all the way from top to bottom on the walls you can make sure the insulation says that 'cause they said in the ceiling\nUm those type of things\nBut I guess my main concern is making sure that everything is tied together from England these two sections were were\nOkay you lost me there [laughter]\nWell they came and it came into sections here and they had to put together uh-huh\nAnd and so I just want to make sure that everything is is satisfactory where she joined sir\nYeah gee I don't even know if I

first\nAutomatic water soccer that you put salt in on your own and didn't have to have the exchange tank thing okay and let's see I was actually bought out by the echo water company ... man that was a privately held company but at any rate uh\nThey created a water soccer that uses the algorithm so it only you know the water or recharging when made it so it might only recharge habitat good order of

riots and and still get that you know a a paragraph each but after the communist manifesto\nWell then you start to get some interesting\nRiots usually called strikes\nNow some of these things are legitimate when it comes to race\nBut a lot of these\nCome from a progressive in office\nWho is doing something and stirring people up against one another for instance the greatest example is Woodrow Wilson where he's you know these practically heaping praise on the Klan\n... shows the first ... a movie ever shown in the in the White House and it's one glorifying the Klan\nClan does real resurgence and he was heavily involved in it he ... to the military and it all sorts of things so you see this all of a sudden you start to see this real uptick of race riots again in the in the Nineteen you know Fifteen on word\nWell that's because of re segregation in all of the things that are progressive\nPlanted alright\nBut let me just go through and see if you couldn't find any patterns here the Patterson silk strike the copper county strike\nThe Indianapolis streetcar strike a the Seattle general strike mayday riots read this summer the Boston police strike the steel strike

forget the things that we were all taught and we all know are true\nTo be civil and kind to one another but we were not at a place where I think you grab a gun\nI won't\nChristians in the age of outrage how to bring our best when the world is at its worst ads that are just wrote that book welcome to the program ed how are you\nThank you thanks for having me and I think we both were books on outrage kind of a nice time you could talk about outright\nAnd we did and you have you found the ad that it's not necessarily an understood topic or a popular topic right now to try to do diffuse it or explain what it does to us\nKnow it's interesting I see the word used more than I've ever seen before in ...\nA lifetime you know rage and outrageous in headlines of articles all the time but it's when you go a little deeper and in your case talking about his relationship to addiction or in my case\nTalking about Christians might engage the age of outrage and I I don't think I think there's a lot of references to it but not a lot of okay what do we do interact I think you know damn from Georgia who who are fascinating fascinating call and as you've gotta walk through that with him he's clearly outraged\nHis response would be very different than yours and I appreciate your responded\nA and mine and I think ultimately part of the challenges is Dan's response is I mean that just\nSaid I'll just say I'll just say it you know dance response or the way a lot of people feel like I Know they are there's a lot of built up outrage that is and it's it's you know you both on the conservative and liberal side\nAnd it's in many ways tearing our country apart from my concern as a Christian leader you know I'm here at the Billy Graham center a well my concern is is as Christians how are we going to engage in a world filled with outrage\nUh and when sometimes where the where the cause of it sometimes where the targets of it it's it's a mix and I love your comments about religious liberty to I mean I I'm I'm deeply concerned about religious liberty or around the world thankful for you bringing that up bring in that case up even today but but but again I I see Christians who are\nOutraged about Starbucks cups rather than about persecution around the world and I think so we got our own issues to deal with but also it's the culture as a whole\nSo tell me because I don't know if you heard last hour when I was talking about bond offer and that we have this closing window bond Hoffert did not succeed in what he tried to do he'll do he was in the end victorious\nUm but he didn't he didn't change the people because the people had already abandoned their Judeo Christian values they were angry they were outraged\nAnd they were they wanted political solutions not a spiritual solution uh and uh they they just went for it we have this this window or on our Judeo Christian culture\nAnd our and our underpinnings they're being lost and if we don't get through that window and keep people's hearts opened\nWe're going to go really a rye ...\nAnd I think ultimately this is our moment and you know not every day we don't get to pick the moment we're born or that where you live in two in every generation of space there are challenges but this is our moment in in in the book I sort of go through I have a chart and some stats up some new statistics in each chapter\nAnd I talk about how in many ways a that Judeo Christian ... a consensus has been lost and now the views of uh you know Christians different groups maybe\nA better more on the conservative side are now outside in many ways of the mainstream of society where once they were the mainstream and that's kind of lead to an accelerated\nA outrage cycle it's led to a everyone's turning up the volume two eleven\nAnd ultimately I don't think that's the path and I appreciate what you just said earlier when you're talking to talking to Dan is we've got to hum we've got to choose a different way now one of the key things as Christians are consistently choosing a different way and you know we don't need to be disabled by our cable news network or we don't need to be\nA shape spiritually by her social media feed\nI think ultimately we need to be shaped as Christians by who Christ is\nAnd the Jesus was afraid to stand up I mean he he was in the temple and he turned over tables but he also showed this remarkable ability that we can model to to build bridges with people with whom he shouldn't even be around the Samaritan woman at the well and I think ultimately we need a better path that the answer is not to\nGet like the world the answer for Christians in this age of outrage is to really follow the way of Jesus in to the world and I'm not some you know well don't stand up for things don't I mean when you said you fight but you fight a you know for example uh you can't war at a people\nAnd reach people at the same time and so it's a question of how you approach that and we're just we're to use your title were addicted to outrage right now and I'm and I'm trying to say there's a better way for Christians\nTo to to to do belt we even when they are the targets of the outrage and certainly to not participate in creating photo and false crises and outrage well\nHere's what's interesting to me and I pointed it out last hour if you talk politically\nWere winning I mean look at the Supreme Court but the Brett Kavanaugh I don't know of any president would have set up for that look what happened with Israel in many ways but you know we're winning it's not they're not forming mobs and going out and and you know\nAh trying to get into people's face and getting them to react out in anger because they're winning they're doing that because they're desperate\nWe're actually making progress and somehow or another we're just being swept up in their drama\n[noise] well I think people are ... it's kind of weird that appeals to us there's a part of us I think that's why a you know we'll find you know some some some crisis on social media\nThat Christians will be very attracted to and then we find out later that wasn't true and it kind of spread around and and you know and and and and I think that's part of the concern what is it in the U.S that draws us to outrage rather than to engage and I think there's a\nThere's a difference between the two and you know I'm some for example I'm someone who is deeply pro life\nYou know I spoke at the march for life here in Chicago not that long ago and you know you have kind of you know they're the girl those of us in the march for life speaking up and standing for life and then you had some protest or on the side just calling us terrible people but then you had some\nSome self identified Christians yelling horrible things at them yeah and here's what I don't want to be I Want to be in the group that's saying I'm going to stand for life not yelling horrible things at one another and thinking even the counter protesters who were kind of part of the march for life but left and started yelling\nThat's the problem we look too much like them and I don't think that that's our goal if our goal and we talk about this a lot in Christians in the age of outrageous is to I used to hold a biblical worldview but then to engage the world with a women some\nApproach and an income for what it's worth I mean I I've been fascinating to watch you sort of walk through that journey as well and I think it really challenged a lot of people in the way that they would think and so so so kudos to you for even writing on this subject matters\nUm I'd like to talk to you about your solutions so let me take a quick break the name of the book as Christians in the age of outrage I think it is\nReally important we cannot become that which we despise we cannot play the same game first of all just strategically you lose but also we lose who we are when Judeo Christian values are under
