believed murder of a missing journalist at the Saudi ... turkey\nOut from the paper I wrote previously with Peter ... the ... as a social construct\nAnd I ended up going and one of these hey\nHey or to publish open access journals that as apparently fairly low are very low um review standards and so it didn't prove what we wanted to prove or didn't even really offer good evidence for what we're looking at\nBut it was we learned or was it was really fun fun right um yeah he misses\nDon't exist but they called all of our problems anyway\nRight [laughter] the amount of that um but yeah so we learned our lesson we we took the criticism\nWe got from that to heart ...\nUh it was fun but it didn't work people criticized us I think fairly pointed out where we were weak by using these journals and instead we committed to a few things going into this new project one is that we would not use\nPaid published journals in any sense a secondly and by the way they don't charge like a hundred dollar they charge\nA couple of thousand ... ... it's really kind of a financial racket going on there is a big problem and I hope\nContinue to address it a secondly we decided that that um we would use the highest ranks journals with it\nAnd the disciplines that we're examining that we could get into so we would start at the best rental we could find for what we were doing and then work our way down if that one didn't take it would go to the next one\nAnd then thirdly we committed to being transparent about our results no matter what happens so if our if we had gone crash and burn complete failure then um [noise] that would have would have been what we report it I don't think it would have gotten much attention but we would have come out and it made it that we were wrong but it it's not what happened um\nAnd uh\nEarly on in the process not just to keep us honest because I think we would have kept our promise but early on in the process we ended up in contact with a documentary filmmaker who is interested in this stuff already but he's been recording us for a year his name's Mike ...\n... and since he's been recording us I mean clearly what ever happened is going to come out so there it is\nOK so before we take a break a and get into what you actually got published I'm telling you about the work behind it just took a year to do what kind of time or are you looking at\nWell easiest kind of look at what this is I had exactly five social outings between\nThanksgiving and when uh the project was came out to the public eye took maybe that many days off including weekends I work probably eighty to Ninety hours a week almost every week\nUm my two collaborators worked\nAlso very very hard I'm Peter put in at least a fulltime job Helen did most of the same as you talk to hell in the other day yeah\nAh so this was an an immense amount of work required learning these fields very quickly writing academic papers a typical academic all published a couple a year maybe if they're working hard\nAnd we wrote twenty\nA holy cow\nYeah it's a lot of work there was an insane\nAmount of work and these are all fields we have no expertise and know Helen has a little bit of background in some of this but this was primarily\nHaving to learn this material on the fly with no education with no teachers and striking author only feedback was how our papers spared and the peer review process and then reading what was out there to try to emulate it\nAnd so what does what does having something published in one of these the magazines mean what does it mean to the author and to the educational community\nSo for the author it is the absolute pinnacle of what an academic is trying to do and the research side of their career\nIs to get papers published in well established journals are for example hype Asia is one of the journals we got a paper in and I paid ... is the\nFeminist philosophy journal was probably the highest standing so it would carry a lot of weight\nLooking at the academic community that that scholars embedded in so they could take that to their university and say hey I got this many papers published if people are being considered for tenure there is a research component to that depends on how the the school wants to do their tenure in process\nBut typically seven papers spanning seven to ten years is considered the ... the basic research requirement to be qualified for tenure um our paper spanned the ones we wrote spend Fifteen sub disciplines of thought the ones that got accepted spanned seven [noise] and\nSo we've got big journals we've got seven disciplines papers got into we probably would have had more how do we not been a short\nSo there's you know you I Know who you are at twelve in the pipeline that look like they would be published and then this came out and so you you hold those but you might have had as many as twelve\nI think honestly we had fourteen that weren't dead yet and I can say with some confidence I think twelve would have gotten in and possibly possibly Thirteen so I Would guess was pretty good confidence that somewhere between eleven and Thirteen would have gotten in in the end we not gotten old\nOkay so when we come back we will go into and remember we're on we're on public airwaves so [laughter] so uh I mean as careful as we can to to discuss what was in each of these papers\nA and credible where they got a little gold star for [noise]\nAlright are us sponsored this half hour is zipper critter zipper critter is just this great\nCompany of ah of dreamers doors\nYou

studies were published in some of the the leading journals a and a and critique but\nI'm not really critiqued in a way that most people would I'm just quickly go through some of them are\nGoing in through the back door which is not something we're going to discuss here that's really great rubbing one out of the violence of object to vacation through non consensual masturbation uh then we get to some really disturbing ones um the progressive\nStack James tell us about the progressive stack\nYeah the progressive stacks of pretty horrifying piece of work and in fact it's evil ah fortunately it did not get accepted the journal was inviting us to re submitted and um give it another go\nThey just it's just as the ... says it's a solid essay that with revision will make a strong contribution to the growing literature of addressing injustice in the classroom\nYeah so what did argues for is that we take students in college classrooms and we have them go through some kind of a inventory that determines how privileged they are it recommends a thing called the step forward step back\nHim as a possibility wants to determine how privileges they are the students are ranked according to their privilege um then the more privileged you are the worst you get treated in class so the most privileged white and male students are invited to listen and learn throughout the semester which means face\nAren't allowed to speak or ask questions in class they're invited to sit in the floor in chains to experience reparations and a level the the knowing field to the degree privileged classroom learning environment\nAnd the problem that the reviewers seemed to have with this set of suggestions was that we thought there's no way this will get in we have to temper it by saying we have to be compassionate to these students as we put them in the foreign themes\nAnd they said watch it with compassion that re centers the needs of the privileged over the oppressed and\nThere's this idea out there called the pedagogy of discomfort which means that you learn to overcome your privilege by being made uncomfortable and left to fit in that without being comforted and so they actually wanted to make\nA terrible scary idea properly evil and that's the worst part is is it's only a small step from what already exist in a great deal of the a feminist than race based education literature\nSo this was not really terrifying this was not accepted because it didn't it wasn't bad enough\n[noise] ah first yeah and then later they were a bit concerned with the death of a scholarship and and the kind of routine thing that you would expect out of a scholarly papers\nThey claimed for example that we grew on too many concepts and it would be confusing for the reader and to try to narrow it down to something a bit tighter\nAnd so on but um but the idea that they're giving students experiential reparations and asking them not to be able to speak in class or to be spoken over him interrupted to teach them what that feels like none of that was questioned\nWhat if this were published and they were real if this were published what\nWhat would that mean to the university system would would what does that mean\nSo all events is a really complicated I'm there would be people who try to take this out in fact we got the idea from a news article about somebody at University of Pennsylvania who\nWas employing a similar but less extreme version of this in her classroom and got in trouble for it a late last year so they decided it didn't come to us out of the vacuum this was actually something that people are attempting\nIn classrooms and so there would have been some ... some ... uh educators primarily working and social justice side or the field topics courses I guess that's the

but he gets distracted\nRealized she forgot his home or\nGo when you can see learning and attention issues from the\nUh asking for and you mentioned health care Medicare for all and twenty Thirteen Bernie Sanders proposed this and gotten zero cosponsors zero he was the only one who publicly supported\nNow the you look at the top ten CNN has a list of the top ten or ... democratic candidates which by the way will not be enough to ... to cover the field there's going to be a lot more than ten I think\nUm but I mean everybody with the exception of Joe Biden who I Will not be surprised at all if he comes out and it does endorse Medicare for all\nThe all the big names are for it already there are many of them were cosponsors of the bill or it\nSeems to be this I mean the idea that we in two thousand ten and eleven were being called racist for suggesting what they wanted was single payer\nAnd now here they are ... the entire field is endorsing single payer health care I think credible\nYeah we were scare mongers in races for saying it yeah so I I just want to go through there's there's three stores will go through this tomorrow but I just I just want to throw these at ya I'm Cortez was out of this weekend we have to eliminate the electoral college\nHey no that is a fundamental I'm a of a fundamental aspect of what brought the states together in the first place\nThe state said we don't want the big states telling us what we can do and if the big states can a control everything well then ... what do we have\nIt can't be that way so we had the electoral college we are one stayed away from losing the electoral college anyway you lose taxes and you have New York California and Texas the rest of the country doesn't matter it will be those three states you lock those three states up and it doesn't matter anymore\nThat's pretty frightening pretty frightening\nSo now we're talking about taking apart the electoral college which would make all of the red states really pretty much in consequential\nYeah I mean it certainly would change the way the founders thought about the idea of people being elected right I might have\nTo do is just just appeal to the big cities\nAnd by the way this is a this is an idea that um and it's not just democratic support for getting rid of the electoral college and I know Trump supports that for example thrown um I I you know I'm not a big fan of the national popular vote or certainly not what our founders had in mind but uh there is a there is some contingency on both sides of the aisle that actually believe\nThis is the right way to go which I mean you that gets you just basically a country run by city\nI mean I you know it'd be which the Mets won that like as a Republican certainly don't understand why you'd want it but ... again like it shouldn't be that way\nRight as they should run themselves in the city is going to run whatever they want and the rural or your skin do what they want\nWhy do we all have to live under somebody else's thumb I don't want to live under a farmer's thumb do farmers should make the although I'd feel better with this than the other way around no farmers should be telling what somebody in the city has to do and how to live\nThey don't understand it taking any of my farmer friends to Manhattan their heads would explode within twenty five minutes\nThey would not want to live there they wouldn't understand it so why should we have the people in farms and farmlands trying to dictate rules that are good for them that also have to be applied to the city it's ridiculous\nRight and it's ... the house and Senate both exist to give a balance to that so that ... not not one side can tell the hand out\nRight and it you know no it's actually it's it's it's goes further than this if you would have if you could a race the mistake of the uh of the progressive under Wilson where they changed the meaning of the Senate\nThey way they got elected yeah it it used to be that the house was the place where the people could move and move quickly\nSo things can be passed because there was a disaster and things can be passed\nQuickly then the next ... the first check on the balance of power the first check on that power was to go through another body that was a lot slower the Senate people are always like parents too slow it was designed to be that way\nSo you go through another body that was much lower but it wasn't just that it was slower it was also supposed to be men or women that were selected by their state legislature\nNow what would that do\nThat would make sure that those guys are beholden to their state not to the rest of the country not figures in national politics for Iraq trying I shouldn't care what uh what's his face in New York is says shouldn't care when Hillary Clinton was senator Brock Obama was center I shouldn't care about that\nBecause they wouldn't be focused on their state and they would be making sure that the federal government would not be eating into the power of their state\nThen it goes to the president\nAnd the president is only supposed to veto thing if he finds it unconstitutional now they'll say I think this is unconstitutional but I'll sign it\nWas way no that's the Austin this the opposite way you're supposed to veto it not if you don't like it if you find it unconstitutional it's unconstitutional then it would go to the Supreme Court\nWe've screwed up the balance of power so much and that's why you have this story today the United States Senate is a failed institution you also have this one from Fox and the case for abolishing the Supreme Court\nAnd this story the constitution of the United states has failed [laughter]\nAre you arguing for a king right with these the several histories and our own may give you the argument for it came\nRight I mean okay really they've failed or have we not been using them properly\nYou know it's it's like it's like going out into the woods with a a Swiss army knife\nAnd saying I've been trying to I'm trying to cut down trees and split lumber and this Swiss army knife has failed [laughter] uh no you're not using it properly that's not what it was meant for\nAnd I would also argue the failure park right and you're talking about ... what is basically the biggest success story in global history the United states of America the fact that it has its problems is is well documented but the idea that you'd call it a failure is patently insane insane\nAbsolutely insane All right let's go through a couple of other things how about the Portland mayor\nWho the hell is Ted Wheeler and how did he ever become mayor of Portland but Portland but\nThat's how I I'm Sorry I'm Sorry I'm Sorry so you know the ... last week the Portland mayor ah refused to let the tops intervene when ... was just directing traffic\nI mean I\nCan anybody just get up and started directing traffic in Portland and they just can I just go on the street can you imagine what would have happened to us in New York City if you would have started directing traffic\nOh my gosh you might be disappeared [noise] I mean especially if it was a union job really they wouldn't be you'd be in the bottom of the river [laughter] ... what\nWhat laws do you even have in Portland now\nYou can just go direct traffic you can break an old man's window he's driving and he's like no I'm not gonna you're young women they break his window and chased him down\nPolice nothing nothing\nNow I don't know if you saw the uh the mob in yes and I did use the N word gosh I don't know if you saw the mob in Portland this weekend but they had a a\nA law and order march and anti fall showed up for the law and order march because they of course in Portland now or the law the browns shirt stuff\nStarted beating kicking burning flags\nWhatever that's pretty scary and and the mayor ... released a statement at a press conference where he said I was appalled by what I saw in the video but I support the police's decision not to intervene how how how can you how can you support that decision I I don't\nI mean I guess the the just the idea of look this is wrong but we don't want to make it any worse he's trying\nTo make it sound as if um the police this is his angle for the mainstream\nThere is for seven years the couple of live the life of luxury and the three with her three children know of five ally is two and daughter video amber Betty Who is eleven weeks old yet all of this seemed to meaningless when Noah was diagnosed with liver cancer two years ago\nAnd the devastated couple immediately announced that they were putting their careers on hold for the care of their son Noah has been declared now cancer free\nI'm Michael ... is very emotional his a brown eyes well up at the mere mention of the C word cancer there's too many see where it's now\nAnd it is clear he is living in the shadow of what he describes his two years of hell\nYou just want to die he said I don't I don't even know how I was breathing my ... my wife was the same and even though I was a stronger of the two of us I wasn't strong my wife was I'm Sorry I Can't make it to the end of the sentence let's just say we find out who we are with these things\nGoing through this with Noah I didn't I didn't question who I was I just question everything else why are we here is this all there is because if this is all there is there has to be something bigger\nHe says that one way you got through was to pretend he was in ... ah Roberto I'm a ... a character from life is beautiful\nI don't know if that was a choice he said but that's why I became for instance I never called at the hospital I called it the fund hotel\nUm he said every day I got extra bed sheets and I would build a tent for NOAA and just made the best of it it's such a difficult exercise it hurts me and it hurts to talk about no because it's not my story to tell it's his\nBut my whole life has changed my perception of life I don't even know if I could get through this conversation without crying and I never lost control of my emotions before in public\nI actually thought I'd never come back to the music business I never fell out of love with music I just needed to put it aside\nWhat it was hard was going to the store and buy hotdogs and toilet paper and going to the gas station going for a walk by the seat a clear my head everyone recognizes me and says how's your son you think you're close to getting over it and you're stuck right back into it but at the same time I was given back to my faith in humanity\nUm he said uh the illness made him realize he needed to make a change in his life\nI spent a good a time a good deal of time with people who aren't so lucky this terrible news came I realized I wasn't really having fun in the music business I had lost the joy and at some point just before the Brits I was starting to lose the plot\nI become desperate to hold on to something I thought I might be losing and I thought I had to do something special to keep it\nI started doing things out of my comfort zone like presenting and the truth is\nIt had been a while since I had been having fun it started I started to worry about ticket sales for my tours what's a critic said what the perception of bite me might be I felt like I was living with this over my face and near a and the reality I was seeing was old blurred by it\nI decided I never wanted to read my name and print again never read a review and I never have I decided I'd never use social media again and I never have but the diagnosis made me realize how stupid I had been to worry about all of these unimportant things I was embarrassed by my ego", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city": "Newton", "day": "15"}
