Murray or are those guys merely a reflection of how dominant his office is going to be I think that's a fascinating question that he has to answer\nRemember back in the day Steve ... funny and going off it didn't matter who's Steve Spurrier put in as his quarterback they were going to be successful and put up huge numbers\nThere are guys now who have those offices and they roll and it doesn't really matter who the quarterback is I Know we had Patrick homes but right now by and large if you put ... berry in charge of it off and they're going to score points\nBack in the day if you put ... in charge of it off and they're going to score points sometimes you can get a transcendent quarterback like our ... or G. three\nBut everybody had playing quarterback for him performed at an incredibly high level so is Lincoln Riley system so good\nThat every quarterback is going to look great in it or has he merely had a good system and paired it with great quarterback the past couple of years with uh with Baker Mayfield and now with coyote Murray\nIf he believes that the system\nAnd not their quarterback than stay at Oklahoma forever if he believes the quarterbacks perfected his system and he doesn't have that next guy to replace coyote Murray then maybe you look at the opportunity of going to Cleveland and consider pairing up with bigger Mayfield\nIf you believe that he is truly a great ... quarterback that is the decision that I Would say that Lincoln Riley has to make I'm skeptical I Would say at Oklahoma probably this has been out kicked thanks for hanging with

what's\nHappening so far well uh we're one week away and this is when we get to see what the chart a little bit because we have a had a lot of races in the middle and the sort of toss up category yep I'm biggest holdings been close and now we start to try to move them around a little bit more aggressively because we're only a week away or so here's what we have right now are done it only three tossup races\nOr we have moved uh Missouri and Indiana er into a lean Republican position I Would say Missouri I'm pretty confident of Indiana\nThe polling is is a little surprising their Donnelly has been favored there for a long time um but we're moving those to lean Republican that the lives there was a Ted Cruz's still lean Republican state\nA ... and ah ah Mississippi and North Dakota are you going to get you to fifty one if you if the Republican sweep their leaders right now fifty one Republican senators have there are three tossup races we have that I think are pure tossed up still and we couldn't really move them\nArizona is in their Nevada is in there and we moved Tennessee back into their Tennessee had a couple of really good polls were Marsha Blackburn a couple of weeks ago\nWhere she was more some of them showing her up fourteen points place falling has a lot closer are really a tough race at this point holy cow yeah so those three are are in the tops of category and we've moved a couple of towards the Democrats as well uh we've moved to Florida to a lean democratic\nState uh again this is a tough race cars you've got the governor versus the incumbent senator it's been really tight the entire time but honestly looking at it we've seen a movement towards towards a Nelson in Florida\nAnd we now have that one is a lean democratic state um we moved from Minnesota as well\nFrom faith Democrat to leaning Democrat\nAppalling there [noise] yeah [noise] I still think that's going to the Democrats but at the polling is closer then I think most people expect there's two reasons in Minnesota one of them to blow up\nThe other one isn't and so we're keeping that one of the leading Democrat category for now Montana we've moved to lean Democrat as well or was a tossup races for most of the time it looks like tester has enough of a lead there to consider this one to be\nLeaning Democrat at this point ah and let's see we've got to New Jersey and Wisconsin leaning Democrat as well so if if it's all leaders you've got forty one forty three forty five for Democrats so\nI mean it's pretty it's [noise]\nI don't think the Democrats are going to win the Senate\nThat as a starting to look shaky it's moving in the wrong direction it is moving in the wrong direction over the past few days the polling has not been good I mean Florida that was discouraging I think for Republicans to the past few days Montana's not turning around\nYou know we've seen no signs of real movement I don't think in West Virginia as well which was a big culprit pick up again this was a state that voted for Trump by thirty points\nAnd Joe mansion I think he you know I think he's solidified his seat there with his pro Kavanaugh's low yeah um but in the opposite with North Dakota and hide camp I think she's done um but\nAs of right now I think you can say pretty solidly that there's that the majority right now is going to stay with a Republican but I mean again Missouri in Indiana are slightly nurses were moving these days I Would normally keep those in the tops of categories of or a week away and we got to pick at some point\nAnd we also are I mean we're in the election right now yeah I mean people are voting all across the country right now uh it's no longer a one day event okay I'm going to take a quick break then come back [noise] can

an American American ... it's ... they\nUse this identity politics to other us and then they completely ostracized and it just isn't that hack mode and it's something that it it it goes into understanding why Hollywood is so ubiquitous Lee west waning\nAnd you know you see why all these stories that come out of Hollywood that are so one sided only tell one side of the story\nSo you know that is when I saw this I said you know what we need to start telling our side of the story and we need to use storytelling as a as a way to do that so that's\nWhat I ... it was it was astonishing kind of moment to to call out a man that is getting in bed with other people's kids and to actually have the entire community turn on it purely because we are conservatives it was an astonishing moment to go through\nWhat is it that they what is it that they have about conservatives more than pedophilia\n[noise] you know it I think it is a fear Hollywood is such a small community and it's run by\nSo few people and it was just such a fear for\nLosing work and one way and then on top of that it's like the game of Thrones where they're it it's very competitive to ah to to get that work so the first the first way to take somebody out is the state of their conservative\nUm and then anybody that anybody that is even near that person that gets to stink them on conservative that they're conservative they run from that person so there's a lot of it is the loudest voices basically first kind of ...\nYou out like the invasion of the body Snatchers that this guy is a conservative and then you have the the second tier which are just people that are fearful for their for getting work\nAnd those people run as well so it's just kind of this kind of\nA very the unhealthy community that get set up and then you know and then you start to see what happens to the Hollywood box office they start to you know slowly over the last Fifteen Years start to decline because they aren't making a content for the other half of the country\nSo um you know and I think that conservatives have really locked in on this and said you know what a ... of this we're not taking the same or you've seen the rating start to go down but now it's our time now there's this new frontier for conservatives\nWhere we need to start creating content for ourselves and we need to start entertaining ourselves because they're never going to do um and that's what we're trying to do with red old America that's on the heart radio a pod cast or cheating on her radio I'm shooting I heart radio ac\nWe're talking to a Patrick grilled cheese and um let me ask you\nI'm Patrick I'm\nI have this theory about what happened with Megan Kelly\nThat the that the business people\nLooked at Megan Kelly inside while she's a great gift she's she's very credible she's great interview you know we have our own kind of sixty minutes kind of person\nI'm very very smart yadda yadda yadda they hire her and that's when the social justice warriors all around them remind her remind them she's a conservative she was released she was a conservative on a conservative network she was part of Fox um\nAnd no you can't play nice and you have\nTo destroy her and so they hired her for business reasons and then as soon as they realized that the social justice warriors were against it they did what everybody else does and they just immediately changed their tune and set out to destroy\nDo you think there's any validity to that\nOh one hundred percent I mean she didn't have an audience when she went there she was walking into a completely different environment that she was used to I also do think that\nOr a ... going after the network where their coverage of the Harvey wind speed and in the entire me too movement had a big part of that that a lot of people aren't touching on um it it it basically she was you know print brave in doing that\nUm I think you know from a career wise it might have been not the smartest moved to do\nIt yet and here's a woman in the me too moment and exposing the corporation for covering and they don't like that and we're all the social justice warriors on that one\nExactly and that's where you kind of see how the me too movement has become just a political weapon because it was not it it's it's not um being used in the way that it was a God given birth to\nA man and I think that that is is one of the main reasons why and it didn't help that she was a conservative and was easy to get rid of it because of that um so yeah I think that's what happened and egg and\nPatrick ... we're we're talking to the host of red build America you can hear it on the uh I hurt radio out really good story teller I Know you're going to be taking on a few issues that I Want to kind of go through\nA a couple of them um first of all the\nThe caravan that is that is coming up uh there's today they're they're the media and clothing ... Smith are saying there's nothing to worry about\nThis isn't an invasion what what are your thoughts on the care of them [laughter]\nYou know I think that it is something that [noise] for whatever reason the last ten years the left is completely changed their tune on um in regards to our borders are open borders I I I feel like it is\nA we actually do an episode of that is coming up that looks at this kind of story of you know is there actually jobs Americans won't do and we follow a to construction workers that um I I don't want to give the you know the end away but they've completely this prove\nThat ah that that argument and I think at the end of the day there is a lot of people that in America that we've forgotten about that have lost their jobs\nTo to a much cheaper labor that comes across the border and I think that we're seeing this here I think that this caravan it is just not for political refugee status these people are looking for its economic and it's going to hurt the the most vulnerable people in the United states\nWell I think it's what's causing the homeless crisis in in Los Angeles is that fueled by any of this [noise]\nYou know it's a funny thing that you you asked that that it does um one hundred percent fuel out of that because a lot of these kinds of a labor type jobs have been taken away um but another thing that is causing the homeless crisis in ... in Los Angeles is is that there is is the drug epidemic\nThere are there's a thing called patient\nAnd we actually have a story coming out on that I'm patient brokering where people are using Obamacare\nTo fly to fly people out to Los Angeles to rehab centers and then when they end up using them are using the the health insurance or\nThey ended up getting stuck here in Los Angeles and there's been this huge surge of of ... basically go to rehab tourism here in the in the Southern California area that has been a that is it being attributed to the homeless ... of course last you know basically follows\nMe the passing of Obamacare and I've spoken to parents that have basically been through this and they went directly to Obamacare as being\nPart of the reason why uh their kids have gotten out here in Los Angeles and then get end up getting stuck out here [noise]\nUm you're covering also one other story I Want to cover it with you why does the black community vote almost

no\nHowever there's also this question support the actions of kneeling NFL players thirty nine percent say yes and fifty five percent say no\nSo people support their right to do it but don't agree

not the I mean that's not the right way I don't support what they're saying and what their what their actions are correct\nA support single payer healthcare fifty six percent say yes thirty seven

stay on message despite the Pittsburgh massacre and the fallout from the wave of mail bombs that means he's bashing the fake news while news rooms or on a heightened state of security alert didn't seem to care about that with me when they were attacking me and my family was under attack\nThat means he's talking about a migrant invasion at the southern border while authorities examined the
