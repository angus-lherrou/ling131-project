seller dwellers the bottom by my top by Jeff\nCharges five states it for chiefs that three pass it to rams at one how do you have the elite any NFL stacked right now\nYeah I have the ravens at five or looked to me the chargers lost both the teams that that are better than them which to me is kind of a red flag right I'm going to be in the teams they should be the last of the chiefs in Iran's I'm not saying they should be but she's the rams but to me I think the ravens I Know they lost to the browns but they have\nA win over the Steelers on the road el ... football I that's a big deal and and their defense is is really go that often can just be consistent throughout the year um they're going to be a they're gonna be really good um and a\nFour I had the saints look raven saints this weekend that that might change real quick I'm sitting on the road their foreign ones you know a slow start as usual the last four years last for years\nThey started over into this year they almost are open to almost lost the browns are we to but that didn't happen three to me is the chiefs I'm obviously\nA little vested interest in that cheese I really love watching them play but their defense to me\nI'm just not good enough to to consistently when in this week to me the patriots were second you know I I I I Know maybe it's written see bias ah but they're foreign to now they just beat the chiefs of home uh there are over there September soon as usual and they look like they are on the way again\nTo probably getting a we used to first or the second seed you know the chiefs are I don't think that she's Fifteen ... drop out one or one or two more with young quarterback as they have a and the best team and then if I was the rams among church even close right now uh yeah they play to road games\nInto tough spots in Seattle in Denver I don't care that both teams are not as maybe good as they used to be closer to really tough places to play a division opponent in Seattle I go to Denver when it was\nYou know twenty six degrees and the Broncos ruining victory the rams went out and pounded the pound the Broncos on the ground and won that game\nGo to San Francisco this week um I mean they they probably blow up and diners as well and uh on the back and look I don't like to write the worst teams I mean we have a hand for them a niners raiders of bills a giants\nAnd probably going to

got\nAbout him to play for got him I think you're I think Arizona's the worst team in a league right now\nYou might change your mind after they went on Thursday\nWell I don't want to talk about that that's not going to be a very good game I've got forty niners giants colds raiders\nOr the raiders situation is just bad but I'm I I agree with you as good as Andrew Luck is the culture not very good the giants didn't have the luxury of drafting sake one Barclay because they didn't have a quarterback that's what it looks like ... right now and that's that's unfortunate for them but that's the way it is\n[noise] uh yeah I mean they're gonna end up probably with maybe Justin Herbert 'cause you look at the top of the draft they're all teams I'm half quarterbacks except the giants of maybe the raiders they can't move on from car so these these therefore we still twenty twenty two so I Can't get a quarterback took an Arizona will get Andy\nOn the giants my luck luck out themselves up with a with a very good quarterback to pair with a cycle and Barkley almost officer weapons\nA bowl\nAnd they'll be games to nights AL first that in the in El al Chavez Ravine plus the NBA season starts a

I don't know I think we should try that I Hope that somebody smoking peace pipe on this whole thing ...\nBecause this is this is just outrageous don't you think\nYeah she released this big ... basically I Would say presidential audition video yesterday and show everyone that she was for Native American yeah super duper NATO really was a she's Cherokee chief Cherokee and Delaware yeah [noise] uh which is a is something that does not\nSeem to be backed up by the facts now they first came out and said well the DNA test shows her to be one thirty second uh Cherokee\nAnd then they revise that you won ... ... ... the media revise they can they actually looked at the report says one thirty second two one five hundred and twelve and ... then they realized groups do you do see we made a a math there this is a serious correction they didn't say what you do see in the corruption but they they they should have\nA cause that always makes everything better sure uh but it was between one uh one sixty\nFourth in one one thousand twenty fourth I Believe it was yeah one one thousand twenty fourth now that of course in and of itself so if you got the human body up to what one thousand twenty four pieces\nThat one of them one of those pieces\nWould have a little bit of Cherokee now this theoretically right I could at least give her a technical defense of her bull crap over the past fifty years right where she's lying and saying she's a you know she's a Native American and she's uh getting benefits for this and she's getting her stupid soup\nThat's the peas and pow al ... which is the goal of almost everybody\nIn America how how come out child and they want to talk about appropriating a culture powwow chow that's what I'm\nGoing all ... I'm going all full I I'm I'm just I'm going to I just but let's all complain about the names of out both teams but let's let let ... how ... from here on out our our audiences called our tribe and we mean it in the Native Americans sense it's a tribe to trial it does\nSee I mean there are studies that show that the average person of European descent ... has more Native American blood in them than Elizabeth Warren is even showing\nIn her study average person the average person because he ever I mean look this is not it it's a very DNA is a complicated matter and it doesn't exactly show what they try to make it out to show that they didn't show\nAny DNA from an actual Native American yet what it shows we don't have any DNA DNA Native American tribes have said we're not participating in DNA studies we don't want\nAny DNA studies so they've never given any DNA so we can't use actual Native Americans to test\nThe DNA against we\nHave to use people from Peru Mexico and Colombia Colombia yes well\nWay and there's the the theory is that they those the same people want to migrating further south so you can use them as a stand in right but it does not show that she is Native American blood and it's not even what they tested or and even that is it's a weird thing DNA doesn't really do that right like if you\nIf you were born like Ted Cruz right Ted Cruz was born in Canada as many people have noticed and like to point out over the years\nHe would not show the his Canadian blood sites like that not only did they say oh well he was he was three miles over the border therefore he was Canadian with DNA does is it shows a lineage against shows it's it can be interesting in some ways show migration patterns since I Wonder if he would it would have his blood would show that he's\nA thousand times more Hispanic then\nOr other friends disorder or [laughter] that's true it probably would show that uh\nBut so it's interesting you know from that standpoint of her trying to put this issue behind her and falling flat on her face first of all it does not even show the Native American thing second of all the other part which is interesting about this is they do have an idea of who they believe the Native American relative was um it was her\nGreat great great great grandmother I think a several generations back and um when she registers in the Seventeen hundreds she registered as white\nNow the theory again as put forth by the the born a campaign and and and then this is true that\nShe would have had an incentive at this time to identify as white instead of Native American because there's a lot of violence against Native Americans at the time so if you get out of thing you know it's like if you're in Nazi Germany and you said you were not a Jew right and they were able to get away with that there'd be some serious incentives to do that\nNumber one obviously well that's true we don't know that it's true with this person right we don't know that it was true with hit her great great great great great great grandmother ... secondarily yeah but what have we learned from aggressive\nHave learned that if you identify as something you are that thing this woman identified as white\nAnd now or denying her what she herself has identified as she said she was white and now we're going to tell her she's not that was what I was not allowed to apply to any money we can't do that to her but Elizabeth\nWarren is identifying as Cherokee so we have to accept that she is\nSo we can't accept look what what are great great great grandmother identified I Know well it doesn't matter it doesn't matter doesn't matter\nI mean it really seriously this is so ridiculous story is just so rich I don't really care I don't care either I don't care that she's lighting and the people trying to you know she's lying I let me just play look I Want a cigar store Indian with Elizabeth Warren's face\nMore than anybody else on the planet so don't get me are they selling those yet those got them you know we've got to start making them or I Want\nOne more than life itself okay so you know where I'm coming from however\nYou know we all have things I have a story in my family [noise] okay [noise] of uh one of my great great great grandfather is now my ... my grandfather actually took a horse a big a full size of course he was a he was kind of a vet\nAnd he told him and he grabbed him underneath the chin he didn't have anything to put this horse down didn't have a gun or anything else ... and he took him and he punched him in the head and knock\nThe horse out okay so in my family my on my mother's side they're big people are and they they they they had muscles in them that I don't app okay now the legend in the family is that my great great great great grandfather\nOr was this guy I don't know why they always involve horses but one of the neighbors horses kept a jumping over and we're getting into his garden or whatever I don't even know what this and he picked it up and threw it\nOver the fence I don't know if that's true I got to go in and say it's not my family you don't know [laughter] so he could be truly might not be true oh who cares that's what I grew up hearing the same thing with her she might have grown up hearing yo yeah\nThis is what it was but it was the was it was not true somebody advantages through your life did you get because you had people in your family who threw horses over over walls and I was ... I almost made it into WWE but how many times have you told a story you've been on the air for how many years never never I've never to you you've you've\nYeah yeah yeah I get it again if she is you're trying to play identity politics and if you're going to play identity politics you'd better be right on these things and that's why it can give you that I got what it's about it I give you then again I'm not a huge story I mean ... you know\nWe well you know what is a huge part of the story\nIs the Cherokee Nation came out yesterday and said quote a DNA test is useless to determine tribal citizenship current DNA tests do not even distinguish whether a person's ancestors were indigenous to North or South America\nSovereign tribal nations set their own legal requirements for citizenship and while DNA tests can be used to determine lint lineage\nSuch as fraternity or to an individual is not evidence for tribal affiliation using a da in a ... a test to claim any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation even vaguely is\nInappropriate and wrong it\nMakes a mockery out of DNA test and it's legitimate uses wildest honoring legitimate tribal governments and their citizens whose ancestors are well documented and who's heritage is proven\nSenator Warren is undermining tribal interest with her continued claims of tribal air at the edge okay look\nNot a good look yeah they're they're not they're not offering the piece by peer to her\nOr she should probably zip it and it does not go on this whole saga of the last two days when the ... as you point out ridiculous story does this not ... the whole uh serve as a gigantic warning signs to Democrats to not nominate her this is a no\nNo no no I look I Want a no no this is this is a science show she's ... years of really really she yeah she's great she's great she'll get\nThe the minority vote\nShe'll get the Native American vote and vote and a huge crush while anybody who is one one thousand twenty six of anything is going to be voting for I'm afraid of her she should she should be the nominee or re convincing cause I think you know [laughter]\nSays this is not the first study to show a different than clinical outcome with female physicians actually out performing male doctors but she called this study a slippery slope and warns before labeling that profession in one groups favor\n\nFox News some Chris foster secretary of state Mike Pompeo has met with Saudi Arabia's king and crown prince about a missing Saudi journalist last seen in a cause wouldn't turkey\nThe state department sank Mike Pompeo has expressed concern about the disappearance of your mouth shut jeep and the tea thanked the Saudi king for his commitment to investigate the journalists family it's coding for independence and impartial international investigation\nBoxes Simon oh in Maine Senator Susan Collins and her husband are allowed to stay in their home in Bangor after receiving an envelope and no claiming it contained the poison rice and test show whatever it was was not hazardous police sergeant wing better says they're analyzing the letter\nWe'll we'll take it in a process that utilize it to work with a list of ...\nSenator Collins is tanking first responders and says in a statement our friends and neighbors have been incredibly kind of even offered open their homes to us [noise]\nThis is Fox News [noise]\nKnow and one thousand dollars now\nAnd you'll get attacked confirming in free plus\nI hard radio info state or data and Mrs right supply bill said two hundred two hundred [noise]\nTargeted progressive as an individual is\nReally entered analysis their purpose nothing wing progressive chain and beer and a dog in controlling it isn't just smother you is don't water you and brutal honesty is how do we know when they said so and so many where\nMark LeVine and this is what your immediate believe Ninety\nNine month Boston\nDr Wilbur hundred will\nKeep you warm today you needed temperatures getting I'm telling you about fifty seven but the guy sunshine\nThis report is ... by St Mary's credit union I'm In love with St Mary's credit union no fee checking in with direct deposit I can get paid to these early St Mary's\nCredit union is opening a new branch in Framingham don't miss a grand opening with special ... visit bank it as empty you dot com federally insured in the way it is a danger\nI time for the most iconic brand into booming canon basically this free just went public joined me I peeled now pi times the bastard dot com dome is your chance to be part of his Purina making busy at high time investor dot com back my time investor dot com\nHigh times holding corps offering will be made only by means of offering circular which has been found with unqualified by the U.S securities and Exchange Commission the security's are highly speculative investigating shares a kind of ...

America to the ground and the media is on their side\nYou know so it's so frustrating because um we had the same kind of thing happening out in in Portland, Oregon\nAnd uh you know Portland has I I don't know who this mayor is what I mean what the hell is he doing where that they're already directing traffic ... the police are standing a block away than they do nothing\n[noise] well my understanding with these super laughing towns like Berkeley in Portland is the mayor allows anti for re chaos and then he can say\nSorry Trump's supporters are trouble I mean look at all the chaos that happens with someone who likes Trump shows up when when Republicans and conservatives are around so it was just you know if you don't want to antifa around stopping huh that's their sort of model and it works\nIt's interesting because it because the initial video seemed to indicate that you guys were in the wrong that they had they started this and and they started the violence\nThe second video that was released however shows clearly someone from anti of throwing something a at a at a the ... the Proud Boys and and the Mets won the fight breaks out it was not something that you guys at

almost like I'm at I'm at a point now where I think they don't just like antifa they are antifa I think a lot of these journalists these little hostile bloggers will go to rallies the masks on I'm convinced\nI Will tell you I I uh I'm having a very hard time defending a the press which I have\nTried to be more moderating or on my on my words with the press but the the deeper we get in to the

Ninety nine a civil war\nUm and the liquidation of about thirty thirty thousand Brazilians he is extraordinarily divisive but he is not he's not talking about a smaller government he is talking about a government run by the military or at least the has in the past correct\nAnd he's still around it by ... so a haste closest advisers today are a military so as a an exception is a ... and that is appointed as he's minister of economy this guy is a liberal so we have several\nDefenses regarding President Trump as you mentioned he's ... he he's a liberal\nAnd he uh comes as he had strong relationships with financial markets in jail\nSo this is the man that he points that out as a base of the trust in his government but\nUh he said he uh ... it's not clear how he will manage his own team he has had some trouble controlling or his advisers that have given a interviews or saying things that he had later to a unauthorized them so uh\nIt is possible that uh he will close down and keep a very close government regarding the press for example he has been using social media as his basic communication tools [noise]\nDon't ... this is the kind of ... the kind of the same thing that you go job is said\nWhen he was running the first time he said oh no it's not going to be this way I'm not going to do and he immediately came in and he started taking over the media and and the\nNationalizing everything is ... is there a ... ... is that we're we're looking at are we looking at a uh a dictatorship possibility with him that is the military and is it\nWhen you say he's liberal is that is that mean a socialist Marxist or what does that mean exactly in Brazil\nWhat we expect here most analysts are don't see any mediate a risk to democracy as hey we'll take office and immediately he will shut down Congress that's not what has been a discussion here at this time\nWhat is expected is that maybe he could uh promote some change in constitution and it is not clear how he would do it he has\nA suggested that he could create a council that would create a new constitution for Brazil\nAnd that would be submitted to a vote for ah after it so and in ... to to people to a electors in general so\nHe had to to take back this this proposal but it's not clear if he will bring it back when he takes office\nBecause the fact is that he's not going to debate he uh is\nGiving a just a few interviews and usually he controls the process it has been speaking mainly through social media so he has no conversation from the press and this ah creates a of an unknown territory we don't know what's coming but\nA analyst most analysts don't expect something so drastic ah right at the time including because uh in the legislative elections\nHe got a a strong a performance in if from his allies in Congress so we expect that he has some some level of governance ... he and he will be able to do\nSome of the changes that he intends\nTo but we still don't know exactly what what are those changes\nCome it can you tell me Steve Bannon's involvement in this\n[noise] a death ... son it ... and he posted on line a while back a photo of him I'm next to ban in and said that Bannon\nAs said he would be glad to help in the campaign or something like this at this generated a stronger position that Bannon was involved the end was responsible in a great part of a sudden out of strategy\nBut both of them out of himself a case of public afterwards and said it was fake news that has nothing to do with it what do we know for a fact is that Bannon has given some indications that he considers\nA ... an expression of this right wing movements in bed with the uh in other parts of the world and he includes a Donald Trump in this a movement so he understand that it's\nA it's a clear wave in this direction\nAnd both so now that would be an expression of this but we have no a clear indication that he would be involved there's a picture of him close to the president's ... presidential candidates son uh and some sort of a message that he took part in this somehow but we don't know exactly at what point\nI'm Clarissa when when is the election finalized when do we know\nA now at the end of the month a\n... on Sunday twenty eighth or we'll have the final result it's very likely that considering the current polls that bill so not we'll be elected\nUh we uh yesterday we had a a recent poll that gave both an idle fifty nine percent of valid votes and\nSet it on to that that is the candidate from the workers' party only forty one\nSo it's a big ... and I'm both an idle at poll after poll has indicated that uh his delight to our ferry sure of their votes so we we would have to have a a new fact something that would it be strong enough to change the scenario button\nAnd it's very likely that hit he wins the election\nClarissa we'll talk to you again after the election and to find out to some more will be followed a thank you so much per se appreciated okay\nThank you so much for having me you about\n\nWhat is disturbing about this is his history or he has\nA he has a very very strong history of um\nOf dictatorship a love and passion and uh he is not a Donald Trump he's not he has time in the government and he is on record now he says he's changed demand\nA you know but this is the way things happen you don't come in as a dictator\nYou know even Hitler didn't come in as a dictator\nHe came in as a public servant and um and things are bad in Brazil\nThe other thing that has really should pay attention to is Steve Bannon Steve Bannon is flying all over the world and he is a helping cobbled together this a populist movement and\nPopulism is neither good nor bad it's what are the Ames\nAnd uh what are they what ... what's ... you know what to someone use populism to get through populism is the Patriot act\nMake it so it sounds populist make it so it sounds popular make it so it sounds like something everybody will want that's populism and you can use that for good or evil and I'm In my opinion Bannon is\nOn the dark side of this one and he is definitely someone to keep your eye on and so we're all the candidates that he chooses and chooses to engage with um because I'm\nIn the rest of the world the the believe it or not softness and a tempered Donald Trump doesn't necessarily exist are sponsored this half hour is

the Klan that probably and those who can you help me war game this abandoning talk about this Saudi Arabia thing because right now Congress is saying we want to slap major sanctions on them\nOkay I'm you know where we're at a point to where uh I said you know back in the early to thousands you're going to get to a point where if you haven't dealt with these problems it's going to be too late and there isn't going to be a single good option you are not going to like the options and so right\nNow you have people saying yeah ours is Star Wars we're not going to sell them the arms more got slapped sanctions on they admit this this is horrible and it is it is and that's probably what America should do\nHowever let me play devil's advocate oil is already up at eighty\nSome some ah oil is headed up to a hundred dollars a barrel we've pretty much shut down the Texas oil reserves where I mean we're slowing them down because of the price of oil they couldn't make enough money so they kind of slow them down and we have to open those things back up again which we can do\nBut we're not held hostage by oil but a spike a severe spike a hundred twenty a hundred and forty dollars a barrel that's what collapsed us last time in two thousand eight was a spike\nTo a hundred and thirty or a hundred and forty dollars a barrel you also have turkey\nThis is coming from turkey and ... um\nTurkey is no fan of Saudi Arabia um the balance of power with turkey is a little frightening economically the Saudi royal uh funds are big in Silicon valley and that's why one of the reasons\nWhy our stock market is taking a hit at least in the tech sector because they think if it goes the wrong way than the the ... the the funding is not going to come from Saudi Arabia anymore\nAnd you know where they're going to go to get it now obviously there is other places for them to get money for the tech industry but it was easy money or from the Saudis it was a easy to get they had plenty of it they were looking to invest it and when you lose a huge source of funding like that it's you know can hurt the industry\nYou also have Saudi Arabia being the massive check\nOn um uh on Iran if they are weakened if uh they are a\nWeekend in the area not only with Iran but also the Muslim Brotherhood that's a significant force\nIn our favor in that\nI mean Saudi Arabia has remained the least bad option in the region for a while to Israel Israel Israel and Jordan there's others that are that I Would say are better options but would that amount of\nPower yes and uh you know again credibility in the Arab world obviously Israel doesn't necessarily have that um but you know Saudi Arabia you know is a is the big\nA sort of backstop right so what do we do can stop the worst of the things that are as an ear presidents presidents do\nWhat do you do today\nI uh [noise] [laughter] [noise] or resigned [laughter] I Know ah I think um you have to figure first of all we need I Would certainly the first thing I Would do is have more information that I currently do um so I think we're over\nThere with the king the king says she's screw up total screw up this guy who they were out of control you know I wanted and brought over here they got out of control they started torturing him for answers he died\nAnd then they just chopped them up put them in a suitcase yes all of that stuff is true and I can't believe in these guys they've all they're already dead [laughter]\nOr whatever or you know but yes we did it\nJeeze I mean\nI think you at the very least they're going to do something public right and you're going to do potentially sanctions or something of that nature um you're probably also are going to tell them they need to be a incredibly uh open about punishing these people are and sending that signal\nA and I think uh you probably wind up as a president with everything that you have to a deal with\nI mean I think it's okay to take a stand and say you know the sort of stuff can happen anymore we still have relations with a lot of a lot of countries who have done much worse than having killing one journalist as sad as that is I mean this is you know\nThen I remember in the world\nThis isn't this guy is not just a journalist he is a he is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood that's really the problem\nHere is that uh they believe that he was um\nYou know helping the Muslim Brotherhood against Saudi Arabia and possibly even helping the Muslim Brotherhood here in the United states so he's not just a journalist this that let's let's", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program",
