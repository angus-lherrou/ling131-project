I'm Dave Anthony Fox News the EU does not want the U.S\nTo pull out of us Soviet era nuclear arms treaty something President Trump says he'll do Fox's John decker live at the White House\nAnd Republicans got smoked two thousand ten or you had a sixty six percent Republican\nA percentage of people who are really interesting the election only forty nine percent of Democrats Democrats got smoked\nUm you said the same thing two thousand fourteen remember Democrats got smoked again they're Republicans fifty nine percent said they were really interested only forty eight percent of Democrats said that um and what's interesting is leading up to I Would say Brett Kavanaugh\nYou had the same type of thing playing out again in this time in favor of the Democrats started to look a lot like two thousand six so up until ... you had sixty three percent of Democrats\nHighest levels of interest in the election Republicans was only fifty three percent so that is a you know a big it's the type of gap that leads you to lose the ... and lose the house or at least makes it possible since capital that has changed\nDemocrats have gone up from sixty three to Seventy two percent holy cow Seventy two is the highest number for any party and all of these elections\nHowever Republicans have jumped a higher percentage point basis from fifty three to sixty eight\nSo now we have a basically a balance of very close within the margin of error separation and both of those numbers sixty eight\nWould be the second highest level of interest of all of these elections so the Democrats are Seventy two Republicans are sixty eight both of those numbers are the highest of any of these elections going back to two thousand six mid two dozen six midterms\nUm and I mean which is which is crazy it is a a a weakness\nA level here that we don't know what's gonna happen if we this is like you know this is territory that has not been seen before\nAnd ... you know while you can look at the polls and you can see the polls as we've talked about over the past couple of weeks relatively are relatively pointing towards a Republican or a ... victory in the Senate where they maybe pick up a couple seats and Republican loss in the house where they would lose a couple of seats\nUm there is a you know if you look at kind of be optimistic way of looking at the house right now\nTo show you how close is if Republicans were just sweep the races they are favored in okay that that it's not going to happen it never happens but just kind of generally for understanding if they were able to sweep all of the races their favorite and\nUh and they revealed a when all of the races that they trailed by one point so all of these races are either victories are toss ups right I mean they could go either way but if they were to sweep all of those Republicans still hold the house at two twenty two Fifteen now the problem is\nThe idea that they're going to sweep all those races is we know that's not going to happen it never happens the other thing is they will win some races where\nThey're underdogs by more than one point they will win some place where the down by five in the polls they'll want him winning some of those races\nSo the split is going to be important here but just that gets them only to two twenty two Fifteen which is a I think they lose that has been losing tens seats from where they are now\nUm but also a very narrow majority to the point where some conservative things could be derailed by just you know your generic moderate house member that you've never heard their name before um when they decide they're going to vote against the president so\nIt's an interesting a way of looking at it and it shows that this really could go either way I mean when they say that there's about a twenty percent chance the Republicans lose the Senate and about a twenty percent chance that the Republicans when the house that's the\nWay that these models are all kind of looking at it twenty percent is one in five right um so it is very possible that one of these things can happen\nBut right now it looks like those are gonna wind up getting split and then of course still has ... even though you're not gonna be able to pass the Democratic bills because they would either give each other on the train in the house you're still going to have investigative power to have subpoena power going to have imposed\nA nightmare it's a nightmare and if if they get the house it's a nightmare okay so here's here's what I found interesting in um in watching the news and watching just the flow of it\nHave you noticed that you know places like the Atlantic and the times and the post are now starting to publish stories about\nYou know it's an uphill battle to win some of these races in the house it's an uphill battle they have changed their tone from um you know an absolute positive well we're on a blue wave to now almost laying the foundation of ... ... ...\nYeah well we lost but it was you know it was really kind of a long shot anyway\nYeah I mean I that's how badly I think the Kavanaugh saying a has backfired on them I mean it's made the Senate basically I mean again I just said it's one of the five chance but I mean they had they had a better chance of this uh two months ago I mean they had\nA legitimate path to victory when Cruz was only up by three points all of these races that looked like leaning Republican we're all taught supper and some of them looked like they might be leaning Democrat they had a chance to win the Senate before the Kavanaugh saying now I mean I think it's a real\n... going to come to the independents how are the independence feeling\n... there is an interesting group because they are not as passionate as you would expect in this environment so independence in two thousand six and two thousand ten or fifty percent\nNow independence are almost always going to be lower in a high interest in partisans because partisans engage more like generally um that type of course a blanket role but it's typical I'm into doesn't fourteen it was down to forty percent and two thousand eight or Eighteen up until ... when I was forty two percent\nAnd then uh the jump now to forty six percent so still that's not as high as some of the earlier elections among independents and that may just be because\nThey're overwhelmed with him and they don't they don't like either side and they just want it makes them want to withdraw\nFrom Palo yeah but I Wonder because I Would consider myself an independent yeah and there's no way you're going to keep me away from the polls and so I'm Wondering you know would that four percent jump\nWas it a four percent effort to preserve four percent jump I'm I Wonder how much of that or people like me who are going to vote for the Republican just because the left has gone insane\nRight and there's a lot of independence that I ... I mean I certainly would fall into this category as well right I Am not registered member of any party nor will I ever being retired life like was that being said\nUh you know I vote Republican I mean I you know don't vote for Democrats [laughter] so I mean for Republicans independents and libertarians libertarians they don't vote for Democrats but yeah I mean so that's never going to happen so and the fact that I'm an independent you can't look at that line as these are people who could go either way it anytime between these two parties that's not what that is\nRight people who identify that way it's a group that ... that's growing and has been growing for quite some time yes people are bailing out of the parties um but the parties themselves are becoming a more rigid in and more\nOf this one could come down to the independents mhm this one could come down to because you can understand the Republicans going up you can understand if you're on the Democratic side Kavanaugh driving all those people but what's driving the independent\n... yeah ... ... ... I mean I Would think they are discussed\nWith what's going on right [laughter] if anything they don't like the overall system there's one other interesting those data here Glenn if we could yeah I'm as we're talking about the caravan of of uh immigrants coming migrants whatever ... which will will be illegal immigrants if they if they get all the way up\nBy the way who who said that was coming uh oh yeah there's this burger yeah definitely we talked a lot about a lot about this uh interesting to see the numbers among Latino voters\nSo uh in two thousand six were coming off of the attempt at comprehensive immigration reform that fails ... Republicans very upset about that Democrats win that election relatively easily um\nA Latino at sixty two percent high interest in the election\nThat number in mid term elections has been dismal sense night and she doesn't tend was only forty eight percent she doesn't fourteen it was forty one percent very low or in two thousand uh Eighteen up until very recently or was it was at forty seven percent that number has now jumped\nIn October two thousand Eighteen to Seventy one percent from forty seven to Seventy one this year so this is a whatever the reason while they were going on is higher than two thousand six for Latino voters oh wow huh and again that was a wave election for Democrats\n[noise] is it I mean\nThe only thing I can think of is the Guatemalan refugees\nWhat else has happened I mean you did have also a fairly recently the uh uh unaccompanied\nMinors situation where they were being quote unquote held in cages you know I was in July or August ... relatively recently a I'm a you know the the two thousand each in polls were taken January to September\nSo some of those polls were for it at some after okay hum all the October ones obviously after ... men include the migrants are caravans situation and that might explain the jump but it's it's high everywhere I mean it would be the only places low\nUm and it's not low relative to normal which is our

so the president wrote the U.S will now begin cutting off or substantially reducing foreign aid\nA better mouse trap or app or where your worshipping because those are the communities that are going to make you happy politics is a means to an end politics isn't the end\nSo become completely agree with you however our politicians are becoming more and more extreme especially on the left um they are you know they're they are anti capitalist they are they're anti constitution\nSo you know you use on one hand I agree with you we can't be you know all about\nPolitics but at what\nPoint do you see good people\nSay enough is enough and I can't take this anymore\nYeah but then to what end what what do we do next because what we don't want to do next is what the weirdos did a to\nNancy Pelosi in California how are you aware does did to Mitch McConnell at all in shallow and Kentucky exactly ...\nBecause there is no second or third just moved from there that doesn't just end up at violence and this is not saying by the way that people don't have a First Amendment right to protest they clearly do\nBut screaming someone down taking ... lanes food off their table and throwing it on the floor and saying you don't belong in our country or to to leader McConnell or to sex\nIt ... and President Trump's cabinet that kinda stuff doesn't actually have persuasion as any goal the the only thing there is just sort of symbolic politics as rent a witch headstrong pretty dark place I think\nSo I agree with you again but where is the leadership I've written a book you've written a book it's different than actually going out\nAnd leading 'em and standing you know Martin Luther king marching through Atlanta and taking the beating\nA yes but I think we should also recognize that the ... a phenomenon is really built for short term media collapse that is what they're doing that I'm In\nI'm In the middle of a little downtown sort of restored downtown in Omaha right now and ah there's no end to fight\nHere and yet we got a whole bunch of people who might be obsessed with thinking about and to fetch today when I think we we need to be aware of this sort of media college in which we live so in the Nineteen fifties sixty eight percent of Americans\nAny given week we're watching I Love Lucy so that it was sixty percent of households that but basically Ninety nine percent of households knew what Lucy and does he had done that week it was an important content but it\nWas shared content and\nThere was an American way when you fall with somebody about some project at work or if you disagreed with them about politics um you could still talk about things that we had in common what's happening now and why I wrote this book of them is because there is no we right now\nAnd they're the most watched cable news programming a Sean Hannity is number one and Rachel Maddow is often number two they're still really only one point one percent and nine tenths of one percent of the public and so our world is so fragmented and fractured that I think it's really important to not consume our media\nAs if the people like ... who are doing this to hope for viral collapse I think part of what healthy Americans should do is ignored them [noise]\nSo what he is [noise] are\nAre we I mean I've spent the last two years and the\nThings that I can I continually come back to every single time is the bill of rights it's why people came here because they were protected they knew that they had the right to dream and create and be left alone\nYeah yeah is that our our even our own them\nSo yes ... ... e pluribus unum out of the many one right we don't have a whole bunch of one right now we don't have a shared sense of what you've just said\nThe first amendment is the beating heart of the American experiment freedom of religion\nFreedom of the press freedom of assembly freedom of speech right of protest all of those things flow from a fundamental assumption about the dignity of three hundred and twenty million Americans\nWhich is we believe Margot day we believe that our citizens are created in the image of God with the turtles souls and with dignity that way bigger than their policy preferences\nAnd so what's unique in our moment I think the grand tension that we as a people are not really wrestling through that is so far upstream from politics is this tension between rudeness\nAnd ruthlessness almost all of the happiness literature a few well out there it's confirming stuff that wise people people who've had grandparents have known for millennia\nWhich is that happiness is actually a relatively simple equation do you have a nuclear family do you have a couple of deep friendships or do you have a local worshipping community do you have a theological framework to make sense to death and suffering and forest\nAnd statistically the number one driver of happiness is do you have meaningful vocation do you have shared work do you have co workers do you think when you leave home on Monday morning when you go to do something not to make a lot of money or do you have a lot of status but is there some neighbor who benefits from what I Do if\nThose four things are true or even if three of the four true\nYou're pretty likely to be happy\nAnd that those things are all tied to rudeness but we're living through a technological revolution that's tempting us to believe that we can be ruthless we can be place less and so a lot of what's happening is the undermining of local community and the undermining of stick relationships and the undermining of vocation or long work\nUm ends up in a world where a lot of people are using political tribalism to fill a void of the loneliness that's actually happening in their local community I think we need to reflect more deeply on that challenge of our time\nAll right so I'm going to take a quick break and I want to come back and talk about um the press talk about uh the new press if you will Facebook and what you write about what's deep fakes um you seem to be one of the very few in Washington that really get to this\nA and a year looking over the horizon and we want to

why people listen to me when I should talk I talk about ways of making people better I I focus on something which will sound crazy I focus on happiness\nBecause our nation was built on life\nLiberty pursuit of happiness and no one talks about that I Do all the time everything I'm Talking about is to try to make people more happy or to at least allow them to pursue happiness sorry so tell me about that let's start there sure um we talk I talk about for example there are there many controversies that I talk about uh education\nI I have a complete revamp the education system and people just want to keep funding the same system I'm ... ... ... making hemp and the candidates legal\nHang up before it surely stuff let's start with out many Haitian go with ... absolutely on them\nI'm Talking about getting rid of all standardized testing prior to high school I Know in talking about doing that because satirized testing is it unfair way of getting teachers\nIt's an unfair way of rewarding schools and it makes kids who are ten eleven twelve years old feel stupid because they can't test well and there's no indication of success and what are we finding the funding literally kids we we have a thirty percent rise in suicide across the entire nation to include children\nOne of those reasons is family court how broken that is but another reason is there pressure to take tests and to feel stupid and to be some become successful at ten eleven twelve years old\nWhy centralized testing is very good when you're in high school and joined way you should go where your book liberties are not a bad idea but ten years old why is to keep control of what's happening in the schools\nI'm not okay with that now you have a bit of gray hair as I Do know that means you are in school prior to Nineteen eighty and it was I proudly Nineteen eighty there really was the department of education I mean it existed but it was basically a repository for information that way but they really do anything ... somehow everyone in in\nIn the United states somehow learn how to read write survive in the world without and at a department of education somehow that work somehow local school districts that a good job somehow that worked at the Internet you add a technology you think the odds are worse and they give you a quick rundown of every single time\nCentralized control has made things better\nFinished [laughter] yeah right so that's not really what I Want I Want to I Want to make sure that we have some localized central and the only guy saying let teachers teach then I don't administrators because here's the problem with getting testing you will lose about we will lose in New York state we will lose about four billion dollars in federal funding\nIt's a lot of money but isn't that much for us our budget is sixty billion\nSo losing four billion not going to the world however we can still fix that here's the issue here when we lose at four billion we also lose something else we lose all those strings attached that for a million and there's lots of strings which means administrators\nGo away and then it shows what writing granted but it shows you a check and boxes all those things we have massive teacher burn out in New York state massive why regulations rules checking boxes I'm the only one say nice things because I crossed the entire state might say that's easy to counties across all ... to\n... get the full sharply by the way\nFor you though but I Want teachers to actually want to teach we actually have districts that have more minutes raiders than teachers\nThe average teacher and that's a shame for by the way you have a teacher makes about eighty thousand dollars a year in New York state and the average diminish it makes it over a hundred and fifty among you dump a couple of minutes raiders you hide my teachers you've given raises you bought computers all these things but I'm Still not done\nWhy in the world we have K. through twelve neat K through ten\nThe last two years of high school for too many kids is Jim study hall video games and probably smoking weed and that's all they're doing how do we know this because the first year of college for most kids is thirty eighth grade it's removed because they're not ready for it correct so now it takes at least six years the average kid to graduate college\nWas terrible now got twenty four year old kid who's never had a job and we say I wonder why hasn't the work ethic\nWe've never had a job it is he's been he's been he's been screwing around for eight years literally now I have people who tell me literally Larry I Will hire anybody with a work ethic\nAnd one of ... told me he said Laurie my interview process is a very simple I tell them to show up at eight o'clock I open the door if they're there they're hired\nAnd that's how bad it is when people show up at the clock in the morning it is so that's so we need to break that system now I Can't change parenting that I Can't do what kind of changes the the environment of course at sixteen now instead kitchen that five choices they they take a test\nThey get a high school diploma number one if colleges right for you that's amazing go to college\nThe problem is we've been told ally and the lie is the only way to have success in this country\nIs to get a great high school diploma and then go to a great college and then sit behind a desk and it for a new computer all day ... that's a way to success not even close to the only way to success lots of people are happy doing all types of things and we should embrace that so it's sixteen let's not make some decisions\nIf I think called you right for me I go to a two year ... to ... ... is that a biology chemistry history whatever break off to college I go two years and I make sure it's working right so that time I get into college and ready and graduate in three or four years and take advantage of internships are incubator as life is good\nI don't like that no worries on the super smart kid the kid who you know loves doctor I'm teasing my doctor who fan\nI'm a doctor who then it goes back to the game not sure about the new doctor do you know being a female but that's a different story\nDown okay yes I Do um [noise] so that kid who's really smart that can take the SAT right away and goes off and get to a degree why should they be bored in school they should be born school\nNext you don't want any of those things now worries go to a two year trade school go to trace could become a plumber a carpenter whatever you want to be about mechanic an H fat guy in New York state particularly we need that desperately\nThe average tradesmen in New York state is over fifty ... that's a problem I Love my six year old I'm fifty a ... year old my problem is that they should
