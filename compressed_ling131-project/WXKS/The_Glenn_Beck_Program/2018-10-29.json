turn any of that stuff on it sort of the show you know because we're supposed to be aware of it right and do you do that occasionally but I certainly I\nIf I was not in this business I don't know why I Would bother with any of that oh I wouldn't I Would have been a taco barely do down the synagogue thing is he's oh literally it's ... comedy questions that is until they can get\nTo a question about why Trump's Trump's fault like that Joe Lieberman on this morning\nAnd Lieberman is like you know sort of very slowly but surely but he's like you know did he he didn't go there to help with that is the first question was ah you know but what about the what's going on you know give us your opinion and he's like you know look I live in a country as a Jew\nWhere I was basically anti Semitism free my entire life I ran for president and senator I I was I was a winning center in a state with two percent Jewish population and uh I never felt some anti Semitism my entire life he's ... he's like you know we have to make sure that we don't we don't have that blah blah blah\nThis is a terrible tragedy then they're like well what what what part of of that you think is is the the climate of today and and and and Lieberman to his credit was like look first of all we need to make very clear\nThat this shooter\nA outwardly hated Donald Trump\nYeah we do not like Donald Trump he was not a fan of Donald Trump or has nothing to do that don't tie him to it yet but they do more broadly we do have this problem with with with discourse and I think that's true I mean I I think that's obviously true that the overall our discourse is pretty terrible at the moment but it has nothing\nTo do with this and all these cable news networks are ... that were telling you that it does mhm they're obsessed with telling your wife well\nWe don't want us we don't blame it on a do Trump I'm just saying it's Donald Trump's fault\nRight [laughter] that's why it's really is really that's what they're doing never said that about Bernie Sanders Bernie Sanders the guy was working for Bernie Sanders' campaign and he went out and he shot all of the geo ... and another guy and tried to try these trying to kill thirty Republican seat\nThat's really tend to the Republicans was working for Bernie Sanders yeah never said that was Bernie Sanders fault no we never said that and neither did I say and either do today yes of course not but they didn't even talk about it because they they had a very balanced view of\nThat one for a understood that individuals were responsible for their own actions that time is right he understood\nThat then they just don't understand it now because now which is not benefit them in and they always complain about discourse isn't that a great example of terrible discourse yes we can sit on both of these things right when if a Republican and now the python think thing thankfully didn't get anybody hurt 'em but you know we did see that ah with with the Bernie Sanders situation\nBut both situations we said the individual is responsible way the discourse is is is an interesting aside because overall it's not healthy for a country but it's got nothing to do with these individuals shootings and I'm going to do with it and you do not ... discourse does not commit murder doesn't happen\nSo the reason why ... ... and this morning is because uh you know or he sees doing more on trivia and uh and pour a trivia is that is always a laugh and so we wanted to find out how it went on friday a pet uh\nYeah it's it you know it's a chance to get away from the discourse furlough for like an hour a week as and just be mean to yeah and just be mean to be [laughter] dumb they are [laughter]\nSo I'm not going to apologize to you know you know me you know me well enough to know and that one I'm never going to band on that one\nAnd in fact repeated it consistently gets repeat it and it was fabulous and again it was you know I wanted to call for so many times and that just made me just pick up the phone and say hallelujah\nBoth thank you thank you so are you coming to the show in Cleveland or what is it Saturday no it's Hyundai coming\nNo because we're going to be out of town not going to be out of town really 'cause I Know are you a free tickets but a theory it's lame oh now all of a sudden you're in maybe can change up like you change your plans I've got free

leave early Sunday yes it's going back to ... tour by the way for the ticket than the details on we're going to be ... it's going to be fought there's a lot of election stuff to talk about like a a stuff\nYou were given gift from the gods as far as serial goes the the nation's turned completely insane so it makes the comedy fairly easy\nAnswer does ...\nAnd up Pittsburgh we've got something special for you we're going to have laughs and and comedy but uh also uh I Am taking all of\nThe proceeds from the I'm from the event and um we're giving them to\nI'm not sure if we're going to give them to the synagogue or to or to the uh the refugee a dollar a group I'm not sure we are going to give 'em to yet but we're we're\nUh we're we're standing with uh Israel um and uh so the proceeds to your tickets or will be going\nTo a a local Jewish um\nCenter perhaps the the synagogue and I'm not sure they're not stance from an anti Semite like why would you do that when you hate Jews so much um I notice you went back and forth at a little issue with a reporter from GQ this weekend oh did I ah Julia something or other said\nThat she was she's a little upset about this and basically blamed anyone who's ever ... uh criticized I think it was George Soros sheep meadow\nOr and I remember [laughter] and you came back but this is you know completely ridiculous like it's nothing to do with that like we you know and then she posted here's an example of that supporting the Jewish people and posted a clip of one of your criticism of one Jewish person George Soros\nOr as as an example of how much you hate the Jews\nNow I did respond because I found an example of you are supporting the Jewish people as well when you want the defender of Israel aboard a that was shot\nBy somebody national award what are the highest I'm most prestigious awards for someone defending the Jewish people cry but beyond that uh it was just it was just presented by the the prime minister of Israel though\nOh well that's it [laughter] okay that's not a big one that out of bed not a big one so it's just amazing you know 'cause this is not just a criticism of you and it's not just this one dopey reporters\nAll over the place and this idea that if you criticized George Soros that you are an anti Semite is completely insane if you are a ... a conservative\nAnd the people in this audience I wouldn't bleep all would fall into this category many of them will criticized George Soros but they criticize him because he's a liberal progressive policies he supports\nA policy that we disagree with so we're criticizing him around him to be dangerous all around the world around the world he has a very shady history or around the world but but anti Semite patriarch source to ... in some ways there are things in common there however they don't like him because he's a Jew or the way they\nDon't like been Shapiro because you're in front of me didn't show hero [laughter] deporting the policies you know like I don't understand racism I mean you can get to know people in hate them for a valid reason [laughter] you know like Karl Marx I don't like Karl Marx he was Jewish I don't like him not because he was a you know because\nHe came up with the idea of communism\nI'm not a bad no not a fad\nAnd the ... like you're in these liberals have never criticized Ben Shapiro before\nIs that because they're anti Semite it's because they don't like what Ben Shapiro's said\nThey will love what ... they would love Ben Shapiro he was a liberal\nAnd they don't like him because he's a conservative is this distinction difficult for people\nCan you really not understand I mean we all know cannot do it and I it's not all understand that they're just trying to use this to make it look like conservatives they're anti Semite we you're telling me the way the uh you know Sheldon Adelson right\nHere's a guy who is one of the biggest financier the Republican Party have you ever seen a word of criticism for liberals about him of course you have does that make them anti Semitic what it does not it does not you can criticize just like when they criticize Clarence Thomas are they racist\nNo they don't like Clarence Thomas this legal opinion because they don't support what they believe\nIt's not about it it is it you try to make these into cartoon arguments ... is such a\nA ... a Ken this is another example of horrible discourse yes they complain about how bad Donald Trump has made the discourse you're calling everyone who's criticizing the main liberal or progressive funder in America\nYou're killing everyone who does that an anti Semite how that possibly in the realm of positive discourse it's completely a disingenuous and they know it is they know it's not true and they go on television and they say anyway in this time in the middle of a tragedy they say it anyway 'cause they don't care [noise]\nThat that that is exactly what they think they claimed to be again

third\nParty they want unity that number is even higher but I'm not sure people actually mean that is\nI'm not sure what unity even means and then they say that we no longer really um agree\nOn the core values of our country which I think is actually true we don't agree on core values\nBut what are those core values\nAnybody know\nAre the values that brought up what are the things that were actually arguing about now way things are going in the United states twenty five percent are satisfied fifty eight percent dissatisfied the state of politics nine percent satisfied Seventy seven percent dissatisfied\nThirteen percent are like a ...\nPercentage that say Americans are United in agreement about the most important values Fifteen Percent\nFifteen Percent of us they were United on the most important values my question is\nWhat are those values sincerely what are we fighting for our we are we fighting for lower taxes\nHere's what the the here's the surveys the shows where we divide on our quote the most important values\nPolitics in this country it's politics of value um moral ethics in our country\nIs that a value\nRace relations gap between rich and poor the state of the news media the way things are going in the U.S the environment the way things are going in your state\nRights for algae beat the status of religion homeland security\nWith an exception of a couple of those aren't values those are issues that is a political campaign and perhaps that's what we're missing\nSee I I firmly believe and I I I wrote this in the book addicted outrage we have a few things we have to decide\nWe have to decide one so western world worth saving is freedom as our founders saw it is it worth saving yes or no and I don't want\nYou just you know jump off and yeah absolutely why why why is it worth saving who can articulate this\nWhy is it worth saving how has it changed the world in specifics who can make that case among us who's making that case to their kids at dinner at night in specifics\n\nIs America a good place or a bad place we have to decide because half of the country says it's a great place half of the country says and I don't even know if these numbers are accurate and half I doubt they are have but let's just say half the country says it's a bad place half the country says it's a good place\nWhich are we sincerely which are week we have to choose deli because it's a binary choice isn't it were good or bad right it's a binary choice you have to choose one\nNo no you don't it's not a binary choice the answers were both we're both\nWe'd been both bad and good we've had really good intentions and the pathway to hell is paved in good intentions and we have great intentions now on both sides we have great intentions\nWhat are we gonna do with those intentions because you rarely live up to them have you heard anyone actually make the case for America and not\nJust in red white and blue flag waving terms but why is America important\nWhy is the constitution worth fighting for 'cause if we don't know let's just get on with it man let's just move on\n\nI I'm I we cannot sit here and argue about our greatest issues of our time we don't have our basic living rooms I Want to make sure I have this right our our basic essential values in line\nLike climate change\n\nYou can say one of our values is how do we treat each other and how do we treat the earth\nOkay that's a value that's not climate change climate change comes off of that value in principle\n\nClimate change is okay is there a problem\nIs there a problem well I'm Sorry but the science is not settled\n\nThe climate is constantly changing it always has to why we we had the ice age ... where were the SUVs for the ice age\nIt always changes now can we do things that can affect the climate I don't know some people say we can some people say we can't\nThe evidence is spotty at best and you can't trust the evidence that is there because we have too much evidence of collusion and ... and in the scientific field\nYou gave me clean cut studies okay\n\nBut that's not even what we're arguing about were arguing about what to do about it see they keep making a about you know whether it's happening or not I'm willing to give you the benefit of the doubt I'm willing to say okay it's happening All right it's happening what do you want to do about it\n\nWell the solutions are insane the solutions don't work\nNow that is a political discussion that is a political discussion you know where our values come in on that particular discussion when someone says the sciences settled a shot up that's a violation of our values\nWhen people sit down at the table and say look I care about the environment I really do I disagree with the science and here the people on my side that are showing you that this is co workers in this this collusion\nEnd that yours your system that you're you're you're you're you're touting is nothing more than a political system\nAnd it doesn't work\nThat's a political discussion those are the things we should have what brings us together at the end\nOr the values\nWe both care about the earth who doesn't care about the earth sincerely who doesn't care about the earth and I'm tired of being lectured by people who will go and protest and leave us see of garbage buying them for others to keep and clean

they're a girl in tears are doing on that particular day but it's very interesting way of looking at this we talk a lot about a districts that have changed\nFrom Obama to Trump people who voted for Obama and then changed to Trump\nAnd there's the other side of that is people who voted for Romney and changed Clinton\nAnd there's an interesting ... a breakdown ... there were a let's see if it's Thirteen districts that voted for Mitt Romney and two thousand twelve and then voted for Hillary Clinton in two thousand sixteen so two thousand twelve on average ... according to five thirty eight had about an eight point advantage for Romney\nAnd two thousand sixteen it was a five point advantage for Democrats [noise]\nSo what what are we closer to I think it's interesting to see where we are when it comes to the polling as of right now\nAre we have about a to point advantage for Democrats in those states so if you look at it kind of ... to summarize those kind of lost three points are well well the three point Democrats have lost three points from two thousand six ... less passionate ... two thousand sixteen but a big big move from two thousand twelve\nGot it so they're kind of in the middle but leaning towards the Democratic way they voted in two thousand correct team now they were Twenty one district that voted for Barack Obama and then voted for Donald Trump Twenty one\nSo in two thousand twelve with Iraq Obama they had about a six point advantage for Democrats ... ... in two thousand sixteen that swung from all the way back to\nEvan points Republican for Donald Trump so it's a huge swing there\nIs that you would think of these real swing districts so far polling you're showing that leaning to the Democratic side by five and a half\nPoints that's big the big change too and that was that's almost equal to where they were voting roam around ... time so if you look at that the people who were voted for Obama then switched to Trump are kind of back to the position where they were voting for Iraq Obama wave and Romney\nAre people who voted for Romney then went to Clinton\nThey're in between those two positions leaning towards Clinton [noise]\nThat's where these a district show up there's also five states where this is a where this occurred\nFive states or Florida Michigan Ohio Pennsylvania Wisconsin where they voted for or bronco Obama been changed to Trump\nIn the Obama election that had about five point advantage for Obama and those states in the Trump election there was about to point advantage for Trump\nRight now those states are showing eight twelve point advantage for Democrats family now now that part of that it it's a little bit different than what you would say in the house where they're broken up into little areas and there's so many candidates and their up all the time\nWhere this is some of these races are just they're so popular Democrats already Pennsylvania is a good example of that where they have been just a big lead or not because I don't think that's necessarily solely because of some ...\nTell me what all this means from last\nWeek or the Democrats making is is the momentum start just they're just starting to swing back towards the Democrat\nI Would say it doesn't tell you much about the Senate but it's I think it does tell you something about the house which is [noise]\nThere was that I Hope that there'll be some movement in the house towards Republicans these numbers aren't showing that I mean it right now wait till the teams like the Democrats will take the house uh and the Republicans look pretty solid in the Senate right now when will we see\nAny movement at all are due to the shooting and the bombing [noise]\nWell the polling wouldn't even start probably if you weren't real polling reaction that
