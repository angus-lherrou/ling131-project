left\nNo amount of evidence in favor of Kavanaugh will change your mind\nAnd you know what I I I really\nI can understand how you might emotionally connect with her especially if you were a victim I can\n\nShe is possessed with this on ending hatred and there's nothing anyone can say or do anyone who says I Know Kavanaugh didn't do it you're fooling\nYour self anyone who says I Know he did it you're fooling yourself\nYou're filling in blanks that you cannot unless you're God let me check yeah no I'm not God today might be your turn unless your God you don't know that\nYou cannot know that I mean this is one of those cases where it is so crystal clear to me judge less you be judged how you judge other people\nI'm telling you if he did it he's out\nIf he was perjuring themselves I don't

both of those men had things about them that I don't like both of those men\nUh they had one was the alleged land or the other\nWas it clear racist gundy I still think they were great men they were just flawed\nWhen you go into social justice and you believe in collective salvation or collect the of justice that I'm going to right the wrongs of the world because men are collectively

because\nI'm going to be honest with you I did that to you because I was so convinced I was right\nThat I did that to you I instead I didn't listen to you I just thought you're crazy these are the your your flushing down this and that and blah blah blah and you're wrong no no\n\nYou saw sings a different way\nAnd as I've said on many occasions on this program since the election I was wrong on multiple occasions but what\nAmazes me is when I say those things the number of people who just want to rub my face in it\nThat's okay if that makes you feel better but I just want to tell you that's foolish\nYou do it to me all your wide please don't do that to others please don't do that to others who say you know what I think you are right or you know what I Can't take my own side and and while I don't like your guy that much I mean you guys are at least making some sense\nPlease do not rubbed their oh well we told you so well really remember when you don't do that please don't do that will

you're trying to look at it and you're and you're just playing team a lot of people would just be like the Democrats are the worst and they're insane but I mean I Know people who are are

hey they want to stop this or hey they want to protect roe versus Wade\nThere is a different part of this it's about throwing the entire um the tire efforts of logic off base\nIt's based in post modern as ... or ... explained in the book and and you'll see the times I look at it sound like I don't understand what are they doing why are they saying they think that that didn't make any sense and there's an easy political explanations for all that but it's not real\nThe real basics of it the foundation of why there why are they attacking this in this way is all in the book\nI mean and it's I Wish I could I Wish Kavanaugh would have happened while I was writing the book because I think it is the perfect example\nMaybe we should do that tomorrow maybe we should take the book the theories on the book and just show exactly why everything is happening point by point yeah or you can find it in the book addicted outrage and the the most important part is it educates you and shows you how the other side is fighting\nAnd why you must not fight that way\nA and the reason why is because they are trying to create chaos and I don't mean your neighbor who's a Democrat I mean I mean the people who are at the university levels are and the the upper echelons of politics they know what's going on they don't they do not believe\nWhat they're saying they're doing it because they have a

some ... you see them acting or radically and there's some reason and you don't understand that why would they do this they blow their job why they do this they blew their marriage all those things why would the left act this way about this thing\nAnd it ... you know if you know why they're doing it and if you're not just dismissing it as typical politics you can fight against it much more effectively and and you know you spend a lot of time in the book going through not just how how and why this is going on but how to push back against that and how to defeat it\nYeah it is not a a it's

now we have a background check Trump is just a okay the expansion of the FBI background check on capital which ...\nI'm so we have that going for us uh and they were really I mean let's be honest it's important\nThat someone who is going to be wielding a lot of power especially where the law is concerned oh yeah we we look at every single accusation because the worst thing that could happen is you know he gets in and he's a judge and he is you know looking at some case before him\nAnd he himself was a serial rapist\nOh thank you all that stuff but the area important it's so important very important if you're abusive to women you should certainly not hold the role\nThat relates closely to law enforcement it doesn't make any sense right right right like judge\nOr or or or um uh\nGeneral general attorney general would be a good one yeah yeah that's a great point and I'm Glad you brought that up because there's cause for certain candidates or who's running for Minnesota attorney general really who's been a a credibly accused\nOr by a woman or he was dating now there is an interesting there's a little bit of a separation and we should be fair on this ... there's a separation between the capital case in the ...\nOf the cabinet case happened uh thirty six years ago the also the case was pretty much ongoing until very recently okay okay All right so there's a difference but on different ... a professor Ford she had a spotty memory\nIssued a very spotty memory now the uh the accuser um who we do not remember with Ford we have no even than that there was a relationship of any sort between Oregon Kavanaugh right we do know that a long term girlfriend of Keith Ellison has accused him of sexual abuse\nOr ... violin okay oh okay that we got both of those so the little do you remember where they happened uh you know she does remember when they happen okay does what did she ... she probably doesn't have notes\nFrom her doctor ... you know from the when she was talking to her doctor when the doctor\nGets it wrong of course like ... ... words case they both have a notes from there do they do around those cases are the the Ford case with something that was a Thirty years after the incident in which he referred to an attack by four people which is different than the story that she's telling now and never named Kavanaugh\nThe notes from ah the ah Alison Keith Ellison I'm a former girlfriend a doctor\nDo name Keith Ellison as the reason why she's getting medical attention for physical injuries um and that's kind of a difference to you might you might notice a slight distinction between those two things\nOne has notes or the don't ask don't actually named the accuser and it was you know many many many many many many years before and this is I'm going to the doctor to get medical treatment because this guy you\nThough using meeting me yeah and so she and you know and in one one one case you have a woman who has photos\nOf the incident and has photos of bruising ... on her the other one of course does not um being fortunate to have that now there are there's a witness situation we need to deal with the of course I'm a Ford has name several people who were at the parties none of them can remember it happening the people forward named\nCannot say that they were actually at the party some of them have said I was not there some of them that I don't remember any party like that so there's a wide wide berth there between those two opinions but she has named witnesses just none of them have corroborated her story in any way\nA key those in a girlfriend has also a named sources those people say the exact same thing and say they've seen evidence of the actual a crime going down um including things like tax I'm writing um the pictures\nAnd those are things that she showed two co workers in real tired\nReal time and had several people she told about it at the moment and again we have no one that forward told about it at the moment in fact in any moment of until at least two thousand twelve where it does not appear she actually he had to Kevin uh I've said the name Kavanaugh even at that\nTime yeah but ... and I mean you I mean you don't have videotape\nWell it was yesterday of tape now we haven't seen it yet though are now there is allegedly videotape that exist some one of these physical altercation we ... we have not\nSeen it yet I'm of course there's no video of the cabinet thing because you know that wouldn't be the thing that we have to take her word that there is video with the with the with the ... and we don't have that evidence yeah we have a a a ton of evidence and in fact\nI don't know hundreds of times more there's really no evidence and the forties so we have I mean like we have any amount more it was like we have a preponderance of evidence in the Alice in case the however um", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Newton", "day": "02"}
