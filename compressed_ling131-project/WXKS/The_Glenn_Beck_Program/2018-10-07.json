women and girls are treated in this country\nAt the same time there is as of now no contemporaneous corroborating evidence for any of the charges as far as we know we haven't seen anybody emerging say

my book addicted outrage um there are lots of examples of of why we should really be talking about something entirely different like we should be talking about how do we make how do we strengthen this and spread this around the world\nRight now are dialogue is America's sucks nothing is good everything is bad and that is absolutely not true\nIn the middle chapter of the the book I I ask this question\nIs this worth saving\nNobody is asking this we're talking about getting rid of capitalism changing our whole system changing everything about it it doesn't work no one is asking the question that must be asked first is this worth saving is America and the west good or bad\nIt can be both because people are both\nBut is it on the on the whole has it helped to more people or hurt more people\nWere not having that conversation we are having an now Arthur Brooks is the president of the American Enterprise Institute he's the guy who grew up in Seattle I grew up in the Seattle area um he remembers the first time he saw poverty and I think\nIt's the first time I really saw poverty as well I think it was it was probably the Michael Jackson a that fund raiser we are the world where we were trying to raise money for Ethiopia and we saw these kids with the bloated stomachs and the flies on their face we had never seen anything like that\nThat was a pivot point for Arthur Brooks in his life Arthur welcome to the program\nHey brother Glenn how are you very good doing months how're you doing\nI'm I'm I Am great I'm great um I I wanted to get you on because we do not to talk about what capitalism a and what this country has has done what the western way of life has done and we're just allowing it to be thrown out the window\nAnd you make compelling case because you didn't come at this with politics in mind\n[noise] no I don't you know and and a lot of the things that we are talking about today I was listening to the last segment of your great show and and you you're talking about this big war this big cultural battle that we're having in those countries or whether it's about the Kavanaugh hearings are about the Trump Administration or about capitalism in general\nThese are really kind of proxy cultural battles that we're having in in our country today it's a culture of outrage you've talked about this a lot\nUm you've done ... work on this important topic and it's important for all of us to remember we are so unbelievably blessed in this country we live in a peaceful society I mean\nIf you're going to have social media if you dare you know if you if you can stomach it and listen to people saying the most violent ghastly things to each other but but let's remember there's going to be known knocking the night it was going to be no jak booted thug nobody's going to take you off to prison God\nBless this country and we have to stop taking for granted the fact that we live in a democratic peaceful society\nAnd we have to stop trashing each other all the time and having the dome proxy wars that's completely unproductive\nSo ... right now I you know the big ideas are being trashed the ideas of freedom of speech or because you know you have to have a safety the safety space all of these all this nonsense\nYeah but also capitalism itself when you saw the pictures back in the eighties of those starving Ethiopians\nIt bothered you and you actually ... set your feet on the course of trying to find out what happened to them right\nIt did I mean the fact that I'm a political conservatives today has everything to do with the fact that I share the objectives of most of my [noise] my my left wing friends and family that I care about poverty in ...\nAnd I started to look for the way that you can wipe out poverty everybody listening to us clan believes\nAnd and the their their obligation infect their privilege to lift up their brothers and sisters at the margins of American society and and and society around the world what really matters is what works what system works full use sleep I became a proponent of American free enterprise system\nAs a gift to the world because I wanted to do more to help my brothers and sisters and I found that there was one system of pulled people by the billions all around the world these are big issues that we need to be talking about it in America today and how we can do this better\nThan you give me some of the stats Arthur I Know you I don't know if you have him off the top of your\nYou know absolute so from Nineteen Seventy and killed today you know when when you and I were\nReally little kid um that was when the world sort of open up and people started to see what was going on so it's really in the seventies that people saw that Ethiopian famine I went to India for the first time when I was Nineteen years old in Nineteen eighty three is starving children and it was ghastly\nFrom Nineteen Seventy until today eighty percent of the world's poverty has been eradicated starvation level poverty has been eradicated no Seventy percent of Americans actually think that poverty is getting worse and the reason is because it's never\nLike front page and the New York times or any of the newspaper millions saved from poverty I mean that's not a news story you only see the things that are going wrong but the truth is it two billion of our brothers and sisters have been pulled out of storage little poverty Glenn since you and our kids and there was one thing that\nDid that and that was democratic capitalism and that is America's export to the world\nThere I don't think you would disagree with me Arthur um that we are not using the first task of wealth of nations moral sentiments we are we uh we have we think that capitalism is just going to be good no matter\nYou know who's wielding it and and it's just going to produce wonderful things no it as Adam Smith lines out it it can produce really bad things as well yeah capitalism depends on the people who are willing ... are wielding it\nBut also uh depends on on what our goals are\nYeah slow and its corrupt now would you agree with that\nYeah that's well that's the problem is is not capitalism a lot of what we see today wired deals cronyism all the special stuff that's going on with powerful people in Washington D. C. and in every state capitals around the country that's actually not competition that's trying to shut competition down on behalf of powerful people\nSo she'll competition is good competition politics and economics and then the competition of ideas factors that\nYou know the ... the Glenn Beck show is part of the competition of ideas and a friend democratic nation is very very important [noise] anybody wants to shut down competition on behalf of powerful people is not a competitor doesn't believe in capitalism doesn't believe in democracy and doesn't believe in the free exchange of ideas\nTo compete means to do it better than the other guy fairly peacefully and respectfully and to win over an audience and said that that's really what we ought to be doing and that's what we're moving away from\nOkay so Arthur I'm gonna take a quick break and I want to come back with a question that I cannot find a satisfactory answer on I Am a big believer in capitalism however there is throughout history\nSome people like Vanderbilt et cetera et cetera they get so much money they have so much power that they are controlling things and it just seems to spiral out of control when you have you know a just a lock on this wealth and we are creating\nPeople through Google et cetera et cetera that are doing the same thing how do you balance the power how do you how do you make sure who's who can compete against Google\nHow are you going to do that how does that work when you get to that point to that like to hear your answer on that when we come back [noise]\nClans\nWeek days it five thirty Easter join us for a brand new program were fired\nAbout the Pentagon ever wonder why we choose the stories we using very high wanting or we can I can live with that important team for why he just got the things the mainstream media won't touch it was like it's your lucky day\nAnd the guy for our Michele then yes and why it matters we right after\nRealized he forgot his homework\nThe school when you can see learning an attention issues from their side you can be on their side that's why there's understood that or a free resource for the parents of the one in five kids with learning and attention issues go for misunderstanding to understood that Oregon brought to you by understood in the ad council [noise]\nNews I'm Karen McHugh the Senate majority leader defending the FBI report on Brett Kavanaugh that cleared the way for his eventual confirmation multiple\nWitnesses over and over and over ... popping up here we had an FBI investigation and three members of our conference who are undecided took a look at the uh beyond ... two of the three decided to confirmed judge Kavanaugh Mitch\nMcConnell on Fox News Sunday justice Brett Kavanaugh will literally take his seat on the Supreme Court this Tuesday\nFifty three year old justice will take his seat on the far right of the bench right next to associate justice Elena Kagan who are those of you who don't know actually hired him to teach at Harvard law school when she was dean up in ...\nNew York state police say twenty people were killed Saturday with a wedding limo crashed into a crowd of bystanders to farm stand\nIn the upstate town is going to Harry Mrs Fox news\n[noise]\nKill trips Gillette Stadium today still that any perfect weather to be outside apple taking a stance in the seventies with some clouds tomorrow in this ...\nThis report is Bronx you buy compassion international you can't change the whole world but you can be part of the change in the world for a child living in poverty by becoming a compassion international trials sponsored you can choose a child to sponsor now with compassion dot com slash radio vets compassion dot com slash radio\nMessage into your ... burning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country might sound impossible to fit into your workload\nBut what if there were a business degree that further your career and give you access to world renowned faculty leaders and mentors all on your schedule one that open doors to some of the most influential CEOs tech companies law firms entrepreneur in thought leaders and what if you could earn that degree in his little less sixteen months one hundred percent on line\nTo find out more text trend to seven nine six four or five\nThat's T.

the American Enterprise Institute\nArthur though the ... who is we're talking about is this system even worth saving yesterday in politics there was a nightmare and people are just turned off by it and I think they just don't want anything to do with it\nUm on both sides of the aisle I think anybody who is is a rational human being is like this is this is not good and none of this is good\nUm however ... ... we're not having any one stand up for the bill of rights the constitution that's why politics has gone awry 'cause we've deep ... you know unpaid from that\nCapitalism is is got a horrible name you now have fifty percent of young voters saying you know socialism is great I Want what they have over in Sweden but that's not what they have in Sweden isn't\nIt isn't and and by the way there are some people standing up for the bill of rights but competition guys like Glenn Beck and we got a major megaphone and you're standing up for what's right and throwing good the big problem is that there are too many people in the media and politics and entertainment in our polls campus shows\nOn the right and the left or ... or ... dining out on the fact that we have a culture\nThe contempt in this country contempt for each other\nI mean Glen you and I we both have and everybody listening to us we love people who disagree with us politically that's fine that's a good thing I mean we all should have friends and and people that we were just really have to agree with them we should disagree strongly but we don't have to hate him and there are people that are making money and getting famous and getting powerful\nBy trying to get us to hate each other even more we should be talking about these good things that you talked about\nThe things that really bring us together and then try to disagree in a way that the competition can actually convince other people persuade other people of our ideas but that's the big problem right now too many people are getting too rich by by getting us to hate our neighbors and that's not right\nSo Arthur let's have let's have the conversation I'm I'm somebody in college and I said capitalism is evil and you know there's nothing wrong with socialism socialism is graded works in the Netherlands\nYeah I Know so I hear I hear it all the time we saw him on college campuses all the time the way not to take that on is by trying to create liberal tears that's the wrong way to do it is to attack somebody's motive into say their belief system is stupid\nThat will you can never ever ever insult somebody into agreement and by the way it's an immoral thing to do because these are your brothers and sisters as well the key thing to start off with an any argument is to acknowledge the objective a moral objection to the people is to is to give voice to the fact that\nYou you want these up social systems 'cause you want something more poor poor people have more equality where people have more opportunity right and get people to say yeah yeah yeah okay well let's figure out the best possible way to do it and then make the positive case for capitalism and democracy\nAnd free enterprise and entrepreneurship ... lifted more people out of poverty in any system in human history it's created a system of of equal opportunity that nobody has ever thought of in the history of humanity and say\nAnd now the problem is not that this is unequal but ... we haven't actually tried to make it as equal as possible and push it all the way out to the periphery of society let's do that together\nCan you give the arguments because most I think even most conservatives um fold on the the Netherlands or Sweden when people say I want socialism like Sweden and you describe what that is\nAnd how the woman goes into a clinic comes out down there is no

there's a difference but that's on different ... a\nProfessor Ford she had a spotty memory\nYeah she's a very spotty memory now the uh the accuser um who we do not remember with Ford we have no even fence that there was a relationship of any sort of between ... and Kavanaugh right we do know that a long term girlfriend of Keith Ellison has accused him of sexual abuse\nOr ... violin okay oh okay that we got both of those so the little do you remember where they happened uh you know she does remember when that happened okay does\nDid she ... she probably doesn't have notes from her doctor ... you know from the when she was talking to her doctor wind\nGets it wrong of course like in their words case they both have a note from there do they do around those cases ah the the Ford case was something that was a Thirty years after the incident in which he referred to an attack by four people which is different than the story that she's telling that would never named Kevin ...\nThe notes from uh the uh Alison teeth Allison's I'm a former girlfriend a doctor do name Keith Ellison as the reason why she's getting medical attention for physical injuries huh um and that's kind of a difference to you might you might notice the slight distinction between those two things one\nHas notes or the don't ask don't actually named the accuser and it was you know many many many many many many years before and this is I'm going to the doctor to get medical treatment because this guy you they'll usually meeting me\nYeah and so she and you know and and one one one case you have a woman who has photos\nOf the incident [noise] um and it has photos of bruising ... on her the other one of course does not um being forward she doesn't have that now there are there's a witness situation we need to deal with them of course I'm a Ford has name several people who were at the parties\nNone of them can remember it happening the people forward named\nCannot say that they were actually at the party some of them have said I was not there some of them that I don't remember any party like that so there's a wide wide berth there between two opinions but she has named witnesses just none of them have corroborated her story in any way\nA key that once in a girlfriend has also a named sources those people say the exact same thing and say they've seen evidence of the actual a crime going down um including things like tax I'm\nWriting um pictures and those are things that she showed two co workers\nIn real tired real time and had several people she told about it at the moment and again

right name for it\n[laughter] it is and it actually the creepy line comes from a speech that erupt Smith Schmidt the CEO of Google gay but it was an interview in fact\nWhere he was asked how do you make these ethical judgments about how far you're going to go and then the interviewer actually asked Schmidt are you going to implant things in our brain and here's Schmidt's response was well we like to go right up to the creepy line but not cross it\nAnd he said we're not going to implant anything in your brain at least not yet those are actually erupt Schmitz word and\nDana he's up to I find him incredibly Frank yes he he just he says it like it is yes it's I I've interviewed him a couple of times and it is fascinating yes because he's just telling you he\nHe doesn't sugarcoat it and I think it's his background as an engineer a and and he's sort of very direct I mean one of the other things we caught him when the film was saying is that Google a house and takes very seriously its responsibility to change the values\nOf American people uh you know Google's Monterey has always been there are more than just a company and make money or they have a certain the east coast or the world view and part of the reason that they structure of the company the way they did\nIn which the founders always have controlling shares is that that sense of social mission is part of it\nAnd Schmidt has been always very direct about paying it yes part of our mission as a company has been to try to shape and changed the values of the United states and that sort of one of the premises of this film that it's not just about privacy it's not that they're taking all this information\nGlands are using that information against us to try to nudge us or to move us in directions there that we wouldn't ordinarily want to go\nOkay so um so let's can can can you tie this all to Kavanaugh and what we've seen with the cabinet case and how for instance you know there's there's um a\n... there is this overwhelming uh understanding from half the country that he is absolutely guilty and she is a victim right and\nThere's a lot of information on the other side in fact more information on the other side but you're not really seen that right\nYeah it's it's very hard because this is happening in real time right now to sort of monitor what's a Google doing but we can look at the past uh in fact one of things we feature in the film is a study done by a Robert ... Stein or have science a very interesting guy he's a Harvard PHD in psychology studied under BF Skinner\nOr was the former editor in chief of Psychology Today magazine and by the way and this is very relevant was a Hillary Clinton supporter in twenty sixteen\nWell one of the things he did and the twenty sixteen election was he had two thousand people around the country\nDoing Google searches are and they monitored the results that people were getting this is a very ah you know a clear academic study and and this research was peer reviewed as his other work was\nAnd what came back was that Google was systematically skewing search results in favor of Hillary Clinton they were in other words they were a suppressing negative stories about Hillary in the algorithm and they were pushing them in favor of Donald Trump\nAnd ... point was I actually supported Hillary Clinton thought she was more qualified but the bottom line is a company should not be doing this and the ... you don't know that it's going on nobody's monitoring the results are getting their assuming the results in the list that they're getting is representative of some objective standard\nGoogle is a Google is a verb now I'm not a noun verb auto Google it yes well if you Google it and the end the algorithm is giving you the answer that is skewed right that's like going to a dictionary\nThat will always changed the definitions of things but as it applies to whatever's happening in the world yes that's real problem\nNo you're you're exactly right and so in the in the context of cabinet I mean I don't know exactly what because it's occurring in real time but\nThe bottom line is there is a history here of Google doing this it was it was leaked um uh a couple of weeks ago Tucker Carlson talked about\nUh about these internal emails where you actually had Google engineers saying hey you know what we don't light you know Trump's policy on immigration so we want to sort of a suppress certain stories\nUm this is a thing in Google does it end and here's the the the point that we tried to make Glenn in this film and in general\nThe whole conversation that Google wants to have is about fake news and this debate about fake news here's here's the bottom line fake news this competitive\nIf you and I are having a disagreement about something I put up my fake news story and you say oh yeah I'm going to put up my fake news story the pointed it out in the open you have combat and by the way the news doesn't really convince anybody you know if you like Hillary Clinton\nThat fake news add that the Russians ran of Jesus and and and Hillary arm wrestling [laughter] probably not going to convince you vote a different\nWay that wasn't that that wasn't a real arm wrestling [laughter]\nBut you know the point is is that that's not going to convince anybody because the confirmation bias you know people tend to look for information they want what Google is doing is different because we don't know what we don't know\nThe question that we should be asking people the Google and Facebook is why will you knocked make your algorithm transparent right why will you not I mean and I let me take a quick break and come back do you have an answer\nTheir answer on why they won't make it transparent yes and it's not very good\nAt it is not\nThe name of the documentary is the creepy line the review line dot com Peter ... with us and we have a lot to discuss because of the plant forming\nA and kind of a role in from our last conversation about\nInformation out of you know that it's true and we'll true information will will actual information will be allowed to see or keep in the future [noise]\n[noise]\nFox News on hand like a tragic crash in upstate New York twenty people in the limousine and show harried New York were killed hundreds you Susan Collins announcer was voting yes for judge Brett Kavanaugh after reading the FBI report\nThere were a lot of rumors that only the four people I bet ... port mentioned dinner testimony would be intervening that was not the case I wrecked twelve different interviews ad on Thursday\nCollins was on CBS his face the nation Senator Ben Cardin says Democrats have concerns\nWe are very concerned about protecting the progress we've made on on health care issues on women's constitutional rights on protecting the more investigation\nSenator carded on Fox News Sunday Fox News we were poor you decide [noise]\n\n[noise]\nWell no trips ... stadium today still that needs to perfect weather to be outside apple picking attempt in the seventies with some clouds tomorrow and the sixties [noise]\nJay Martelly founded usage promise more up to you to learn more visit TJ march held on board\nThat DJ Marcel dot org [noise]\nThis report is Bronx you buy the T.

that I think you're very smart to do that because let's step back in first consider the power of Google and a lot of people don't realize this but it was widely reported in the guardian elsewhere in two thousand nine Google actually shut down the entire Internet for two hours on a Saturday morning\nThey blacklisted the entire Internet\nThat shows you the the scope and the size of the Google ... wait a minute I mean it it it's it's a ... they blacklisted the entire Internet if you go to the guardian WWW yes they shut down the entire Internet a couple of years later they shut down half of Japan's Internet\nOr they said it was sort of an area that they but but the point being the size and the scope of this company is enormous\nAnd a lot of people don't realize even if they're not using it Google products somebody will say why don't use Gmail I'm not worried about Gmail that's fine but here's your company ... you know it may be John Smith acme incorporated dot com but his acne incorporated email server actually a Google product\nBecause if it is golf Google is monitoring and watching what you're doing and it's part of the data collection they're doing on you a lot of news organizations in the United states use group\nOh we we we highlight in the film for example Robert up sign this caller who's been critical of Google\nA link to support a Clinton supporter a Harvard PHD in psychology um Iran or did some studies and the Washington Post ran a piece about could Google swing an election this was back in twenty twelve yeah the next day\nRobert ... was shot out of Google he could not get on Firefox he could not get any on on any of the uh the Google products they had shut 'em out same thing happened to Jordan Peterson a University of Toronto professor\nWho had taken a position about forced speech if you have on general or gender pronouns the next morning when that went public he was locked out of his Gmail accounts\nAnd Google would not let him back into his Gmail account all of his emails his calendars and everything he was blocked from\nThe point being they have a lot of power and you cannot assume that Google is not going to take these actions people will say a lotta times whether a company they want to make their customers happy they are more than a traditional company they say so themselves\nThey view themselves as a company with a mission so\nHere's what people say when when you know what I use ... well you know Google is monitoring your mail they're not reading my mail actually you are both right and wrong they are not reading your mail however\nThey are analyzing your mail because what they're doing is collecting the information on how people relate to one another how people talk to one another all for their a\nI research so Google isn't fried rice for no reason\nThat's exactly right you you are the product we say what is Google's product you are the product because they are selling information on Glenn Beck or on Peter Schweitzer or on whoever\nAnd more importantly I think\nThey are ... all of it look you know there's that this is just at the beginning let me tell ya boogie story mhm you go to Beijing there are three concentric circles of security in Beijing okay\nThe center is the main city of Beijing how many people that you just look it up for me what are you still how many millions of people are living in Beijing\nIn the city proper that is the inner circle there is so much monitoring going on they just did a test they release the guy they they uh took a guy [laughter] pick somebody said go into the center of the city just go hide okay [laughter]\nThey had a picture of the guy and the the Chinese tested this new brand new system and then", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck
