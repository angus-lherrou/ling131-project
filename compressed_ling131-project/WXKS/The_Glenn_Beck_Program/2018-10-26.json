not an issue with just the current administration and stop making it one President Obama was historically a nightmare for the free press and you refused to say anything about it\nThe crazy thing is today\nThe craziest thing is is that the media gleefully gave Obama a pass even though he was ... the FBI and the de OJ against the press\nDonald Trump has gone so far as just calling them fake news and they got their feelings hurt\nForget about the oh I don't know threatening to throw us all in jail\nThis president is calling us fake\nNews yeah well he kind of has a point just if you even look at how President Obama treated the press compared\nTo you know President Obama was putting new people in jail he was what\n... the government against you and you failed to stand up and say any thing\n\nI mean he was gearing up for its outrage over being called fake the New York times was publishing an ...\nArticle on the very same day these pipe bomb packages were delivered now I Want you

novelist had one assignment right out what you think happens after the Mueller investigation is completed okay [laughter]\nSo let's come up let's go to fiction writers and come up with what they think is going to happen with Mueller's investigation and what's gonna happen immediately after\nAnd you mock me you mock me\nEvery single one that's going to come a surprise they found five fiction writers are going to do it\nBut every single one wrote a short story depicting a scenario where the president was found guilty every single one isn't that amazing they couldn't find one fiction writer\nTo write something where Trump was not guilty it's crazy one story had Trump's signing the twenty Fifth Amendment\nA and another even had him being assassinated by a Russian agent with the help of Secret Service\nYeah\nWe can write about the president being assassinated we're not advocating violence I don't know what ... what are you are you kidding me know that it was about the Russians that wasn't about a coup yes yes okay Secret Service was involved but that's not about a cool\nThis is the New York times\nYou know the ones who are leading the way saying oh my gosh the talk of violence is so horrible oh my gosh and we don't print fake news you're supposed to be investigators you're supposed to be\nNeutral I thought that was the idea let's be neutral\nNow I understand that everybody has an opinion but five for writers and no one can come up with anything other than the guy is guilty and maybe it's going to be killed\nBy the secret service this is unbelievable how\nIs it the two hundred

his fat face loud mouth guy what's his name do ah ah no no no uh Alex Jones sixty five percent\n[noise] whatever it is a you know and I and I talked to Bush about this on TV and extensively and he basically said factor that's my strategy I'm not changing it okay so that's number one\nSo Donald Trump could have done that easy but he chose to fight back trumped it and he said I'm not going to let these people marginalized me 'cause it'll never end and the American people uh see me as a fighter\nThey see me as a person who strikes back when attacked so while I'm going to do that\nSo then you have to say okay well who started the fracas who started this\nAnd you can make a case said Trump's bombastic a tax on his rivals in the uh in the primary process um started it you can make a case for that\nHow did he he just when people names yeah he's a symptom the American people have never been this way we've never been this way no no no was Tim ... feeling\nBeat and kit to death by being called racist and homophobia and everything else came later\nWhen it when it was apparent that Trump was a player and could win see what people don't understand is that in the beginning the press didn't think that Donald Trump could\nDo anything you want to have a chance he was he was like entertainment All right let's bring out the dancing bear\nThat out of the press on him but then when he started to win\nThe whole strategy changed and I keep saying that this comes from the corporate level and it does\nOkay so then it was destroy him destroy ... that that would be orders that came down from the editors of the New York times not in those words but it was very clear what they wanted to do Washington Post CNN MSNBC\nElemental Facebook I mean they're on their ... their on video saying that\nYes okay so there's no doubt that people listening to us know that so that it's All right if that's the destruction that has been ordered how does Trump\nCounter what does he do he doesn't have surrogates I mean there are no surrogates who can do it for him he has to do it\nSo he does it in a very ... and sometimes disturbing way for a president but my column said what is his choice\nWhat if he doesn't do it they are going to marginalize and destroy him he'll be the laughing stock and yeah you know liberal precincts he is already but he doesn't care about that but he has a growing I Believe growing number of people supporting him\nAnd the reason he has it been is because it gives them no quarter yes he fights\nBack but now they're turning it around saying well your\nYour fight back cabinet Kavanaugh fought back oh he's out of control oh that's not a if not fight back shows he doesn't have the temperament oh come on you're you're being destroyed by these people you're not allowed to show emotion\nIt's the same thing so now with the bomb thing oh Trump did it where where CNN and we're not responsible for any of it all in all ... us\nNow I'm hoping that the vast majority of the American people understand what's happening I think they do because CNN's ratings are so terrible no matter what they do no matter how they ratcheted up still very very few people watch them so I'm hoping they get it\nWell they're not going to um so so bill uh how much trouble or are they in I mean the New York times literally paragraph thirty five\nIn the New York times talks about how this doesn't look like these bombs were made by somebody who wanted to actually kill anybody this was just a statement of some sort of what happened to us\nFrom the job of course they're cartoon bombs they are the only thing it it\nDoesn't ... this is a the gang that couldn't shoot straight or gay or straight this is ... from Asia yes was a\nPress we're going to do this to get it into the press because we know the media will go hysterical\nCorrect and it could be somebody who was on the right and didn't want to kill anybody but wanted to make a statement and they are crazy\nCould be somebody on the left who wanted to do the same thing could be somebody who is just a really unbelievably worst bomb maker known to man which I highly doubt\nIt could very well be somebody who thought you know what we're going to send these to the press we're gonna send these to all of the all of the enemies of the right obviously sway an election\nObviously crowd contrived to get media attention to influence them in terms of putting my money on putting\nA button [laughter]\nHow to do and how does the uh media respond when it turns out that ah it's it's either a prank with no political motive or it was politically motivated or by the left\nWell that would be an amazing story when that was why I'm hoping the FBI can you know flushes out pretty quickly I'm ... how\nWould the press handle what I think that they would um look you have to understand it every morning out of the Washington DC think tanks progression fish tanks\nBass and stuff\nTo Anderson Cooper and and Rachel Maddow and these people they get stuff so that they'll they'll sit down and go okay now how are we going to spin this uh may be the person sending it was insane or you know that kinda thing they'll never say\nWell gee maybe
