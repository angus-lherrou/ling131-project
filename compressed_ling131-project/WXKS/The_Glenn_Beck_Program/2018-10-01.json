I think I'm actually\n\nI um [noise] I got something last night have you seen the copy by the way hello soup have you seen the a copy of um of a\nRachel ... memo yeah I'm reading a little bit about it okay pretty amazing this is really amazing now she remember Rachel Mitchell is the Maricopa County sex crimes prosecutor she is the one who interviewed um Kavanaugh's accuser a Christina Ford\nShe was the she was the woman that ah was made fun of on Saturday Night live this weekend\nShe well she was a highly respected advocate for sexual abuse victims she's twenty five years experience she's not political at all in fact she was recognized by Barack Obama is head of homeland security as the a sexual assault prosecutor of the year let me say that again\nThe woman that the Republicans selected\nTo dig in and find out whether or not Dr Ford's claims were legitimate or not was per rock Obama's head of homeland security sexual assault prosecutor of the year\nSo she's not a democratic hack and also not a defense attorney right she's a prosecutor yes she tries to prove these things true she goes in her expertise is on old crimes\nTo be able to go in and say All right how did this happen and be able to put it together to make sure that the prosecution can win All right\nBefore I continue and tell you what's in her memo let me just preface it with this\nWe're not going to see any uh CNN sock it to be leading with this New York times not going to have this on the front page but it should the reason why they won't is because it is devastating for Senate Democrats left wing activists the media this is absolutely devastating to you\nI Want you to know if you're easily triggered you might want to turn off the radio for just a minute here's what she wrote quote here's my bottom line\nA she said she said case is incredibly difficult to prove but this case is even weaker than that and quote\nSo I've been saying he said she said that that's pretty difficult she said the same thing that's not what she's saying this is an even he said she said case it's weaker than that\nDr Ford identified other witnesses to the event\nAnd those witnesses I'm Still quoting have either refuted her allegations or failed to cooperate them she then adds I Do not think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee\nI don't think a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case not to the court\nNot for prosecution [laughter] but before the committee nor do I believe that this evidence is sufficient to satisfy the preponderance of evidence standard and quote\nIt's pretty significant do you think and again like she's being portrayed as this Republican hacked to go after this uh this poor woman because she was a girl you mean ... yeah Brock Obama's ah the homeland security prosecutor sex crimes of the year they picked someone who should have incredible amount of credibility with the left\nYes so she's saying that it's it's it won't stand up in court wouldn't no prosecutor would even bring it and know prosecutors should even bring this to the committee this explains in my opinion why\nIt was leaked in the final hour because every one who saw this knew exactly what it was now she explains why\nShe says Ford has significantly changed her story several times in recent months in ways that are shady have not been explained and defy common sense\nOkay wait a minute it may look like she's credible are based on what she said not how she looked\nIf you're looking at what she said her story falls apart the most glaring issue with Dr Ford story is that she has given for different dates for when the attack occurred\nAnd we're not talking about the difference of a few days according to this this this is from her memo according to the Washington Post the twenty Thirteen notes from a therapy session lists the attacks have having occurred when she was in her late teens\nFast forward five years July sixth of this year in a text message to the Washington Post reporter Ford said the attack happened in the mid Nineteen eighties\nThis would be consistent with their therapists notes since Ford was born in late November sixty six and would have been in their late teens from Nineteen eighty four through Nineteen eighty six\nBut then something changed three weeks later in July thirtieth letter to Senator Dianne Feinstein is office the date of attack changed to the early eighties\n\nNow you might say what difference does it make well if you say you're in your late\nTeens sixteen Seventeen Eighteen Nineteen\nYear in high school so you're Seventeen or Eighteen late teens you've\nBeen saying mid eighties anytime you've ever talked about this before it became political mid eighties late teens\nWhy did it change and how did it change within the span of three weeks she changes the date by a couple of years it\nIt gets better this is the again I'm quoting I'm quoting the um the report\nIt gets better one week later when she goes to take a polygraph test with their lawyers she was asked to write down a statement describing the events in that statement Ford wrote the alleged hack attack happened in the early Nineteen eighties\nBut then something strange happens if you look at her written testimony for the lie detector test she scratches out the\nEarly Nineteen eighties and leaves it the Nineteen eighties perhaps because she knew early Nineteen eighties was false\nAnd it was fresh in her mind and might set off the polygraph\nThen finally by mid September on her first on the record interview with the Washington Post for narrowed the date of the attack down to the summer of Nineteen eighty two so let me recap Dr Ford provided for different dates over the span of a couple of weeks\nFor what was supposedly one of the most traumatic andme important ... events of her life\nWhy is this significant well\nOne and twenty three million the odds of having a child diagnosed known

parents would ground him I mean this guy was a complete door in high school and he's like the kind of guy who if he comes home with your daughter or your sister you'd say she really did well first off this is great I'm really happy so the thought that this guy was running a gang rape cartel\nIn the suburbs of Maryland is just asinine on its face but you're saying is that we have entered I think that we abandon a traditional forms of religion and now we're in the church of the social justice right where we just believe things based on a matter of faith based on historical\nPattern of injustices and notions and that's what's happening here late\nThat they want to believe that this guy did all these horrible things or because you know a women have had it rough for many years and there there there has been a lot of sexism in there it's still exists therefore he's guilty right it's a it's very similar to the rationale we saw in the OJ Simpson trial but almost in reverse\nThis is like reliving the O. J. case again where OJ apparently all the evidence planted that he was guilty but he put like half the country thought he was guilty because the LAPD is allegedly races\nRight so you know Shankar low I just did a monologue on this about a half hour ago that the that African Americans rightfully\nFelt that the justice system had gone against the black men for so long\nHere is a black man fighting for his life\nAnd they they wanted him to beat the system I don't think at the time they actually believe he was a was innocent more than they wanted a black man to beat the system\nYou go back and you look at the polls then to the polls now in the African American community they all know that he killed the un Nicole\nAnd they all know it so what they were doing was saying they were rebelling against the system that was geared against them and they wanted that social justice that's exactly what's happening here\nExactly yeah and it let me tell you I think a\nDoctor poured who testified she's a serious person cheated as qualified as a witness as as as someone could possibly walk on on the witness stand right\nBut when you actually start dissecting hurt or testimony ah I think as as you pointed out earlier it has tremendous flaws\nOr just a it's a series of inconsistencies that would make it physically impossible for Brett Kavanaugh had done this or at least at the very least severely limits the ... the window of opportunity right so\nThe fact that the entire apparatus of the of the Democratic party which I understand how it works I I I used to work and communications and political communication so\nI understand how talking points are circulated and how people get on T. V. shows\nUh the fact that everything has been mobilized to support look the evidence just isn't there right you don't crucify someone with zero evidence\nAnd then what they're doing now is that you're moving the goalposts right I I saw Laurence Tribe that this morning I like reading was this guy's a respected harbored a scholar write a law professor who is talking about a well you know he must have drank when he was in\nIn college or whatever who cares it's a completely irrelevant now I mean I I felt like reading at him hey Lawrence those goalpost seem kind of heavy let me know if you need help\nMoving them [laughter]\nSo John Carlin we're talking to John Carlos elbow he is a Democrat or who uh has not lost his footing ah with with reason\nUm so the address people address people who are let's say a twenty something female that says you know but if there's a chance that this guy did this\nUm you know I don't I don't want that guy on the Supreme Court\nYes and there's also a a a chance that he was db Cooper right there you have to go by the evidence and the case you have to evaluate a cases based on the ... you know the unique dynamics of that particular situation\nOther people that are just as qualified why don't we just go I mean this guy why don't we just go to somebody else\nOr because he because when he is he's a centrally being accused right now he's essentially on on a summary public execution trial of a um the worst crime in the United states of America in in our legal system shorter murder\nSo the question now is the economist is right and there's no evidence to ... to reach that conclusion in fact all of the evidence that has been presented is exculpatory right the if the guy's calendar clears him right the testimony of his friends clear up the absence of evidence also clear as him so you you have to\nCast that aside and then you want to oppose his nomination based on his judicial record that's absolutely fine that's a debate I'm willing to have with people but what we cannot do is become a banana republic where we just start convicting people you know air quotes on on near accusations that's not\nThe way there's is into court of law this is this is not a court of law you don't have to have that kind of evidence\nRight but ... you're you're you you are asked to write this would not meet ... any kind of legal standard but it doesn't even meet a standard of common sense because you have here is a series of of accusations that have been made\nWith zero Robert of evidence zero independent evidence to back this up and then when you actually analyze the ... little evidence doesn't exist which is a form of testimony of of the alleged victim\nHer testimony she contradicts herself in ways that are significant she changed the timeline when this happened to four times so I think people need to cast this aside or less the FBI find something new\nGlobal that guy that guy that that guy you know the friend a judge Mark Mark judge he sure seems like a bad guy why won't eat testify\nWell he is going to testify to the FBI but what we cannot do is play guilty by association ride mark judge\nI I've never met the man nobody nobody it Ninety nine percent of this country has never met this man right so we're just going off of here see right now and based off his own memoirs of somebody who was a very quotable person who had\nA serious drinking issues it's not bred cabinet but he we're we're not nominating mark judge for the Supreme Court it's Brett Kavanaugh as the one who's who's being nominated and if people want to take issue with the judicial philosophy that's fine but we can't do as destroy someone's life destroy his family\nThat's like two young daughters he coaches basketball for crying out loud right we we we cannot destroy somebody's life based on near allegations just because we disagree with them politically or ideologically\nThat's insane that's what they do in in in ... republic spending third world countries that's not who we are in the United states of America\nCarlos ... a Democrat when when we come back I I Want to ask you if you don't mind holding on for a second generally the I'm I'm I actually have to run the meeting about okay All right we'll ... we'll talk some other time mechanism on\nI really want to I really want to hear from people\nAnd uh they can respond to what I'm hearing from the Democrats now which is um um we just have to stop\nAll of these people the people all the people on the all the people on the right you know we need to break up their dinners you know

New York what do you do\nAre several things that have to we're going to be and to be clear about this when I when this thing I can win this thing with about thirty percent or so developed a five way race in New York state and\nThere are a plurality state not a majority says we don't require fifty one percent there's a runoff go\nWhoever has the most that's how New York state works so I could actually win this thing with thirty percent so it's it's actually one of the race so assuming that I win this thing I'm going to happen in ... percent but if it's in the vote for third party is a mandate that\nWill shock everything to be forward when this is the most important single\nIn the entire nation not as a whole other things that were more broadly as a whole but as one single election if I come in first\nIt changes the entire nation overnight to does not just the Libertarian Party but for any third party\nYou know is this the ... yeah this is this I think if people thought Donald Trump was get ground breaking a libertarian winning in New York uh would would would be an earthquake I mean would you change the political system overnight\nAbsolutely it is that important even coming in second\nWould shock people but first would literally changed a nation of it would give every third party a better chance it wouldn't make better Democrats embed Republicans because right now Republicans just have to talk about our potential Democrat\nThey don't have to worry about small business they don't have to about smaller government that will have to worry about lower taxes so unimportant is just I'll protect you from the evil left and all at the same thing in return they don't have to get my civil liberties is supposed to be but they don't they're supposed to go I'm gonna protect you from the evil right\nBut when there's a third party that were the libertarians can point the finger and say Democrats what happened what happened to civil liberties Republicans what happened a smaller government now they have to change they have to be better it will change how everything works so day one is I have to recover from the shock\n[laughter] man will be a massive a massive\nCulture shock within within the uh the state and within the nation but something else I don't have a career to protect I don't have people to pay back\nDon't have that so I can actually just do what I Want which is amazing\nI'm assuming that I Will be in court my entire four years this is my assumption and I'm fine with that but I have to focus on several things one a complete re board of education to a complete review of how we mandate every local county to pay\nFor things that the people don't want to pay for a thing called unfunded mandate that's how the Albany which is our capital of New York state and Washington DC control every local county and take the power away from the government and that that the credit culture of transparency because the problem with those governments now is they're enforcing the kings well\nSo they are not transparent they are constantly being bullied and I don't want the state government to be I'm the king and I and force my will I Want the state government to be I Will protect your rights of the individual against the local bully\nSounds like you've read the constitution\nOr what is that I don't know\nI Know I Know it's I'm not sure it's an old dusty on day to document\nTheir ego yes anyway I think we throw it away awhile ago yeah [noise]\nBut yes that's my point I Want to make sure that look if we focus on the individual more we will have better individual families met her individual businesses but individual people who are trying to you know do their jobs growth locally you know I Want the local communities to provide more value to each community\nWe don't do that well in New York state it all we have things called regional economic economic development ah corporations which all the neighbors are capital and decides where the money is spent\nAnd opened his eyes were taxpayer money spent within an individual county how 'bout instead the county's can start to budget to zero\nSo they can is that what they want how about we add new ideas of volunteerism how about the concept I'll\nGive it to an interesting concepts one\nInstead of me focusing on lowering taxes how 'bout I focused instead on raising money through ways other than taxation and through lowering spending here's one idea that does both of those we have a bridges right now in New York state\nAnd one of them is named the Mario Cuomo bridge we literally have an imperial Britain named after our well family that's embarrassing how 'bout instead that British named the staples bridge or the the rise in Britain the apple bridge and making a lease naming rights of the bridge we retain the asset I got no business gotten that giving my ass it up\nI'm going to lease naming rights no hybrid model that fails Everytime straight contractual that's all these companies that are paying billions of dollars right now every year a marketing they dropped twenty million dollars on a stadium name that she was on the weekends\nI got a bridge you can name and that bridge gets mentioned hundreds of times on every single day during rush hour and a sixteen person Mitt a sixteen million person metro area and hundreds of thousands of cars pass it every single day you will easily dropped the million dollars and that if not more\nOn a law that taxes hang on just like a Texas New York's ... Scott Texas you should listen to this guy this is a good idea [laughter]\nAbsolutely but here's the best part now we have them do maintenance again we own it so we still we\nStill inspect it so damages though our responsibility their job is just to repair it right\nThey begin to repair it what does that mean we're not spending money on the repairs lower spending not just that contracts don't come through Albany less corruption someone else's spending and spending it so guess what lassie fix bridges bridges right now when you if they collapse we don't have enough money these guys do what you have safe or bridges less money and guess what we can start with holes\nIn New York and New York city some bridges costs Fifteen dollars I Know I don't know if you're a truck driver I Know a truck driver you pay by the axle you're dropping Seventy five two hundred bucks to cross the bridge\nLess money less corruption safer better service boom we raised billions of dollars this is just one idea and there are many of them no one else talks about them this is what we have to work on a New York state\nWe can do that so where you are you ... it's amazing to me how we\nAre running\nHeadlong just willing to give up everything that we have already ... the freedoms that we have and embrace democratic socialism yes\nBut we won't embrace this very American idea how do you\nHow do you get the common sense Democrat and Republican who has been raised in New York so their mentality is me this would sell in Texas how do you get them in New York to see guys this this that it's already selling\nThe forward the Republicans in New York have given up I mean they don't show up or the Democrats I think I'm afraid so let's just vote Democrat the reality is again Seventy percent New Yorkers don't vote those who do vote vote because of fear we can't have fear but the reason why people vote it's simply the wrong answer\nMan but I Would say that in\nReality I'm try to change just to make it so that people stop voting for the lesser of two evils and instead vote for someone\nAnd it is working I Am actually using if you've noticed I'm using non traditional media traditionally it does not want to cover me and polls don't want to deal with me but not the media is working and I'm getting out there and people are seeing me they're responding to me and this is what's working the way to make this happen is through non traditional media and believe it or not\nPeople are getting it they actually like it I hear all the time people say\nLarry I don't agree with everything you're saying but you actually answer questions you actually have a plan and\nThey love it and that's what I say and look my plan may be faulty maybe they will we can't leave all the bridges maybe we can't raise fifty billion they were going to raise ... billion\nThat was still a when you know happy with that ... and let me ask you can I hold you over for one more break yes okay a old you over and and
