about the killing of journalists democracy ... inside the Saudi constantly in Istanbul, Turkey Saudi Arabia's foreign minister is defending the kingdom\nAnd I ended up killing one of these hey hey\nUh to publish open access journals that has apparently fairly low are very low um reviews standards and so it didn't prove what we wanted to prove or didn't even really offer good evidence for what we're looking at\nBut it was we learned evidently fun fun right hum that he misses\nDon't exist but they called all of our problems anyway\nRight out of that um but yeah so we\nLearned our lesson we we took the criticism that we got from that to heart ... uh it was fun but it didn't work people criticized us I think fairly pointed out where we were weak by using these journals and instead we committed to a few things going into this new project one is that we would not use\nPaid published journals in any sense a secondly and by the way they don't charge like a hundred dollar they charge like a couple of thousand ... ... it's really kind of a financial racket going on there it's the big problem and I hope people continue to address it a secondly we decided that that\nUm we would use the highest\nJournals within the disciplines that we're examining that we could get into so we would start at the best rental we could find for what we were doing and then work our way down if that one didn't take it would go to the next one and then thirdly we committed to being transparent about our results no matter what happened so if our if we had gone crash and burn\nComplete failure then um [noise] that would have would have been what we report it I don't think it would have gotten much attention but we would have come out and admitted that we were wrong\nBut it's it's not what happened um and uh early on in the process not just to keep us honest because I think we would have kept our promise\nBut early on in the process we ended up in contact with a documentary filmmaker who is interested in this stuff already but he's been recording us for a year names like ... ... and it's since he's been a recording us I mean clearly whatever happened is going to come out so there it is\nOK so before we take a break a and get into what you actually got published I'm telling you about the work behind it just took a year to do what kind of time or are you looking at\nWell easiest kind of look at what this is\nI had exactly five social outings between Thanksgiving and when uh the project was came out in the public eye took maybe that many days off including weekends I work probably eighty to Ninety hours a week almost every week um my two collaborators worked\nAlso very very hard I'm Peter put in at least a fulltime job Ellen did most of the same and talk to hell in the other day yeah uh so I this was an an immense amount of work\nRequired learning these feel very quickly writing academic papers a typical academic all published a couple a year maybe if they're working hard and we wrote twenty\nA holy cow yeah it's a lot of work there was an insane amount of work and these are all fields we have no expertise and know Helen has a little bit of background and some of that\nBut this was primarily having to learn this material on the fly with no education with no teachers instructing author only feedback was how our papers fared and the peer review process and then reading what was out there to try to emulate it\nAnd so what does what does having something published in one of the the magazines I mean what does it mean to the author and to the educational community\nSo for the author it is the absolute pinnacle of what an academic is trying to do in the research died of their career is to get papers published in well established journals\nAre for example hype Asia is one of the journals we got a paper and and I paid ... is a\nFeminist philosophy journal was probably the highest standing so it would carry a lot of weight\nLooking at the academic community that that scholars embedded in so they could take that to the university and say hey I got this many papers published if people are being considered her tenure there's a research component to that depends on how the the school wants to do their tenure in process\nBut typically seven papers spanning seven to ten years is considered the ... the basic research requirement to be qualified for tenure\nUm our paper spanned\nThe ones we wrote spend Fifteen sub disciplines of thought the ones that got accepted spanned seven and so we've got big journals we've got seven disciplines papers got into we probably would have had more how do we not been a short\nSo there's you know you I Know you had twelve in the pipeline that look like they would be published and then this came out and so you you hold those but you might have had as many as twelve\nI think honestly we had fourteen that weren't dead yet and I can say with some confidence I think

through non consensual masturbation uh then we get to some really disturbing ones um the progressive\nStack James tell us about the progressive stack\nYeah the progressive stacks of pretty horrifying piece of work and in fact it's evil ah fortunately it did not get accepted the journal was inviting us to re submitted and um give it another go\nThere's it's a it's a START I says it's a solid essay that with revision will make a strong contribution to the growing literature of addressing injustice in the classroom\nSo what did argues for is that we take students in college classrooms and we have them go through some kind of a\nInventory that determines how privileged they are it recommends a thing called step forward step back game as a possibility ones that are determined how privileged they are the students are ranked according to their privilege\nUm then the more privileged you are the worst you get treated in class so the most privileged white and male students are invited to listen and learn throughout the semester which means face\nAren't allowed to speak or ask questions in class they're invited to sit in the floor in chains to experience reparations and a level\nThe the knowing field to\nBe in a very privileged classroom learning environment and\nThe problem that the reviewers seemed to have with this set of suggestions was that we thought there's no way this will get in we have to temper it by saying we have to be compassionate to these students as we put them in the Florence teams\nAnd they said watch it with compassion that re centers the needs of the privileged over the oppressed and\nThere's this idea out there called the pedagogy of discomfort which means that you learn to overcome your privilege by being made uncomfortable and left to fit in that without being converted and so they actually wanted to make\nA terrible scary idea properly evil and that's the worst part is is it's only a small step from what I already exist in a great deal of be a feminist than race based education literature\nSo this was not really terrifying this was not accepted because it didn't it wasn't bad enough\n[noise] ah at first yeah and then later they were concerned with the death of a scholarship and and the kind of routine thing that you would expect out of a scholarly paper they claimed for example that we can grew on too many concept and it would be confusing for the reader and to try to narrow it down to something a bit tighter\nAnd so on but um but the idea that they're giving\nStudents experiential reparations and asking them not to be able to speak in class or do we spoken over\nInterrupted to teach them what that feels like none of that was questioned\nWhat if this were published and they were real if this were published ... what what

where to break out these will change completely uh you know individual scandals can change these things as well but the Republicans look like as of this moment there in really good shape\nTo control the Senate and a really bad shape to continue their control of the house\nOr is it going to mean I mean look at the ... dream policies that the left is looking to push in through the Democratic party free health care\nSingle payer sorry single payer healthcare free health care free college\nI'm a repeal the taxes they are looking for an even bigger a infrastructure package then what Donald Trump was even a asking for\nAnd you mentioned health care Medicare for all and twenty Thirteen Bernie Sanders proposed this and gotten zero cosponsors zero he was the only one who publicly supported now the you look at the top ten CNN has a list of the top ten or ... democratic candidates which by the way will not be enough to ...\nCovered the field there's gonna be a lot more than ... than I think uh but I mean everybody with the exception of Joe Biden who I Will not be surprised at all if he comes out and it does endorse Medicare for all all the big names are for it already there are many of them were cosponsors of the bill\nOr it seems to be this I mean the idea that we in two thousand ten and eleven were being called racists for suggesting what they wanted was single payer\nAnd now here they are ... the entire field is endorsing single payer health care I think credible\nYou know we were scare mongers in races for saying it yeah so I I just want to go through there's there's three stores will go through this tomorrow but it just flashed up to ... um Cortez was out of this weekend we have to eliminate the electoral college\nHey no that is a fundamental um a a a fundamental aspect\nOf what brought the states together in the first place\nThe state said we don't want the big states telling us what we can do and if the big states can a control everything well then ... what do we have it can't be that way so we had the electoral college\nWe are one stayed away from losing the electoral college anyway you lose Texas and you have New York California and Texas the rest of the country doesn't matter it will be those three states you lock those three states up and it doesn't matter anymore\nThat's pretty frightening pretty frightening\nSo now we're talking about taking apart the electoral college which would make all of the red states really pretty much in consequential\nYeah I mean it certainly would change the way the\nFounders thought about the idea of people being elected right I'm old enough to do is just just appeal to the big cities and by the way this this uh this is an idea that um and it's not just democratic support for getting rid of the electoral college I Know Trump sports at for example thrown um I I you know I'm not a big fan of the national popular vote or certainly not what our founders had in mind but\nUh there is a there's some contingency on both sides of the aisle that actually believe\nThis is the right way to go which I mean you that gets you just basically a country run by cities\nI mean as you know it'd be which have been launched that like as a Republican is certainly don't understand why you'd want it but ... again like it shouldn't be that way\n... says you should run themselves in the cities can run whatever they want and the rural areas can do what they want\nWhy do we all have to live under somebody else's thumb I don't want to live under a farmer's thumb no farmers should make the although I'd feel better with this than the other way around no farmers should be telling what somebody in the city has to do and how to live\nThey don't understand it taking any of my farmer friends to Manhattan their heads would explode within twenty five minutes\nThey would not want to live there they wouldn't understand it so why should we have the people in farms and farmland trying to dictate rules that are good for them that also have to be applied to the city it's ridiculous right and it's why\nThe house and Senate both exist to give a balance to that so that ... not not one side can tell the truth out\nRight and it you know no it's actually it's it's it's goes further than this if you would have if you could have raised the mistake of the uh of the progressive under Wilson where they changed the meaning of the Senate\nThey way they got elected yeah it it used to be that the house was the place where the people could move and move quickly so things could be passed\nBecause there was a disaster and things can be passed quickly then the next the the first check\nOn the balance of power the first check on that power was to go through another body that was a lot slower the Senate people are always like parents too slow it was designed to be that way so you go through another body that was much lower but it wasn't just that it was lower\nIt was also supposed to be men or women that were selected by their state legislature\nNow what would that do\nThat would make sure that those guys are beholden to their state not to the rest of the country not figures in national politics correct I shouldn't care what uh what's his face in New York it says shouldn't care when Hillary Clinton was Senator Barack Obama was center I shouldn't care about that\nBecause they would be focused on their state and they would be making sure that the federal government would not be eating into the power of their state\nThen it goes to the president and the president is only supposed to veto thing if he finds it unconstitutional now they'll say I think this is unconstitutional but I'll sign it\nWas way no that's the opposite this the opposite way you're supposed to veto it not if you don't like it if you find it unconstitutional it's unconstitutional then it would go to the Supreme Court\nWe've screwed up the balance of power so much and that's why you have this story today the United States Senate is a failed institution you also have this one from Fox the case for abolishing the Supreme Court\nAnd this story the constitution of the United states has failed [noise]\nAre you are you just arguing for king right with these the several stories in our own the ... give you the argument for it came\nRight I mean okay really they failed or have we not been using them properly\nYou know it's it's like it's like going out into the woods with a a Swiss army knife\nAnd saying I've been trying to I've been trying to cut down trees and split lumber and this Swiss army knife has failed or no you're not using it properly that's not what it was meant for\nAnd I would also argue the failure park right and you're talking about ... what is basically the biggest success story in global history the United states of America the fact that it has its problems is is well documented but the idea that you'd call it a failure is patently insane in\nSaying absolutely insane All right let's go through a couple of other things how about the Portland mayor\nWho the hell is Ted Wheeler and how did he ever become mayor of Portland but Portland but\nThat's how I I'm Sorry I'm Sorry I'm Sorry so you know the ... the Portland mayor ah refused to let the tops intervene when ... was just directing traffic\nFusing ... can anybody just get up and started directing traffic in Portland and they just didn't I just go on the street can you imagine what would have happened to us in New York City if you would have started directing traffic oh my gosh you might be disappeared [laughter]\nI mean especially if it was a union job would be you'd be in the bottom of the river [laughter] [noise] what ... what\nWhat laws do you even have in Portland now you can just go direct traffic you can break an old man's window he's drive and he's like no I'm not gonna you're young women they break his window and chased him down\nPolice nothing nothing\nNow I don't know if you saw the uh the mob in yes and I did use the word gosh\nI don't know if you saw the mob in Portland but they had a a\nA law and order march ... showed up for the law and order march because they of course in Portland now or the law suit browns shirt stuff\nStarted beating kicking\nBurning flags whatever\nThat's pretty scary and and the mayor ... released a statement at a press conference where he said I was appalled by what I saw in the video but I support the police's decision not to intervene how how how can you how can you support that decision I don't\nI mean I guess the the just the idea of look this is wrong but we don't want to make it any worse\nHe's trying to make it sound as if um the police this is his\nSingle for the mainstream our police can do no right they they act and they're just sucks they don't act and their do nothing's so they have no way to win\nIt's a great observation there are two political parties and whatever you do one of them might criticize you yes that you
