Monica ... uh and uh\nOthers in affords camp in front of the committee\nAnd he could bring back for it and say you lied to us about the lie detector test if\nThat happens for it could be prosecuted\nNow I don't think it will I think it should it should should to here's here's the anybody\nCabinet allied or for allied anybody they should be held to account\nYeah here's here's the thing I don't care if it is mark judge or if it is a professor Ford right you lied yeah you should go to jail right that this this is too serious this tour the country apart\nAnd it a little what if this was coordinated it ... and I mean Chuck Schumer is well if Chuck Schumer lead to this\nHe should also stand some sort of penalty but anybody who is involved you know there was one guy who or what was it sue he came out and he said oh I Know I have this evidence I saw this happening and as soon as he ... he's been drinking this morning bill you wouldn't believe\nThe IRA yeah [laughter] oh you have him arrested yeah I'd like to be drunk for all of your interviews if that's OK rights do then is it better state for you because you can't understand them sober\n[laughter] that's true that's fair so um ... there's there's one guy who came out and leveled accusations and then immediately retracted them and admitted that he was lying everyone likes to focus on four but there's been five accusers\nYeah yeah this is the Newport Harbor guy yes but when you get when you get into a situation um and and this goes right back to the need to think here we're talking about did you see a list so mulatto yes this week say\nIt doesn't matter if individual men get crushed\nIt doesn't matter because women have been abused for so many years and I have no sympathy for men innocent men who get crushed I mean once you're into that zone and we've discussed this before your interest Allen is\nYou are no we don't care yeah\nYou know if some guy didn't do something like ... whoever it may be and and and you get it and your career and\nFamily and everything else was destroyed you know that's the price you got to pay because of the past injustices a against women\nBut that is the now that is the ... bill that's the combination of post modernism and social justice\nSocial justice now is the vehicle for post modernism and the idea is it doesn't matter if she was telling the truth because others have been in her situation ... doesn't matter if he did it because others have been in his situation is what matters is\nIs communal justice\nThan it is that other people are talking\nAbout in the media will never report on\nIs it the same people that organized a sponsor boycott against me when I was on Fox News are now paying people to go to the capital to scream and yell at senators\nAbout cabinet that same outfits are doing it move on leaves the league\nAlright they've got the mailing list they've got all the information\nI mean I'm sitting there going\nDeja vu yeah same people\nSo now in addition to insanity like Alissa mulatto individual insanity then you have an organized coordinated effort with tens of millions of dollars courtesy of George Soros and others okay we're organizing\nSending people paying people to go in and disrupt sometimes physically\nThe process and Americans are basically in a dark they don't know what's happening back because there's a

give me my eyes bleed today I couldn't take the hypocrisy a button\nOne of the things that we're talking about is you know I'm really concerned because things in the capital are becoming very scary they're very scary for reporters and for you know for these senators and and things are getting out of control the do you do\nThe idea for this show is that we're regular ... people who maybe like you

see me having them on his knees came I'm not in love with the number two in the states and my eyes or do you is your number one come back into Frankie Valli this person [noise] listening to\nHer radio for more from Nineteen Seventy five ... coming up\nStuff people are talking\nAbout every establishment Whitey out or government wants to sell them for conservative\nTalk twelve hundred [noise]\nGlenn how bam [noise]\nFor them to the program we're glad to hear a bad grade from pat gray unleashed which is a tearing up or the podcast world and literally target up tearing it I Would say ... numbers I've seen them they're huge yeah they are in that show it really is it really is into who could be more surprised than all of us but\nThen you get it you know who's also doing really well\nA fat so fast so yeah without till June while I'm fat the podcast you know the fat with Jeff Fisher is\nLike I Know would be like jeopardy people love Jaffe and they did to us because we hate him we\nLike ... him I Know I had to write a chance I had to write a memo to all of the you know producers and everybody involved in team fat and uh and I was like I'm nobody can be more surprises me\nMhm yeah but really bad guy but yeah it's a you know it out in the ... really impressive\nAll right so a pack ray from ... at least welcome to the program glad you're here I'm Glad to be here to argue that yeah yeah I I'm a I'm a it's a forty or fifty one forty nine Kavanaugh so they will vote tomorrow however there is one vote for the Republican side that is going away\nAnd I'd love to get first your gut reaction men then let's talk about it okay because my gut reaction was clear\nAnd then thinking about it I'm like well now wait a minute you're a Republican senator you are a you're going to vote for Kavanaugh is this close\nYet your daughter is getting married on Saturday ... view cannot cast your vote in any other way you have to be there your across the country so it's one or the other\nMy gut was see America I'm with my daughter yeah right yes okay now\nLet's think about this ... you are because this is a senator Danes yeah from Montana okay so senator name from Montana he's been elected by his people to represent them\nEither this is one of the most important in game changing votes a of maybe his lifetime or it will if if the Republican if the Republicans lose this it will set the standard of how everything else goes from here it will teach the left\nYou can do this to anybody ...\nHow do you just because my still would say I I go to my daughter's wedding but I don't know how I could reconcile that\nOh well it depends on\nDo they still won the vote without his they may not or if they're at fifty fifty I say go to your daughter's wedding yeah if it's less let let's play the game though yeah forty nine forty nine essentially you'd have to probably ... ...\nWell no well yeah I mean it but again let's say mansions which is right now he's a Democrat one Democrat voted for the Republican so let's say ... signifies today or that he can go and and vote for the Republican but let's say he he changes that tomorrow\nSo it's in Ted is forty nine forty ... it's not it's not a sure thing you need Danes I've got to say like\nMy it's it's hard with your gun was title with my daughter but in ... and the end you you really think that I kind of had the other opposite thought which was\nMy initial thought was this is really important I think if my actual daughter not like a you know now own daughter but like my daughter ... she's getting married screwed this country I Am they're like that's like the most important thing in my life I did sign up for that job but I did not sign up to a band in my family\nNo you didn't but your family can that can be moved for instance if the vote is it you know two o'clock\nA that is still what a Montana time noon or eleven o'clock you could say hey move that I'm going to vote at two o'clock eastern time that's eleven o'clock if the the ceremony was so close to start at noon started it's sick started at three and I'll be there\nAt the ... vote right like move the vote and then go there oh they're planning on doing by the way if they need Danes are going to delay the holy until he comes back oh jeez delayed the vote well only if they need them right now that doesn't look like they need him we should be clear about that um it looks like it would be fifty to forty nine easy\nThing to do you could just ... it doesn't have to be tomorrow to no no they can relate to it on day yeah or easily yeah or Monday but\nThere's a risk of like you know some new accusation during the day that the crazy thing that happens you know what the Democrats will try right yeah a ... there is a risk there there is a risk there [noise] but I mean I Am I missing my daughter's wedding\nYeah I don't I Can't see myself missing my daughters had\nEither yeah a kid I mean that's your first responsibility or your family you know so if we're the say oddly values party right like if that's what we really are you know you'd have to get would understand that and", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Newton", "day":
