can't just be in movies and I I thought to myself I'm not sure that matters really doesn't matter anymore\nJob is smashed that but it's certainly a plus for Michelle Obama because she doesn't have any little attachments and and so that you know that's not going to be a diversion so you might be right there I mean I I don't know that well I met her a few times um I Know she was very powerful in the White House\n... extremely powerful and that was kept very quiet and and I think you're right\nYou might you know this is in her time the next time around and you don't want to go up against Trump a certainly doesn't want to do that but it took twenty four absolutely she could uh if she wanted it I think the Democratic party would rally around her\nYeah All right when we come back I Want to talk

and I think that uh various ah people have to say you know let's get a little group together and ah maybe we'd go out and and stand in the park with some signs saying whatever\nOr maybe we write a letter to the editor of our local newspaper\nA with five hundred signatures are attached to it\nSo the Oregonian for example or a very left wing newspaper you know you say okay we'd like to have um some space for not bad we have a community group and this is the way we feel about it there are things you can do to be visible in your local community it doesn't have to be a big national thing 'cause that's almost ... possible\nBut I'm trying to get people to understand the evil it's growing in America which is you know what killing the ashes really essentially about and and a lot of people still want to look away at it they they don't want to engage\nAnd um if we continue down the road\nWith the press being as you just pointed out solidly aligned with the most progressive\nThe most at our elements in our society the pressure sympathizes with all of that they sympathize with open borders they sympathize with legalized narcotics\nThey sympathize with not prosecuting violent crimes and there's the press and mass is is is an agency now that advances socialism and progressive causes cells\nThat's a big difference we didn't have that what was left wing press but we didn't have an activist left wing press and that's why we have now\nLet me let me ask you this um uh I beg to differ with you on the on the activists press if you look at you know I'm the Nineteen sixties those some of them we don't have it we did we've never had it like this but we we have had it in the in the past\nIf if somebody stood up let's say a a you know some group we're standing in the community uh stood up and they did a non violent you know protest a non violent march ... for justice and non violence or whatever I\nUm and they followed the king um the rules where you just never swing back\nA

trying to go you saw it on sixty minutes you solidly still try to do with\nTrump into basically dismissing Saudi Arabia alright well ... they want to not trade with them they want to crush that nation because of the nation is quote unquote bad okay I'm not going to stick up for Saudi Arabia is bad\nBut Saudi Arabia is the bulwark against Iran and the middle east it's the leader of Jordan and Egypt in that movement to blunt it runs terrorism and\nDestruction of Israel Saudi Arabia is leading the charge so why on earth is the American left wanna destroy that nation\nWhen in history we outlawed ourself with style and it was killing millions of people while we were allied with him because we had to defeat Hitler\nAll right and you can just give a thousand other examples of countries that we had to do business with that were bad countries for the greater good\nBut the left wing press now says the Trump you're an idiot because you are not destroying Saudi Arabia you should destroy that and

of state Pompeo has left turkey where he held talks a day after meeting with the Saudi king and crown prince who promised a thorough investigation into what happened at the Saturday counseled on east anvil Fox assignment on monitoring the latest fly from London\nBecause as the news was tightening around the neck of ISIS\nYou know supplies and food and water we're becoming more and more scarce and so ISIS was stealing all that from the civilians and so ... living behind the ISIS wall um in Mosul was absolutely health of these people so they tried to break free and run away and so\nWhen these people ran away as as a large group ISIS massacre I think that day there was more than a hundred and fifty people just slaughtered in the street because they went right by ISIS hounded ... to ... the ISIS people\nI've heard that they've kind of gone back in they've they've just kind of morphed back into a lot of societies that true\n[noise] we we did it come across a lot of guys trying to blend in with society and and kind of get out of there um and that has happened so ISIS is definitely having a bit of a resurgence in in Iraq right now\nSo they went underground you know and it it it was neighbors and just people who who all live together right so these guys blend in there from the city of Mosul ISIS that's where these guys are from\nAnd so they were able to blend back into society a lot of them and so now we're seeing a bit of a resurgence however the guys that we were seeing toward the end of the fight in Mosul a lot of these guys were actually white European guys a lot of a lot of Chechens and things like that ... and the reason for that is good they they have no\nChoice but to fight and die they can't assimilate back into society they can't run away because it you know they looked like me they're white guys read ... and they can't they can't get away so those guys had to fight it out all the way to the end and they know they're going to die and they they just didn't care and so yeah\nSo you went from that um to uh say and I I've got to do\nI've got to keep doing this ... um and that brought you to\nBurma mhm right yes and now you're working with an as Rene fun yes in Burma yes in last we talk you were the only one in Burma and you started telling us about what was really happening ... and you have an update for us\nYes absolutely so ah also to clarify I'm not the only one working in Vermont I'm the only one from than as rain fund for getting out of the road you were telling me that you were trying to organize a mattress people yes and you were going to bring them all together slowly and I just got I just got back from a trip about a week and a half ago\nAnd met with a lot of the tribal leaders and the um the guys who run a stuff across the border and\nThey they are more than they they are beyond ecstatic to have the ... okay now this is a group of Christians yes about fifty percent Christian about fifty percent a Buddhist looking out all the leaders of the it's called the ... tribe\n'em and they are all of their leaders about Ninety percent of their leaders are Christian so every time every time I meet with them they we pray at the beginning and at the end and it's it's it's a really really good thing\nUm [noise] and so I met with these guys and I explained to them like what we can do and I had already been working in there I don't don't several trips with the ... fund in there and they are beyond ... ecstatic to how this because\nWhen I was there literally while I was there the Burma Army just moved in three hundred and fifty more troops to attack their positions to attack the civilians and current state so we just saw what happened last year with the ...\nAnd then the the Burma Army moved all those same troops up to the north to attack the kitchen but in another ethnic group and so now they're starting to bring troops down to attack the current and that's where we're there on the ground helping keep people alive so\nWhy why are they doing this why are they doing this to these\nTribes [noise] it's it's it's a it's an ethnic thing it's a racist thing is is essentially what is it goes back a thousand years of the ethnic Berman to control the Irrawaddy valley sort of in the center of Burma\nWant to control all the high lines they want to control the entire region and so if you're a different ethnicity\nYou can ... they'll let you live there but you have to be sort of a subject or serve class you have to basically serve departments and also the for example like the ... they live in these they live in the hills and the current hills are full of natural resources so there's a lot of that going on plus\nThey don't like you 'cause you're Christian right that adds that just add a whole whole nother level of hatred um because you know\nChristians don't put up with being with being oppressed they don't put up with it because we're the spirit lord as there's liberty right and these and so because of that the Burma Army attacked them even more tell me what you wrote me\nSo I brought se I brought with me several photos as I got to have somebody I'm over his mercy just pass their apologize I think we're getting so I brought with me [noise] several photos\nOf\nOf what I see all the time when I go to these places\nAnd these are ... I bought I brought with me photos [noise] sorry\nOf of one particular um attack that happened\nUm this is actually only from this is from two thousand ten writes it seems like a long time ago but this is these are the only photos that they were able to get out to me I was asking you had any photos of what's happening and what's going on and in these photos you see dead civilians you see\nKids dead a baby and these are not accidental collateral damage is or intentional executions of these people\nThese are some of these are it's that's a that's a baby\nThat's a baby intentionally and killed and the baby didn't die right away\nI Survived for about twenty four hours and then died and this just looks like it's in the woods yeah they're out in the jungle these people have nothing and the army still wants to attack them and take more from them and so every time I go there every time the ... shows up\nWe're stopping that from happening and I'll tell you I'll tell you a quick story back in back in may I was there and I can't I Can't divulge exactly what we were exactly the artist for security operations exactly what was happening\nSuffice it to say we save a lot of people's lives and a villager who had been pushed out of his home by the army him in his family have fled the army and they and they had built they built a a a new hot out in the ... out in the jungle in the middle of nowhere um\nHe he heard that the ... was there and he came and found me and said hey I Want to I Want to I Want to thank you please come to my house for dinner tonight so they gave me on a motorcycle and I drive at this man's house in the middle of nowhere\nWhen I get in there his wife is cooking pigs that for me to eat because that's the big fat and rice and ... and ... and so we're sitting there and he's like hey I I when I was like I Wish I had more to give you a he's like this is all I have for a snack and he pulls out a bag and it's literally tree bark\nIt's bark from a tree and he's like this is all we have a snack on while my wife prepares food and he gave me\nTree bark to eat and I'm sitting there chewing on tree bark with this guy and he has nothing is literally nothing and she wanted to give me ...\nBecause that was the best that he had and so I'm sitting there chewing on tree bark with this man and\nI I was I was so overcome was just like in his gratitude\nIs the level of gratitude he showed for us for that for the ... being there it was it was unbelievable it was so touching and then later on as I was leaving as I was leaving the jungle\nAnother man barely speak any English\nUm he's um I'm On a motorcycle and he is driving me out of the jungle and he ... he as he's driving he turns me he says thank you and I said oh like oh good English or what I'm trying to pick them and talk more about um\nUm I'm about what what use more English and so I was like oh like what what do you what are you grateful for what you know yeah and he's like is that this is amazing he said thank you for giving my people hope [laughter]\nThat's what he says to me this kid who's maybe Nineteen years old they know nothing but slaughter an aspirin these in these terrible things but\nWe're there to bring help and we're there to bring help and it's it's an honor to be there it's an honor to represent the ... it's an honor to do what I Do every time we go out we save people's lives and it's it's it's an incredible thing that we keep things like like those photos that you're looking at you can't even show them\nWe keep the you know what I'm saying is happening born on\n\nIt doesn't become a real to people until they see it and then you don't want to show it because it's\nIt's awful it's awful it's horrifying mhm um\n\nI don't know what to do with them ah I think I think I'm not sure but I think we have them on than as a marine fund dot org if people want to go over there and see first hand like what's happening I Believe they were up there if they're not and make sure that they get on there today there were over\nThere yeah don't go for um you know if you if you ...
