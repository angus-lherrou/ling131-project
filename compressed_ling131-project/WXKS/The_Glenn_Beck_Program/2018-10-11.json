really good for Republicans in the Senate or it looked really ...\nBut if we don't there hasn't been enough of it to necessarily know that the two two are tied but it does seem like\nI'm a real positive things have happened in ... red states where Republicans were a little bit on the ropes at one point um for example give you a Ted Cruz Ted Cruz going up against Robert Francis O'Rourke he's an Irishman\nYou mean oh yeah oh yeah they go oh Ashville most Irish people are called better so you point that out but Robert Francis O'Rourke is running against Ted Cruz some of the polls there's one poll that had him tied at one point um ah ah several polls showed cruise only up by one or two\nNew York times doing something really really interesting in which\nYou know normally you kind of see ... well I didn't do that or they're doing something interesting in that like normally see polls and you see it like if you think of it as a as a sporting event like the football game happens and then you score after right like you're not seeing the play by play the game with a poll you're only seeing the results that in\nNew York times is trying something this cycle that's different which is there actually showing you as they make the calls\nWho's voting for who when you see the poll build slowly as you watch it it's addicting to watch uh and uh\nIt's kind of interesting because one of the things you'll notice is how many calls they have to make to get anybody to agree I at one point yesterday um the Texas Senate poll they had made Seventeen thousand seven hundred phone calls\nAnd had two hundred and eighty five people who like that's how hard it is for them to get people on the phone anymore to take these pools which is\nIt's part of that and why it's hard to read you know 'cause I mean who's going to answer yeah who's going to do that but Cruz in that\nPoll wound up up a nine point in that one he seems to be honest when their eyes open up a lead there again and I'm not

I mean uh you know pick up and what Trump is saying and I think there is some truth\nTo the fed and and uh John John Powell why you take in a punch bowl away from this party just when it's getting boring and I tend to I tend to think that he's right about that you know look\nYou don't want inflation but just because the economy is picking up doesn't mean you're going to have more inflation I don't think that the Fed's job is to the squash shows a stock market rally and pick up and unemployment is we've seen in record numbers\nYeah I Would I Would tell you Steve and you know I'm an inflation watcher and the and hyperinflation renew believe we should watch your guy I was I was really concerned with all the repatriated money that was coming in and the tax break and we haven't seen it\nWe show me the inflation I mean look I Would I ... I have to admit you know I I admit when I'm wrong I'm a I'm a conservative and that's when I'm wrong I'm not wrong all that often but\nI Do predict we see higher inflation as a result of you know all the money creation by the fat and the truth is we haven't seen it up by the way one of the reasons for that as we are international trade we have um\nYou know we have like all sorts of technological change that makes goods and services cheaper overtime and\nTrade and technology are two things that really keep prices down and affordable and so I my only point is I just think the fed acted preemptively prematurely and raising rates\nIn in a in a way that wasn't necessary I Am a little concerned by the way to go on about the increase in the price of oil it's gone up to eighty dollars a barrel that's that's like a quibbling a four dollar a gallon\nGas by why that's why is it going up like a tax on the economy why is it going to\n\nBe there soon soon are you there yeah maybe I didn't hear what you\nJust said okay why I'm a why did why is oil going up\nTo a good question too I it looks like because there's been disruptions in the um [noise] in the middle east with respect Iraq and so you're seeing a big um you know a big sell off as a result I mean a big rise and the price because people are really concerned about the um\nYou know about the price of the global reduction in supply as a result\nOf our ... bring Texans Becca bring Texas back on line\nWell that's the point you know I look I think\nOil prices are going to fall I just was out in Midland, Texas in the middle of the Permian Basin I've never seen anything like it when I mean everywhere you go all they're doing is drilling drilling drilling drilling and you know it's it's a anywhere you can stick a stick in the ground there drilling for oil and natural gas so I don't think I don't think we're going to see a continuation you know over the next\nYear or so of these higher prices in fact I think they're going to go back down again so [laughter] you know I think that the\nThe big problem right now is just fear you know this the stock market is driven by fear and greed\n[laughter] that's a true except for a hundred and fifty years and people are afraid right now that uh and then by the way there was a lot of profit taking I did this myself when the Dow hit twenty six thousand five hundred I said to my wife funny let's let's take some of these profits and and get out of the market and I think a lot of people that that\nSteven let me [noise] um let me ask you this I don't know if this is true or this is an old wives' tale but the last\nPresident that I heard really take on the bed [laughter] was Ronald Reagan and we had Nineteen percent interest rates shortly after that until you stop talking about the fed when her\nAnd the fed has a lot of control I mean and and you know a lot of people say it's it's it's a\nA you know somehow some kind of a violation for the president the question the fed and I wrote a column on this last week I don't know why the president as his chief executive officer of the country right he's the one who was supposed to help manage our economy if he doesn't think the fed is doing the right thing why shouldn't they speak out\nI'm not look I don't want to see of politicization of the fat correct but I I think there's a lot of ... one of the lessons we've learned ... new and I've talked about this over the years\nThat these are not some kind of or a falls on high at the fed they act as if there was a temple with all of the knowledge and all of the intelligence but they've made so many mistakes so you're in management I remember the seventies as you do when we had literally twenty percent mortgage interest rates\nThat was all because of fed mistake and ah you know I Would make the same case that the fact that you know was the one that built up this bubble that led\nTo the housing crisis in two thousand seven and they all yeah I keep thinking\nThese people are somehow like jobs like\nI don't know [laughter] I don't know let me ask you about the uh the NAFTA replacement\nUh and and also the the trade war that we have going on with with China\nI I fear that Donald Trump really likes the trade wars are and we're not that this isn't a negotiation tactic if it is you know great but do you think isn't even [noise] that's what he really fundamentally believes that the Arabs are good\nHere's my view I talked to Donald Trump many times about this you know and he said that set the rose garden I was at his Rose Garden ceremony last week when he announced the new trade agreement and he basically said look I Will um I Will I'm I'm using these tariffs as a\nTool as a negotiating tactic get better trade agreements now I'm a free trade guy I think you are to go on so I I used to tell Donald Trump I don't agree with you I never trade strategy but I gotta say so far you know the\nThe kind of apocalyptic view has not happened Trump is getting some good deals he got to deal with Mexico he played candidate like a federal here or he basically said you know we're just going to go ahead without you with Mexico and Canada the eleventh hour ... literally eleven o'clock on\nThe night before the the deal has to be seal candidate came and said okay we agree to the deal is going to get a good deal I think with Europe\nAnd then that leads to Canada I mean to China and\nThis is where I think Trump is going to take a very hardline\nAh and I happen to agree with I don't know how you and I haven't talked about this one but I Am a hardliner when it comes to China I'm a free trade guy but China we don't have free trade with China China's cheating\nStealing their you know three hundred billion dollars if you're an actual property they're building up their military they're like you know the old Soviet Union in terms of a lot of the tactics they're using that's all I Do think Trump should get tough with China what what do you think\nAh I think so too I just want to make sure that we understand the a symbiotic relationship of mutually assured economic destruction or when it comes to China then I'll let\nMe challenge you on that one or a you know I'm going to you of course a trade war would hurt us but I think the way Trump looks at it and I think he's right about this like if we can't trade with China we'd sneak if they can't trade with us they catch pneumonia\nAnd I think there's a lot of truth to that I mean they can't their ... their economy depends on access to America's Fifteen trillion dollar consumer markets\nMean damn near everything you buy and Walmart is made in a is made in China and so Trump is playing that card and saying look we're not gonna give you an unfettered access to our markets if you're not going\nTo play by the rules I talked to company CEOs all the time is blind who basically say it's almost impossible to penetrate the China market you got to give up ownership of your company you have to give up your trade secrets ... I mean we can't live with that in his right eye when he says look I didn't start this trade deal this trade war they started at ten years ago\nI Would feel better if we also weren't big they also weren't or bank at the same time I would feel better about it\nHey Stephen quickly one quick question for you and you probably have a real insight on the ah the we were kind of talked about the steel tariffs and these things going on of allies\nAre ... like Canada and as a way of negotiating to bring these contracts at the table for what was kind of like a ... a NAFTA to point out type of situation well that happened but the steel parents are still on Canada do you have any idea why or is this going to change in any point\nWell this is one of the issues that I find my you know as you know I'm a big fan of Donald Trump I helped write the tax plan with my buddy Larry Kudlow so but I I just disagree with this policy I don't see the wisdom and steal an auto and aluminum terrorists or auto terrorists but especially not steel and aluminum\nBecause you know we have something like a hundred thousand Americans who are employed and steal an auto but we've got six million other manufacturers who use steel and aluminum and what they produce I was all over it and how is your Bush a couple of weeks ago they you know when they make a you know Budweiser is they're using a lot of aluminum for those cans\nAnd they showed their prices are going up and the judge that's going on around the country our auto producers are autos are more expensive because the steel tariffs so my point to Trump is this isn't even creating factory jobs were going to lose factory jobs as a result of this so I disagree very strongly with the steel and aluminum tariffs I think they do more harm than good does\n\nFox News I'm Chris posture there is widespread devastation and the Florida Panhandle home after home blown apart in Mexico beach where hurricane Michael made landfall yesterday the
