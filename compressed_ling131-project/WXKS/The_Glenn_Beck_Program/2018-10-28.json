{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WXKS", "content": "Can get to the podcast for both yesterday show a in today's show\nAnd ah you just go to Gary ... click podcast it'll take you right to the eye heart platform and uh you'll have plenty of information right they're All right let's get back to the phones here and we have Steve Steve welcome\nHi Gary and I got a little toilet information that may help All right well first of all I replaced my uh toilets with American standard for the longest a ... and uh what I didn't hear you mention you probably know the budget hole itself\nYes ah my problem with my whole thing kind of Fox is I'm I'm On a well I'm In the country and the county area and that's pretty high metal deposit some water\nAnd so uh well I found that helped me I had the same ... the the gentleman was mentioning some flushing okay just how luggage so I have good water flowing that all the above the ... right now the roof and everything and it was a so I took a coat hanger and\nAnd straighten that occur that also get get to go as far back in the general mhm as possible will be a lot about and then also that didn't help completely but I took a\nLot of third to half a gallon bigger underscored and before I let it sit overnight like you were saying with the\n... yeah\nAnd that the break up a lot of stuff I have put more vinegar and chance to change a big improvement in the flow\nOf whom so we're kind of on the right track we were talking about you know the hard water deposits\nI never got the mentioned the really the jet old\nWas certainly thinking about it in fact even on older Portland says they begin to a cow supply up uh one of the upside abused us Steve is to take because you've got to have a strong enough gush of water from that a tank to the bowl and I've talked about taking a compact mere\nAnd maybe a twist drill bit and you can you can really see where the clubs aren't just with your thumb for finger just run the twist drill bit in those holes and you will open up a lot of those holes in the problem goes away\nAnd I haven't decided how it's going to stay in those out yet I'm Still getting from those but I can get better [laughter] yeah\nYeah it might be able to increase the bit hey thanks for tips appreciate it\n... thank you bet by by their very good and the artists welcome\n... hello yes\nHi thank you bet and what ... is I Need to I Want to help my daughter with a dry wall\nHair in the bathroom and [noise]\nIt we're quite a paper holder is attached to the wall there are two ... one of the impact the other one is completely off the wall and there's dry wall hole there and it's probably about an inch and a half a wider point guard height and maybe\nBeing born but I don't know I even hire\nAn eye candy how on and on about Dr wallich here that I'm Wondering how they're going to work with Hank ... hats that racket there there's nothing behind the drywall I mean it's just open space\nAnd how big is so we have two holes that are that the brackets that whole the wallpaper or the toilet paper a holder onto the wool or\nMaybe like a inch and a half long and maybe an inch high was is that close in their eyes screws on\nGlee probably an inch and a half or so tall and not very wide ... about an inch wide of ...\nAnd then there's two screws that goes through that into the uh\nI Believe that close\nLike at the bracket but I'm Wondering if that three haired and I don't know just tear a [noise] um [noise] it's something you could be done other than just the patching material put on there and you're\nProbably going to any more than that you're probably going to need a little bit more that let me ask you a question the whole where that bracket that whole bracket the one bracket is no longer attached to the dry wall so there's a whole they're correct\nRight and how big is that whole well it's probably\nNot more than an inch an inch and a half\nAt the highest height way into it and it's about it's very good it's not all the same I read it about three inches wide or so\nOkay so that's going to be a challenge to patch it and then to come back in a put a bracket on it so that the credo so there's a couple of things we could do I'm One of those\nThings you might do is good and ... and ... and play is something that may be is just imagine a block of wood that would cover that both of those brackets okay\nAnd they sell those decorative once okay oh and we would\nTake that other bracket out right and we would basically install\nThis ... this backer piece okay so\nThat would be then that would be visible that would go on on on the surface it would be decorative you can go up to the hardware store and you'll see in the there was\nSome memories sustain you could paint 'em and it's just a an ornate a backers backer piece that goes over both polls that would get screwed and then you could screw the toilet brackets on to that piece of wood and re installed your toilet older your toilet\nPaper oh okay I'll take a look at that\nThere's also plates that you can you know install over the whole uh but that's\nGoing to be a little bit challenging to than mount something on there I really take a look at some of your options on an excavation\nBehind a toilet paper over their walk through the ... by all the different folders I think you'll find something better work dicey forty

translate to not have a place anywhere I'm Pam who sales Fox News the words of Pittsburgh Mayor Bill to do though as his city mourns the loss of eleven people who were shot and killed while worshipping at a Senate cod\nFifty nine percent said they were really interested only forty eight percent of Democrats said that\nUm and what's interesting is leading up to I Would say Brett Kavanaugh you had the same type of thing playing out again in\nTime in favor of the Democrats started to look a lot like two thousand six so up until ... you had sixty three percent of Democrats\nHighest levels of interest in the election Republicans was only fifty three percent so that is a you know a big it's the type of gap that leads you to lose the money and lose the house or at least makes it possible since capital that has changed\nDemocrats have gone up from sixty three to Seventy two percent holy cow Seventy two is the highest number for any party and all of these elections however Republicans have\nIt's a higher percentage point basis from fifty three to sixty eight\nSo now we have a basically a balance a very close within the margin of error separation and both of those numbers sixty eight\nWould be the second highest level of interest of all of these elections so the Democrats are Seventy two Republicans are sixty eight both of those numbers are the highest of any of these elections going back to two thousand six ... two dozen six midterms\nUm and I mean which is which is crazy it is a a a ... there's a level here that we don't know what's gonna happen if we this is like you know this is territory that has not been seen before and\n... you know while you can look at the polls and you can see the polls as we've talked about over the past couple of weeks relatively\nNow for a relatively pointing towards a Republican or a ... victory in the Senate where they maybe pick up a couple of seats and Republican loss in the house where they would lose a couple of states um there is a you know if you wanna look at the kind of be optimistic way of looking at the house right now\nTo show you how close is if Republicans were just sweep the races they are favored in okay that's not it's not going to happen it never happens but just kind of generally for understanding if they were able to sweep all of the races their favorite and\nUh and they revealed a when all of the races that they trailed by one point\nSo all of these races are either victories are toss ups right I mean they could go either way but if they were to sweep all of those Republicans still hold the house at two twenty two Fifteen now the problem is the idea that they're going to sweep all those races is we know that's not going to happen it never happens the other thing is they will\nWin some races where they're underdogs by more than one point they will win some place where there was a down by five in the polls don't want him winning some of those races\nSo the split is going to be important here but just that gets them only to two twenty two Fifteen which is a I think they lose that have been losing ten seats from where they are now\nUm but also a very narrow majority to the point where some conservative things could be derailed by just you know your generic moderate house member that you've never heard their name before um when they decide they're going to vote against the president\nSo it's an interesting a way of looking at it\nAnd it shows that this really could go either way I mean when they say that there's about a twenty percent chance of Republicans lose the Senate and about a twenty percent chance that the Republicans when the house\nThat's the way they these models are all kind of looking at it twenty percent is one in five right um so it is very possible that one of these things could happen\nBut right now it looks like those are going to wind up getting split and then of course still hasn't even they're not gonna be able to pass the Democratic bills because they would either give each other only turn in the house you're still going to have investigative power gonna have subpoena power you're going to have imposed\nA nightmare it's a nightmare and if if they get the house it's a nightmare okay so here's here's what I found interesting in um in watching the news and watching just the flow of it\nHave you noticed that you know places like the Atlantic and the times and the post are now starting to publish stories about\nYou know it's an uphill battle to win some of these races in the house it's an uphill battle they have changed their tone from um you know an absolute positive while we're on a blue wave to now almost laying the foundation\nOf ... oh\nYeah we we lost but it was you know it was really kind of a long shot anyway\nYeah I mean that's how badly I think the Kavanaugh saying a has backfired on them\nI mean it's made the Senate basically I mean again it's just that it's one of the five chance but I mean they had they had a better chance of this uh two months ago I mean they had a legitimate path to victory when Cruz was only up by three points all of these races that look like leaning Republican we're all toss up or in some of them looked like they might be leaning Democrat\nThey had a chance to win the Senate before the Kavanaugh saying now I mean I think it's real I realized that income\n... to the independents how are the independence feeling\nAt the ... they're in an interesting group because they're not as passionate as you would expect in this environment so independence and two thousand six and two thousand ten where at fifty percent\nIndependents are almost always going to be lower in a high interest in partisans because partisans engage more like generally um that's like of course a blanket role but it's typical um and she doesn't fourteen it was down to forty percent and two thousand eight or Eighteen up until Kavanaugh was forty two percent\nAnd then uh the jump now to forty six percent so still that's not as high as some of the earlier elections among independents and that may just be because\nThey're overwhelmed with it and they don't they don't like either side and they just want it makes them want to withdraw from Palo yeah but I Wonder\nBecause I Would consider myself an independent yeah and there's no way you're going to keep me away from the polls\nAnd so I'm Wondering you know with that four percent jump was it a four percent effort to preserve four percent jump I'm I Wonder how much of that or people like me who are going to vote for the Republican just because the left has gone in the same\nRight and there's a lot of independents that I that I mean I certainly would fall into this category as well right I Am not registered member of any party nor will I ever the ... was that being said\nUh you know I vote Republican I mean I you know don't vote for Democrats [laughter] so\nI mean for Republicans independents and libertarians libertarian so I don't vote for Democrats but yeah I mean so that's never going to happen so the fact that I'm an independent you can't look at that line as\nThese are people who could go either way it anytime between these two parties that's not what that is right people who identify that way it's a group that's ... that's growing and has been growing for quite some time yes people are bailing out of the parties [laughter] um but the parties themselves are becoming a more rigid in and more\nOf this one could come down to the independence mhm this one could come down to because you can understand the Republicans going up you can understand if you're on the Democratic side Kavanaugh driving all those people but what's driving the independent\n... yeah I mean\nI Would think they are discussed with what's going on right [laughter] if anything or they don't like the overall system there's one other interesting Saturday here Glenn if we could yeah I'm as we're talking about the caravan of of uh immigrants coming migrants whatever\n... which will will be illegal immigrants if they if they get it all the way up by the way who who said that was coming uh\nOh yeah there's this burger yeah definitely we talked about ... about ... a lot about this uh interesting to see the numbers among Latino voters\nSo uh in two thousand six were coming off of the attempt at comprehensive immigration reform that fails ... Republicans very upset about that Democrats win that election relatively easily um\nA Latino at sixty two percent high interest in the election\nThat number in mid term elections has been dismal sense night in two thousand ten was only forty eight percent she doesn't fourteen who was forty one percent very low or in two thousand uh Eighteen up until very recently or was it was at forty seven percent that number has now jumped\nIn October of two dozen Eighteen Seventy one percent from forty seven to Seventy one this year so this is a whatever the reason while they were going on is higher than two thousand six for Latino voters oh wow and again that was a wave election for Democrats\nIt I mean the only thing I can think of is the Guatemalan\nRefugees what else has happened I mean you did have also a fairly recently the uh uh unaccompanied\nMinors situation where they were being quote unquote held in cages in July or August yeah but still ... relatively recently a I'm a you know the the two thousand aging polls were taken January to September\nSo some of those polls are for that some after okay um all the October ones obviously after ... men include the migrants a caravan situation and that might explain the jump but it's it's high everywhere I mean it would ... the only place it's low um\nFox News I'm Karen McHugh in Pittsburgh the names of the eleven people shot dead Saturday at the tree of life synagogue I've been really\nSaudis believe at forty six year old Robert powers acted alone and was simply driven by his hatred abused no explanation was awkward during the news conference this morning about\nWhat might be the possible cause of his anti Semitism before the attack he posted his raised his views on line and you continue to express them during his alleged ramping\nFox's David Lee Miller meanwhile is authorities continue their investigation of suspected pipe bomb Miller says are say one lawmaker says don't blame politics ... there's a day I don't\nThink it's political rhetoric um it's mental illness ah that is causing these tragedies or or would be tragedies or we've got a mental health crisis in this\nCountry that just GOP representative John Ratcliffe on Fox News Sunday Morning futures fish is Fox News\n[noise] well ...\nThere in the forties today tomorrow it will clear away leading us was cooler camps and then they forty this report is\nBronchial by compassion international you can't change the whole world but you can be part of the change in the world for a child living in poverty by becoming a compassion international trials sponsored you can choose a child to sponsor now with compassion dot com slash radio that compassion dot com slash radio\nDiabetes high blood pressure anxiety meds everyone's on them if you own a fifty year old male maybe a bit Porgy and you may even have type two diabetes a million dollars of term insurance may only cost you about two hundred bucks a month\nCalled term provider speak with big Lou it eight hundred five five five twenty eighty five big Lew will find the term life policy for you even if you have tied to diabetes are overweight or have high blood pressure\nGerm providers helped thousands of people like you think they can afford term life\nInsurance to buy a million dollars of affordable term life for you all you need to do is call big Lu at eight hundred five five five\nTwenty eighty five Lew will make sure the scales are taped in your favor call eight hundred five five five twenty eighty five big Lu we'll answer your call and worked to fit you went to a term life policy that you can afford remember big lose like you\nHe's on meds to call eight hundred five five five twenty eighty\nFive eight hundred five five five twenty eighty five [noise]\nNow a year and rock spotlight Nineteen Seventy one February four months after her get Janis Joplin Pearl is releasing those are the single me in the game also topped the charts\n\n\nWeather's hip number three with the single ain't no sunshine from his debut album produced by ...

actually raising your kids and built a\nBetter mouse trap or app or where your worshipping because those are the communities that are going to make you happy politics as a means to an end politics isn't the end\nSo become completely agree with you however our politicians are becoming more and more extreme especially on the left or they are you know they're they are anti capitalist they are they're anti constitution\nSo you know you use on one hand I agree with you we can't be you know all about\nPolitics but at what\nPoint do you see good people\nSay enough is enough and I can't take this anymore\nYeah but then to what end ... what do we do next because what we don't want to do next is what the weirdos did\nA to Nancy Pelosi in California how are you aware of those did to Mitch McConnell it Elaine Chao in Kentucky exactly that are day because there is no second or third just moved from there that doesn't just end up at violence and this is not saying by the way that people don't have a First Amendment right to protest they clearly do\nBut screaming someone down taking mentioned Elaine's food off the table and throwing it on the floor and saying you don't belong in our

politics um you could still talk about things that we had in common what's happening now and why I wrote this book of them is because there is no we're right now\nAnd they're the most watched cable news programming a Sean Hannity is number one that Rachel Maddow is often number two they're still really only one point one percent and nine tenths of one percent of the public and so our world is so fragmented and fractured that I think it's really important to not consume our media\nAs if the people like anti ... who are doing this to hope for viral collapse I think part of what healthy Americans should do is ignore them [noise]\nSo what is are\nAre we I mean I've spent the last two years and the things that I can I continually come back to every single time\nIs the bill of rights it's why people came here because they were protected they knew that they had the right to dream and create and be left alone yeah yeah is that our our even our own them\nSo yes ... ... e pluribus unum out of the many one right we don't have a whole bunch of one right now we don't have a shared sense of what you've just said\nThe first amendment is the beating heart of the American experiment freedom of religion freedom of the press freedom of assembly freedom of speech right of protest all of those things flow from a fundamental assumptions about the dignity of three hundred and twenty million Americans which is we\nBelieve ... day we believe that our citizens are created in the image of God with the turtles souls and with dignity\nThat way bigger than their policy preferences and so what's unique in our moment I think the grand tension that we as a people are not really wrestling through that is so far upstream from politics is this tension between rudeness\nAnd ruthlessness almost all of the happiness literature a few well out there it's confirming stuff that wise people people who've had grandparents have known for millennia\nWhich is that happiness is actually a relatively simple equation do you have a nuclear family do you have a couple of deep friendships or do you have a local worshipping community do you have a theological framework to make sense to death and suffering and forth and statistically the number one driver of happiness is do you have a meaningful vocation do you have shared work do you have co workers\nDo you think when you leave home on Monday morning when you go to do something not to make a lot of money or do you have a lot of status but\nIs there some neighbor who benefits from what I Do if those four things are true or even if three of the four true\nYou're pretty likely to be happy and that those things are all tied to rudeness\nBut we're living through a technological revolution that's tempting us to believe that\nWe can be ruthless we can be place less and so a lot of what's happening is the undermining of local community and the undermining of thick relationships and the undermining of vocation or long work\nUm ends up in a world where a lot of people are using political tribalism to fill a void of the loneliness that's actually happening in their local community I think we need to reflect more deeply on that challenge of our time\nAll right so I'm going to take a quick break and I want to come back and talk about um the press talk about uh the new press if you will Facebook and\nWhat you write about what's deep fakes um you seem to be one of the very few in Washington that really get to this\nAh and you're looking over the horizon and we want to talk about that we're talking to Ben Sasse his new

making people better I focus on something which will sound crazy I focus on happiness\nBecause our nation was built on life\nLiberty pursuit of happiness and no one talks about that I Do all the time everything I'm Talking about is to try to make people more happy or to at least allow them to pursue happiness\nSorry so tell me about that let's start there sure um we talk I talk about for example there there are many controversies that I talk about uh education I I have a complete revamp the education system and people just want to keep funding the same system I'm making\nHemp and the candidates legal I'd hang on weight before it short such so let's start with ... absolutely I'm the one talking about getting rid of all standardized testing prior to high school\nI Know in talking about doing that because they're testing is it unfair way of bringing teachers\nIt's an unfair way of rewarding schools\nAnd it makes kids what ten eleven twelve years old feel stupid because they can't test well and it's known a case of success and what are we finding we're finding literally kids we we have a thirty percent rise in suicide across the entire nation to include children\nOne of those reasons as family court how broken that is another reason is there pressure to take tests or the feel stupid and to be some come success\nWell at ten eleven twelve years old why centralized testing is very good when you're in high school and joined where you should go where you have a clip of these are not a bad idea but ten years old why is to keep control of what's happening in the schools\nI'm not okay with that now you have a bit of gray hair as I Do hear that means you are in school prior to Nineteen eighty and it was I\nProudly Nineteen eighty there really was a department of education I mean it existed but it was basically a repository for information about it may do anything ... somehow everyone in in in the United states some help on how to read\nWrite survive in the world without at at a department education somehow that work somehow local school district did a good job somehow that worked\nAt the Internet you add a technology you think the odds are worse and they give you a quick rundown of every single time\nCentralized control has made things better\nFinished [laughter] yeah right so that's not really what I Want I Want to I Want to make sure that we have some localized central and the only guy saying let teachers teach then I don't administrators because here's the problem with getting ready to testing you will lose about ... we will lose in New York state we lose about four billion dollars in federal funding\nIt's a lot of money but isn't that much for us our budget is sixty billion so losing four billion not in the world however we can still fix that here's the issue here\nWhen we lose at four billion meals loose something else we lose all those strings attached that for a million and there's lots of strikes which means administrators go away and then it shows were riding granted measures were checking boxes all those things we have massive teacher burn out in New York state massive\nWhy regulations rules checking boxes and the only ones saying nice things because I crossed the entire state might say that's easy to counties across all sixty two\nI'm going to fool sharp by the way for you though but I Want teachers to actually want to teach we actually have districts that have more administrators and teachers\nThe average teacher and that's a shame for by the way you have a teacher makes about eighty thousand dollars a year in New York state and the average ministry makes over a hundred and fifty ... you dump a couple of minutes raiders you've had more teachers you've given raises you bought computers all these things\nBut I'm Still not done why in the world we have K. through twelve neat K through ten\nThe last two years of high school for too many kids is Jim study hall video games and probably smoking weed that's all they're doing how do we know this because the first year of college for most kids is Thirteen sprayed it's removed because not ready for it correct so now it takes at least six years the average kid to graduate college\nWest terrible now got twenty four year old kid who's never had a job and when you say I Wonder why hasn't the work ethic\nWe've never had a job it is he's been he's been he's screwing around for eight years literally not people who were telling me literally Larry I Will hire anybody with a work ethic\nAt one uh ... told me he said Laurie my interview process is a very simple I tell them to show up at eight o'clock I open the door if they're there they're hired\nAnd that's how bad it is for people show up at the clock in the morning there's just so that so we need to break that system now I Can't change parenting that I Can't do what kind of changes the the environment of course\nAt sixteen now instead kitchen that five choices they they take a test they gotta has a plumber\nNumber one if colleges right for you that's amazing go to college\nThe problem is we've been told a lie and the lie is the only way to have success in this country\nIs to get a great high school diploma and then go to a great college and then sit behind a desk and ... and the computer all day ... that a way to success not even close to the only way to success lots of people are happy doing all types of things and we should embrace that so it's sixty and make some decisions\nIf I think called you write to me I go to a two year prep school to prep school is that a biology chemistry history whatever break off to college I go to years and I make sure it's working right so that time I get into college and ready and graduate in three or four years and take advantage of internships are incubator is life is good\nI don't like that no worries on the super smart kid the kid who you know loves Dr ... and my doctor who fan\nI'm a doctor who they're gonna have to go to the gates are not sure about the new doctor do you know being a female but that's a different\nStory now okay yeah I'm so that kid who's really smart that could take the SAT right away and goes off and get to a degree why should they be boarding school and they shouldn't be born school\nNext you don't want any of those things now where he's going to a two year trade school go to choice to become a plumber carpenter whatever you want to be about mechanic an H ... guy in New York state particularly we need that desperately the average tradesmen in New York state is over fifty ... that's a problem I let my six year old I'm fifty a ... year old\nMy problem is that they should not be the average they should not be doing all the work they should be tried in the youngsters and you can't find enough in the oceans doing it's a problem so do that we don't like that could get a job\nWhy not go learn a work work ethic now at sixteen I worked at sixteen I Know lots of people might you know if they do go work learn what it means to have a boss learn what it means when your boss says show up at eight that doesn't mean nine thirty that actually mean seven forty five learn that now at sixteen Seventeen Eighteen get some experience\nAllow it sounds great how do you pay for New York state constitution tells me I have to pay for grades one through twelfth grade I'll pay for the last two years to I still pay for him here so I Do it I'm a marine when I got a Marine Corps I had a GI Bill they gave me X dollars and why years to use the same thing here is six team you got twenty thousand dollars seven years to use it good luck\nHis ... his wife prompt she's going to happen a bunch of cool prep schools will pop up a bunch of great trade schools will pop up\nGuess how much they'll costs for two years yeah twenty thousand dollars ... well I don't know they'll pop up because it's guaranteed government money what banks love most\nGuaranteed government money yes they do so they will actually give loans to many schools pop up it'll be amazing\nThere's the best part when he schools pop up now spending ten thousand dollars per kid per year for the last two years the ... states spend twenty two thousand dollars per year per kid so we're saving twelve thousand dollars each twelve thousand times the four hundred thousand eleven twelve feathers is more than four billion dollars\nWe saved all of the federal funds\nWe've removed tons of administrators\nWe've given teachers or a ... a better chance to actually teach we've given teachers freedom to do what they feel it's appropriate we've got rid of Common Core ah we've made teenagers who are unhappy happier and this goes to the next level which is school safety\nIf you look at all the school shootings we've had while they are murders at at their core that public suicide they're unhappy kids ... ethnic or the unhappy kids now thinking about this dilemma twelfth grade you're in eleventh twelfth grader you're in a class with everyone who wants to be there\nTo believe that isn't there the bully kids in something else the kids a bully because he doesn't want to be there that's why he's a bully but now he go someplace else your teacher lemons fourth grade this one problems almost go away why all the kids want to be there they've taught\nWith killing our children isn't guns was getting our children is lack of community lack of purpose and loneliness that's coming on kids put them in these worlds all that goes away\nI Can't go to my fellow friend the teachers have me you know build a rocket with my class\nI Can't go she ... the the farm and he's been a fix a tractor I've got things to do I've I've purpose I meaning I don't do things like that anymore\nWe're living in a
