George that's a female decision that can make the world a better place who's up next Eldorado Colorado which got for me\n[noise] [noise] Hi clay thanks for taking my call so I'm\nAn intramural soccer I'm twenty nine years old my brother and my wife constantly are signing me up and asking me to play and the problem is is that I don't want to play anymore because every single time I play a they're getting a verbal altercation or get thrown out are arguing around\nOr whatever it is a ... or bad or from like conduct is it coed\nYeah it well it call it and it and then um it's both my brother usually man and then with my wife usually call it but it really doesn't matter that they think that we all we are much more competitive when I'm On the field\nYeah no I Know that feeling look I I appreciate that I got kicked out of coed flag football uh for a walk with my wife then girlfriend the first time I met my father in law I got kicked out of a coed flag football game for telling a guy that uh that fat guy\nThat he needed to stop complaining about somebody a girl to aggressively grabbing one of his blacks I was kicked out of the game the guy said like hey she's being way too aggressive I Swear to God this happened and I said\nDo what are you like four twenty five I said fat ... she's not going to hurt you in every flag in the every official through I got kicked out of the coed black football game so I understand the concept of talking too much also of like\nPlaying coed intramural is tough anyway 'cause it's like what am I doing here\nAm I trying to win or am I trying to convince these girls that they should sleep with me right because\nCoed sports in general make no sense to me like if it's just a casual game that's fine but like you don't want to be the guy who gets shot thrown into the bleachers by a girl 'cause you're not playing that heart rate so I never know what to do in a coed flag\nFootball are coed sport in general so I think you can tell your wife look I'm just too competitive to play coed sports I'll go watch you I think that's fine for the brother in law you just like dude I'm twenty nine I'm afraid that I'm going to tear my ACL playing\nSoccer I haven't felt very healthy lately I don't want to play anymore at twenty nine I think you can back out and retire pretty easily do we have time for one more got to be faster yacht Fremont Fremont, California what you got [noise] a\nChicken stock way um I got a father in law married or you got widow or widower or ten years ago remarried five years later he's got a lot of property and acted but why he married now\nWhere do you all get along with their were concerned is going to take a drawback he said he will spend motorized we don't believe that that's actually the ... what's your opinion how do we go about as\nWell so for in general the general rule is going to be when it comes to a ... if you're worried about him dying and her being left behind the spouse is going to receive as a general rule all of his assets\nSo if you have grandkids or you have a shoulder in that you believe should get some of his assets 'cause it's not like this is the second or third wife whatever it is it's not as if this is your mom\nThat can be a big concern so I don't know how much of an estate he has but the more asset you have the more significant asset planning becomes\nAnd this is a common familial issue you don't want him to die and leave everything to her because then she may end up giving nothing to your grandkids or to your kids you need to sit him down and be involved in the final planning for his estate but you need to do it in a non threatening manner\nAnd without alienating her which means you need to do it with kid gloves very carefully All right I

to\nThink and ah that's or he is um he's a guy that we had booked last hour and a kind of went in a different direction but I it it fits right in to what we have been talking about today I had a caller\nUh about an hour and a half ago who said that you know when is it time that we are going to fight back and we should fight back we should fight back in the polls we should stand the crew and steady we have to speak truth\nDo not forget the things that we were all taught and we all know are true\nTo be civil and kind to one another\nBut we\nWere not at a place where I think you grab a gun\nI won't\nChristians in the age of outrage how to bring our best when the world is at its worst ... steps are just wrote that book welcome to the program ed how are you\nThank you thanks for having me and I think we both wrote books and outrage I'd have a nice time you can talk about outright\nAnd we did and have you found the ad that it's not necessarily an understood topic or a popular topic right now to try to do diffuse it or explain what it does to us\nKnow it's interesting I see the word used more than I've ever seen before in my lifetime you know rage outrageous in headlines of articles all the time but it's when you go a little deeper and in your case talking about his relationship to addiction or in my case\nTalking about how Christians might engage the age of outrage and I I don't think I think there's a lot of references to it but not a lot of okay what do we do interact I think you know damn from Georgia who who are fascinating fascinating call and as you've got to walk through that with him he's clearly outraged\nHis response would be very different than yours and I appreciate you responded and mine and I think ultimately part of the challenges is Dan's response is I mean that just said I'll just say it I'll just say it you know dance response is the way a lot of\nPeople feel like I Know you are a lot of built up\nOutrage that is and it's it's you know you both on the conservative and liberal side and it's in many ways tearing our country apart from my concern as a Christian leader you know I'm here at the Billy Graham center a well my concern is is as Christians how are we going to engage in a world filled with outrage\nOr and when something that's where the where the cause of it sometimes where the targets of it it's it's a mix and I love your comments about religious liberty to I mean I I'm I'm deeply concerned about religious liberty or around the world thankful for you bringing that up bring in that case up even today but but but again\nI I see Christians who are outraged about Starbucks cups rather than about persecution around\nThe world and I think so we got our own issues to deal with but also it's the culture as a whole\nSo tell me because I don't know if you heard last hour when I was talking about ...\nAnd that we have this closing window bond Hoffert did not succeed in what he tried to do he'll though he was in the end victorious um but he didn't he didn't change the people because the people had already abandoned their Judeo Christian values they were angry they were outraged and they were they wanted political\nSolutions not a spiritual solution uh and uh they they just went for it we have this this window or on our Judeo Christian culture\nAnd our and our underpinnings they're being lost and if we don't get through that window and keep people's hearts opened\nWe're going to go really a rye ...\nAnd I think ultimately this is our moment for them you know not every we don't get to pick the moment we're born or that where you live in two in every generation of space there challenges but this is our moment and in in in the book I sort of go through I have a chart in some stats up some new statistics in each chapter and I talk about how in many ways\nA that Judeo Christian a consensus has been lost and now\nThe views of uh you know Christians different groups maybe a better more on the conservative side are now outside in many ways of the mainstream of society where once they were the mainstream and that's kind of lead to an accelerated\nA outrage cycle it's led to everyone's turning up the volume two eleven\nAnd ultimately I don't think that's the path and I appreciate what you just said earlier when you're talking to talking to Dan is we've got to um we've got to choose a different way now one of the key things as Christians are consistently choosing a different way and you know we don't need to be disabled by our cable news network or we don't need to be\nA shape spiritually by her social media feed\nI think ultimately we need to be shaped as Christians by who Christ is\nAnd the Jesus was afraid to stand up I mean he was in the temple and he turned over tables but he also showed this remarkable ability that we can model to to build bridges with people with whom he shouldn't even be around because the American woman at the well and I think ultimately we need a better path that the answer is not to\nGet like the world the answer for Christians in this age of outrage is to really follow the way of Jesus in to the world and I'm not some you know well don't stand up for things don't I mean even you said you fight but you fight or a you know for example or you can't war at a people\nAnd reach a people at the same time and so it's a question of how you approach that and we're just we're to use your title were addicted to outrage right now and I'm and I'm trying to say there's a better way for Christians to to to to do belt we even when they are the targets of the outrage and certainly\nTo not participate in creating photo and false crises and outrage\nWell here's what's interesting to me and I pointed it out last hour if you talk politically were winning I mean look at the Supreme Court but the Brett Kavanaugh I don't know of any president would have set up for that look what happened with Israel in many ways\nYou know we're winning it's not they're not forming mobs and going out and and you know ah trying to get into people's face and getting them to react out in anger because they're winning they're doing that because they're desperate\nWe're actually making progress and somehow or another\nWe're just being swept up in their drama\n[noise] well I think people are ... if it's kind of weird that appeals to us there's a part of us I think that's why\nA you know we'll find you know some some some crisis on social media\nThat Christians will be very attracted to and then we find out later that wasn't true and it kind of spread around and and you know and and I and I think that's part of the concern what is it in the U.S that draws us to outrage rather than to engage and I think there's a\nThere's a difference between the two and you know I'm some for example I'm someone who is deeply pro life you know I spoke at the march for life here in Chicago not that long ago and you know you have kind of you know they're the go those of us in the march for life speaking up and standing for life and then you had some protest or on the side just telling us terrible people but then you had some\nSome self identified Christians yelling horrible things at them and here's what I don't want to be I Want to be in the group that's saying I'm going to stand for life\nNot yelling horrible things at one another and thinking even the counter protesters who were kind of part of the march for life but left and started yelling that's the problem we look too much like them and I don't think that that's our goal if our goal and we talk about this a lot\nIn Christians in the age of outrageous is to is to hold a biblical worldview but then to engage the world with a win some\nApproach and an income for what's worth I mean I I've been fascinating to watch you sort of walk through that journey as well and I think it really challenge a lot of people in the way that they would think and so so so kudos to you for even writing on this subject matters\nUm I'd like to talk to you about your solutions so let me take a quick break the name of the book as Christians in the age of outrage I think it is\nReally important and we cannot become that which we despise we cannot play the same game for small\nJust strategically you lose but also we lose who we are when Judeo Christian values are under attack and
