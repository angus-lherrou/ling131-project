my library of of of hardcover books\nAh and I read so much I read it all on tinder all but I have recently really been concerned not just because I don't actually own it and I can't have it in my library and I can't pass it on but also because you watch things like that happening in China\nIf you're ... if you're in China in the first they wouldn't sell the book but if they did sell the book\nThe government can just deem that that book is you don't need to burn books you could just overnight just take all of that\nEvery copy of that book out of circulation if it's only digital that's really disturbing to me\nI think it's a real concern um it's a concern I'm from the perspective of censorship and you've just described it it's also real concern or from the perspective of preservation and sort of archiving our cultural history if\nThese books are ... are are stored on these centralized servers and only the hands of you know the the the two or three companies um that dominate these markets\nThen there's a real risk that uh we are going to be able to ensure a cab to widespread distribution of copies that will allow us to um to to uh to archive and preserved um do these works\nIn an air and it was a movie it wasn't because they founded objectionable or anything else is because that particular provider they lost the rights to that movie right and so they they had to pull it from people's libraries because their rights that expired\nSo there are number of ways that this can happen this most recent example I don't know the facts are totally clear on exactly what went on\nSo one way this can happen is that as you described um the deal between the digital retailer apple or Amazon and the copyright holder expires may no longer have the rights to sell that product\nIt can also happen when a record label or a movie studio decides that they want to put out the new updated re mastered the director's cut edition of the movie and when they do that they pulled the old version\nTo home I Do [noise] um\nOh my gosh so they almost a force you to I mean because they they've always done this where you know it's the masterpiece collection and it's you know additional footage and and the you know fully restored but you still had the old copy\nNow that's right you can't ... I mean even for I mean think of this even just for comparison you can't if they change something in a movie imagine when remember when George Lucas changed in our war huh well I Want to see what it was like\nWhen they were originally came out you wouldn't be able to do that what'd you unless the movie company decided to allow you to do that [noise]\nThat's right I mean and the and the problem is most recent case in part was that the consumer didn't have a local copy stored on their computer or their device um\nAnd and this is a practical tips for people you should always try to store as much as you can do the locally many services are often trying to encourage consumers to rely on their own on the on the company's own set of cloud storage solution\nAnd sometimes I'm with the Apple TV for example the Apple TV doesn't allow you to permanently download a copy of a movie you have to access it through their ... servers\nExactly I'm\nSorry I I think that makes a big difference in your relationship as\nIf I downloaded or something on Kindle could I downloaded to another cloud and still be able to read it on Kindle\n\nOr so is it allows you to store those files locally on your own device cars that Kendall is tattered through soft where right where connections to Amazon\nAmazon has the ability as as they showed ten years ago to block it move those files stronger\nHubble can you talk about or go ahead [laughter]\nReal quick apple apple has the same sort of control we saw this several years ago two and a very different way I Am sure um some of your listeners may remember when they woke up and found a huge who album on their iPhone\nHas asked for they put it the other way David forest everybody to have it exactly\nThe bizarre you write about this a little bit and it's it's an interesting change in the way we think about commerce there is in the past you had a transaction where you go into a store and you buy something\nWith these digital purchases that we're making provide tunes or Amazon\nWere actually like entering a ongoing relationship with them\nYou it's a it's sort of an open ended thing where they're constantly knowing what you do with that product and you have that ongoing relationship where they can cancel that at any time without your knowledge to talk about a little bit about the change there 'cause it is but the real change I don't think people have considered an air and before you answer that we're going to take a quick break\nAnd they will come back and get you to answer that question a and just the change in\nIn capitalism change what

that the world always returns to gold um and for a barter a they have the maple flex going which is is this bar of of a silver that it's about the size of a credit card that you can carry it

the way that\nCommercial transactions are structured will say we're going to start to shoot people become more and more customs to paying for temporary access to resources rather than owning them and in some ways\nI I think that makes some degree of sat there are some people for whom owning a car that necessary they'd rather be able to take a left are used on sort of car share application\nAnd I think that makes a lot of what I'm worried about is the long term a set of implications for a shift away from ownership and towards temporary access a shift away from in control\nOf resources to one where we have to rely on permission or or or the sort of good will of the companies\nIn troll access so ...\nMaybe many I give you an example and see if I'm On the right track I buy a car and I love this car and I want to keep it and it's a classic car but\nI don't own the software that runs the car and if any time the software company says no I'm not going to we're not going to support that or we want to discontinue or whatever\nI I um I don't I have a heap of junk I Can't do anything with it because I don't own the software that runs it\nI think the cars a great example um we see this issue come up in the motor vehicle context or the ... the way it's come up um [noise] uh most most recently in most often is actually not with cars but with tractors a John Deere\nUm the long running American farm equipment company makes exactly this argument that they own the software and the tractors that say they sell to American farmers and that means that farmers can only get their tractors repaired I authorized John Deere a dealers\nThey can't do it themselves they can't go to their local mom and pop a you know farming repair shop [noise] um I think those kinds of changes are really troubling\nBecause they go to this sense of independence in the sense of autonomy that we're all independent actors in the world who can make our own decisions who can decide what's best for us\nDo we want to keep his tractor as it is do we want to modify it do you want to repair it\nThose decisions are being taken away from individual consumers and you're doing forced to play by a set of rules dictated by the company to quote unquote sell you these products\nAnd doesn't that also doesn't also stop innovation I mean sometimes the guy who takes something and then tinkers with it comes up with

program [noise] one\nOf my favorite guys uh because he is he does his own homework he rolls up his sleeves he looks and he tells the truth as he finds that Peter ... is a here he's the president of government accountability Institute and a producer of a new documentary that's out called the creepy line and that is exactly the right name for it\n[laughter] it is it actually the creepy line comes from a speech that Eric Smith Schmidt the CEO of Google gave it was an interview in fact\nWhere he was asked how do you make these ethical judgments about how far you're going to go and then the interviewer actually asked Schmidt are you going to win plant things in our brain and Eric Schmidt's response was well we like to go right up to the creepy line but not cross it\nHe said we're not going to when plants anything in your brain at least not yet those are actually erupt Schmitz word and\nHe and his he's to I find him incredibly Frank yes he he just he says it like it is yes it is I I've interviewed him a couple of times and it is fascinating yes because he's just telling you he\nHe doesn't sugarcoat it and I think it's his background as an engineer a and and he's sort of very direct I mean one of the other things we caught him when the film was saying is that Google a house and takes very seriously its responsibility to change the values\nOf American people uh you know Google's Monterey has always been there are more than just a company and make money or they have a certain ecosystem world view and part of the reason that they structure of the company the way they did\nIn which the founders always have controlling shares is that that sense of social mission is part of it\nAnd Schmidt has been always very direct about saying it yes part of our mission as a company has been to try to shape and changed the values of the United states and that sort of one of the premises of this film that it's not just about privacy it's not that they're taking all this information\nGlenn they're using that information against us to try to nudge us or to move us in directions there that we wouldn't ordinarily want to go\nOkay so um so let's kick can can you tie this all to Kavanaugh and what we've seen with the cabinet case and how\nFor instance you know there's there's um a ... there is this overwhelming uh understanding from half the country that he is absolutely guilty and she is a victim right and\nThere's a lot of information on the other side in fact more information on the other side but you're not really seen\nThat right yeah it's it's very hard because this is happening in real time right now to sort of monitor what's a Google doing but we can look at the past uh in fact one of the things we feature in the film is a study done by a Robert ... a ... a very interesting guy he's a Harvard PHD in psychology studied under BF Skinner\nOr was the former editor in chief of Psychology Today magazine and by the way and this is very relevant was a Hillary Clinton supporter and twenty sixteen\nWhat one of the things he did and the twenty sixteen election was he had two thousand people around the country doing Google searches are and they monitored the results that people were getting this is a very ah you know a clear academic study and and at this research was peer reviewed as his other work was\nAnd what came back was that Google was systematically skewing search results in favor of Hillary Clinton they were in other words they were a suppressing negative stories about Hillary in the algorithm and they were pushing them in favor of Donald Trump\nAnd ... point was I actually supported Hillary Clinton thought she was more qualified but the bottom line is a company should not be doing this and it secret you don't know that it's going on nobody's monitoring the results are getting their assuming the results in the list that they are getting is representative of some objective standard\nFrugal is a Google is a verb now yeah not a noun yes it's a verb I don't know Google it yes well if you Google it and the end the algorithm is giving you the answer that is skewed right that's like going to a dictionary\nThat will always changed the definitions of things but as it applies to whatever's happening in the world yeah that's a real problem\nNo you're you're exactly right and so in the in the context of cabinet I mean I don't know exactly well because it's occurring real time but the bottom line is there is a history here of Google doing this it was\nIt was leaked um uh a couple of weeks ago Tucker Carlson talked about uh about these internal emails where you actually had Google engineers saying hey you know what we don't light you know Trump's policy on immigration so we want to sort of a suppress certain stories\nUm this is the thing and Google does it end and here's the the the point that we tried to make Glenn in this film and in general\nThe whole conversation that Google wants to have is about fake news and this debate about fake news here's here's the bottom line fake news is competitive\nIf you and I are having a disagreement about something I put up my fake news story and you say oh yeah I'm going to put up my fake news story the pointed it out in the open you have combat and by the way the news doesn't really convince anybody you know if you like Hillary Clinton that fake news at that the Russians ran of\nJesus and and and Hillary arm wrestling [laughter] probably not going to convince you voted a different way that wasn't that that wasn't a real armor [laughter]\nBut you know the point is is that that's not going to convince anybody because the confirmation bias\nYou know people tend to look for information they want what Google is doing is different because we don't know what we don't know\nThe question that we should be asking people the Google and Facebook is why will you not make your algorithm trends parents right why will you not I mean and I let me take a quick break and come back do you have an answer their answer on why they won't make it transparent yes\nAnd it's not very good and you know\nThat it's not\nThe name of the documentary is the creepy line the ... dot com Peter ... with us and we have a lot to discuss because of the platform Ming\nA and kind of a role in from our last conversation about\nInformation how do you know that it's

hundred [noise]\nThe Glenn Beck ... meters wiser is with us a president of government accountability Institute producer of a new documentary that is out and you find it at the\nCreepy line dot com um the creepy line and it comes from a a quote from the guy who's running the Google\nThat you know we were not going to implant things into your head but we're going to come right up to that creepy line that's terrifying beer from somebody who's in charge of Google\nPeter uh I I wanted I Want to talk to you about the platform me\nI Am currently saying to anyone who has a conservative voice\nLet's all get on a single server let's get on to our own platform together we don't have to join business or a but we have to have a protected platform because I Believe these companies\nAre are going to the platform us one by one\nIs this what you've been doing ... here yeah I I think you're very smart to do that I think you're very smart to do that because let's step back in first consider the power of Google and a lot of people don't realize this but it was widely reported in the guardian elsewhere in two thousand nine Google actually shut down the entire Internet for two hours on a Saturday morning\nThey blacklisted the entire Internet\nThat shows you this the scope and size that Google has wait a minute how it is it's a ... they blacklisted the entire Internet if you go to the guardian WWW yes they shut down the entire Internet a couple of years later they shut down half of Japan's Internet\nOr they said it was sort of an error that they but but the point being the size and the scope of this company is enormous and a lot of people don't realize even if they're not you\nUsing a Google products somebody will say why don't use Gmail I'm not worried about Gmail that's fine but here's your company ... you know it may be John Smith at acme incorporated dot com but his acne incorporated email server actually a Google product\nBecause if it is golf Google is monitoring and watching what you're doing and it's part of the data collection they're doing on you a lot of news organizations in the United states use Google we we we highlight in the film for example Robert up sign this scholar who's been critical of Google\nA link to support a Clinton supporter a Harvard PHD in psychology um Iran or did some studies and the Washington Post ran a piece about could Google swing an election this was back in twenty twelve yeah the next day\nRobert ... was shot out of Google he could not get on Firefox he could not get any on on any of the uh the Google products they had shut 'em out same thing happened to Jordan Peterson a University of Toronto professor\nWho had taken a position about forced speech if you have on gender or gender pronouns the next morning when that went public he was locked out of his Gmail accounts\nAnd Google would not let him back into his Gmail account all of his emails his calendars and everything he was blocked from\nThe point being they have a lot of power and you cannot assume that Google is not going to take these actions people will say a lotta times whether a company they want to make their customers happy they are more than a traditional company they say so themselves\nThey view themselves as a company with a mission so\nHere's what people say when when you know what I use ... well you know\nGoogle is monitoring your mail they're not reading my mail actually\nYou are both right and wrong they are not reading your mail however\nThey are analyzing your mail because what they're doing is collecting the information on how people relate to one another how people talk to one another all for their a I research so Google isn't free right for no reason\nThat's exactly right you you are the product yeah we say what is Google's product you are the product because they are selling information on Glenn Beck or on Peter Schweitzer or on whoever\nAnd more importantly I think they are ... all of it look\nThere's that this is just the beginning let me tell you is bouquet story mhm you go to Beijing there are three concentric circles of security in Beijing okay the center is the main city of Beijing how many people it used to look it up for me what do you still how many millions of people are living in Beijing\nIn the city proper that is the inner circle there is so much monitoring going on they just did a test they release the guy they they uh took a guy mhm pick somebody said go into the center of the city just go hide okay [laughter]", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city":
