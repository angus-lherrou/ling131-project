would be funny\nAgain there's no chance these bombs would go off\nAnd maybe it's a kid maybe it's a guy who's so screwed up she just doesn't even know what he's doing\nThere's also the possibility someone knew exactly what they were doing and wanted to send a message one way or the other this however is not stopping\nThe left from jumping on this I mean you never let a crisis go to waste by noon yesterday we hadn't even found all the bombs by noon yesterday Paul Waldman of the Washington Post already had an article out blaming Donald Trump quote\nGiven what Trump has done and said this was absolutely predictable in fact it's all wonder that it took this long\nIt's not just that Trump advocates violence against his political opponents\nLow he does it's everything about his rhetoric that pushes his supporters in that direction\nYou know at this coming from the same guy that if it is ever found out that it is a\nLeft wing guy or just a crazy person they will never report that\nCan I ask when the president has actually called for violence\nNow you could say in a some of his campaign rallies where he's like rough 'em up okay I'll give you that\n\nCalling the media fake news\nIs

pipe bomb was sent to Mike Pence\n\nBut I don't know how hard it is for the people in the news media I don't know how hard it is for you to go back so deep in your memory bank you might need a

saying\nEverything is speculation and if I Would say Ari ... versus a left wing person trying to ramp everybody up what would that do that would choose the people listening\nAnd they'd say oh my gosh that's exactly right so why is it you feel so comfortable demonizing Donald Trump and all of his supporters and\nBlaming this on Donald Trump and all of his supporters when you have nothing but a cartoon bomb\n\nYou know [noise] if you just get on and say we don't have the facts let's wait for the facts you do something like that and something crazy happens it's almost unthinkable\nYou can actually keep or begin to rebuild something I Know it's a little tiny cold credibility but you'd have to be you'd have to be interested in having some credibility\nTo be able to gain it\n[noise] [noise] [noise] well for\nThe second day in a row Jason ... who is with us it is I'm\nA former [noise] I'm a former military intel uh knows a little something about bombs and and I eat\nThese Jason how ridiculous\nIs this bomb the most ridiculous looking bomb I've ever seen it sort of when I when we first looked at it I think I was reading a tweet by Jake Tapper and he was talking about how these were designed for mass murder and um I I was looking at it and I was like\nNo not really I mean it's a ... you were just talking about it's plastic which defeats the entire purpose of a pipe bomb the shrapnel is what's dangerous and apply Bob and explosives inside or just to make it like basically build pressure so usually it's a potassium nitrate I think charcoal okay we don't need\n[laughter] [laughter] um\nBut there's another ingredient that they actually talked about which is a again that goes towards the detonation of it um they said they did detect some of that and there but they didn't talk about the other ingredients so I again the everything is spec is is so speculative about it but everything points to a guy that really did not know what he was doing a\nLower\nOr somebody who didn't know what they're doing but they didn't want it to work\nRight it had no I mean you're looking at this thing there is a you know and I've also spent some time in some insecurity all the people that they sent these are these packages to they have screening services whether it's the secret service private security or like places like CNN all media companies have the same thing you you ... you would think that this person would no\nWell I was no chance just gets to them the coverage I heard yesterday was this was a sign of how advanced and serious the situation but there was a level of sophistication level is\nSupposed to get him because he had vent or or she by the way he or she had a sense um some of these bombs to home offices and\nAnd residences where there wouldn't be the screening rather than sending them through like the congressional uh mail service which would definitely be\nSchool until I tell you something I Know this is true because ah I've seen pictures and you can just imagine Hillary Clinton coming out and her bathrobe and are fuzzy slippers with a cigarette hanging from [laughter] get the paper in the mail every day when she gets\nUp

and Brokaw and how many more\nAt NBC it's been one of the biggest and not to mention ignoring the Harvey Weinstein thing for how long remembered they employed Ronan Farrow when he was writing the story and they gave it to the New Yorker\nI I you know all of that goes on and making Kelly happens to me one of the biggest critics of what happened and NBC and yet you know she has one comment that people don't like and she's gone it's fascinating\nNBC News uh chairman Andy lack released a statement following her comments\nThere is no other way to put this but I can damn those remarks there is no place on our air or in this work place for those kinds of words I mean touchy feely guys that's fine but words no no no I'm Sorry I add to that quote it's very unfortunate and quote\nWhat is unfortunate is that America has devolved into a country of oversensitive cry babies who\nTake offense at the slightest thing and you know what I don't even think it's America I don't think it's Americans I really don't I don't think that it's a vast but I don't think it's eighty or Ninety percent of this country that are cry babies they're sick of this\n\nIs about maybe five to ten percent of America and many of them in the media and many of them in politics\nAnd the last\nPlace probably the last comes first\nAcademia [laughter]\nOh you should be coddled the slightest thing upset you well that's not American\nIt's not where are the ones you know what I have a picture of my grandmother she crossed the Rocky Mountains and in a um a in a ... a wagon train okay is she was she looks like me in a dress with a bomb it okay she she ...\nShe also kind of looks a little like a pirate you know why because on the wagon train her I was poked out\n[laughter] you know she did she wiped her face and ... and kept going she didn't wine she cry about it she's like oh\nCrap [noise] shouldn't around with that\nI pulled my eye out and she moved on\n\nThat to Americans are yes bad things happen we move on yes people say things that I don't like we move on and yes\nThings have changed were involving we're learning\nNew things some things are outdated some things that are good or just being tossed out the window and somebody should say wait a minute let's not throw that away\n\nMegan Kelly oughta know blackface is awful yes it's no longer acceptable but you know what\nIf it's a costume that his purpose flea ridden a ridiculing race as black faces done historically yes it's not kosher nor should it be\nBut notice what is happening here with Kelly ... is being fired not because she wore black face but because of words and I the ah question it's not even she was advocating she was questioning why\nWhy is this wrong if I'm not ridiculing people\nWhy is this wrong at that person light Diana Ross wanted to be like Diana Ross in a costume why is this wrong\n\nI think that deserves an answer\nInstead what we got was an apology I Am so sorry I shouldn't have oh please don't beat me please don't beat me master please don't be mean [laughter] I don't want to know are whipping please don't beat me are you kidding me how\nAre we supposed to learn if we don't have civil conversations and yes once in a while we ask a question that's politically incorrect\n\nLook criteria in America right now has narrowed so far that it is it is almost nothing it takes almost nothing to get you fired\n\nYou know we should we should take Megan Kelly and we should take her down to the river and we should put a bunch of rocks around her and throw into the river if she floats we know she's a bigoted racist\nIf she doesn't well we will will know that will know that she was innocent\nThis is so ridiculous how similar it is to the thought crimes that Orwell wrote about in Nineteen eighty four here's a passage for anybody who you know it hasn't sort of something called a book in a while\nThe main character Winston Smith training himself to avoid thought crimes here it is quote the mind should develop a blind spot whenever a dangerous thought presented itself the process should be automatic instinctive crime stop\nThat's what they call it a new speak\nHe's had to work to exercise himself in crime stop he presented himself with propositions the party says the earth is flat the party says that ISIS heavier than water\nAnd trained himself and not seeing or understanding the arguments that contradicted them and quote here's another one quote if you made an unexpected movement and then they yelled at you from the tell a screen\nSwap tell a screen swap tell a screen with what Twitter and here we are in reality let me read that one more time if you said something unexpected\nIf you made unexpected movements they yelled at you through the tell a screen\nI don't want to ruin Nineteen eighty four for you but let me just say it's not the kind of world we want to end up in\nUnfortunately not enough people read anymore you should because it is exactly the world

twelve hundred Boston dot com\n\n\nBe a migrant caravan\nIs coming our way to migrate caravan\nThat's not what this is ... if anything this is a humanitarian crisis because these people are being used they're being used by political operatives in Honduras Mike Lee a senator who was always standing guard by our constitution welcome to the program sir how are you\nDoing great thank you very much good\nSo you are [noise] are you wrote to me last night it I'm not smart enough to understand it or you said there is a is there is a procedure that you're pushing for 'em to hold these countries responsible and get them involved in stopping it can you explain\nWhat happened was that the Senate Judiciary committee chairman Chuck Grassley and I sent a letter to they had took a department of homeland security and the department of state chasing good workout like green but\nWith Mexico a whereby a Mexico would require people who enter Mexico let's say from Honduras or from El Salvador or from any of these other countries in Central America where a lot of these people were coming from with the intent of claiming asylum that they would have to claim asylum\nIn Mexico rather than in the United states\nWould be similar to an agreement that we already have in place with Canada and a rule imposed buddy you refugees\nArriving in ... countries from Syria in other words\nWhen people were fleeing a ... a country that's dangerous to them that is particularly hostile towards them for some particular racial such that they have an asylum claim they ought to apply for asylum and the first country they reach that could be potentially safe here that should be Mexico\nIsn't that normally what happens I mean I saw that when you wanted asylum I thought I personally I think the United states government should be running ads do not come to America with your family because you will be turned away if you're in danger come to the closest to us embassy\nAnd apply for asylum\nI I mean why are we die thought that was what we always do\nWe ... it should be more like that and that's not really how it works and that ... in order to these people end up applying\nFor asylum with Mexico that are sort of going for the long bomb Hail Mary pass and trying to make it all the way the United states but this jury is itself dangerous this journey itself\nI'm right with opportunities for people to be exploited ah it it's an exceptionally dangerous journey for many people especially for children and for young women many of whom are sexually assaulted during the ...\nAnd a lot of the people claiming asylum turn out not to be able to make the case that they're even eligible for asylum but once\nThey're in the United states it makes it much more difficult to get them back\nAnd we think that the asylum application if they're coming by land for Mexico ought to be made to Mexico as they enter Mexico\nI talked to a great guy but the other day and he said that he thought Mexico was working on something with the UN to put some sort of a camp there in Mexico for these refugees have you heard anything about that\nI have not but I\nDon't think that sounds like a a great idea I think that could become a another potential magnet I agree for bringing people here um if the idea is to facilitate that journey specifically the journey from somewhere else in Central America to the United states that could become more of a problem\nAgain you you you nailed it quite a few minutes ago and saying that the humanitarian crisis that we have to be focusing on here really is the crisis with the refugees themselves having to make this long dangerous journey and then knowing\nThat when they get here the odds are pretty high that they're not going to be deemed eligible for asylum in any event at this creates a whole lot of headaches for them\nIn the process so Mike I got a I got an um an email in yesterday from a listener in Honduras Honduras resident and then a born and raised native ah
