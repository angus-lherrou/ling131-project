always take me back and and have me kind of paint a picture of the hardest day I had at work and he said that dollar are you willing to put that dollar into that trade\nAnd it just goes back to that

worthy of my heart or an investment dollars and unfortunately the answer that echoes across Web unorthodox echoes across live workshops\nIs near zero which is one of the reasons why we don't have the

I I'm doing it secretly from\nMy own selfish purpose in it if I don't have a plan for all this stuff and just all goes apart everybody yeah runs around like a chicken with their head cut off and you know it's funny I I can remember this back\nWay back to my high school days one I wouldn't you know prepare for earnings answer tests or projects and always Wayne to the last minute and I had such mounting stress in high school and one plan just like you know what\nI just got to prepare better and I think that's when things start changing and I really have a passion for planning you know at vents and just\nEverything in our life because it does decrease stress a lot if I can see you know what is coming down the line how to prepare for it but also how to be flexible if you know a wrench gets thrown in the works as well\nI don't agree with that I think that you do get stressed out if things aren't organized in advance but you're also a people pleaser you like to see people be happy and having fun and so sometimes just winning it\nYou can't really give people necessarily the best experience and\nYou know I Would say that we should take equal credit like in our own family when we plan like trips I Know that we're planning on going into Virginia and a couple of weeks we've never been we're really looking forward to it\nYou know we'll sit down together and we'll look at all the possibilities that we do a hotel or air BNB what cities do we want to hit you know what they would be the best way to go to the beach because of course the boys are going to demand a beach visit right\nAnd we are really cure rating that trip like almost down to the minute\nSo were scouting out where we are going to stay how we're getting there where we're going to eat one of the sites that were going to say so literally we're looking like almost minute by minute what it is that we're going to do and that's just us because in the absence of that we might miss out on all these different sites and opportunities things to do\nAnd also the way that we took here just as I Know that we would be stressed out if we dislike dot on a plane and we were just like winging the entire\nExperience so a little planning goes a long way and often but we like to remark upon is that I think a lot of people listening are very similar they liked the planet advance for especially the things in life that are fun whether it be a party or a trip\nThe thing is retirement it's almost like a twenty year vacation to twenty or party and the thing is I find a lot of people don't really have\nThat planned in advance that I temporary that kind of maps out what they need to be doing both before during and afterwards in terms of making sure that they maximize their experience and also eliminate the stress and the worry you know sometimes people go half way they've got maybe some investments\nAnd maybe they've gotten themselves a whale maybe they bought in themselves you know some insurance and things like that but it's at all tied together and are they looking at all the other an flurries issues like tax\nHealth care you know will the money last as long as I Do\nThe thing is I find an obviously why we are out here a spouse and the importance of uh of retirement planning is that really to have that kind of peace of mind to maximize what's possible\nIt really does require a plan and so today I think would be helpful is really parsing out the difference between what some people are doing it but they might call a plan but what an actual holistic financial plan looks like and really breaking that down to the sum of all of its individual parts were always have your start as just consider what have you done the far\nIf you've got a four O. one K. if you've got some savings if you're reducing your debt if you've got good habits that's a start\nBut do you know how you're going to legally eliminate as much future attacks as possible what happens if you get sick or injured along the way do we have every single possible legal protection so it's a money stays inside the family if something happens to us and isn't gobbled up by those attorneys and the IRS", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Your Retirement: On Track & On Time with Arcadia Financial Group", "city": "Newton", "day": "06"}
