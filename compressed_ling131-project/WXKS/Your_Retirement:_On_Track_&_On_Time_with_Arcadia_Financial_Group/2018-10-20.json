Eighteen people\nYou know I Would say that we should take equal credit like in our own family when we plan like trips I Know that we're planning on going in to Virginia and a couple of weeks we've never been we're really looking forward to it\nYou know we'll sit down together and we'll look at all the possibilities that we do a hotel or Arab Ian be what cities do we want to hit you know what day would be the best way to go to the beach 'cause of course the boys are going to demand a beach visit writer\nAnd we are really cure rating that trip like almost down to the minute so were scouting out where we're going to stay\nHow we're getting there where we're going to eat one of the sites that were going to see so literally we're looking like almost minute by minute what it is that we're going to do and that's just us because in the absence of that we might miss out on all these different sites and opportunities things to do\nAnd also the way that we took here just as I Know that we would be stressed out if we just like got on a plane and we were just like when you're in the entire\nExperience so a little plan and goes a long way and often what we like to remark upon is that I think a lot of people listening are very similar they liked to planet advance for especially the things in life that are fun whether it be a party or a trip\nThe thing is retirement it's almost like a twenty year vacation\nAnd the thing is I find a lot of people don't really have\nThat planned in advance that I ... that kind of maps out what they need to be doing both before during and afterwards in terms of making sure that they maximize their experience and also eliminate the stress and the worry you know sometimes people go half way they've got maybe some investments\nAnd maybe they've gotten themselves a will maybe they bought in themselves you know some insurance and things like that but it's at all tied together and are they looking at all the other ancillary issues like tax health care you know well the money last as long as I Do\nThe thing is I find an obviously why we are out here a spouse and the importance of uh of retirement planning is that really to have that kind of peace of mind to maximize what's possible\nIt really does require a plan and so today I think would be helpful is really parsing out the difference between what some people are doing it but they might call a plan but what an actual\nHolistic financial plan looks like and really breaking that down to the sum of all of its individual parts were or what have you start as just consider what have you done thus far if you've got a four O. one K. if you've got some savings if you're reducing your debt if you've got good habits that's a start\nBut do you know how you're going to legally eliminate as much future attacks as possible what happens if you get sick or injured along the way do we have every single possible legal protection so it's a money stays inside the family if something happens to us and isn't gobbled up by those attorneys and the IRS\nThe idea is that there is a real difference between a partial versus a complete plan\nAnd if you're suspecting that maybe your plan is incomplete it's probably about time that we had a chat\nGive us a call today for our next ten callers we've put specifically aside ten spots on her account or over the next two weeks where we can sit down for a complementary consultation and see what it is that we can do to complete that plan and give you some real clarity envision around your financial future so called today be one of the next

building up our nest egg and we're all working toward that every day right we're trying to build a nest egg our asset based and take this through retirement what we aiming for though what's is there a magic number is ... is a million dollars going to do it\nYeah I think a lot of people like to have a particular target in mind do I need to save and have a million dollars or two million ... million taught it\nI'm looking at a static numbers probably the wrong approach because how much you're going to need to retire on depends on a lot of things you know if you're retiring at sixty\nVersus Seventy that's going to change how much you're going to need to have said if you have good genes in good health and you're going to have a longer than expected life expectancy well that changes things too and then probably the most important element the variable we really have to focus on is well what's the monthly budget\nHow much you're spending you know recently we had some people come into the office and we were talking about how much they needed in order to be happy and I was mentioning like you know do golf do you take big wild and crazy trips\nAnd this woman looked at me and she said no Mike for me\nBeing happy as being outside sitting in my ... lounge having some sunshine right reading a book\nAnd I said well hey if that's the case and we don't need some big huge nest egg right because the things that you enjoy in life are pretty close to free\nAnd it's funny how you know clients run the gamut because we have other people that like I'm going to Europe from some travelling all over the place I have grandkids all over the country I'm going to go visit them so obviously those folks will have to have a larger number but\nOther people are just happy hanging on their back yard and that's a beautiful thing to him you know one versus the other one's not better or was not correct\nVersus the other it's really it comes down to what you see all the time might each situation is different each family's different\nYeah so I mean to really answer your original question is there a magic number I Would say no I'd say that there's more of like a magic formula to this we have to look at when you want to retire how long you think that retirement might be\nHow much do you think you're going to spend along the way and then we can back into as a result once we identify those things\nWhat it is that you need to have saved to supply that monthly income for the rest of your life and then I Would say we need to marry that to the right attitude because even getting there doesn't necessarily mean that you were in the right place mentally\nYou know we had a visiting the office from a a woman she was a nurse and she just retired I Want to say about three or four years ago so she's been retired for some time\nAnd I asked her what her experience had been like over the last few years how was retirement and she kind of gave me a man it's been okay\nAnd so I said explains search dialing into her situation she's basically just living off of her Social Security which is like twenty five hundred bucks a month now her rent is you know well she doesn't have rented a house and it's paid off so she spent a lot of expenses but she's also not doing a lot now with their free time\nAnd I looked at her finances and she had like one point two million dollars saved\nAnd I said well you're not touching any of this money and I found out just by kind of poking prodding that a lot of the influence in her life particularly some friends that she has there are so anxious about the future higher taxes and the Trump presidency and all this other stuff that they were basically coaching her not to spend the money\nSo I told her listen you've got the amount of money that you need and as far as we know you're not King Tut you're not going to be able to take all this money with you went to the afterlife\nSo I don't care if you spend it but if you're not going to spend it let's have a real talked about what this money will mean maybe one day to the people in your life that you care about the next generation maybe some kind of community cause or a charity or maybe and so we talked about using it for you what do you think and she was like oh honey I could use it for me\nBut the thing is we had to help her not just understand the number Megan\n'cause she was already there but understand mentally that she was really in a position to start enjoying that number spending it and having fun and retirement see I think we can fool ourselves and believe that retirement planning is only about investments and rate of return and maximizing things\nAnd it certainly is to some extent but it's also about the right attitude understanding\nThings getting confidence and clarity with what it is that you're doing because in the absence of that we might not be fully enjoying what it is that we're doing if you feel like you're maybe missing that piece you don't know how to feel confident about your financial future it's probably long past time that we had a chat dial eight\nEight eight Arcadia today that's eight eight eight to Seventy two twenty three forty two let's have a complementary consultation today I Know that me and the team would love to assist you and mapping out your future again eight eight eight to Seventy two twenty three forty to\nHow much you'll need to save for retirement that certainly important to know but it's one thing to set aside money it's another thing to invest it wisely Mike and just give us a few of their most effective retirement investment strategy that's next [noise]\nYou're listening to on track and on time with Michael in just a company [noise]\nAirliners on middle children in Springfield forms lives

wonder when care in the most advanced\nIn state of the article and to ensure our young patients safe return to play sports and the activities of daily\nRehab gym with a variety of parts\nYeah I think that taxes is probably the most under explored item when it comes to retirement planning 'cause I Know a lot of advisors there's a lot of bravado here in this industry about who gets people the biggest rate of return what the best portfolios at the lowest price points and everyone focus on returns I mean returns or sexy\nYou looked like it just that last year twenty Seventeen and a lot of people made twelve Fifteen twenty percent rates of return that's what we talk about at those cocktail party what\nMoney's coming in to you but how much\nOf that you get to keep you know this reminds me a just used to watch that show parks and rec a lot and one of the characters Ron Swanson he's like the\nCurmudgeon right I mean governor [laughter] yeah he thinks the government so to get you and there was like a civic day or something where all the local school kids how to like chateau one of these municipal workers\nAnd ah so this case following Ron Swanson around and he's like so I I guess I've got to teach teach you about taxes today huh how the government goes what did you bring for lunch and she does shows him his sandwich or the sandwich\nAnd we'd grabs it out of her hand takes three ... bites and hands it back and he goes that's how taxation works [laughter]\nSo she's sitting there looking like half of or sandwiches gone right\nAnd I like to think that a lot of people listening you know they actually have a similar type of experience in store for them in the future see they don't have a sandwich that they're holding onto there's\nSome sort of a portfolio that they've got they get that statement in the mail from fidelity or vanguard their four one K. company and they're like hey man look my balance is just about as big as it's ever been and that is true for a lot of people because the market has done so well for so long\nSo their statements say two hundred thousand five hundred thousand a million or more whatever it says\nBut sooner or later Ron Swanson is going to grab your portfolio take two or three bites and leave you with just a fraction of the difference of course we're not talking about Ron here we're talking about the IRS\nAnd we're not talking about sandwiches you're talking about you what we call that at our house what the parent tax I we've been out for ice cream Sundays yesterday and mom and dad always get at least the first two or three bites of that Sunday mhm he earned it has it gotten or nearby though good question\nI got to tell you I think a lot of people when you ask them where do you think taxes are going in their financial future\nThey guess if they're going up this country is in an outrageous amount of debt and just the last two weeks both Medicare and Social Security announced that those entitlement programs are running and solve meant a lot further ahead of schedule than they had planned for guys taxes are ... are going up or ... it's almost an inevitability\nAnd the thing is we're all just sitting there looking at our accounts wondering well\nWell is this money mind or what kind of bite is going to be taken out of this\nHow much are we just focusing strictly on returns and diversification and safety and feed\nWhile we're paying zero mind at all in terms of what we're going to be separated from in the way of tax I find that most people if they think about tax they only look backwards and I do it every April fifteenth may try to figure out how it is they can count their beans and save as much money as possible but what about the next ten years Twenty years\nHave you used every single ... legal loophole in strategy shelter\nTo make sure that when Ron Swanson the IRS comes around looking for his bite but that bite that they take is as small as possible you either done that planning or you have and and if you haven't it's time to come sit with us and our team see what it is that we can do to protect your heart or a sandwich or I mean money\nSo give us a call today that's eight eight

be prepared for all of the curve balls that life throws your way especially in retirement the good news is\nLife does happen but we can plan for it and making jets are getting us great strategies today and\nYou know like I was thinking about your book and for our listeners who aren't familiar Mike has a book out just out this year it's called retire on rails of heel you cover a lot of these issues that pop up but also had a plan for them\nOne of the things you have to make sure you had buttoned up is your plan for Social Security this is really\nMight the cornerstone for a lot of people in their retirement plan isn't it\nYeah and I think it is somewhat under waited in a lot of people's minds in that well we can just go by the statistics the average American turns on their benefit at sixty two\nWhich is when the government has to give you the legal least amount in terms of your best of them out see if we wait 'til sixty six or sixty seven we get one hundred percent of what we were promised you turn it on sixty to get significantly less and a lot of cases only Seventy five percent of what we were promised that's a pretty big difference\nSo we have to ask ourselves and why do so many people turn on their benefit when they get so much less in collecting early\nNow we know just a couple of things are going on sometimes people just need the money chair\nAnd if you need the money and you're in a situation where there is some like mounting debts or some sort of crippling situation you find yourself in hey that might be the right thing to do no one's going to pass any judgment but we know Seventy percent Seventy percent of people turn on their benefits sixty two not all these people are doing it because they need the money\nA lot of people think you know what if it's not going to be there for me just turn and now I'm trying to get as much as I Can't\nYeah I mean just even in the last week there's news about how both Medicare and Social Security or like running insolvent way ahead of schedule and so we have a lot of people who turn on their benefits early 'cause they figure hey I'd better get mine while they're still money to be had or I Want to get grandfathered before they changed the rules\nBoth of which is kind of like executing on bad intel guys who's to say when or if you'd be grandfathered and who's also say that they're not going to fix these\nPrograms I mean Social Security by itself it has\nTo be fixed I mean people have been paying into it for decades in so many more people are depending on it so the way I look at it is a little bit optimistic I feel like the system will still be there albeit it's probably going to change a little bit so if we can count on it then to some extent\nWhat we have to do is really think about how when when we collect it because this matters because some people will and just we see this every day literally leave tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars on the table\nThere are so many different ways to collect in different options you have especially if you're married and there's a shocking number of people they don't even know I\nWrite and what I've now seen is I'm actually seeing the Social Security administration for the first time\nNow actively advocating for people to collect under methods that over the course of their lifetime would benefit them least so I'll give you an example of this we had some people come into the office\nAnd what's happening in their marital situation is that the wife is collecting her full benefits and the husband was collecting spousal off of her\nNow there's a pretty good strategy behind that when you collect spousal benefit you get half of what your spouse is entitled to Syria collecting less about your own benefit which is being delayed as a result is still growing and earning the eight percent annual credit for Social Security administration gives you for waiting\nTo get a check coming in and it's just not you're on then\nYeah you get a little bit less for a period of years to get the maximum amount on your own benefit for the rest of your life it's a great little strategy he got a letter from the Social Security administration that said hey\nYou know we see that you're taking a benefit on your spouse don't you know that you can be collecting so much more if you just shut that off and turned on your own benefit instead\nLet me guess ... ... and ... says it didn't say you get even more than that if you laid collecting just like you're doing now no that wasn't pointed out\nI mean while technically accurate or I mean and
