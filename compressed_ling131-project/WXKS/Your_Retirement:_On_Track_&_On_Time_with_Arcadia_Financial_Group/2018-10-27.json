when we went in for that last a loan application\nThat sometimes you wait that long sometimes it's a the weather changes and and it gets really cold you wonder how much are you know benefit was putting it down so I started looking at you know a couple of weeks in the November\nLooking at trying to long range forecast see what the weather's looking like where's the lawn at that point in any time like the second week or so you're good to go but I Would know again don't hesitate and if you don't have that bag of fertilizer or bags\nThat it takes to to feed your law and the second time or if you haven't found it at all you can still do this and that since second third week of November go get it this weekend\nGo buy it this weekend so you've got it in the garage or in the garden shed so you've got it available so you can get out whenever the you know the more weeks get a good day get out and put that down very very important so many times we just kinda\nYeah I'll Wait and see you know wait and see the next thing you know I'm In the holidays and I don't go to the garden center and I don't get the fertilizer and some places have put a lot of it away and so you know you just kind of skip it\nGo get your fertilizer this we can be ready to go for that final feeding when the time is right having the garage or in the garden shed waiting for you to go okay don't don't hesitate this is very very important I Can't stress enough um how important it is to feed that lawn\nTwice in the fall very very important but if you haven't done earlier I'm saying you could still do it in November that's better than nothing at All right and we'll get the doing whatever in the spring by the way other question came up about a\nBroadly weed killers and the grass we talked about you know October being a great months to do that so the question came up Ken I still spot treat weeds in my lawn\nAbsolutely look at the at the weed killers at work and cooler temperatures fertile loans weed free zone\nBon eyes we beat her alter our two that work at forty five degrees so those are two broadly if we killers that are great to use on those early weeds in the springtime and the late weeds in the fall because they work at forty five degrees\nNow if you've had a two or three good frost on talking good frost on your broadly weeds in the lawn\n[noise] it actually kind of slows down the process of the week killer action\nIt's nice to get it on their before we ever for us but we have had a couple of good for us and if that's the case you may see it not it take a little bit longer for it to work and you may not see it at all you say whatever they can kind of green going into the November it trust me it's working but it won't work as fast if it's been frosted but you still have time to do that\nSo if you want to spot treat get out their coverage you have to work in between rainfall or whatever but if the weather is right get out there and you still have time to do some spot treating if you don't get to it will look at it next spring and we'll see what we have to do at that point to union Kentucky we go build good morning\n\nUh Charles I'm Sorry Charles good morning got a question for you sure I got to have a one I heard\nYou get caught I caught the end of it about next thing or a soul and far between\nA that Gary and I talked about\nYeah that's been six months ago and I hadn't been able to get through the oh uh I I don't really hear that yeah I Know I'm not supposed to do that\nWas first though I was proceeding\nHe used it as a top dressing in a bear area in his lawn\nAnd it's you know at work the grass came up right away but the problem is it's such a light mix in all rooted in the top of that he couldn't keep it moist enough he wound up taking that out and then scratching the the politics or into the regular soil and ... is ceding it again but the point was don't you just use that regular potty soil\nAs that filler on top because it's often does you know it's not like a regular topsoil and he used the kind of like a filler and a point where you can't do that now to mix it in with the soil or to mix them with the soil and a flower bed\nOutstanding as a matter of fact I'll take a few parts that I don't know what I'm going to do with next year I'll dumped that in in a bed and just rake it in really well I like to use that for that and it's a good organic matter that back to it\nBut that was a bill area in the in the lawn where he was actually see okay well I\nJust caught the end of it yeah that's what I was going to do was I had a paper bag makes I just don't mix it in there and I thought maybe I should\nSo yeah it and then with the bad no problem mixing it in with the regular soil no problem but to use it as a filler problem\nOkay I got a ... problem okay ah the roots come up off the ground yes uh I got\nTwo trees after I don't know which one it is I've got a large you know like you were talking about mhm and also have a\nTwo foot diameter a water may mhm and er about thirty feet apart the water vapor will die down but the uh ... right\nSo you but you can't tell you can't tell which the surface roots are coming from\nNo uh I Would I put my money on the maple but yeah\nMore than likely it is and and typically you know it's not the best thing in the world to remove the surface roots the ... one or two off is okay and I think the maple would tolerate it with no problem than it is pretty good about that\nUh would tolerate that without much of an issue even the piano good old mature one you had one route that was causing an issue I'm sure you could pull that off and it would probably not affect the the big oil because well but I'm with you the the maples one thing the yolk is another\nYeah I've got to do that are\nActually three feet long and two inches in diameter that are all\nIn the ... [noise] yep yep yeah I you know and again if you think if you think it's to me I mean is three feet longer so and it's a far away from the tree [noise]\nWell it's it's close to the oak tree but I've seen maple trees\nI had a problem with the [noise] I was down to I was former [noise] that I was down checking the drain\nAnd like the guy as I said you've got roots that drain we started up the steps [noise] but I heard them explosion [noise]\nI mean it was like a cannon go at all\nWhat back down in the basement [noise]\nAnd [noise]\nUh like an elbow of a roof\nReally aren't interested I got I got to take a break but I'm I'm guessing that's probably from the maple [noise]\nUm if you're not sure I have a certified Irish ... can take a look at it but I'm if it is [noise] I wouldn't have any problem taken that thing out of this eight hundred and eighty three to five five here in the garden was\nGardening questions wrong has the answer to that one eight hundred eighty two to three calls and your even the guy with Ron Wilson [noise]\nMessaging ... burning your degree from one of the top business schools in the country might sound impossible to fit into your workload but wonder if there were a business degree that further your career in case you access to world renowned faculty\nLeaders and mentors all on your schedule one that opened doors to some of the most influential CEOs tech companies law firms entrepreneur and thought leaders and what if you could earn\nThat degree in his little less sixteen months one hundred percent on line\nTo find out more text trend to seven nine six four or five\nThat's T.

the pipe bomb sounds back that general hind bars\nMy own selfish purpose in it if I don't have a plan for all this stuff it just all goes apart and everybody yeah runs around like a chicken with their head cut off and you know it's funny I I can remember that back way back to my high school days when I wouldn't you know prepare for earnings answer tests or projects and always lean to the last\nMinute and I had such mounting stress in high school and one point I was just like you know what\nI just got to prepare better and I think that's when things start changing and I really have a passion for planning you know at vents and just\nEverything in our life because it does decrease stress a lot if I can see you know what is coming down the line how to prepare for it but also how to be flexible if you know a wrench gets thrown in the works as well\nI don't agree with that I think that you do get stressed out if things aren't\nOrganizing advance but you're also a people pleaser you like to see people be happy and having fun and so sometimes just winning it you know you can't really give people necessarily the best experience and\nYou know I Would say that we should take equal credit like in our own family when we plan like trips I Know that we're planning on going into Virginia and a couple of weeks we've never been we're really looking forward to it\nYou know we'll sit down together and we'll look at all the possibilities do we do a hotel or air BNB what city is do we want to hit you know what they would be the best way to go to the beach because of course the boys are going to demand a beach visit\nAnd we are really cure rating that trip like almost down to the minute so were scouting out where we are going to stay\nHow we're getting there where we're going to eat one of the sites that were going to say so literally we're looking like almost minute by minute what it is that we're going to do and that's just us because in the absence of that we might miss out on all these different sites and opportunities things to do\nAnd also the way that we pick here just as I Know that we would be stressed out if we just got on a plane and we were just like winging the entire\nExperience so a little plant and goes a long way and often what we like to remark upon is that I think a lot of people listening are very similar they liked to planet advance for especially the things in life that are fun whether it be a party or a trip [noise]\nThe thing is retirement it's almost like a twenty year vacation to twenty or party and the thing is I find a lot of people don't really have that planned in advance that I temporary that kind of maps out what they need to be doing both before during and afterwards in terms of making sure that they maximize their experience\nAnd also eliminate the stress and the worry you know sometimes people go half way they've got maybe some investments\nAnd maybe they've gotten themselves a whale maybe they've gotten themselves you know some insurance and things like that but it's at all tied together and are they looking at all the other ancillary issues like tax health care you know well the money last as long as I Do\nThe thing is I find in obviously why we are out here a spouse and the importance of uh of retirement planning is that really to have that kind of peace of mind to maximize what's possible\nIt really does require a plan and so today I think would be helpful is really parsing out the difference between what some people are doing it but they might call a plan but what an actual holistic financial plan looks like and really breaking that down to the sum of all of its individual parts were or what have you start as just consider what have you done this or\nIf you've got a four O. one K. if you've got some savings if you're reducing your debt if you've got good habits that's a start\nBut do you know how you're going to legally eliminate as much future attacks as possible what happens if you get sick or injured along the way do we have every single possible legal protection so it's a money stays inside the family if something happens to us and isn't gobbled up by those attorneys and the IRS\nThe idea that there is a real difference between a partial versus a complete plan\nAnd if you're suspecting that maybe your plan is incomplete it's probably about time that we had a chat\nGive us a call today for our next ten callers we've put specifically aside ten spots on her account or over the next two weeks where we can sit down for a complementary consultation and see what it is that we can do to complete that plan\nAnd give you some real clarity envision around your financial future so called today be one of the next ten callers dial eight eight eight Arcadia\nThat's eight eight eight to Seventy two twenty three forty two eight eight eight to Seventy two twenty three forty to\nOne of the best moves you can make for your future life in retirement is picking up the phone\nAnd calling that number today you'll gained so much value so much insight and confidence as you move closer to retirement if that retirement dates getting close for you you don't feel especially confident you are attached overwhelmed\nYou owe it to yourself to reach out to make ingest they'd be happy to meet with you just see where you are give you that honest evaluation it's eight eight eight Arcadia\nThe number again eight eight eight to Seventy two twenty three forty to another great way to meet my guess is at a dinner workshop and those are held all year long you can find out more at the Web site go to on\nTrack and on time dot com that's on track and on time dot com\nMy part of getting that plan for retirement it does involve building up our nest egg and we're all working toward that every day right we're trying to build a nest egg are asked that base to take this through retirement\nWhat we aiming for no what's is there a magic number is ... is a million dollars going to do it\nYeah I think a lot of people like to have a particular target and mind you I Need to save and have a million dollars or two million ... million cut it\nI'm looking at a static numbers probably the wrong approach because how much you're going to need to retire on depends on a lot of things you know if you're retiring at sixty\nVersus Seventy that's going to change how much you're going to need to have said if you have good genes in good health and you're going to have a longer than expected life expectancy well that changes things too\nAnd then probably the most important element the variable we really have to focus on is well what's the monthly budget\nHow much you're spending you know recently we had some people come into the office and we were talking about how much they needed in order to be happy and I was mentioning like you know do golf you take big wild and crazy trips and this woman looked at me and she said no Mike for me\nBeing happy as being outside sitting at my ... lounge having some sunshine right reading a book\nAnd I said well hey if that's the case and we don't need some big huge nest egg right because the things that you enjoy in life are pretty close to free\nAnd it's funny how you know clients run the gamut because we have other people that like I'm going to Europe from some travelling all over the place I have grandkids all over the country I'm going to go visit them so obviously those folks will have to have a larger number but\nOther people are just happy hanging on their back yard and that's a beautiful thing to him you know one versus the other one's not better ones not correct\nVersus the other it's really it comes down to what you see all the time might each situation is different each family's different\nYeah so I mean to really answer your original question is there a magic number I Would say no I'd say that there's more of like a magic formula to this we have to look at when you want to retire how long you think that retirement might be\nHow much do you think you're going to spend along the way and then we can back into as a result once we identify those things\nWhat it is that you need to have saved to supply that monthly income for the rest of your life and then I Would say we need to marry that to the right attitude because even getting there doesn't necessarily mean that you're in the right place mentally you know we had a visit in the office from a a woman she was a nurse and she just retired I\nWant to say about three or four years ago so she's been retired for some time\nAnd I asked her what her experience had been like over the last few years how his retirement and she kind of gave me a man that's been okay\nAnd so I said explains starts dialing into her situation she's basically just living off of her Social Security which is like twenty five hundred bucks a month now her rent is you know well she doesn't have rented a house and it's paid off so she spent a lot of expenses but she's also not doing a lot now with their free time\nAnd I looked at her finances and she had like one point two million dollars saved\nAnd I said well you're not touching any of this money and I found out just by kind of poking prodding that a lot of the influence in her life particularly some friends that she has there are so anxious about the future higher taxes and the Trump presidency and all this other stuff that they were basically coaching her not to spend the money\nSo I told her listen you've got the amount of money that you need and as far as we know you're not King Tut you're not going to be able to take all this money with you went to the afterlife\nSo I don't care if you spend it but if you're not going to spend it let's have a real talked about what this money will mean maybe one day to the people in your life that you care about the next generation maybe some kind of community cause or a charity or maybe instead we talk about using it for you what do you think and she was like oh honey I could use it for me\nBut the thing is we had to help her and not just understand the number Megan\nBecause she was already there but understand mentally that she was really in a position to start enjoying that number spending it and having fun and retirement [noise] see I think we can fool ourselves and believe that retirement planning is only about investments and rate of return and maximizing things\nAnd it certainly is to some extent but it's also about the right attitude understanding things\nGreat events to come meet my desk and the team\nFind out more about them their philosophy for retirement and generating retirement income making sure that you have that plan in place shared great meal with them as well go to on tracking on time dot\nCom we were talking about diversification and just I think you kind of let that fire under me to go clean my pantry when I get home [laughter]\nI don't envy the task but you feel better ones it's done do absolutely do and diversification it really is about doing that spring cleaning making sure what you have is serving you well that it isn't ... fired that it's\nIt's you don't have duplicates everything is working in harmony with ... with each other\nAnd I want to find out Mike from you when we're talking about diversification do we need to be aware of our tax strategy as we are diversifying yeah I think that taxes\nIs probably the most under explored item when it comes to retirement planning 'cause I Know a lot of advisors there's a lot of bravado here in this industry about who gets people the biggest rate of return what the best portfolios at the lowest price points and everyone focuses on returns I mean returns or sexy\nYou look like a just that last year twenty Seventeen and a lot of people made twelve Fifteen twenty percent rates of return that's what we talk about at those cocktail party\nWhat money's coming in to you\nBut how much of that you get to keep you know this reminds me a just used to watch that show parks and rec a lot and one of the characters Ron Swanson he's like\nHer margin right I mean governor [laughter] yeah he thinks the government so to get you and there was like a civic day or something world at like local school kids how to like chateau one of these municipal workers\nAnd ah so this kid following Ron Swanson around and he's like so I guess I've got a cheeks you teach you about taxes today huh how the government goes what did you bring for lunch and she does show some his sandwich a sandwich and we grab that out of her hand takes three a norm is bites and hands it back and he goes that's how taxation works [laughter]\nSo she's sitting there looking glass half of her sandwiches gone right\nAnd I like to think that a lot of people listening you know they actually have a similar type of experience in store for them in the future see they don't have a sandwich that they're holding onto there is some sort of a portfolio that they've got they get that statement in the mail from fidelity or vanguard their four one K. company they were like hey man look\nMy balance is just about as big as it's ever been and that is true for a lot of people because the market has done so well for so long so their statements say two hundred thousand five hundred thousand a million or more whatever it says\nBut sooner or later Ron Swanson gonna grab your portfolio take two or three bites and leave you with just a fraction of the difference of course we're not talking about Ron here we're talking about the IRS\nAnd we're not talking about sandwiches you're talking about you what we call that at our house the parents tax I mean these are for ice cream sundae is yesterday and mom and dad always get at least the first two or three bites that Sunday mhm he earned it has the gum or nearby though [laughter] good question\nI got to tell you I think a lot of people when you ask them where do you think taxes are going in their financial future\nThey guess that they are going up this country is in an outrageous amount of debt and just the last two weeks both Medicare and Social Security announced that those entitlement programs are running and solve meant a lot further ahead of schedule than they had planned for guys taxes are ... are going up or it's almost an inevitability\nAnd the thing is we're all just sitting there looking at our accounts wondering well\nWell is this money mind or what kind of bite is going to be taken out of this\nHow much are we just focusing strictly on returns and diversification and safety and feed\nWhile we're paying zero mind at all in terms of what we're going to be separated from in the way of tax I find that most people if they think about tax they only look backwards and I do it every April fifteenth may try to figure out how it is they can counter beans and save as much money as possible but what about the next ten years Twenty years\nHave you used every single Lou legal loophole in strategy shelter to make sure that when Ron Swanson the IRS comes around looking for is by\nThe ... bite that they take as as small as possible you either dumb that planning or you haven't and if you haven't it's time to come sit with us and our team see what it is that we can do to protect your heart or a sandwich or I mean money\nSo give us a call today that's

eight eight to Seventy two twenty three forty two we're talking about ways to be prepared for all of the curve balls that life throws your way especially in retirement the good news is\nLife does happen but we can plan for it Mike ingest are getting us great strategies today and\nYou know like I was thinking about your book and for our listeners who aren't familiar Mike as a book out just out this year it's called retire on rails of steel you cover a lot of these issues that pop up but also had a plan for them\nOne of the things you have to make sure you have buttoned up is your plan for Social Security this is really\nMight the cornerstone for a lot of people in their retirement plan isn't it yeah\nAnd I think it is somewhat under waited in a lot of people's minds in that well we can just go by the statistics the average American turns on their benefit at sixty two which is when the government has to give you the least\nThe least amount in terms of your vested amount see if we wait 'til sixty six or sixty seven we get one hundred percent of what we were promise you turn it on sixty to get significantly less than a lot of cases only Seventy five percent of what we were promised that's a pretty big\nDifference so we have to ask ourselves and why do so many people turn on their benefit when they get so much less and collecting early now we know just a couple of things are going on sometimes people just need the money chair\nAnd if you need the money and you're in a situation where there is somebody mounting debts or some sort of crippling situation you find yourself in hey that might be the right thing to do no one's going to pass any judgment but we know Seventy percent Seventy percent of people turn on their benefits sixty two not all these people are doing it because they need the money\nI think you know what if it's not going to be there for me just turn and now I'm trying to get as much as I Can't\nYeah I mean just even in the last week there's news about how both Medicare and Social Security or like running insolvent way ahead of schedule and so we have a lot of people who turn on their benefits early 'cause they figure hey I better get mine while they're still money to be had or I Want to get grandfathered before they change the rules [noise]\nBoth of which are is kind of like executing on bad intel guys who's to say when or if you'd be grandfathered and who's also say that they're not going to fix these programs I mean Social Security by itself it has\nTo be fixed I mean people have been paying into it for decades and so many more people are depending on it so the way I look at it is a little bit optimistic I feel like the system will still be there albeit it's probably going to change a little bit\nSo if we can count on it then to some extent what we have to do is really think about how when when we collected because this matters because some people will and just we see this every day literally leave tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars on the table\nThere are so many different ways to collect in different options you have especially if you're married and there's a shocking number of people they don't even know that\nRight and what I've now seen as I'm actually seeing the Social Security administration for the first time\nNow actively advocating for people to collect under methods that over the course of their lifetime would benefit them least so I'll give you an example of this we had some people come into the office and what's happening in their marital situation is that the wife is collecting her full benefits and the husband was collecting spousal off of her", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Your Retirement: On Track & On Time with Arcadia Financial Group", "city": "Newton",
