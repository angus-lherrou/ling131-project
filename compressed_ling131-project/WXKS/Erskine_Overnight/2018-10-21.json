some of these schools depending on the area of academia and does not\nYes well the academic job market is very bad and has been for a long time also the leftist biases gotten steadily worst to first went to graduate school in Nineteen Seventy so at the beginning it wasn't nearly as bad I didn't know what I was getting in for\nBut as I've stayed around it's gotten nearly every year I think it's a little worse\nKids I'm surprised that the trend has been just straight down because you know that doesn't happen very much in history [noise] usually you are you're making a mistake to think that things will go on exactly the way that they've been Abbott whatever trend there is will continue year after year to go in the same direction about the same pace\nBut left to be an academic has turned

by left us so this is an exponential occurrences that\nOh yes yes I mean you can tell from the fact that I went to graduate school in Nineteen Seventy that I'm getting on an IRS too and it's just a fact but today occasionally I Do run into conservatives who wants to go to graduate school and I don't tell them you kept\nTheir\nUniversity is well mostly colleges that will hire conservatives but I said do you realize what you're getting in for this is going to be really really are\nThere's a lot of hostility even if you make it\nThey're teaching any more of a big storm out say thing they certainly the what they need to do is to have some teaching of logic I remember and philosophy courses you learned uh all the different things about the logic that you went to the various\nAh ah people who talked about logic and how it was developed and how to think of logical and they don't learn that a more\nOf course it doesn't fit in the social the gender if you look at it logically socialism fails everywhere and gas has been their main products\nYeah you don't hear about that very much what you do hear everything even teaching Shakespeare or the American revolution you keep hearing that\nWestern civilization and America in particular evil that they oppressed people that there are intrinsically oppressive through all of the things that they do\nAnd you know all this\nComes straight from the university through schools of education down to high school and even grade school it all goes back to the university [noise]\nPeople are training themselves in high

didn't they didn't singled him out in our sort of way and you know that's really the place but a western civilization has been for quite a long time I don't think the medieval women early modern women door agent women felt oppressed\nAt least not in most societies here this is something that they've been told they have to feel because that race conscious about being walk\nWhen they couldn't boats I ah had marches for that they were given the right to vote when they have slavery we're we're one of the first countries to overcome slavery and do away with that we have been on the forefront of grabbing freedom\nTo people who had not had that before\nAnd the yes okay they had slavery back then\nBut it is gone and we were the ones to recognize than do away with that we've done a lot of positive things the other a lot of wrong but the time when the times came we corrected them we have to somebody has to give credit to the people for doing that\nWell if you go back far enough you're willing to find any but any civilization any country has some bad things in the past but if you emphasize so it was gonna say that it's bad this makes it an evil country than they were doing\nToo bad things you're taking only the bad and using it to judge said civilization and people would surely have really good at it in our case I think has overwhelmingly more good in it\nRight and the other thing you're doing is you're making history and literature and everything else just about moral life thing and\nA Shakespeare wasn't really making a moral statement when he wrote most of his plays he was trying to entertain and he was trying to reveal some things about a\nHuman being banded about all sorts of things I Love hatred down so on but the Shakespeare you can't really say Shakespeare was a conservative or liberal or a you certainly can't say was Marxist or\nAre you you could say here's an observer of the human condition nobody else\nAnd the good one right he didn't come with praise would be a well with these prejudices of how to look at everything that bat you should just divide everybody up into oppressors underground oppressing\nAnd that was the only thing that was interesting about the most people are primarily oppressors are oppressed wave band that is the most important fact about them\nAnd you know at almost everybody at some time or another has been treated unfairly or is treated other people unfairly but that isn't the most important fact about most of\nNo no and it is is the prevalence fact among the population as a whole that the population of all Americans are good decent people who want to treat everyone equal\nYes I think that's very fair that very true that is true of most people worldwide actually\nNow there are there are exceptions some people are just are just that way than where they've got all their presidents and we all have certain prejudices and some people really act on them and some people are extremely prejudice against us and the other\nAnd you just don't deal with people like that to the size of realize that they're just a little bit a little plug I'm also a ... square you know you realize that they're just not right that don't deal with it\nWell the most dangerous thing really is when you have this year the allergy this whole political mindset\nThat you have to seek out the oppressors and keep them out and you have to seek out be oppressed and give them favoritism look this is what happens in hiring professors this is what happens in Iran academic administrators today in fact if you were black\nOr female it don't take your oppressed\nYou're going to find just as much trouble getting a job as if you're a white male who feels that this whole idea of oppression and depressed isn't the right way to look at that besides the bay want people who share their world view and there are plenty of white males\nWho are forcing this world view will university administration is to be diversity faculties today\nFishery is ... is the the allergy that they want to make uniform\nHave arch against hiring white males if they're properly a book if they're properly that life according to their point of view but they all have to think alike\nAnd they're proud of the fact that they were deliberately excluding people who don't share their ideas\nSo and there does seem to be inclusion area and diverse they're becoming exclusionary and stressing uniformity exactly\nActually I've got you got students who are so concerned about stuff they they don't study that much of they're not learning that ... she got professors who are grading easier than they ever have before because after all you have to\nHelp the people and help these poor students as long as they are\nConcerned themselves diverse as long as they're preaching the same line that they're trying to put out then they'll give them good grades so has nothing to do as a course or the the difficulty of it or anything like that so people are being passed through who shouldn't be passed through\nAnd you've got a diversity which doesn't exist because it uh\nBecame exclusion and uniformity if he don't agree with what the professors say its own agree with who wants to the rest of the children students did in the school or say then you're just a you are excluded\nJust because of that and they're not taught logic I still believe logic is one of the keys that needs to be taught\nA lot of people that they do not understand logic and they don't understand civics look into the lady who's running in New York and she said oh\nWell she said what I get it in a good luck to and as soon as I'm sworn in I'll be able to sign bills and things that I'm thinking no you ... you are a little like the president's here just a representative how bad it is\nIs that a vigorous for the fact that you're right it would be good to teach more logic but they but these people don't want to in Europe they aren't really interested in logic and they aren't really address cause and effect [noise]\nAh they example that is very much a live around here in St Louis University in St Louis university which is very near to Ferguson, Missouri where I Am is\nThe case of Michael Brown who was an aide shot and it was in the armed but uh he was shot because he was trying to take away the gun or the police officer who shot him and if he thinks he will just suddenly become armed and he was obviously trying to kill that police officer\nAnd literally and the Arabs are hands up don't shoot narrative was all falls that's completely\nSo how how well abolishing it makes things worse well I have to take a short break and then after that uh I Know you've got an answer to it because he said that they could make things worse you know years and years and\nThen your case I think it's a good thing otherwise they get rid of it because you're a conservative ... [noise]\nI don't go getting your nose in a bunch her skin we'll be right back\nIt's not news that people's health is declining each year with fast food junk food GMOs artificial flavoring in more it's

reforming higher education Dr Warren ... girls this is a book from the inside for somebody who normally wouldn't be writing a book like this but he has the courage to come out and say what's wrong with the university system and how it can be reformed\nBut he doesn't believe in abolishing tenure please explain sir\nWell Terry is a way of protecting professors\nBasically against miners graders by how\nWe have a University in which there are about as many administrators are professors think about back I mean it was supposed to be doing the job of research and teaching and the administrators are supposed to make it easier for them but they are\nThey are the people who are running but yeah the allergies most controversies they love to be able to fire even more\nProfessors that as a matter of fact we view than here with his use\nOf a tenured adjunct professors but majority of faculty are not tenured anyway I Know they fired me long span divided that pet or\nOne of them they were having these are people I Know you're not ... do a propaganda on the line that they want a A R soon as you know too much [laughter]\nWell there's that too but anyway no this is this is something\nAbolishing tender would not help and I don't see why people think that if you have bad hiring I'd like to improve hiring very much\nA bat abolishing tenor would somehow improve things I don't think of a bad professors be hired I think we're going to independence professors would be fired him bats that's really a serious\nProblem so what can be done how can they give them to be more open minded and have more true\nTrue autos diversity on college campuses where people can actually exchange thoughts and people can feel free to express their own conservative opinion if they want and maybe have a dialogue dollar hatred of throwing rocks at each other\nNot of the answer to our people wearing the black but the truth dialogue that's what we need in this country\nWell I have a couple more proposals that would help one is a national board to look good accuracy and research because there was a great deal of research today that is done that people get tenure for that is either plagiarized or just plain wrong and fraudulent\nAnd there is no way there's no national board there is a national board to study that in science there's been a natural sciences\nThere saying here around here it

separately and Hillary you lost thirty of the fifty states\nThan we are not a democracy we are a constitutional ripped off like there is a difference I don't think this is to challenge the national popular vote gave me an electoral votes to whoever wins the popular vote and saved or they give it was challenged the Supreme Court I think it would lose\nIt depends on who was appointed the Supreme Court and that's of course one of the things\nThat the left is now screaming about for example they're saying oh well Kavanaugh was finally named cream colored by the Senate but he was elected to do so only by senators represent forty four percent of the national population\nThere were senators from small states not from big wouldn't and therefore that really shouldn't count that isn't in the election in fact for of our current nine Supreme Court justices were selected by a senator who represent a minority of the population\nBut the whole southern folk song the confirmation so every senator\nThere's a right to vote on the confirmation south forty four percent is already forty four\nPercent voted for Kavanaugh right which means that was fifty six percent voted against Kavanaugh\nPopulation wise\nPopulation wise that that's their argument\nAnd this is is part of what they are I mean for example\nRight now David Ferris of Washington University in Chicago decided Franklin Roosevelt type is something that should be taken up as he proposed in his book it's time to fight\nDirty out Democrats can build a lasting majority in American politics [laughter] ah he says Franklin Roosevelt was right to try to pack the Supreme Court\nBack in Nineteen thirty seven\nNow his idea that they had to send to people to bring corn to I guess if you're not happy with the way it is\nA Roosevelt proposed adding as ... as many as six to eight or more tests to pray and record so or or baking the total sixteen or more I there's nothing in the constitution that says how many justices there are in the Supreme Court and so ah he's arguing that have variable number\nAnd each party who is this dominant you try to pack the court to a lead up to a number that favors them and their ideology which of course we don't have a Supreme Court with more members of Congress in it you know that would make for a real mess by but see that's the point the Democrats\nDo not understand the Supreme Court was supposed to be nearly a legal body that judge to the law that had been an actor by Congress and signed by the president\nBecause Democrats for fifty years now have you noticed

does does on Fox television they had a relative all Pocahontas with actual relatives that she was not mad that a Trump called her Pocahontas but she was very upset with one of those books warn that dog\nThey had lost another group of people they have lost the indigenous people may have lost the Indians because of this the Democratic party has really alienated these people plus the fact\nThat she got all of these uh money isn't everything else from Harvard because she was considered part of the diversity because she was considered part Indian they didn't even check is asking just took a word for it she's not on the rolls anywhere and looks like she's one\nOne thousand twenty fours part Indian less practically any body I'm In the United states or\nFrom at least one press report was being paid five hundred thousand dollars a year for having taken a a seat on the faculty there was supposed to be granted to a real Native American\nRight in other words he was stealing altogether she stole more than five million dollars in income that should have gone to Native Americans he hasn't offered to pay it back to suppose Elizabeth Warren\nActually were an honest person and this was just an honest mistake what would have happened different from what we've seen in recent days number one\nElizabeth Warren would have said I have decided\nTo write this raw to clarify anything let the chips fall where they may I Want to pick the most famous or reputable person or have expert pick that person to do a DNA test on me\nAnd then we will find out together what the test show to do that she held the test in secret\nShe held the test in secret not using a standard DNA researcher using our or Stanford academic it genetics researcher who just happened to be an ideological comrades of hers right\nWas never going to issue for the report of what her DNA was unless it could be twisted bent to make her appear to be an NBA which was rather do the U.S because they were not even testing her against the DNA of American indian tribes\nNo there to listen\nTo us any against tribes in Mexico and Colombia and in Peru rise to the United states\nAnd what did they find they found that oh she could only be one one thousand and twenty fours\nIndia [laughter] about how much is that that that is about half as much as the average American of European ancestry in other words the average white American right so she's only half as much\nIn the end as Joe blow a who you know run into a bar every night\nShe does not have any meaningful claimed to be Native American at all she has lied about it all this time they presented her evidence that totally wrecked unfair for them to begin with\nTo try to have her calmer as the Boston Globe put out a favorable article or as the only documented

thousand twenty fourth Indian\nRights to fill the Boston Globe ... published not one but two retractions\nAnd then the main ... we've seen Elizabeth Warren behave in an orderly dishonest disreputable way I mean if anything she should if he's even\nEven as a tiny trace of decency your humanity about her she would resign from the Senate today as a disgrace who deserve no public honor our recognition or or power at all\nI think you're watching the identity politics of the Democratic party and his final throes\nI Would hope so because Harvard University not only misrepresented Elizabeth Warren glorified itself by doing so not only cheated millions of Native Americans who could have held that professorship he stole but Harvard University\nWe now find has followed a longstanding policy of discrimination against Asians\nAmericans why because if seats were given at Harvard based on merit Asian Americans would hold about half of all the students seats at Harvard\nThere that much better scores that intelligence and so on\nAnd I would say I believe in meritocracy if they're that good it they should be the ones in these higher positions Harvard of course it's not a public university it's a private university but it has shown an absolutely outrageous and racist but tendency here\nBoasting of the fact that it uh it is going to select people not based on merit not based on a chief\nBut their intelligence but based on entirely arbitrary standards that we're going to favor one racial group over another\nNow wasn't Elizabeth Warren part of the consumer financial Protection Bureau creator\nOf it she was the one who found it at first she was the one who developed the idea that what made the idea of the CSP be so frightening thing\nIs that it was not like other bureaucracies every other bureaucracy in the federal government uh depends on Congress to supply at the funding and that means Congress had control of the purse strings over to remember\nThe very essence of democracy itself began with the British Parliament and the British Parliament held the purse strings over the money that came could spend\nOr couldn't quiet democracy took root now what the Elizabeth Warren wanted was to create a bureaucracy with all the power of a government agency all the abusive power but with none of the control of the people that Congress would provide\nWho pays for was Federal Reserve really they're paying for\nThe Federal Reserve board which is kind of quasi governmental it's half private banks at a half a\nWell let's see if the if the open market committee of the fed is oh fairly class as a federal entity but most of the rest of the fed is considered private\nAnd it was money from those private entities that basically we're funding the CFPB ...\nSo it was

national socialist from Germany throw them into the same thing\nWhat's really interesting to me as you've got groups like as far as I pass as as they are the fastest so anything that they're saying that the conservatives are doing they're already doing it so you can look at what they're calling the conservatives and see what they're doing\nWell and the FAA began in Europe as a Marxist

Catholic Church is becoming endemic in this country I had no idea that it wasn't as bad as that you do you work for\nIt it's a huge problem or skin in fact I'm a Catholic or the case or Twenty years ago or so involving\nSeven pedophile priest and one archdiocese of the Catholic Church in my job as soon as there was a novel an outcry and of course that has to be you know multiple children already before there was an outcry they lose the previous to or even core parish\nAnd I think they had moved on four or five times before somebody was able to try to hold the ... the church itself accountable for their criminal conduct and there's still cover up after cover up of all of that throughout the Catholic Church is absolutely hideous\nBut he had a previous to Mexico who had aids who ended up giving forty children of thirty children aids that when they asked the poll about they said well I'm not here to judge his jokes from is going to come from God\nWell I'm Sorry but the parents there were very very upset as they are here I have nothing against the Catholic Church but I have some major problems about them allowing this to go on right under their eyes and it's happening all over the country and you're not hearing reality\nYeah it's called conspiracy and aiding and abetting those crimes which are crimes themselves\nAnd there's absolutely no excuse\nFor it I mean pretty simply should not be alone with\nAny child should always be at least another one lung presence parents present it there's just no ray or a Catholic priest to be alone or what the child anymore they cannot be trusted were at large to do that and the good ones wouldn't want to be\nIn those circumstances where they might be charged anyway so it really seems to me like like a polygraph all the current priest against him anybody has brought any charges\nTrump kid them criminally as they need to be because there's no other way to fix that somebody that that is too sick to say except by God and he's going to have to deal with that when they die because not and then when they are alive\nAnd pedophilia is not sure about crime and this isn't something these people have other hardwired to be sick but the thing that sort of the city was as if somebody is abused as a child a lot of times they become abusers as adults it ... if\nIf the cycle isn't broken and that's all they know so that's what they continued to perpetrate that's why if and pedophiles never salt just one child they all they do it to multiple children so it's something that grows exponentially if the cycle isn't broken\nNow when you have false accusations doesn't that really\nHurt somebody from coming forward when they see the somebody like Mrs Ford's who didn't know where it happened did know when that happened in reporting for thirty six years I mean the whole thing and then they had the other lady who was the ten different sexual\nA encounters or was there for a man to the laws and she says the while I saw him standing next to the punch bowl I mean some of these were just sort of ludicrous doesn't that affect somebody who has a real case from coming forward\nDoes false claims hurt absolutely everyone because the person who's falsely accused is almost all but destroyed\nThe grocery store his reputation worse they go\nWell fortunately I think most people in the country realized that that was a false claim and he's\nHeld in very high regard by the federal judiciary\nSo I yeah I don't think it's going to have a long standing effect on him although you know like Clarence Thomas de ... there and they always be
