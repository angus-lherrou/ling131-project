not well up up all my favorites do good you know I Would love to you\nBurn them isn't it interesting how\nThis morning the FBI investigation and all of that and only\nOne Democrat only one Democrat voted for Kavanaugh now the the after the FBI investigation the Susan Collins said while the most beautiful eloquence impassioned speeches I've ever heard even Jeff Flake went along with it but only one Democrat voted for\nMr Kavanaugh's arrest all heroes aren't qualified is this is this the way that we\nCreate the civility of is the way we create ... partner of bipartisanship but in the country where both sides can get along when they don't even listen they have their minds made up growing in Schumer had before they even even have a first ring of the gavel by Mr Grassley he already has mind made up\nThis is what we've got this this is Dan\nI'm Chuck Schumer is that in that time interview\nThat big cars there were accusations against judge Kavanaugh he should have quit\nFor what he said\nHe was by a better these days are there any time it doesn't mean you're guilty Renee thing in this country does or maybe it does ...\nOr ... according to Schumer the fact that somebody accused him of doing it he should be used as though\nThat was the point I was going to make it the last segment is that the Democrats have missed playbook and the play was when you when you're president and you have an opportunity to nominate somebody if we don't like that we're going to go after them and force them to recuse himself from the nomination\nAnd Trump brought out but no he said he supported him\nWhen he went he did all the office visit you went through the thirty tutor thirty six hours of eerie and then after the hearing was over I think polls out the letter that she's dead now for six weeks desert certainly\nTo the Justice Department to the FBI right to investigate full well knowing that the FBI can investigate the artists dot their jurisdiction and that's why they do there's no crime\nNo later on they it was the same charges even all state charges thirty six years old even though there's she never brought age charges the courts and marijuana\nShould broaden their charges anywhere but the point being is that the whole idea of of all of the stuff was to get Carolyn on to resign\nBefore they got to the testimony the whole reason why Ford and they were attorneys postpone the hearing for a week was to allow the Democratic operatives to try and create enough stuff that would cause capital to recuse himself\nAnd he chose not to and when they were not prepared ... masterful thing the night before he was give his testimony\nIn the subsequent theory he put out a\nA a an outline of what he was he was going to talk about the next morning right\nWhen it was very a low key and a warning came out with guns blazing the Democrats didn't know what to do because he didn't follow his own script from the night before\n... when he knows why did the interview on Fox television right mhm yeah that\nThat I was very low key but if you're being a tax away he was being attacked what you said back then no you wouldn't sit back and this was a gift in his entire reputation everything is does the entire life they went after his family they went after his wife's they went after his daughters they went after him\nI mean he had to fight at that point he really had to he was a cab that corner\nYes he has a fight and and the fact that he did was a foreign to the Democrats because he wasn't exposed to\nAnd so when when you hear the ridiculous questions that the senators were asking and how he responded there's a piece a section in the piece that I I I told you about that I wrote for Newsmax right about that talks about the comments from John Paul Stevens the retired\nJustice of the super ... saw that ... says so what am I calling to have that they used to anger by Capitol I was talking about his anger and then they used as a reason to keep your mouth judicial temperament who wouldn't be angry\nWhen John when John Paul does suggest that the demeanor of Kavanaugh when he was defending is is family and his reputation was not appropriate for Supreme Court judge\nCry I knew with them I knew at the moment that he was he was a not being coherent or logical reasonable and I'm Glad he's not on the court\nBecause what goes on to say how many days did it take for John Paul Stevens to be confirmed to the Supreme Court\nNineteen was\nIn Nineteen Nineteen day Nineteen days to get him confirmed to the Supreme Court from the time and he was nominated to the dining\nChair Nineteen days right look how much time judge Kavanaugh trying to get to see the the challenge or skin is again I under I understand what the Democrats for trying to do but they made a huge mistake they made a bunch of us that\nThey made a mistake because he was replacing\nJustice Kennedy and\nSeventy five percent of the time Kennedy voted with the conservative twenty five percent\nHe voted with the liberals ... at the farm the ranch the cows the house the barn tractors and everything else on trying to stop it but they did not what the what they now find themselves in a five four position and they've got an agent in\nThe mail Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg okay stay awake in state of the union addresses no matter how much applause or a\nBad [laughter]\nShe ... she ... she wouldn't be able to stay on the court through Donald Trump's first term\nWhich says that she believes that it that she was hoping that Donald Trump doesn't get reelected but if he gets re elected she is not going to be able to serve so he's going to now make another appointment and and again I'm Talking about something that nobody else is talking about he's going to make two appointments\nAnd the voting where do you mean to I Believe what's going to happen is that that if she\nDoesn't die by the end of the time she says he finishes\nHis first time she will probably retire from the court and that means that she's going to replace he's going to be replaced\nIn order to make the court that liberal court diminish and we now have to replace one of the three or four liberals we're now going to have a situation where her replacement will be made and one person is needed\nI fully expect Justice Thomas to retire rise hard\nBy Justice Thomas retiring at a younger more conservative judge being appointed to the court the power of the great on the court\nWith six to three will be for many decades\nNow the next talk that they're doing they want to pack the court there while the extended by two new people\nGraham will be the new chairman of the Judiciary Committee and he said\nOn the air [noise] I'm going to get to the bottom of this to who leads the letter\nIt's all ...

examples\nRoe versus Wade and gay marriage\n[noise] know congressman or senator\nEver sat down and look at him and bill no president ever signed that bill\nLegalizing gay marriage the definition of marriage or world versus Wade so the American people as it relates to roe versus Wade never had a boy\nIn making that decision was made by the court the court legislating from the bench\nAnd the court shouldn't be legislating from the bench and it's the American people have more of a say\nIn what was going on in this country we wouldn't have less division I look at it from the standpoint and say when you take away from the people\nThe power to make a decision on the ballot and through the electoral election process you are going to create divisions and that's exactly what happened here and it's been happening since roe versus Wade\nWhen the courts became activists and began to write\nThe law not interpret the law that changed and that caused a separation in our country where people believe that the court shouldn't be doing it but yet are just getting thinking about this\nFive justice is five justices on the Supreme Court\nTook it upon themselves to decide\nWhat the definition of marriage is going to be going over\nThere to do that and also on the abortion issue lived right is that people have no say no representatives or anything else is the only way Democrats previous just

[noise]\nIraq Iraq but what\nI like to do when people have an idea they add something that unproven 'cause a lot of people come up with ideas that are unproven\nDaily somebody else had the idea that they weren't able to prove it\nLike the business model work or there wasn't an end in the marketplace right thing that we have to figure out building a business and I like getting back to me a movie with Rodney Dangerfield do you remember back to school oh\nYes of course right okay\nLike I did and I uh dated a Caucasian entrepreneurship down at the University of Arizona and it didn't didn't show up for class one day they had to watch and they had to research\nAnd writing a paper on\nThe movie and they had to answer the questions that I made sure I go there like questions that they weren't on the Internet the answer and one of the things that I asked about the collapse that Rodney Dangerfield of taking when the one business professor that he was competing against for the affections of this woman said that\nHe said he said that the guy when you wouldn't go\nBuild a factory in by landing get at least it's easy to get anybody wants to buy your right you gotta find that there's demand in the marketplace\nFor learning rather go the market research before you start out because you know you're talking about when something we are going to make some sense on cell walls or maybe you like it but nobody else will you'd probably do some research on a bill down to the actual with research to a large degree\nTo people is a good idea or go to others because today people like the idea the ... the probably already but I'm tried and failed\nAnd you know why here on the right track because here's the deal like oh you're making your ads and say it's a great idea and let's say he he wanted retail you're gotta get a hundred bucks they okay give me a hundred bucks\nAnd they're like no I don't want to buy it like that you just told me is a great again it must be good for you don't get me a hundred dollars a ride back then they will spend the money that\nShe didn't know that watch them make your money and time for what you need to do it by the person didn't I didn't like it wouldn't you buy\nAnd find out why especially if they have that need it you can identify somebody with the need but they're not to you and your product they teach you what\nYour validation you're on the right path\nBut if you don't have enough customers he's still not be on the right time might be more information out there and you're not aware of I used to work for a venture capitalists they might want to him as a matter of fact I'm On my way to go with him we and what I worked for him\nMy job was to to make it work my job was to break it funny to them straight ahead then he gets all excited about something\nWas wrong more than make much when you brought out what's wrong with it then you can I ever to appeal to more people you'll see that one was obstacle you haven't selling and whatever your winter selling\nSo if they can be again how do you speak to an end to end the war worth it and that's why\nIt takes time to solve that problem of why it's not working because research and development ... might be to cash for him again you know they're just like not technology might not be a point where you needed to be to be able to accomplish whatever it is especially if it's something like a man with the actual\nYou know ... hours purpose for a journey\nIs to find out what can go wrong if they're looking at everything negative now to me and surveys and are you more to get anything done because every single right\nBack to the matter is you want them to tell you what can go wrong as you can ... and see if it's worth the gamble because they're very good ... problems really are they going to work for a minute what part of a dark cloud and the beautiful blue sky bar this\nYou're down to yourself is worth the risk or is it worth the risk and so that's really what you're looking for somebody to negative boy look at the news I welcome I changed it to where it would be better not to the negatives right\nOn his gives you a different perspective there was a yes or you don't want us men around during the year [noise]\nAnd you know and and you you would think you need so many\nCompanies especially once you hit a level of states that that was black and they can't get burned me get everybody's at themselves on the back five and good job but everybody believes same thing you can actually have value\nPeople freak out when I say that but there's value in conflict\nAs as long as it is there's criticism of this criticism is a\nConstruct there's the truck they have to be very very careful and constructive\nCriticism and destructive for you on the movie struck the prison system dumps rather [noise] yeah\nYeah and he gave me something of value an ad hominem attack because you don't like that where the color of my hair why I'm doing right by political affiliation that's not held yeah so we want an area of feedback nonjudgmental button valuable\nYou know like you know I I don't care what he looked like I care what value you bring to the table because\nNow I'm going to be able to determine what my next course of action is and I only I and in fact the decision maker based on the reality of the information I have no doubt about that quantity like quality\nThat's the beauty of the Internet because nobody has to work after you don't have to necessarily be a people person you can work behind the scenes and do wonderful and build a heck\nOf a good business without ever if so if you're not a people person and your business in my business you've got to be people people have to be people versus have to deal with people and that's a good thing but today a law that kids are not people\nOriented but they are ... oriented so you can do is if you're careful on the Internet and they bought it doesn't matter if you're a male female black white doesn't matter people have all sorts of presidents this Bill Maher for about a better product [noise]\nYeah and you know and\nHe got a really good point yeah the younger generation because they should only add technology I
