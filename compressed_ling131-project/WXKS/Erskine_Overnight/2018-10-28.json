LA\nWas inside paradox room during the twenty minutes shooting he admits that tells me Bernard yeah he admits to being inside the room during the shooting has anybody really questioned him [laughter]\n[noise] um well he claims that the FBI called them and now you know I Will just tell you what blows my mind as dumb as happy I think it's not common practice to call a uh somebody who claims to have stayed in the room\nOf the guy who just conducted the largest mass shooting at the United states and call him on the phone and ask him questions\nNow do you want to give you all take him over the corner and you are but sit down whether they've been the way these tell the truth or the other than what he knows you've got to get every bit of information who are just shooting that's ever occurred in this country\nThat's right and they've got a guy who ah we can put\nA in places like in Albuquerque New Mexico in a restaurant owned by a guy who's going to watch less tied to a likely tied to ISIS the Islamic state meeting\nA in a hotel room but immediately after the shooting\nWith a group of people from an area in Mexico wow we've hired ISIS activity and at a minimum of these things raise the question\nAs to uh explain herself\nUkraine on social media you were in the room that pattern goes in you by yourself on the thirty second floor of the Mandalay Bay which is good for the shooter was gone\nWild is shooting ones going on you lied about your whereabouts because we know where you were shut your hiring under Bush for three and a half hours\nWhen we have you uh we do you or elsewhere\nThese are questions that you may need to be asked a wire wire July well why were you in these places where these people and a year from Australia and the only other people that claims they attack besides ISIS four times was one time there was a post\nAh that Australian antifa claimed the attack well oddly enough Brian Hi just from Australia he's a he's a last winter\nAnd it is not a far stretch to think that he and his anti for ties to the worst case scenario is the Las Vegas shooting attack were first joint ISIS antifa attack on us soil\nBut at a minimum wage only targeted investigation based on the evidence\nShould have been ISIS because they actually claimed it um and they claimed it in a way that they've never claimed an attack in the west has it turned out to be that way now you got to be scratching their heads [noise]\nUm yeah so\nThere's a there's a a support group on that same play with everything else we were just talking about because that's a massive information operation that all the evidence points towards the Islamic state conductor this attack\nAnd yet these guys have been able to convince us that uh it's just some old guy and they share for them the idea that we have no idea why did it\nRight answers right in front of you so are you that stupid or is there something\nElse going on I mean they may be that stupid I won't take that off the table but might be something else\n... yard too they kept changing the bottom line now did they know what happened boom boom boom out they get their guns up there the whole thing and then

things that's been a driving force tire western world in western civilization\nAnd America's people we're proud of America and here's an hang on just cut to the chase and that's that's\nThe Republican Party and it's not the only two parties but there's a big win the Republican Party is filled with people in this country and appreciate the constitution but Democrats\nHave built a party now they changed it to be a party of people do this white even hate America and they don't like the Constitution's\nNow if you'll let me I'll tell you I just I get a robocall I didn't do a lot of the robocalls

them do I mean he was like\nShe because she has to shaded hatred for men\nSo she's going to have anything against women women it has to be ...\nHas to be that way and I didn't talk about this for years I used to talk about our my radio show that they were setting up for years for a century straight white man to be the pressure of all\nThe way people and people said now they're crazy they would never do that I'd say you're not seeing that for what it is today those people were coming to me and they're educated people doctors lawyers and they're saying do you rewrite how come I see it\nAnd that gives you more work and it was happening all around you that was a member in America and and I'm not seeing white men are cool wine and don't think they're cool if it weren't for white and we wouldn't have gotten gotten with eliminating racism and sexism but blacks probably would not have done it\nIt does look like anything minorities would\nWe are all equal that is that there should be
