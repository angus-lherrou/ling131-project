based on people not finance as\nAnd to get that you have to have a credit policy which is not determined by the ... largest money center banks in the world is not ... the whole response to the September two thousand eight crash\nWas to bailout speculators to allow them to continue trading worthless than actual paper and\nAt the same time flood them with with a funny money\nTo allow them to keep the trading going in the meantime uh the entrepreneurial sector especially\nIn manufacturing and construction then in a research and development at no access to credit\nTo banks that was the low end of them were cut off from credit by the Federal Reserve which said that the future depends on the solvency of a bunch of bankrupt banks so the whole thing was done wrong in two thousand eight\nA and remember it was it was Obama and John McCain who both were running for president\nWho sat down with Bush and Paulson and the end of September two thousand aid and signed on to the bailout and the Dodd Frank bill was designed to facilitate a a I was a cover story that they were doing something about the causes of the crash in fact they were continuing to pump money into the crash\nOne thing Americans should know is the Dodd Frank has within that requirement than in bank resolution cases that is when a bank goes bankrupt they\nThe access to the deposits of their depositors\nRight why don't you don't end up back us no longer years it belongs to the bags that they have access to your money\nAnd that's US law under this Dodd Frank bill and and that's what the fed is going to enforce the Federal Reserve so under that system they're going to continue to run a funny money operation even while they're putting the squeeze on corporations that have stayed in business by issuing joke that\nAnd when that the uh but that that comes do which is happening now I think there's something uh in the range of two hundred billion dollars of corporate bond that\nThat comes due in the beginning of two thousand Nineteen ... where are they going to get that money they can borrow it there's no one lending to them it means we're gonna chain reaction default in the corporate sector which will then spread into the consumer sector\nOver the next five years one point five trillion godfather natural corporate profits were mature each year has some companies struggle very pay defaults the most likely will rise out there most of that has a lot of it is in derivatives\nTell me what exactly how to reverse the ... is from what I gather it's just pure gambling with our money\nWell it's it's a the the greatest swindle effort it's called financial innovation\nWhich\nThey call and if a bet on a bad\nThat you issue a financial instrument like a mortgage backed securities a form of derivative\nThat depends on something that has no underlying value the real underlying value of the mortgage is someone who has a job who can pay a mortgage right when you secure a ties mortgages that as you start betting on whether or not people pay their mortgage\nAnd then you get something called swaps where you get insurance on whether or not someone is going to pay off a mortgage that will keep the derivative afloat so this is a casino or economy\nAnd then what should have happened is the Glass Steagall should've been reintroduced in two thousand eight which would have meant no bailout for these big banks and would have meant they had to write down or write off their bad\nAnd they would eat the losses not the taxpayers not the future or in government
