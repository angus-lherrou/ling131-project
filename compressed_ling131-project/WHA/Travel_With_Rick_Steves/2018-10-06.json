Alexander Hall is an investigative reporter and she first heard the story when she was working on a pro public a project called documenting hate [noise]\nWe're looking for hate groups in Wisconsin my boss told me about the story the headline was Madison police investigating possible ambush of proud boy by anti fascist and I thought were the Proud Boys\n\nYou know they seem really pissed off and irritated about woke culture and the PC culture that they feel like\nThey have to apologize for being guys all the time and so what the Proud Boys are about is not happy and apologize for being a man's man\nAnd they want to return to that\n\nWe politically if you had to nail us on the spectrum I Would say Ninety five percent of us land on the new right they're socially liberal fiscally conservative they don't really care if you're gay or anything like that\nBut they think the tradition has some value in this in the you know we've thrown up the baby with the bathwater quite literally and uh you know with these women are letting their ovaries dry up for some stupid career in the logging [noise] how old are you\nTwenty nine\nSo you you're right there you go to stop dating comedians and musicians and start thinking seriously about your mate [noise] yeah\n[noise] well it seems like he makes a giant right turn right there he's talking about libertarian politics and suddenly he's asking you whether you're planning on having babies I think that's kind of his and I'm\nLike feminism is obsolete\nIt definitely had a a place a woman needed to vote needed to drive but the pendulum has swung way past that so I Would say feminism was done and maybe Nineteen Seventy nine\nAnd since then it's just been woman inventing problems in lying like saying one in four women will be sexually assaulted or raped in college or saying that women earn less than men\nDo you think that has to sticks about sexual assault in the wage gap is just that it's not true\nWell I don't think you've looked it up if you think they are\nAnd that makes me think why do you care which makes me think you don't care which makes me think you need to find a man you need to focus on creating an shaping lives because you don't sound like a tiny percentage that we'd better off in the workforce I think you'd make a great mom you're clearly curious\nI don't even know what to say about that\n[laughter] what did you think\nI thought it was a distraction I thought it was strange that he was making it personal want to be curious about the quality of the schools your kids or\nIf you look on line I feel like a lot of the Proud Boys blog posts that they write are pretty offenses scene borderline angry at women yeah\nAbout feminine and\n[noise]\nI just think it's [noise]\nIt's taken so much away from the traditional family\nThat is kind of contributed to the degradation of\nThe American family as a whole in\nSeeming to be anti [noise]\nKnow they always had these means\nWriter like platinum blonde nag a hat super sexy looking twenty something rolled girl and then on the last this overweight woman with green hair all tied it up with like a pita shirt\nAnd it says which would you prefer basically it's kind of like you are you with ... with Bernie make the choice what kind of girls you want to hook\nUp with men and women are physiologically created different\nBecause of their physiological bio chemical makeup men and women are predisposed to gravitate towards different fields\nYou think that I Do think that's the case absolutely to the field that when a health\nCare for one I think nursing for one that that's one teachers early childhood education in\nEngineering fields math fields\nAre you saying that like men are better than no no\nMy little sisters of biomedical engineer she's great\nThey have a lot of ideas about where winning would be happy as\nAt home versus in the workplace\n... are looked down upon like they're not doing enough when\nReally their shaping lives and what's more important than that [noise]\nAnd what do you think about women [noise]\nThey were very cautious about hey you don't want to be a housewife that's cool with us for the housewives you want to be housewives don't look down on it personally\nLove the idea of my wife's the reason I ...

DUIs and so the parents focus on the DUIs and we don't focus on the hurt and the pain that is leading to the to the DUI the questions that are being asked\nAnd we have things for example like you know we have I think it's six officers in federal offices of women\nEven it even though men die sooner if we consider ourselves progressive and liberal we need to see the pain of men as well as women and boys as well as girls and that's our that's our next evolutionary\nMan [noise] Florence arrow is often called the father demands on any route the classic man now power and that was the awesome [noise]\n\nYou know boys started getting messages about what it means to be mom [noise]\nYoung [noise] um\nSometimes really young\nUncle told me when I was seven years old you're the man of the house you got to take care of your mother and your sister and your baby brother like at seven I just want to go play and he told me that I was like what does that mean\nThis is a shanty branch he's a high school teacher and mentor in Oakland, California and when he first started teaching he noticed that a lot of supplies at his school we're kinda checked out they weren't going to class they weren't doing their work and the majority of them weren't graduating\nSo shocked he did something that seemed at first pretty simple he started an after school club for boys\nAnd in that club keep push them to take off what he calls the male mask\nYou know the mask is it's a thing that we show the world like when we walk out of our homes to work to school to played most people they're clear that they have a massive they show the world\nAnd so I think that with a lot of young men um ... there's an idea like let me just show everybody that I'm happy funny cool athletic intelligent smart hard you know whatever their characters that they show and then there's that stuff sometimes there's like people couldn't handle this stuff people couldn't handle knowing that I'm dealing with sadness or fewer depression and also\nIn our society is that I respect for a man Who's Afraid\nWho sad\nSome of our work is helping our young men have a safe place so that they can talk about the stuff is really happening all of it so when they go back to the world they're not like built up all this pressure that's waiting to explode and that's what I think sometime happens with a lot of my young men\nSo for you personally I mean what was the mask you grow up wearing and how did you adopted at what point did you realize that was getting your way\nOh man I was a middle school was where there's like a lot of transformation was happening you know I knew that in my head I thought it was kind of smart but in middle school is not cool to be smart\nAnd so my ... was like getting slide and buy whatever I don't care about this in order to do the homework because I didn't want to\nIt wasn't until there's one teacher pulled me aside and really adjusted my thinking you know 'cause I was really I was dealing with a lot of sadness you know my father died before I was born\nWho you cry at too about the fact that you're sad every time you see a father like picking up his son from school ... when you do when you see your father come to back to school night when you talk to about that they do with my friends couldn't you couldn't talk to them about it\nSo I just had to hold it and I had to pretend like I didn't really exist", "show_name": "Travel With Rick Steves", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "06"}
