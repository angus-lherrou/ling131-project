[noise]\nBecause they were using more acts and then of course formaldehyde which isn't a modern fluids they started calling these preserved products and ... one of the manufacturers when he was talking about the the for me\nWe all eat the mom and we love it involves\nBeef and what a horrible thing to say about what you're eating\nCoffee coffee was simply a mix of a little coffee and a lot of fake and people would charm loans and crumble them and they would die saw does often with lead based blocking compounds and mix that and\nAnd so people would actually [noise]\nBack in late that the whole origin the phrase\nMuddy cup of coffee\nCame from the fact that you were drinking mind [noise]\n\nTo complain oh you want about over his own government regulators without them we would still be drinking or [noise]\nDeborah Blum shares all the gory details with Steve\nAnd Steve who is not a picky eater had one question [noise]\nThey didn't bombing food\nWork for me is a good preservative\nStopped bodies from rotting and in milk it worked really well take this with a grain of salt because I Do not drink formaldehyde\nBut the story is that it's kind of slightly Swedish and taste so you see this conversation in the nineteenth century about how it restores the taste of bat milk right thanks to the wonders of formaldehyde it has that fresh sweet taste again so in the case some dairy products they loved formaldehyde\nSo that's what he had and that's what got me thinking about how easily it is for people to be misled or food\nLike I go on a walk through a gardener on a hike with someone and they'll be like a very often Bush should go here try this and I'm always like me\nPick your poison\n[laughter] we'll be right back to the best of our knowledge from Wisconsin Public radio [noise] and ... our tax [noise]\nOn WPRI you get thoughtful programming that brings you news and information from close to home and from around the world contributing members including the growing number of ... jeep WPRI future secure thank you\nWant to know more about uh WPRI trip or event you hurt promoted on air our audience services department can help contact audience services by calling one eight hundred seven four seven seven for for for\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

know that there are a lot of poisons growing\nIt got to thinking you know there are a lot of famous stories in history about poisonous plants\nSocrates was killed by hand lock and and on and on and I thought it would be interesting to tell those stories not to write a field guide to poison the well\nLet's talk about wind plants have actually killed someone or been used in warfare or for some dark in various purpose [noise]\nAny story is a mystery writer and she's the author of the best selling cops history series she is also a serious Gardner with ...\nWriting about wicked\nIntroduce China Henry Potter to a few\nAll Abraham Lincoln's mother was killed by a plant she was killed in a very indirect way the plant is white snake rude poisonous\nWould Gray's on this plant the poison would make them sick but\nAlso get into their milk and people would drink the milk and get sick and die and that was called milk sickness and it was a real problem throughout the Eighteen hundreds in fact the mystery part of it is interesting it took us a long time to really understand how plant poisons work in part because how do you even do those experiments\nThe KGB starts assassinating people with rice and which is an extract of the castor bean seed\nAnd we did not in medical science even know how much rice and it took to kill a person so as the latest\nExperiments where we're figuring out what would be a lethal dose for a pig that weighs roughly the equivalent of a human it's amazing how much we still don't know about toxins and plant\nI read that you have a poisonous plant garden and that it's been listed as one of them I think Eighteen most unusual gardens in the world [laughter] [laughter]\nWell I live out that I Want it to grow these plants it's weird to write a book about plants that you've never grown and maybe never even seen and some of them are pretty hard to get you can't just walk into a garden center and say I would like twelve men drinks [laughter] they're just not for sale\nBut as I'm doing these interviews and reaching out to people in the horticulture community\nPlant started getting offered to me kind of secretly like\nYou actually yes I really did go visit a farm that grew a lot of very poisonous and strange plants including some illegal plant\nThere was up in the hills and before I went up there where I knew there was going to be no cell phone coverage I remember calling my husband and going if I don't call you back in an hour or something has happened [laughter] what plants\nSo like I owe ... maybe you've heard of a loose new genetic plan from South America\nThings that may be or not quite illegal but that the DEA is very aware of and that are hallucinogenic plant but they were going straight up you know it was a pop farm and it was a I mean they were going other illegal\nStraight up illegal plants as well so you're you started collecting collecting so I started collecting them but they need to go somewhere so I planted a poison garden\nAnd I really made it a I had fun making a creepy so like rather than plant markers I had the cement tombstones that identified what the plant does to you\nMadness or\nBlindness I found a company that makes resident skeletons for medical schools and they sell their factory seconds on line [laughter]\nSo I had all these lightly divide the skulls and hands and and so I had those are kind of Ohio like a skeleton buried those creepy and wonderful but not terribly practical was it beautiful I mean opium poppies are beautiful right yeah I mean a lot of these are very pretty plants\nSo I was growing Fox glove did to tell us which is a heart medication it's a great example if a plant that's both medicine and poisoned depending on the dos and who's taking it\nAnd tobacco's beautiful at flowers and it's spending on the which one you grow can be quite large and impressive looking plan so yeah a lot of them are very pretty\nI've heard that some people think plants have a consciousness I was reading something about maybe the night shades have an inability to hate\nYou think that's true well I'm fascinated by this and it is something that we're finding out more about so one way that plants communicate is through route exits so they exude chemicals out of the roots into the soil and those route exits can attract\nCertain microbes are other living creatures that might help the plant do better or ward off enemies\nAnd they're also plans to do the same thing above ground that if they're under attack they can release a pheromone\nThat would attract the predator of the bug that's attacking them so in other words they can signal for help mhm so this certainly suggest that they're able to react to stimuli around them in a way that we didn't know was possible and we're sort of just starting to\nFigure out do you think that there's a reason that we have these toxic plants in our world\nOh sure they're just defending themselves and this is something I Try to remind people of is that you don't have to be terrified of poisonous plants they're just trying to make a living you know they're they're trying to protect themselves against predators it's a mistake\nAnd comes out of the ground but it's all natural and it's therefore good for us you know we tend to think that anything that's plant based is more healthy and superior in some way but strychnine as a hundred percent plant based on what a sewing cyanide so it was a rice and\nThey're just trying to keep from getting eaten plants are rooted in the ground they don't have opposable thumbs they can't run and hide they can't fight back but you know that's why plants have\nForeign or spines are stinging medals I mean they're all just trying to keep predators away\nSo they inflict pain and suffering on anyone who tries to\nThat was Amy Stewart she writes mystery novels in addition to books like drunken most we can [noise]\nAnd that was shot and Henry cyber talking with her\n\nReally fascinating things about poisons [noise]\nIs it in small doses they can cure\nAnd larger doses killed [noise]\nSo much power in a simple leaf mushroom or all white powder\nThat can be tempting [noise]\n[laughter]\nIf I wanted to poison someone today what would be the best way to go about it oh\nThat's all I knew that you want to get away\nWith it [noise] absolutely [noise] yeah but not what you need to do a very\nGood that they are better than they have any chicken to the ... the ones picking point then that mimic some of the ship sense what you're trying to point the hotel they

New Jersey and in ... in Illinois\nWho was the first girl to die of radium poisoning and and what happened to her\nName was ... so it started in Mali in ... which was true with money dial painted as she had bought two that was ... she went to the dentist and he extracted it\nBut then her next to ... started to hut and then the next one she goes to the dentist absolutely desperate for some kind of help for some kind of a used to this excruciating pain that she's suffering\nAnd the dentist reaches into her mouth with his hand and gently ... a habitual buying and it breaks against his thing goes\nAnd he is able to lift it out of her mouth and a week later he does the same to the rest of the ... in her mouth\nAnd just to explain what radium does so it's a ... and that could be your own phone unlike your hips you'll ... you'll buy and and it was actually\nMaking holes in the woman's buttons say when the ... to study them they found that they honey kind ... ten\nAnd say what money not CEO was trying to treat with aspirin was ah you know ... when victory hunting holes drilled in Kathryn Shaw one of the radium Gulf said that the paying ... to a dentist joining on a life of\nDays weeks months time that's what she set the pain of being radium go with like\nAnd in the meantime the girls would go to the companies and the companies would say no or they'd say you're imagining it or you're making it up and they would they paid doctors testify against the girls the level of the cover up as kind of hard to believe it's really\nQuite shocking as you say the the debts the depravity to which they would sing they hired private detectives to pick up dust on these women you know they actively lie to them they concealed medical test results and it's just astonishing you watch the comedy that anyone would be that inhumane\nOne I remember there's I think you wrote that at one point they tested a lot of the girls for their radium levels they didn't give the girls\nCreated a list of who's going to die first yeah that is exactly what happened they graded then depending on how radioactive Iowa\nAnd so I saw in the ... when I was researching it Saturday in black and white a list of all the women's names and a number next about name you know from one three to five I don't see how somebody could look at a woman a young woman I Know\nYou've got her name on a list and you know she's going to be dead in a year and look her in the face some say you're fine\nWell I I I think it just goes to show just how expendable disposable people full of women are not time that was one funding Connecticut to settled with that girls\nAnd one woman knows recall it I who died and he's six months off the sheep and moderate on the phone off the husband a settlement\nBut there's some they offered him was forty three dollars and Seventy five cents\nOh my God less than fifty dollars for human life he picked\nOne of your favorite young women to tell us about just introduce or some yeah tell us about her a coyote it's very hard to picture [laughter] but I Will pick Katherine Wells done uh who who was one of the and annoy thought paint is\nCatherine was Nineteen when she started what that and it was half assed job and she was there for nine years\nShe was actually fired for being sick\nShe had a ... basically because the radium had settled in ... lack and they said ... was cruising tool he's given nine years of your life to a company and they fight you for being sick but they've ... the sickness that was a very big mistake because we'll have done it he did was that she fought back\nAnd it takes years say by the time the end annoy you went in a finding suit it's the great depression\nAnd say the town panic and to and the women of disbelief that shown that told the lawyers and foods and sheets\nAnd by the time the case comes to coal\nKatherine is incredibly sick she has a song cutting the abundant GMO on how the hip caused by the radio and and it's the size of a

fight 'til she knows she is going to die but she does it for her friends and she does it have found that they had children for her husband\nAnd I just think that is just a shining example of all these women did you know as you say that buddies were crumbling they were impoverished they were facing sudden death they grieving from the friends they lost and yet they stood up they fought for that
