...\nI grew up listening to these kinds of stuff I mean there are stories of exercises and those of us are coincidences of\nYeah just truly uncanny things that happen\nI don't know if I Believe and goes but um that's the story of\nThe ghost of William justify Bradley [noise]\nThis is your app march [noise] and she's talking about her father\nFather died when he was eighty in Nineteen eighty three it's about her father's ghost and how he appeared in the house they grow up in Michigan\n\nWe kept the house for the first year after my father went to assisted living and then we sold it [noise]\nAnd in Nineteen Ninety no I'm Sorry I Would have been Nineteen Ninety five\nTook a walk down the street where I grew up and the man who had bought the house or a model that\nAsked me if I wanted to see it and I said yes so he introduced me to his wife and I went into the house and she was telling me about how they expanded it and she said your father's coast has been here and I looked at her like she was a little [noise]\nWacko Mm [noise]\nAnd she said they were remodeling the first part of the house and this decision or a man or a figure appeared and she went running out of the house and to her husband and said there's some man in the house and she described what she saw and the neighbor across the street was talking to her husband and he said sounds like Bill Bradley\nSeveral months later her husband was downstairs in the basement doing some electrical work and the same person or whatever there isn't a feared\nRunning down stairs to say he's back and found out her husband had electrocuted himself\nAnd she ran upstairs called nine eleven and they came and treated her husband or whatever it\nWas they do [noise]\nFeel that dad saved him [noise]\nSo when I got back to Michigan\nI found a picture of my father and his thirties the pitcher my father in his sixties and I sent those pictures to her and she wrote back and she said\nMy coast is your father [noise]\nSo I Would say that you're at Marge is actually one of the more skeptical members of your family I Would say that's true yeah I mean I've heard ... oh yeah I mean there are stories of ... after spirit possession of bizarre coincidence is that your mom was it goes to my mom was a ghost hunter in Milwaukee\nStuff that year the family straight arrow I've been around a lot of true believers and I am not one and it's probably not an accent that I became a journalist and yet this stuff the uncanny the paranormal you read about this stuff all the time why there are some serious questions intellectual questions about what is real\nWithout throwing your intellect out the window your rationality out the window\nWhere do you make of that store without just saying oh that is impossible you know there's just there's no way one of the most interesting people I talked to\nWas Michael Schober the poster boy of skepticism who's Michael Sherman he is a scientist an atheist\nA regular columnist for Scientific American he has the founding publisher of skeptic magazine and he's the guy you go to if you want to have someone throw cold water on these crazy terrible stories the strange thing is he has his own story\nWell so my wife's from a cloned Germany she was raised by a single mom and a grandfather and her grandfather had this radio this little Philips transistor radio from Nineteen Seventy seven or so [noise]\n\n\nThey used to listen to music you meet her and when he\nDied she kept it and it stopped working you know long ago [noise]\n\nAnyway and when she we met and bell in love and so and she moved to Los Angeles to be with me she shipped her belongings out ahead of time including this radio\nAnd I try to get a working for her because I knew was meaningful to her and I couldn't put new batteries in and checked the wires and slap that on the table firmly and all the things you're supposed to do to get electronic equipment to work and uh you know I couldn't and and so we gave up and I just tossed in the back of a drawer in the bedroom and it\nDidn't think about it for months and then you know in the day of our\nWedding we just had a particular moment when she was feeling rather sad that there was nobody there from her family\nAnd friends a long way from home and we heard music playing in the back of the house is like what was that you know and I thought well I'm a slap my iPhone honor my laptop with tunes or maybe the next door neighbors playing music and it was none of that and then we\nOpen the door beneath the fax machine and then there's the rate this plane is blamed Islam song perfectly you know perfectly to a station [noise] for us particularly for my wife this was a very deeply emotional experience I mean meant something to her ... her symbolically like the grandfather was there\nWith us than they ever wedding make her feel good and it did [noise]\nIt played the rest of the day and night we fell asleep listening to music on the radio and they went there the next morning endeavor sense even though I get it to work and [noise] and civil war is still there [noise]\nTo just share my I think that was anything more than just a bizarre coincidence not really but it kind of struck him\nIt was like whoa man ... called down to call it it's okay [laughter]\nUh yeah a little bit but but I also as insightful to me when I talked to other people that have had these experiences makes me more open to what they're talking about are more sympathetic like yeah I get it I totally understand the yeah I had something similar\nHe didn't have to write about this and I mean that's actually one of the things that I think is is great about what he did as this goes against his sort of ... of skepticism\nWhat does it mean I don't know you know I wrote about this and Scientific American just to say you know weird things happen you know my friends not real religious friends with people like the buck to Oprah that think that there's a you know it's sort of a quantum field that inner connects all of this and that quantum consciousness way he thinks that's a sign you know okay maybe but\nMy wife said numerous experience as a last year and a half or she felt sad or was missing home and the radio didn't\nCome on a goat but this was this was your wedding day well it was yeah I mean there was something a little unusual because I mean there is another I mean what some people who study mystical experiences say is that\nThe most profound experiences are often once in a lifetime I mean they're not replicable there there there's heightened emotion for whatever reason there's something extraordinary hobbies and will never happen again\nThat's possible and and it could be you know that science is limited in the sense that we really really need replicable lab tested or some kind of way of getting that the experience again and those kind of went off events don't fit that and it could be they are real and we just are limited and how we can study them\n[noise]\nWell I don't think that science can ask the question of what's\nUltimately true about the supernatural the nature of the supernatural is is that it is\nBeyond the natural I think science studies for natural okay so this is the Stanford anthropologists Tanya Letterman [noise] signed the kind of person that people come up to at cocktail parties and\nYou know I haven't told anybody this but my goodness I was in the hospital I find myself up in the corner to room looking down at at my body [noise]\nPeople see things that people don't see or couldn't see the here things with other people couldn't tear they sometimes steal their mind leading their body and was in around\nI mean these experiences happen to people and in fact I think they're pretty common [noise]\nSo she has been her career studying religion sort of trying to understand religious belief why do people have these beliefs and when she was a grad student in England she was really interested in the pagan community practitioners of magic and she joined in so as an apologist you'd do what the\nField that you've come to study does no I'm In I cast spells out as part of groups of people who were conjuring up power I was I learned to read tarot cards I learned to a little bit about astrology a lot about the law\nAnd participated in these different groups as they met to carry out their ritual metric did it become real for you or at least ... times one of the things I could see\nWas that people experienced the magic Israel\nAnd so I I put that aside the question of whether magical force really existed what I could see and what I came to experience is that if you spent time in this world and you did the kinds of things that people did to\nA psychic ability I have this article ready to step in to other people um the living and begin to resemble them become them without having met them or seen them ended so I'm kind of like a human radio think that's the way to look at me and who are you channeling I have these guys that work with me they say that there are teachers\nThey say that they're operating in a different level of consciousness and we're at a higher level of consciousness uh higher octave\nThere is a name that they use occasionally which I'm always a little uncomfortable with names because that seems to bring in ideas of lineage and history that I mean so that now that you can distinguish between different gods they have\nDifferent personalities elective I work with a collective but yeah there's personality that comes through certainly when I work but I don't really see them I mean for me the experiences very physical and very auditory I've seen a couple of them and meditation what are they look like\nThe one that I've seen that I Am I'm able to to distinguish clearly and I only saw him because I was hypnotized and somebody said we like to bring your guides through when I was quite surprised when somebody showed up and sat down he was you know quite lovely to look that he was older he were a large hats\nAnd it's sort of went up up up and up and there was some sort of flat up the topic was sort of a little bit like you would imagine I suppose\nA Greek Orthodox priest would wear and he held to a sector which was very odd it was in Boston the lettering was raised and it was higher clinics and I\nDidn't know what any of it meant to the time and um he had blue eyes very blue eyes and a long beard and he had a Purple Rose of some ... and so when you when you have that image I mean you do take that literally do you think this is what this guide really excellent that's how he presented himself for me\nSo this all sounds kind of crazy in Akron imagine maybe when you first started having these experiences that might have felt like too much but I mean did you ever feel like you were going crazy\nNo not really I didn't start off believing in any of this stuff I was raised an atheist you know and I wasn't I didn't have a great interest in the paranormal certainly see we're not you did not come out of a religious no not at all I grew up in the Upper West side of Manhattan and we sort of snicker to people who believed in things that was a convenient\nAgnostic ... I suppose when I was twenty five I was a year at a graduate school at Yale I'd had a list of things that I had achieved in the world but I thought would make me okay and I got the whole list and I wasn't okay that's really what happened and I began\nTo pray or to embark on what I now know was the beginning of a spiritual path\nThings begin to happen as a result of that ... what started happening well the first thing was I heard a voice telling me to get my act together and I was so surprised that I heard that voice and when I hear a voice it's like a fog comes in and rounds out all of your other thoughts and it's not your fault it's the only way that I can explain it\nAnd I had a bit of an experience and the experience may well had been hyperventilating I really I may never know what it was but it was an experience of energy\nMoving through my body and out through the top of my head\nAnd then as a result of that I started seeing lights around people or maybe not as a result of that but shortly thereafter I sort of seeing this things is flashes started going off so when you say see lights around people without was whether they look like wells fireflies sparks little blue lights over the top of the head\nSo I ended up studying a form of energy healing as a way to get a context where this\nShort a lot of people who are listening to us right now are are deeply skeptical she or he might be thinking you know you're making it all up or even if you're not you're delusional you care about that kind of skepticism\nNot in the way that I used to I Can't you know I had a life as an academic for very long time I was and why you for twenty five year teaching creative writing my writing yeah I play running for very long time\nAnd you know initially I was very concerned about what people thought and I kept a very low profile with this\nBut once the first book came out I had to begin to own a bit more and that was a challenge so you're not you're not teaching creative writing and he no I'm not ... I'm traveling around the world\nSitting in a chair closing my eyes and waiting for this transmission to come through in speaking what I'm hearing them and then all of this energy comes in and fills the room and people who come are having an experience with it\nYou know I'm not a spiritual teacher I'm not a good ... I'm not a psychic who's gonna connect you with their dead relatives and I don't like doing productive work\nBut if you're actually having problems in your relationship and you give me your spouse his name I can step into your spouse to begin to look like her\nAnd possibly hear what's going on in the dynamic them that's been proven out in the film when I'm channeling I'm really just operating as a radio so I'm just sitting in the chair and letting the dial turn to the station that wants to come through\nAnd then being receptive to take the dictation\nSo play that out from ... explain that for me if you can when you say you're like a radio you know you got to sort of tune into the writing handle and then the guides we'll we'll speak through you ... how does that work I mean ... where are you in where whereas Paul ...\nHeated I'm president but I'm receded are you sort of an altered state of conscious I think I'm going to like trance it's light enough that I can interrupt pertinent and and and say hey wait a minute this doesn't make any sense which I've been known to do\nAnd the rule with all of the books is that they could they can't be edited so all of the books really on edited transcripts of the session\nSlates they really are you are and you're not going at you know sort of cleaning up the highway and you're saying these books you know they're not written by you it's like reading your automatic writing any no no no they're spoken these are oral teachings that are transcribed\nDo you think about the metaphysics of all of this okay what's the architecture of this universe that you are describing here\nI Do and I don't I think I only do when I'm sitting with somebody who asks those questions okay well you're you're sitting with one right now these are not going to access it myself because I actually don't know\nAnd I would have to recede in big in channeling on your show and I think it was already the way we started off as Congress has so far out to begin with ... through [laughter]\nYou know honestly when I first started doing this stuff I didn't want to record it I wasn't looking to be known for it\nSupport for WPRI comes from the children's hospital of Wisconsin foster care program dedicated to helping thousands of Wisconsin foster kids connect with caring families more about being a foster parent is that C.
