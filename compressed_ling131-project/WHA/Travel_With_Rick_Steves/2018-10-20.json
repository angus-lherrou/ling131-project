Virginia where I grew up\nYeah I was surprised too and actually I didn't know it until I was on our cemeteries healers and one of my coworkers pointed this out and I said I'm Sorry who [laughter]\nThey're all over the Midwest they're still family members in Michigan still some in Ohio now this kind of progressive we moved to the middle and north of the United states\nJust thinking about the history of this I mean if you have the son\nOf Jefferson the guy who wrote the declaration of independence and then you have a child who grew up in slavery it's like these threats of American history come together right here in the cemetery\nRace it's interesting how little it sort of know about your local history and how it all kind of intersect in various ways and it still affects us today Thomas Jefferson is so famous right and he stands for so many things and I think you can avoid feeling the weight of that here\nUm Mm\nAaron Hogan is an education specialist with the Wisconsin veterans museum here in Madison\nOoh\nSo by now pretty much everyone knows that Thomas Jefferson had a sexual relationship with his life and Sally Hemings and that they had children are Twenty years ago the Jefferson Hemings relationship was mostly a rumor that his white\nDescendants denied [noise] and then a brilliant legal scholar Annette Gordon Reed proved it with historical records stories passed down by Sally ... children even DNA evidence ... became the first African American to win the Pulitzer Prize for history followed by a MacArthur genius award she tells the\nPolicy of this story is a perfect example of the way many Americans have tried to bury and deny the real history of slavery [noise]\nI think most people in the black community did not doubt it because\nWe understand that this kind of thing happened quite a bit and so it didn't seem like it was wild and crazy\nIf they had free papers people would know that they were part black because they'd been in slave and you'd be able to trace them one reason we don't know about their descendants is because they have no paper trail we know about Madison that asked and and that's the thing about documents that the importance of them once you put things down and writing\nYou can at least begin to locate where people are and then research and find out about them\nSo the big question that people have been asking for decades is what do we make of Thomas Jefferson this revered founding father who wrote the major part of the declaration of independence saying that all men are created equal you know the great document of freedom and equality\nWho's not just a slave owner but ... have this intimate relationship with the slave woman for years and had children to go to I mean what when we ... well\nThat kind of thing was a part of being a slave owner I mean the the real problem with Jefferson is the connection to slavery\nAnd we've always known that but I think what is happening now is people are understanding that slavery was not just about making people work for no money or whipping people or whatever it was an institution that ended up with mixed bloodlines and a lot of different ways to rape\nThrough connections that we don't understand and that make us uncomfortable I think the thing to make of it is a Jefferson was a person\nWe should take him down from the mountain as this revered icon\nNo there are things to admire about Jefferson and we're just going to have to grapple with the fact that a person who wrote the declaration of independence and helped create the country not just Jeffrey symbol Washington and all of them the number of them were slave holders they help people in bondage\nAnd profited from that I think you'd have to take the better with the sweet and I don't know that it's ever good to revere people\nAs God in a way because they're always going to disappoint you\nI think a better way to look at it is to say this is what these human beings did on their time on earth and some of it was good and some of them was bad and what can we live with and what things do we reject how do we move on from that Jefferson didn't think that we were going to stay in one place\nBut he had already mystic view of race relations didn't eat I mean he was he was racist and he he thought black people were inferior we're not as smart as when you\nThat most people at that time thought and that's a lot of people think today there's no question about that even though he says I venture it as a suspicion only but not a suspicion he believed that whites were better than blacks that was the currency of the time\nI Do think he thought slavery was wrong but it's like many other things that we believe that we don't live by\nThis was not what really animated Jefferson I mean we're interested in slavery and race and we should be but that's not the main thing\nIn the United states of America he'd been part of a revolution that overthrew king and created a new society\nThat's what he was fixated on that slavery thing that'll solve itself but it's like many things in life you say if I could just fix this that little thing over there it will be fine but it's that little thing over there that destroys the thing that you love yeah and slavery was he came to see the walk upon which\nThe union will be split and that was true yeah thank you very much this is just fascinating history Oh thank you for having me\nThat's Harvard legal historian Annette Gordon Reed talking with the fall some ...\nHer book the Hemingses of Monticello won a Pulitzer Prize and
