P. R. dot org and bend photo welcome back good to have you with us again thanks great to be here [noise] you know what I'm going to be doing this weekend\nMy daughter Emily is going to be carving pumpkins with her perfect across country friends but I Will be\nIn the back lawn in the vegetable garden area and I will be pulling out the a ... to ... plants and getting the straw bale stuff taken care of\nIt is time yes but I'm leaving the front of the I I have no on on the front because it's all flowers and and so forth so I leave that alone\nPerfect so I ever touch it yeah and um so you mentioned in the intro that uh you know something that I'm fond of saying is brown as a color to and\nI think the first thing you notice when you really start to look at sort of our landscapes for November and beyond that is that brown is is much too ambiguous term for us to use it it's sort of like if you talk to fashion designers or interior designers and they say no no it's not purple it's you know a ... few sources not directed at greater specificity that\nI'm emerges but it's the same when we think about uh the generic idea of brown so we have silver and gray and ... are sepia enter caught a and a silver and blacks and suddenly there's this huge palette that opens up to us for this time of year that\nMost of us are focusing on you know when do these flowers and plants bloom and how do they look when they're blooming but you know we have especially here in Wisconsin we have many more months to look at things they um and and I don't like to just look at a flat garden I like to see something there yeah\nI I'm with you on that and you know I I yeah I'm Wondering I thought about this as I looked at my own flowers or the last couple of days thinking about your trip over here [noise] ah they don't look as nice right now and I think that there's\nYou know people look at those and say you know at this doesn't look so good I'm just going to clean this up and if you just wait a little bit like Freddie Freddie good\nYes and and I will say there are probably some plans to do the job better than others um per hour but anything with strong seed heads are typically things will will look out for in terms of structure and texture especially\nThen food are our guests today from the Allen centennial gardens as we talk with him about getting the guard and ready for winter and appreciating the color brown\nOver the winter as you uh take a look out the window and look through the snow and see those plants out there that are ... died a long time ago but still providing a whole lot of interest\nJoined in with your own questions comments or maybe experiences we've had some great experiences so far from listeners what about you question give us a call one eight hundred six four to one two three four email us at ideas that WPRI dot org\nAnd then you're a a landscape architect I'm a by my training at a designer\nWhile I I should say started in landscape architecture Raymond Dart it and then ... well and I did three semesters in undergrad and then realized that didn't have quite as much to claim says I Want to know [laughter]\nAnd then on my way to public gardens\nSo he did get into design ... yeah you you did get into design and I just wonder do you do when you're designing dude and thinking about the plants that go in do you give consideration to the winter\nOr as well as what those plans are going to like look like in the summer\nMost definitely um and so there's a famous plants been out there who do Foose who's noted for saying a plan should look good when it's dead\nAnd and again when we're thinking of perennials specifically are are puree to bloom interest is really so short compared to the whole life cycle of the plant so\nI'm thinking about you know the emerging foliage and spring it's fall color now how well to the seed heads hold up\nUm does it need sticking our can stand up to the elements on its own I'm sort of a a really exciting products for us we just rented it at our new American garden in the Alan Simpson you'll garden this season so about Thirteen hundred new perennial plan ... of the four season interests another it's looking fabulous right now is another great time to visit\nHim that's ah that's wonderful well we have similar color so let's take another call again I think there's one more overloaded eight hundred six four to one two three four Scott in Madison it's your turn nice Scott\nMorning or good afternoon no good learning good morning other question about getting rid of creeping Charlie and when the best time to do it with the\nI Would probably say spring um only because being a perennial weed is starting to go dormant with other plans write about\nIs not going to be as effective now is it would be in spring when things are in a really active state of growth [noise]\nSo wait until spraying and tell probably flowering or a little after ... just\nAbout when you see the flowers start to emerge that should be um probably the optimal time how Henry over\nThere is there a chemical available for getting rid of Charlie it's difficult to get rid of\nYes there there are a you know I had been in this case of chemicals probably the best way a hand pulling you'll you'll hate yourself for it\nUm so are there are broadly herbicides other that won't kill the grass but will kill 'em any of those broadly weeds my recommendation do would be um dude don't just go the lawn 'em do it yourself or or hire a skilled horticulture is\nUm because we really like to try and work around things like a beneficial perennials like white clovers and other things that really encourage healthy grass ecosystem but um\nYou know we don't want a new everything if we can help it would be really specific and targeted and also remember\nThat there are creeping Charlie's one of the first things that blooms in the spring and so the booms the flowers are out there for\nThe audience beneficial insects and they don't have a whole lot else to\nA ... and truthfully you know I mean keeping Charlie isn't necessarily harmful and to that point you know we in in the ... continual garden as well we live dandelions because they're they ours is the first food for pollinators and so we don't spray we don't kill anything we just we embrace that there are packed a part of our sort of won ecosystems\nHas got to be had any children ah I haven't done a [laughter]\nI have gone out with my daughter I said there's a couple of days on the show but I I go out and go on even with my daughter and we pulled creeping generally\nYou'd be amazed at how much creeping Charlie you can pull in a Fifteen minutes to a half hour\nAnd it's sort of sets it back and you know it gives your lawn your grass is a a chance to to join in I guess I can get some pretty good piles [laughter] again in a minute so anyway we're that thanks\nFor my mother's ... Charlie uh you got it so\nGotcha understood well get over to bombs on and do a little ... [laughter] there you go yeah thanks you can join into eight hundred\nSix four to one two three four let's turn to Roy in white water right what's on your mind [noise]\n\nAll right thank you for calling what can we do for you\nI just heard comments a fellow what's good or to craft or S. S. I. assumption for marrying him is that that is a set a fire will now I'm looking at my front lawn and the country and I have\nA real uh infestation of crab grass this you're possibly do to the ... weather I'm not sure I've always been told that to prevent crab grass you need a free merchant that would be spread early spring\nAnd I'm calling to see if now that I can clearly identify these areas where the crab grass has apparently died and turn kind of a brownish red color\nCan I apply that are beside excuse me that a free emergent now\nAnd use it selectively rather than a broadcast that over the entire law and\nI I Would agree with using it selectively adjust to minimize the impact of the chemicals um but I think a waiting till spring would be your fans because they won't be doing any terminating at this fall there don't they are going to wait until spring so definitely I'm good marks those areas yeah ... and either you know puts American flags out there or something to sort of remind yourself where those spots are and that may be helpful\nYeah that's a that should work right thank you so much for calling Pete in Greensburg emailed and he says I have a fire and ice\nVery well it's now about five feet high four to five feet wide so it is doing well he wants to move it now law should he do it this fall or wait until spring\nSo I Would say actually fall is not a bad time to be moving things again the plants are are going dormant they're not an active states of growth so the the shock that you'll um you know anytime we move a plant there is some shock value going on um but doing it in fall minimizes that a little bit\nUm but I Would still say makes 'em if things keep up you shouldn't have to water it any additionally but um if things ever do dry out after you move it definitely makes sure you're giving up some good water I also would proven that the\nPrint it back fairly significantly just to reduce stress next spring so the plant isn't trying to leave out a full size plant on reduced root system but after a year or so it should push through and recovered just fine [noise] that\nSounds good to me thanks for that email Pete appreciate you can email to add ideas that WPRI died or post an email and the photo too if you won Kevin in Madison it's your turn\nThat morning I enjoy the show um I had a question about left or and I got a lot of fat in it that the Lakers right here in town and I'm Wondering ... treat them with us stumped killing product in the winter months\nI it should be I I haven't done I don't have a lot of personal experience with ... but I'm from what I Know of other sort of invasive treatments I\nI think it would be okay I I Would probably do more in the fall than deep winter I'm On the plane to fully dormant and not actively growing it's it may not absorb the herbicide quite as well so if you're if you do it maybe an October November that probably is going to be a better back then January or February\nYeah I'm pretty sure of that and usually on the labels you're going to uh get that information ah Eris ingestion says to went to to make those applications so take a look at the label for whatever it is you\nBuy and then as you ... ... as you do that you make those cuts and and I I Know for sure\nWhen you do make a caught a you should be applying that product brain that's right away right away if\nYou don't wanna wait not waiting around because otherwise it's certainly than not as effective joined in at eight hundred six four to one two three four winter some of your before I go back to the phones what are some of your favorite winter interest plans\nA one in particular for right now I'm Sonia as are just an amazing plant especially the ... which is one of our native I'm Sonia is a ... they are just about to go a really strong golden lemon yellow color they're just really spectacular this time of year\nThey also in spring have these big clusters of beautiful blue star shipped flowers and our can fairly disease resistance they sort of once they're in they're there and I'd almost treat 'em like a shrub in the sense that they don't they don't like to move they\nAre and they will just sort of stay put and\nYou know this is the time of the year when it's awfully tempting you know the garden centers are all I'm offering they'll see some gas yeah its sales season so should we be taking advantage of that\nYes absolutely that follows a tremendous time to be doing planting um again the typically the stresses on the plan to the getting establish or less we're not going through you know Ninety degree days and droughts um they can get their roots initially establish but again if you're going to be doing for planting I'd be doing it in the next couple of weeks I wouldn't wait much longer [noise]\nThe most precious and um if you're really looking to preserve that tree I Would I Would consider relocating the patio someplace else or were there\nLooking at ... off to flip the gravel I was going to add a standard grab a laptop it's correct\nYeah it it's still still sort of the same condition so any um complexion 'cause the roots are actually breathing also at the same time they sort of found where they like to be\nUm relative to the soil surface in any compassion with a quick mentor sand or gravel or adding height can can do a you may not see the damage in the first year but in three to five years if you went through with us the tree would likely suffering decline\n[noise] yeah and it's it's too bad those is you know a maple roots are really shattering yes maybe they were thrown him very shallow so they're even more susceptible than a perhaps some other trees um although many many trees species are pretty shallow road when you get right down to it\nSo there you go [laughter] oh by the house that we are to be the bearer of bad I mean that's what we can tell you on that but I'd look for three to five years from now having some problems with your tree if you go ahead whether ... I think about up to you to decide what you want to do let's go to Mary in Waukesha next time Mary\n[noise] um we've got ... that were plant it probably Thirteen fourteen years ago and they had it all and they got seed pods and do I need to pick them up throw them out or\nUsed to have daily lays right there yeah raise yes\nYeah well have you ever divided them no\nI Would say it's um if you said you've had them for over ten years and that's what\nIt is and and they've never had that sense\nWould say it's time um so I wouldn't you could do it this fall\nAm I gonna do it in the next week or so I Do it I wouldn't wait too much longer um but you can also do them in ... next spring just as easily but a ... dividing them will really rejuvenate the plants should hope of flowering\nThe the the seed pods that it's hard for me to know without seeing what if it's an actual the powder for it may be something else but uh in terms of encouraging more blooms definitely a sort of lifting and rejuvenate into plants would help tremendously [noise]\nOkay if we if we divided them in the next\n... how do we store them for the winter\nI Would plant them right back in the ground I'm so dig them up divide them and put them right back in the they shouldn't um they won't they won't like being stored over winter so they are very hearty they can go back outside\nSo much alright thanks for calling ... call Lynn in Waukesha it's your turn I Lynn Good morning how are you re appreciate your call\nWell I'm calling about a Trump that thing that I planted earlier in the spring it took off it had some little it was green it'll it's going great and the south side of the house later in the season about a month and a half ago during August it started to turn yellow and looked like it was dying\nNow this is my first go around with it so I don't know is there something I should or shouldn't do in the fall to hope that comes back in the spring\nMost of my experience with trumpet vine as it takes a lot to kill them so I my guess is this may be sort of just\nFirst your troubles also um you could be related to all the water we've had in some fashion um but I wouldn't I wouldn't stress out too much I'd I'd I'd wait until spring and see how it does but my gut is telling me you'll be okay\nNow than it could be yeah hopefully next year you're going to have a great trumpet vine I had I tried for four years to get a trumpet vine to go in a particular spot\nAnd then I finally realized that trumpet vine does not those trumpet vines I tried to plant do not like that [laughter] so I just gave up on it [noise] unfortunately I had to\nHave some sometimes a location some showers that if this was the first year I'd give it I get home next year I went to Oh absolutely especially with the gang busters this year I I'd say you're you're on a good track ...\nThank you thanks a lot or let's go to a Joanne in Washington Island tied Joanne\nThanks for taking my call your two quick questions I ... in planters outside and I fight over which can I Know for going to water down well they serve\nYou can move them indoors um they will still I'm so these are actually plants if I'm ... I'm thinking correctly of what you have these are native to South Africa and so they actually are um\nLike it a little hot and dry and so they're not um ... I Would say in terms of watering let them get just a bit drier you don't want them bone dry but they don't need to be sopping wet all the time\nUm but definitely in a place with highlights um high heat there they will enjoy a bit um the the downside is that they can get a bit Laiki over the course of the winter so by the time you're getting to march and April they may just kind of look like little wiring trees um\nYou can sort of a nip those goes growing tips off and it will encourage doormen buds to lease out and it'll get bushy and look really good again for the next growing season [noise]\nAll right Larry thanks very\nOnly real quick can I Know night candy Bush's that fits scare\nYes this is the time to do ... yes there you go thanks a lot Joanne for calling appreciate it talking today with Ben food a director of the Alan centennial garden I'm Larry\nWork next\nTime and the people's pharmacy find out what treatments are available for women who are having sexual problems\nWomen sex drive may vary depending on pregnancy breastfeeding menopause prescription medication\nHow dysfunctional medicine address the root cause of sexual difficulties\nFind out how women can improve their sexual satisfaction on the next ... farms\nAt seven on the ideas network\nSupport for WPRI comes from delta dental of Wisconsin committed to helping improve access to oral health care in the state do their dental benefits plans and community support more information is at delta dental W.

with the kids who just immediate started yelling [noise] you can't keep yourself together you can't do this you can't do that so I walked right back out the door and I never looked back\nWithout steady employment and her husband to help with bills Randy watching anxiously as her household supplies dwindled she worried constantly about money\nAs your as your checking the price was in a number and the prices and figure out if you buy two cards will you have enough money for breakfast you are forgetting things are paying less attention to your rent you could homework the of the other things that make you know life complete\nThe thing is as a result of doing this the underlying problem can become worse if you don't pay our bills you'll be even deeper and the whole next month\nScarcity in other words is a trap the scarcity trap for us is\nAll those ways in which scarcity today begets behaviors which leads to even further scarcity tomorrow and we think it's something that poor people do people do is another example we think the lonely do this\nSo people who are lonely will often engage in social interactions in a particular way which actually makes it harder for them to make friends\nJust as the poor focus on the money they do not have\nThe lonely tend to focus on the friends\nThey do not have the result is they try too hard to be locked in a conversation the lonely person might be so preoccupied with making a good impression that he can't pay attention to watch actually being set the conversation\nFalters instead of appearing likeable he's seen as awkward or flat footed what happens as a result people avoid the aqua conversationalist [noise] and the only person becomes even lonely or this lands offers a new way of\nThinking about white people who find themselves in scarcity seem to do things that\nTo an outsider look stupid when you're in a whole why would you take yourself even deeper\nCenter says we're asking the wrong question what if it's not the poor people are somehow deficient but the poverty make everyone\nLess capable that it's the it's it's you and I tomorrow will be to become poor or with all of a sudden have the same effect the poverty is in some sense changing our minds\nHow do we know this isn't some bleeding Haass theory to excuse irresponsible behavior and out in ... wanted to test that hypothesis\nOf all this is true one thing that ought to be true is the same person when they're poor should have very different cognitive capacity than when they're rich\nSo how would we test that well unfortunately we don't have the kind of money to go around making poor people rich but a sugarcane farmers actually create a natural experiment for us\nSugarcane farmers specifically those in India\nRight after the harvest the month after they get that income they're pretty rich\nBut like anybody who gets a huge windfall all at once that the money gets spent a little too fast and so by the end of the harvest cycle they're relatively poor so now we have the same person a month before harvest poor and the month after her this well off\nAgain you have the same group of people who are poor one moment and rich the next ... tested the farmers on their long term thinking when they had no money and when they had plenty of money the results were stunning\nWe found a huge difference so we found that post harvest when they're well off and they have much more impulse control\nFarmers who are rich tended to think about things that would help them over the long term this mashed other research that shows for example the farmers who are well off tend to read their feels more regularly and farmers who are poor\nFarmers who are poor mostly focused on how to make it to next week short term thinking\nTo be clear it's not that poor people focus on immediate needs because that's all they want to think about it's all they can think about scarcity captures the mind like it did with those charming men in Minnesota in fact scarcity can actually knew or how you perform on an IQ test\nPut simply being poor is like having just pulled an all nighter\nNow if you've been very lucky maybe you've never experienced what it's like to be poor or hungry or lonely but they might be another former scarcity you have experienced\nOn Sundays we get to leave at four pm some days we don't leave till one AM [laughter] and then you

when you're so busy it feels like you don't have time to brief let me tell you the story of a young woman named Katie she asked us to use her middle name for reasons that will be clear in the moment\nFor as long as she can remember Katy has been driven really driven\nUm when I was in high school I was determined to be valedictorian so I took a sophomore level honors biology course as a

don't have a lot of hours so I Need to make the most of them and it was like okay I Need to make sure I'm exercising keeping my body healthy and they need to read and stay on top of things so\nI come home after pretty long day and I might go walking for half an hour and then I had read and then I go to sleep um but then as time went on I decided to try to get in more exercise than like I never know and I'll get enough\nExercise and so I started spending all my free daylight hours\nWalking or running outside are going to the gym [noise] up to three hours a day plus like working Fifteen hours and then trying to read and then go to sleep\nShe focused intensely on the things she believed was key to her professional success [noise] Katie lost sight of things on the periphery [noise]\nShe

was stressing me out [laughter] and it was just a mess [noise] and um [noise] I my\nClothes and piled up I had a lot of dirty clothes and coming home just so overwhelming I didn't want to be there and that's part of I think why I was walking so much just to get out of the house and get away from all the things I haven't done an ounce of forgot to pay a bill in the mix of all of that

like to be rich\nSaving all of our friday talk of the house and it I think it has a really\nReally rich and why are you wearing attacks because after six when I'm a farmer private jets your island the state of the Caribbean rich\nI mean it's one and then what would it cost ten dollars\nMost of us would never know what that's like [noise] but if you've ever being at least a little curious about the lives of the liver wealthy this next segment is for you\nBroke Harrington is a sociologist at the Copenhagen business school in Denmark several years ago she decided to explore the secret lives of billionaires\nStrategy become a wealth manager [noise] roof discovered that in order to manage money for the super rich wealth managers known a lot about the private lives of their clients and a very different set of rules that govern their world [noise]\n\nParenting welcome to hidden brain thank you for having me on the show for wealth managers to do their job broke I understand that they need to find out everything about it clients life not just appliance\nFinancial life but everything about their life give me some examples of the kind of compositions people have with wealth managers and the kind of issues they bring up about that personal circumstances that might affect how their wealth has managed\nWell usually starts with what's called know your client activity so if you were to come to me I was acting as the wealth manager I Would first asked to see some proof of identity like your passport and then we would talk about um what goals you had for your wealth\nAnd that begins the series of increasingly delicate an increasingly intrusive questions\nThen usually we get into whatever real reason is bringing you to me\nUm maybe you want to avoid your taxes maybe you really don't like your family that's surprisingly common among wealthy people\nFor example if you have a um a relative or if you yourself are engaging in some activity that might get you explored it it may not be illegal but it might be socially shameful that's a financial risk that your wealth manager needs to know about\nIf you have a son or daughter with a drug problem that's a financial risk that your wealth manager needs to know about there can also be issues like I think I'm headed for a divorce but I don't want my spouse to get half my assets how do I hide those assets\nPreferably offshore so that whatever is is legally provable as mine is such a small amount that it's not worth fighting about\nSuicide already interesting because these professionals in some ways get to know their clients better than the lines own family or friends or even their own spouse\nYes it's it's apparently something of a cliche and the offshore world that\nThe average client is a a man in his fifties with a secret family somewhere might be a gay lover might be a common law wife and some children\nBut they're usually all sorts of secrets that these wealthy folks wish to keep hidden and that they have the additional privilege of being able to hire people to take care of in secret\nI understand you've conducted about sixty five interviews in Eighteen countries for this book um\nI'm sure you have to understand financial the law but this kind of wrote also calls for a certain psychological makeup about what kind of person becomes a wealth manager will several of the people I spoke to describe themselves and only somewhat joke in terms of social workers for the rich [laughter]\nSo you you have to have a empathy and a desire to help people but also a very high tolerance for people who would otherwise seemed to be so extremely privileged that you might be otherwise inclined to smack them around and say snap out of it you're lucky\nYou write in your book about the extreme lengths that some managers go to please their clients or to provide services to their clients or you write about a manager named Eleanor in Geneva who said that one of her clients once called her from outside a restaurant in London tell me that story\nSo this is one of the first stories that I heard that really made my eyebrows raise it was a while I was training to be a wealth manager Eleanor told the story over lunch of receiving a phone call\nFrom my clients who was in another country saying I've just lost my bracelet outside of a restaurant helped me find it and the client didn't identify the restaurants by name [laughter]\nSo imagine having someone call you from another country I mean obviously the country was identified but not anything remotely approaching a location\nSo you have to sort of marvel at the maturity of the client expecting someone else to help her fix the problem like this but Eleanor somehow did she she determine where the client was\nAnd what exactly had been lost and got the local authorities on the case found the bracelet and build the client for all the time and apparently the client was happy to pay\n... there are some times ah clients do make request like this not because they're acting childish but because they actually have an ulterior motive they actually want to test the loyalties or ability off the wealth manager you tell the story of wealth management Hong Kong named David\nYes he he got a call early on in his relationship with the client in which the clients said that he was in Japan and he was meeting with a Japanese gentleman who had expressed a desire for smoked salmon and that this client had promised him I think a thousand side just smoked salmon straight from the factory in Scotland\nAnd was now calling David saying get me the salmon and David said on on your wealth manager not your fish monger and the clients I'd well today you're the fish longer and so David happened to know someone who knew the head of the smoked salmon factory in Scotland and he he fulfilled the clients wish\nAnd the client later told him I basically made up that story I wasn't sitting across from a Japanese\nFellow who wanted a thousand side to smoked salmon I just needed to see that you had the connections and the will to do what I wanted one I Want it and not ask any questions\nOne thing that I got from your book is that there are important ways in which the very rich are very much like the rest of us and ways in which they are not up so wealthy people unsurprisingly turn out to have troubled marriages and where were children just like you know everybody else\nBut but wealth you argue Ken compound those challenges\nWell apparently it's it's not uncommon for the wealth manager to be asked to find a recommend rehab facilities for kids or parents will last a wealth manager to break some bad news\nTo the next generation to to his or her own children sometimes to the wealth manager has to broker a truce between feuding family members say one family member feels that they've been done done by unfairly\nIn the inheritance plan and has to be somehow\nFamily the big risk here is if you have a disgruntled family member who sues the lawsuit process and many countries mixed public many many private documents that would reveal the extent in nature of the family's wealth all of which has had been carefully
