P. R. dot org and Brian welcome back good to have you with it yeah thank you very glad to be here again while we recently been talking about um doing last fall clean up on the show as a matter of fact ah for winter interest and and so forth but\nUh are there are some things that we really should be cleaning up in the garden in the fall\nLots of things this year because in many areas of the state it was really a great season for a lot of plant diseases and most of the organisms that cause the problem survive in old plant debris that's died during the fall\nAnd if you leave out there and allow it to stay there in the spring you're just going to have a nice source of the pathogens to re infects your plants next year so\nIf you don't want to do it in the fall because of the\nWinter interest or make sure you do to clean up in the spring before the plants leaf out okay what were the main diseases this year that pretty much everything under the sun really dependent upon where you were in the state because we had some areas of the states were relatively dry for much of the season but hearing the Madison area we seemed to have rain pretty much every day or at least it seemed that way\nSo we were seeing all kinds of fungal leaf diseases bacterial diseases\nUm there was actually a new pathogen I'd never seen I knew of the pathogen from pictures I seen it on my bucket list to seek called God Krista Larry Ella\n'em and tell them what the heck ... wells causes a zone eight we spot and it was very interesting the county extension agent in\nA marathon county sent me some photos of maple leaves them when I saw the symptoms I was pretty sure it was this particular fungus that was causing the problem and I basically told her send me a sample I Will do the diagnosis or freak accidents on my bucket list as the\nAnd interestingly the same day that sample came in and it was this um\nA particular fungus I also got a a grape sample that came in and I looked at it right after the maple and I saw the same sort of reproductive structures on the grape and I thought like Ross contaminate samples that sure enough the pathogen goes to both hosts and so was separate the same disease on two different types of plants so\nI was pretty psyched and then we incubate at the leaves and washed over for a while in this particular pathogen\nAnd ended up well okay I had it for like OK okay well for lack I came back out like oh wait no ill tell where that\nBen yeah where did the leaves are brown up afterwards or did you just see kind of green leaves with white powder on the surface and wasn't on the upper surface of the leaf or the lower surface Italy\nIf a white powdery um coverage as well a flower\nOkay it's probably powdery mildew and we had a relatively good season for that in certain areas ... tend to do better when we have somewhat dry conditions but really high humidity\nSo it's often times are pretty cosmetic disease so I wouldn't worry too much about it unless you're seeing a lot of leaf browning associated with powdered milk as we sometimes see that when we get powdery mildew on flocks are minard as [noise]\nBut I have not seen really severe pottery mildew on black eyed Susan so I Would be patient with it um if you can send things around that particular plant open up the Airflow that oftentimes can reduce the humidity and you'll have fewer problems\nWith powdery mildew there are some or fungicides options if you really want to go that route or we do have kind of a home remedy that we sometimes recommend this based on some research\nOut of Cornell University\nIt's a tablespoon and a half of baking soda\nYou can get off your kitchen shelf\nAnd then a tape of three tablespoons of a lightweight horticultural oil these are paraffin based oils and mix set in a gallon of water but you need to apply the this concoction before you see any symptoms to preventative treatment\nAnd that can sometimes get give you some control of powdered milk juice or it may simply be that we just had a great season for the disease I Would you may not want to treat next year see what happens there may be that the plan to look perfectly fine 'cause Potter don't lose their severity can vary from year to year\nTheir ego Wendy thank you so much for calling appreciate your call Bryan Adelson our against a director of the plant disease diagnostic clinic in the department of plant pathology at the W.

P. R. dot org\nAnd speaking of ah our ideas network pay a page Jose email as sent a picture of photo and he wonders if his for his disease the tips are losing needles and that shows up pretty\nWell here um yeah my thought when I look at that as it might more likely be an insect problem there may have been some larvae um that and that we're feeding on those needles it could possibly be disease\nWhat's interesting is that it looks like the needles near the tip and also the bud looks pretty good from what I can tell from the photos so\nUm if it is a disease it was probably very much or um environment related so maybe a wet period last year when those needles got infected and then they've shut this year but again I Would get out there early next season and watch for any larvae that might be associated with the new or the last year's needles yeah I think you're right and we'll\nTake another call all league in rice lake attorney do you know thanks for waiting what's on your mind\nShow I actually I just felt like it is a great place to pledge also according to first get\nIt get so oh so how do you play it will also or ... or ...\nOr ... or ... focused struggle pledge it will cause a problem you\nKnow I'm not aware of any fungal pathogens that are moved around by honeybees but certainly there is a major bacterial pathogens penny muse can move around and that's the one that causes fire blight on apples and pears how when you have a tree that's infected with this organism typically in the spring\nThere will be cracks in the bark and then he gets his losing material that comes out and it's a combination of plant sap and bacterial cells\nAnd honeybees like to feed on that it's quite nutritious for them in in the process they get the bacterium on their bodies\nAnd then when they pollinate they actually dropped the bacterium end of the neck trees on the flowers and then it gets into the tips of the branches and you get this branch tip die back and that can be quite serious disease or for Apple's crab apples pairs a lot of other different types of rose Asia's plants as well\nSo that's an example where a honeybee can cause a pathogen but it's not fungal if you look at the other way around are there other insects that can move from pathogens around yes indeed and kind of the classic examples\nOf two diseases where there are insects involves would be Dutch disease where there are\nFungus around they tunnel into lay their eggs and if the tree happens to be infected they can pick up spores and then move that the pathogen from tree to tree\nAnd then also oh quotes is another disease where the pathogen can be moved around by insects in particular ... that will visit the trees pick up the fungus and then if you have an injured trees are attracted to the wound and they'll drop the fungus off as they visit the wound did\nDid you mentioned molds I he he asked about molds and I'm a yeah molds are basically of fungi so I'm not ... you know certainly they could be moving spores of these organisms around the question is whether or not they're actually disease causing organisms and again I I'm trying to dredge my memory is there any\nFungal pathogens that are moved around by honeybee specifically that may very well be but there are none that popped into my mind is is I'm thinking here it's really that fire blight that's the classic example and that specter all all like thank you so much for calling appreciate it as Sam in Madison it's your turn Hi Sam\nHi Brian and Larry I'm I have a number of trees on my property at I lost a hand old too old well what should I expect a tree service it when they remove the oak tree or prevent the spread to other trees in the area\nHow close are those trees together well my first question is do you know for sure that it's over ... have you had the trees actually asked it for oh quilt\nHaven't had the tested by their red oak and showed all the common signs of of wealth they died very quickly OK\nI'm that's certainly a possibility by due caution folks that before you jump to the conclusion that you have a quote that you get a test on 'em because there are other things that potentially can mimic oh quilts all want us to line chest that bore which is an insect pests that will come in on trees that are under stress and can in very short order kill those trees\nWe do have another fungal pathogen\nThat can cause issues although it's usually a slower death um the pathogen has called our malaria\nAnd it's a mushroom producer it produces these really weird\nShoestring or ... like structures that girl out from an infected tree and kind of search for other routes systems too in fact um I Would suggest probably getting a confirmatory test or before you jump to that conclusion let's assume that it is a quilt\nIf you have other red oaks or so red oaks or the ... one of the oaks with kind of pointed Loeb leaves if you have other pointed Loeb oaks in your yard those trees could be re crafted\nAnd so once the local fungus gets into one tree can actually move from tree to tree via ... craft\nNow there are also what's called the wider group of folks which have the rounded lobes those tend to pretty frequently re craft as well you can occasionally get ... between the pointed lobes and the rounded loathed um folks as well so you could get some transmission between both of those those are a little bit less common [noise]\nAh but you could have trees that are already infected in your yard that just aren't showing symptoms right now and Larry's question about how far away the trees are how that will determine whether or not there Rick crafted so how large a property do you have and how close to the trees\nAre a lot about two acres adding um they're all fairly forced grown although they're they're pretty close up I'd assume that there would be for graft I don't know if I tried to round them would help um ...\nYeah we do oftentimes recommend trench being bought one of the another reason to make sure that you know that you have ... is our malaria disease that I mentioned if you do that ... to sever the regrets senior actually dealing with our malaria and you can make our malaria worse because that's on his oftentimes enters into trees through wounds and roots\nAnd again I just see this box with light is getting progressively worse here in the state it's not going to go away\nAnd uh if you want to see some scary photos just do a search on box with blight ... put in a state on the east coast Maryland for example\nYou know see these properties that are just loaded with box words that are all basically dead from the boy and I did a program at over gardens this year and I was shocked at how many box words they have there and they're just going to have to think about probably replacing some of those eventually as well [noise]\nThere you go just thank you so much for calling appreciate your call I I Want to give done in Appleton a chance to join in done hello to you\nOne way or you can improve habitat issue fertilizer trees and fertilizer in the late\n... well you know I I wouldn't I wouldn't fertilize a I usually don't recommend fertilizing trees and shrubs unless you have a soil test that says that they need to be fertilized\nSo and definitely I Would never fertilize late in the fall because what you oftentimes Dubai fertilizing particularly with nitrogen as you keep the trees physiologically active so they don't harden off properly for the fall and you can make them more prone to winter injury\nSo I I Do not do that and that at all\nMy ankle and quite frankly don't necessarily think that you would probably need to fertilize folks or other trees period particularly in a forested area yeah for sure you might want to send a letter to the editor you ask them where they got that information 'cause that's a very very odd recommendation\nIn my mind yeah it's it it is indeed Don thank you so much for calling appreciated and please do send a note to the editor of about that because you don't want people doing that\nOr in Greenfield it's your turn high [noise] are are grown and\nTell them and uh and to protect you might call um it's ... ... S C I F R I and my question we have an indoor of him as a two part question I Hope I'm a lemon tree that it did their food\nInto that than we ate from those who really delicious Clinton is it's a small the inside of ...\nAnd I'm a last kid and meaning ... last fall and go this fold it did not there in your food\nWe took it outside in the summertime it does look to have\nA healthy and leaves but nothing coming out of it\nDid you um how how old is the tree\nOh I think probably I mean we had to turn around five years\nNow since I Am you know you have you um [noise] and large the pot at all\nYeah we did we did I understand you have the line with you I remember before I'm your daughter called apply me with\nJust yeah [laughter] [laughter] okay and\nUh uh ... and we did we when we bought it and are they gonna pots um at one point to get to have and this is before the gloom last time they have a um what it looks like a ... some kind of residual on ...\nAnd now we translate down totally on them to go back and as I said it looks like healthy leave 'em but uh nothing no blooming were where\nWere you fertilizing it at all\nI did um probably a month and a half ago I'm One of those like medical uh I'm ... and and he was actually a little bit less than that of commended amount to um\nOh that's probably good and less fertilizers probably\nUm maybe bettering your circumstance if if the if it's really fertile it's possible that's why it's not producing fruit you get leaves them set of flowers and also I'm Wondering if the pruning you print it off the bugs that may have turned off the flower buds\nUm well I mean we trying to get rid of whatever that was ... ... uh and uh I mean did it go more a new branch has a new leaves and so forth salt\nSo I I Would and you did that this past year so right\nI Would I Would hold on and it's good and healthy or get it inside or put it on some girl lights maybe if you can that's what I Do with why me\nAnd I'm I'm willing to bet\nThat you're going to get some flowers are you're going to get some more lemons again it may just have ... it may just take a year given the pruning had to do\n\nQuestion I had a um a granite which are again in the past it did bloom and you get those little tiny or you know it's just that but I Am I trying to enjoy it and then they all fall down and and right now it's losing all its lease\nOn this is we bought it and again a couple of weeks ago because it started getting a little bit colder at night and a and right now it's just I'm hardly any he's on it\nThat's probably a a function of late or when you bring it into the house you're you're losing a lot of light and it's very common\nLose their fully edge for a while now this one this a pomegranate may come back um but you need to give it as much light as you possibly can\nUh that that I wouldn't worry too much about it frankly I I think maybe I'm wrong you Brian do you have anything that\nOftentimes I'm not that familiar with pomegranate but again I've heard of other types of plants where they've been grown up outdoors and then you bring them in and that because of the change of environment they tend to shut leaves that just a matter of being a patient until they relief yep yep there you go so hang onto it [laughter]\nI sit there and hopefully you're going to get some uh lemons and hopefully your pomegranate plan is going to come back\nThank you very much for calling our guest today Brian Adelson director of the plant disease diagnostic clinic at the top of your Madison within the department of plant pathology I'm Larry Miller for garden talk here on the ideas network\n\nNext time in the people's pharmacy and ancient practice from India is getting enthusiastic support in the U.S\nYesterday trendy ... who\nCan senior citizens gain flexibility in strength by practicing yoga your questions and calls about yoga I mean people than at seven on the ideas network\nSupport for WPRI comes from the twenty fifth annual fall our tour fifty five artist working in their studios in and around and mineral point dodge ... spring green unbearable October nineteenth to the twenty first fall art tour dot com\nSupport also comes from Madison country day school and independent pre K through grade twelve college preparatory school fostering a lifelong love for learning in smaller class sizes open house November tend Madison country day dot org\nYou are listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

I Love [noise]\nJoseph mazer professor of mathematics and author of the math and men are going to [noise]\nWhen we come back we're going to look at what coincidences reveal about the mind in particular I'm fascinated by something I've observed in my own life when I experience a coincidence\nInvariably if the U.S more meaningful to me than it does to others this is hidden brain I'm not going to be done to\nAnd this is NPR\nHey it's like Burbank this week on live wire Jose Antonio Vargas who have the Pulitzer Prize but not the documents to live legally in the U.S if you were actually to compare what citizenship is I Would argue\nThat undocumented people exhibit of greater amount of citizenship that you can possibly imagine [noise]\nThat this week on my wire for PR I asked for right here on the ideas network [noise]\n\nFor Wisconsin Public radio comes from the second century endowment fund aboard designated endowments on providing ongoing financial support for WNPR in its second century of service to the resident\nStay up to date with WPRI politics podcast WPRI Shawn Johnson Laurel white and John K Wilson connect you to the Capitol every week listen to past episodes and subscribe at WPRI dot org slash politics\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

hidden brain I'm Shankar Vedantam I'm fascinated by coincidences and could listen for hours the stories about them but what is it that so fascinates us about these moments in life at the University of Chicago psychologist Nick Epley things he might have one answer he's the author of the book mind wise\nTo understand how they things about coincidences I Need to take a moment and explain his broader work to you first [noise]\nAt least book examines how we read the mental states and intentions of other people [noise]\nThis is a remarkably useful skill [noise] let me sometimes miss apply it we sometimes attribute intention allergy to things that aren't even living [noise] especially when they're out of the ordinary for example we don't personify a sunny day but we give hurricanes a name Katrina Sandy\nAndrew [noise] after Hurricane Katrina\nThe mayor of New Orleans said God must be mad at America [noise]\nFor centuries people have described intentional ... to natural forces we think storms droughts and earthquakes must have a mind of their own [noise]\nThis general tendency to explain behaviors in terms of purpose or intent or or meaning is often quite a successful thing to do\nTurns out we live with other people who do have intentions and goals and foresight and planning and meaning behind their actions and so by and large that tendency to make those kinds of attribution to other people it was a good way to learn about each other is a good way to explain why are the people did something in the past\nTo predict how they're likely to behave in the future but the problem with\nAny kind of good tool is that sometimes we use it a little too much and that's what happens in these cases where you're trying to explain\nThe behavior of something that doesn't really have\nA sensible explanation for some random event some chance occurrence some physical anomaly some weather pattern or that crops up that might not in fact have have a mind behind that\nThis is why we're fascinated by robots that move in unpredictable ways\nWhat we found was that when people were given a description of an object that made it sound unpredictable like you couldn't anticipate its actions that's\nWhen people described it reported that have had more mental states they were more willing to say that the object has a mind of its own that it has intentions for instance and I don't think this is totally counter intuitive that that is a mind if you if you see for instance have billiard ball sitting on a table\nAnd other ball comes along and hits it and that ball rolls off\nAnything to explain that but if you've got a ball sitting on a table and suddenly starts rolling around randomly\nWell then you've got something to explain and in these cases\nSometimes people look to the inside of an agent give it a mind maybe the ball is possessed maybe there's a demon controlling it a moving it around the table sometimes people attribute of mind or something when it's not there but they do that as an effort to explain\nWhat's going on in this uh autonomous and this autonomous agent and they're more likely to do that when an age of behave somewhat unpredictably\nI was over at a friend's house and uh my friend has a wonderful pool and um he had set up\nThis underwater Roomba for the lack of a better term to clean the bottom of the pools that sort of rolls around the bottom of the pool and it goes into completely random fashion right so just runs for a couple of hours of cleaning the bottom of the pool and I find myself fascinated just watching it because the fact that you can't predict what it's going to do next\nMakes it just more interesting and more a lot even away then something that moves in a very predictable fashion\nAbsolutely something that moves robotically very predictably that is just a mindless machine but when you're rumors going around randomly well\nNow it wants to go over there a little bit not wants to move over here and now it realizes that didn't clean that side of the pool over there are things that we have randomly ... start to get a little sense of a mind that people are crazy you don't\nYou don't think it's like your mother writer or your your your uh you know your spouse whose vacuuming or the living room but it starts to look just a little bit more mindful in fact the rumors are good example people\nActually do name their room but as you can buy outfits to address it up\nOr if you Google this uh online you'll find all kinds of examples of people thinking of their room buzz having perhaps a little bit more of a mind than it really does\nI Want to talk to you that have been about the subject of coincidences and I thought of you and your work because it feels to me that when something unusual happens to us and we stop and we say\nThat is weird I was just reading this word in a book a second ago and someone in the room around me mentions the very same word and and it makes you stop and look up just like I stop and look at that underwater Roomba\nAbsolutely that's a case where something unusual happened was unpredictable and you try to explain it you can explain\nThese kinds of random coincidences in lots of different ways there are lots of different kinds of causal structures we might be able to put on it um but some of them involve giving it more meaning that it actually has\n[noise] this is what underwater room buzz have to do with coincidences [noise] like a robot that does something unexpected coincidences crowd for meaning or explanation because they are out of the ordinary we stopped to see patterns even when there aren't any\nMy favorite example of this in the world of psychology is actually phenomena first documented by my PHD advisor\nTom Gilovich having a brilliant psychologist traverse the illusion of the hot hand in fast [noise]\nMiss that basketball players get on a real\nPeople believe the basketball players get a hot ... and that there are times when they're on and the chance of making a faster it's higher after they've just made one then after they've just missile at least in saying basketball players don't have to treat\nWhich is the idea that many biased things are unconscious and one very well studied bias was ... value in the cell favorably protecting the self and so forth and so we simply got the idea that there are several different things that at least to some degree reflect the preference for the self an attraction to things that resemble the self\nLike having an affinity for someone with the same but stay or someone with the same name or even going into a profession that sounds like an echo off your name\nSo we were originally looked at whether people name Denis or Denise gravitate toward dentistry but we learned pretty quickly that it's really hard to get data on those things so you know there aren't great director ease of medical professionals\nThere is a guy named able who was able to document that was a review on this paper and I said no every time you say this I'm going to just jump in and say a guy named able who was able to do something he was able to do a lot of things he showed that people whose last name is Dr or whose last name is the word lawyer named lawyer gravitated toward those two professions\nThere are lots of other examples Brett looked at a massive database of millions of Americans names for the recently released Nineteen forties senses to examine if they were brought patterns like\nCarpenters working in carpentry bakers working as bakers butchers working as poachers\nMiners workings minor masons workings Mason so we looked at every surname there is a currently at the top two thousand ... names that happens to be a career name and we looked at all of them they're laughing at them that are pretty common I just listed a few and for every single surname in the Nineteen forties census with something like a\nI think it's a hundred and thirty million people we were able to show that for every single surname there was at least a week tendency for people to gravitate toward careers that perfectly matched their last names so the\nObvious thing to say of course is that the reason you have a slightly larger number of carpenters be carpenters is that the name\nFamilies who were in carpentry and so there is some kind of ancestral connection to the profession that is driving both names and the choices\nQuite possibly but if you do the math you pretty quickly say it gets to be a pretty tiny percentage of people so if you assume that even over ten generations\nThere's a fifty percent chance that you did what your dad did and a fifty percent chance that he did what his grandfather did which is probably higher than reality you're talking about a a probability of less than one thousand already over ten generations in other words surname are so old\nAnd they change hands you know when a woman named carpenter Marin County farmer for example that that's really it it really just can't account for an effect anywhere near this magnitude\n\nRent ... looked at large datasets in public records like the Social Security deaths index or state marriage records databases with information about millions of Americans and he and his fellow researchers have seen all kinds of funny effects\nLike for example one listener called in to say she and her husband we're both born on the twenty fifth day of different months this isn't as common as you might think\nBeyond what you might expect by chance\nThere's about seven percent bias in that direction so if you should have a thousand people doing that you have a thousand Seventy people doing that\nIf that doesn't sound like a lot you're right you should think of them ... as a tiny invisible nudge it won't shape what everyone does all the time but it does shape what some people do some of the time it's when you multiply these small effects over hundreds of millions of people that you start to see lots of examples\nBrits says that if you really love your birthday the effect gets even larger\nOr operational definition of really loving your birthday was getting married on your birthday number so if you got married on the thirteenth of the month you were quite a bit more likely to marry another person who also had the number Thirteen as his birthday them\nAgain bread calls this an implicit bias for a reason you may not be consciously choosing things as important as your spouse\nOr your profession or the place you call home based on arbitrary factors like your name or your birthday he thinks the bias comes about simply because we like our names in our butts days and have positive associations with that\nAnd so you just associate your name with all the wonderful things that come along with that and the the best bit of evidence I have that I've never bothered to publish this there's one part of people's names I don't like that much and that's their middle names you know the the joke about that as the sole purpose of a child's middle name it's not what he's really in trouble\nAnd my additional come as no if he might be a serial killer someday right in the middle name is not nearly as love this the first or the last name people feel very ambivalent about their middle name\nThey can be other reasons for ambivalence sometimes we dislike it with another person has the same but day if you were born on April twentieth you might hate the fact Hitler was born on that day to\n... find that if a consumer product happens to have your name on it but as poorly belt you are more likely to hate that product people dislike seeing something inferior in the world that has that name on it\n\nAs Britain and I were talking I realized something a little uncomfortable\nThat I myself had fallen prey to ... you know as as you're talking right now I'm realizing something about myself from the very first time there is a there was a philosopher in India whose name was ... my name and he actually taught\nA philosophy that is known as ... and I I've always being drawn to the fact that\nI find the philosophy of aid that that would be very interesting and the fact that Shankar I taught that philosophy\nI thought was just charming but now as I'm listening to you save this I'm realizing that\nRead his work very well and it truly is wonderful it's brilliant so I think in your jak decision at the same time it does make you think though that absolutely yes has this ever happened to you ... do you ever think about yourself in a city ... affecting we're getting a little\nPersonal here but uh I I I Can't resist being a little bit personal I Would say the probably the most dramatic example is that my son Matthew I'm his his last things Poland his mother's last name was pulling my lessons Pelham and I entered a relationship with her before I developed this did\nNot after I developed a theory to validate the so so your pal them and you got into a relationship with the woman named pulled in Poland and we are very different in most other ways that's about as much as I said are you saying that the names played some kind of a role I I have\nTo think it did have to think and we were from different backgrounds different um different religions I mean where we come from very different worlds and yet I was very attracted to her\nWhere she had she was attracted to me right yeah [laughter]\nI said I understand why you would sort of called this charming and I think if you do this work for a while\nThere is a certain smile that comes to your face as you sort of look at these connections and you're so to see\nYou you understand sort of the choices that human beings make but I Do think there's something disturbing about it because I think there is a very strong sense that I think most of us have I have the sense even though I've been covering the world of the unconscious mind for the last ten years\nI have the sense that my choice to deliberate choices that I've thought about that my ... and making them intentionally and the idea that you're coming in and telling me that they have these hidden factors that come in and change how I think about myself and he's a disturbing idea it is a little bit\nDisturbing and of course most people do what you and I did which said well of course that applies to the rest of all but I in particular but never fall prey to re implicit racial bias room solicitor you get to them so most of us do tend to sort of separate ourselves from even our own findings\nBut I've become in the past decade or so comfortable enough for the study that I have to\nAdmit that I really never know for sure exactly why did something I mean sometimes I have a pretty good idea but I don't I certainly don't kid myself anymore to say that I even usually know what why and do what I Do I mean there's just too much research and much of what you've documented in reporting on\nThat show that by sees were completely unaware of not just sometimes powerfully drive us in very\nParticular direction so I think I've just kind of let go of it ... it was disturbing to me when I first began to study it the Serbian as well as delightful and now it's become more delightful unless disturbing\n\nSomehow you're wondering how does any of this matter [noise] who cares if people born on the twenty third of September married those born on the twenty third of July\nWho cares if someone named Betsy carpet gravitates to what's carpentry why does it matter if I prefer a philosopher whose name is similar to my own\nQuestions about the degree to which we have free will so I think some people who have pretty negative reactions to this work are very threatened by it and the sense that it suggests that very important decisions\nHad at least a little nudging influence\nUm based on things that you're completely unaware of so people are more likely than they should be by chance to marry another person who happens to share their birthday number that's not an objectively great reason to get married you should get married because you shared values you're both Republicans you're both rabid Marxist but\nLearning that these subtle little influences can affect what you do a apparently to some people's ... I find it delightful but some people find it pretty threatening I don't think that it proves that there is no such things free well but it to me it does suggest that we don't always have free will sometimes we make\nThat we told ourself when really the more powerful underlying reason is something we could have never put our fingers on\nAnd this isn't just a matter of being drawn to someone who shares your birthday in general we tend to prefer things and people who have something to do with us and that can be a big problem", "show_name": "People's Pharmacy", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "13"}
