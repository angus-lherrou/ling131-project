guard and what are some of the plants that that actually do well after the first frost\nThat case better are still grow and it's kind of well the one that there's a couple that taste\nBetter actually oh yeah yeah there's a lot of them the taste a lot better after they've gotten a couple of Ross and most of the crops are actually that way I'm most notably the ... and the carrots because they're so closely related but\nSome of the other ones like even ... and uh the scars on or people that have never heard of that one [laughter]\nUm but there's there's a few of those root crops that really they're meant to be left in the ground until after a foster to before they get full flavor because they're really um by any old plant so they're meant to over winter and then formed their flowers next year\nSo they don't start changing over starches and into sugars until after they've basically gotten frozen\nYou know I think by carrots there is nothing better than some carrots out of the garden after like a couple of frost man's we'd\n[noise] yup yeah in person inside of the same way and I get that gets few people who are new to ... call me in July and August and\nI got my apartments are so bland around there and not really mature yet and they really should I say for their the poster children for I'm not really being in full flavor until\nLate fall midwinter next spring [laughter]\nYeah well Brussels sprouts can be pretty good late as well\nOh yeah yeah they can handle pretty cold conditions um depending on where you're at in the state the growing season could be completely and utterly over at the right and then our neck of the woods where we got down to Seventeen degrees the other night and\nUm or if you're you know if you haven't gotten below about twenty four twenty five degree some of those ... crops that cabbage family plants they can still be going yet for quite a while so [noise]\nLooked like it has to do with a strong and I and I how how often they ... the water I does get cold at night but I Want to a storm and I don't want to mess up\nOkay well I'm I'm not a marriage counselor nor do I play one on the radio but uh\nThe butternut squash issue is that one's a little bit more clear cut quite honestly than the second question even though it may sound harder um we need to we need those winter squash is to be mature to be able to well to have full flavor for one thing but then also especially if we want to be able to store them\nSo maturity is very important um quite honestly it sounds like maturity might be about halfway between what your two perspectives are because we don't need everything to go down you know down as far as those vines going dead and dormant before we harvest them\nBut we do need to make sure that those fruit are fully mature and with butter not in particular usually\nI'm the fruits will have some green changes or green stripes on them\nAnd with some cult of ours butter or not they can actually unfortunately hold those green changes too long and then it makes it harder to judge when they're mature but\nWhen the stem of the that connects the fruit to to the vine starts turning color that's usually a good sign of fruit maturity\nUm the other side of this though is that butter not cannot handle getting frozen out in the garden or they will not store nearly as well as they should have so like again up in my area up here\nIf you still have butternut squash out in the garden there they're not worthless but they're not going to a store or they're going to need to be taken in and used as soon as you can because those they're rinds have are not going to be able to hard enough correctly because the material just simply got too cold [noise]\nUm [noise] the shrubs I'm certainly want to let them go dormant naturally uh and that should be happening in response to Dale links um even in ... so you know the temperatures are going to be better for growth there but the day length is going to dictate ... processes\nSo if you just water them lately relatively normally until you\nIf you're going to over winter them into who pose they need to have a little bit of moisture available but if you over water them of course that can lead to more chance ... and stuff like that so to make sure you have well drained containers and all and the normal things that we would probably talk about\nBut then try to keep that soil just barely moist over the course of the winter without overdoing it\nAnd thank you very much for calling appreciate your call a Carlene [noise] Scotty Reiss our guest today you W

R. dot org and like us on Facebook at the ideas network\nYou're listening to guard and talk you're on the ideas network Larry me there with my guest Scott Rice you W extension crops soils horticulture agent for ... and O'Connell counties and you can join you they actually have to open minds at one eight hundred six four to one two three four\nOr go ahead and email us at ideas that WPRI dot org surely in the ... has a question let's go there [noise]\nYeah I have a question for you sure that the frontier garden hard it's hard enough for what am I\nOkay I'm potatoes are one of those ... or vegetables that are a little bit picky on their temperatures for for a long term storage at least they they prefer a cool temperatures but not quite as cold as some of the other things\nSo they want to be stored you know in those upper thirties really low forties so that's you know ... ... settlers are usually pretty good for them sometimes depending on the setting they may get a little bit too cool but and we we certainly can't let a potatoes freeze because they're actually stem\nMaterial that's living so we can't let them freeze or they won't um hold their quality at all\nUm but a key thing with putting something like potatoes or any other long term storage um type of produce in a prior to storage is actually ... proper harvesting and proper selection of the the ones that you can put into storage so [noise]\nUm harvest things with the proper time or conditions you know as we were kind of talking about with a butternut squash just a few moments ago\nBut then also sort of hard to make sure that you're not trying to put anything into storage that isn't to mature that isn't a proper size or that has any bruises or cuts are scratches or insect holes or anything like that or ground squirrel bites her chipmunk fights or something like that into it\nUm because those are and not going to stores well they're much more likely to have a secondary ride a organisms get in and then it can spread throughout the entire storage that way\n[noise] and um there is nothing almost nothing worse than the smell of our rotting potato\nYeah in rotting potatoes riding tomatoes they're All right up there with\nHave a root cellar a you know that's a question I'm Randy had as well just in general is storing root vegetables have you don't have a rude salary kind of I think all the things you talked about applied to probably any a route vegetable yup\nYup and the the true root vegetables actually like it a little bit cooler than potatoes they prefer really write down close to freezing but without men being under freezing consistently so you know that thirty two to thirty four thirty five degree range is best for the the root crops [noise]\nUm if you don't have a root cellar you know you can either you can do a couple of different things if you don't have the outside space to\nActually you can actually tried digging a pet 'em and put rock or something that will drain in the bottom of it and then\nPut your stuff in there and close it back over and then the problem with something like that is that when you open it up you have to use everything that's in there so don't have to do the amounts of storage that you put into it\nSo that's one option it does work fairly well\nUm but um we can get pretty good storage out of just paying attention to light and temperature consistency so if you have a basement or across space\nOr even just the cooler spots in your house or apartment or condo or whatever it is that you live in\nThe the key for ... for storage is consistency it's even more important than perfection a lot of times I'm just have things that are the coolest inconsistent ah most consistent sorry temperature that you can have in most consistent humidity and they will store at least reasonably well\nYou know if it's a little too warm for them they want a store as long but they will still ... store for several weeks or maybe even month\nI'm In for the root crops make sure they're also in the dark\nUm squash is pumpkins things like that they can handle light and still store well but the root crops cannot and they need to be in the dark as well\n[noise] so my purple potatoes could I stick to them and they second refrigerator\nIf they if it's warm enough yeah I'm very fridges are not fantastic storage things for some things but uh that it would work as long as you stay up you know like I say in those upper thirties\nOkay or if they're ... yeah surely thank you so much for calling appreciate your call let's turn to Harold in burn a more next Hi Harold\nLloyd all\n... good morning to you what's on your mind\nOr just general hope for in a storage which are like that for you just got one writer that record some years but\nHow close are we not get fired up together I just got my yesterday us for two to three weeks later I'm gay or straight mulch horse trading like crazy\n[laughter] yeah of course it was so\nWell I'm mad as you already mentioned I mean planting were on the late side of planting for garlic um we're not completely out of the window we can still get away with it but now we're\nWe're probably at the point where we're going to be sacrificing a little bit on size for what they're going to be able to get to next year because they're not going to be able to form the root system that we want them to so\nNormally in the state of Wisconsin are you know you're going to find some different answers to this question but\nI'm the iron northern Wisconsin where usually looking at the last ten to Fifteen days of September and the first ten to Fifteen days of October is our prime planting time for garlic\nIs it possible that you're nuts I don't know I I I'm a question about that oh okay okay yeah you're a gardener in Wisconsin yeah we we all have to be a little bit nuts um anyway are okay is it ... I don't\nDiscount any possibility I guess is as one blonde thing\nIs it likely that they're on the same plants no on odds are good that either you've got a a secondary plant that came up right next to it because tomato plants should not be able to produce two different types of fruit on the same plant okay\nNow the only way that they theoretically can do that is if they were grafted and they had a you know centrally ended up having to different plans grafted onto one\nAt doesn't usually work very well either but I'm not because of the maternal fruit dominance that tomatoes have they should only be able to to have one type of fruit per plant um so that's about the only thing I can say to that without seeing the situation\nThere you go to obey Joel and hazel hers then as an email he has some Norway spruce seedlings and pots they're two inch seedlings are shitty keep them over winter in northern Wisconsin hazel hers is pretty far north\n... I'm well if you know where they're going to go planting them yet is probably the simplest route quite honestly because we you know we still have a a month or so for them to establish the rest of their root system that they would need\nUm otherwise you're going to need to just have them in a fairly consistent environment um you know they can over winter in a house if you have enough space for um er and but you can't ... or put them into dark conditions because they are a evergreen conifer\nGrowing all year long so I'm ... and they need to have sunlight or and make some ... originally yeah um they don't need to have exceptionally high quality light but they need to have light all year long and then moisture for growing so\nI say it's a you can just need to pick which is the best situation for you if you don't want to put them inside and but really don't have a space for them outside either\nOne thing that you could do is just literally plant the pots when you know a day go trench essentially put the parts in the ground and then covered them back up with soil it makes transplanting a little bit less fun next spring but it's a great way to over winter plants with a lot less work than trying to get hold them over in the house\nAnd let's now turn to carry in Michigan Hi Carrie\n... Hi I'm calling about um we have a tree planting a yard and a lot of them have these little flowers ...\nUm well what do you think that we have the different ... and others have\nWell I got a couple of gases but I'll be blunt and say that that's probably about all I can give you a um I I Know enough about those that species to be dangerous might be the best way to say it\nUm it's possible that it just simply hasn't gotten mature enough um there are some of those ah in some cult of ours may have different ages as far as when they're able to start blooming\nI'm as sunlight could be part of it or conditions you know if it's experiencing stress or not getting enough sunlight maybe it just doesn't have enough energy to foreign buds\nUm that might be one of those were a need to have either a little bit of patience or get a little bit more detailed information you know depending on which county you're in in in Michigan\nA ... there are a few home horticulture educators available through the MSU extension system otherwise you know we don't check ID's at the border so human contact any you W extension people too and\nWith a little bit more detail and we can hopefully get that help or help you get that figure it out\nYeah there we go thank you very much for calling and let's see we'll turn to a gym in camp Douglas Hi Jim\nVery brief then I'll just get your response\nI'm I've been trying to grocery cucumbers tomatoes and some treat Buckeye each district a buck a foot gardening soil that fertilized during those bucket I Can't get him to get started but once they come out and the vice\nTrust show up those are the fruits and vegetables just seemed to be what they would be if I Would plant will go out\nMhm okay uh well with with any type of containerize grow situation there's always a few different possibilities and it it takes a little bit of detective work a lot of times to figure out for sure which one is is the most likely culprit\nI'm obviously it can be water consistency because we've containerize plants can dry out really fast you know so if we don't have a\nAn actual watering system in a ... system um that can be part of it um other parts can be as far as you what do we really have available for nutrients um cucumbers and tomatoes are both ones that need a fair amount of calcium\nAnd consistent water availability for the fruit to not get ... or to have other issues with a fruit maturity so\nI'm calcium content is a is such as always a chance for a problem to occur within containerize vegetables and fruits so um that would be something to think about and maybe a new dad I'm you know a quarter cup to half a couple of lime into your\nIf you have already done that and then again you look at the rest of the plant to are we seeing any other symptoms that could be related to nutrient deficiencies\nBecause you know a lot of our containerize situations even though we may start with really good stuff to start with it can just run out of their own faster than in a in a garden setting the pleasure it doesn't have the uh insurance essentially of the neighboring soil and the the the sub soil so\nI I think about those things is my first possibilities and then kind of go from there with you know maybe called diverse election because there are some that are better served in those restricted ... girl situations than others so there are some other things like that to think about to\nThank you Jim pre she ate the call Scott ... is our guest today you W extension crops soils in horticulture agent for Mary Annette and all ... counties I'm Larry Miller for garden talk here on the ideas network\nI'm Terry ... next time when the people's pharmacy find out what you can do to keep your bones strong should we getting are kept\nWhat about magnesium and vitamin D are there other than that helps build bones spring examining nutrition research for bone health next people pharmacy at seven\nOn the ideas network [noise]\nSupport for the WPRI Mike Simon's and investigative reporting fellowship is provided in part by a gift from Frank Ellen Mary eat nickel lay the Mike Simons an investigative reporting fellowship helps WPRI provide in depth the news coverage throughout Wisconsin\nSupport also comes from S.

R. dot org and like us on Facebook at the ideas network\nThis is hidden brain I'm Shankar Vedantam we start today with an account of two communities one is liberal the other conservative\nI Want you to guess which is where\nPatriotism man respect it would be a very rural face educational system the houses would be fairly similar\nKept in a beautifully green and mowed the town of the class with lots of churches that's down one [noise]\nHere's town to the schools would be based more on stereotypes are all kinds of things rather than than real memory\nPeople would prefer older houses with wooden floors or rather than wall to wall carpeting um they would keep the yards natural um lots of bars and community theaters and foreign films are more of those and churches that was easy right\nConservatives like order liberals embraced ambiguity now you may be rolling your eyes are even getting angry at these stereotypes but we all know there's more than a grain of truth to them so how did these two towns which I guess today refers to as liberal bill and conservative and\nGet this way when most of us think about how we came to our political views we tend to have a straightforward explanation we use our upbringing in life experiences as a basis for a political beliefs we imagine\nThat our parents teachers in friends shape our views on everything from taxes and the economy to immigration and national security [noise] but what if I told you there's something deeper to those attitudes drives that shaped the music we listened to the food we eat the politicians we elect\nThis week on hidden brain how the partisan divide in our country might arise not just from our upbringing and lived experiences\nFrom biology [noise]\nA regular basis right before an election someone was Sharon article with me about how science proves that the brains of liberals\nAre stunted or post on Twitter was say Republicans are less intelligent than Democrats\nThese claims obscure something far more interesting and far more accurate there are genuine psychological differences between liberals and conservatives understanding these differences can give us fresh insight into our political conflicts\nJohn hitting as a political scientist at the University of Nebraska Lincoln he has spent many years studying the psychological and newer logical differences\nBetween liberals and conservatives he is co author of the book predisposed liberals conservatives and the biology of political differences John welcome to hidden brain thank you Shankar pleasure to be with you when\nMost of us think about how we came to our political views John we have a relatively straightforward explanation that has to do with our upbringing and background how does that theory go well [noise]\nWhatever ask my students were their political views come from the first thing I say it was our parents and I think we have the sense that those views that our parents have passed along or supplemented by those you know from a clergy member I trust the relative\nNow it's important to stipulate you know John that it's entirely possible these politicians they might indeed be saying things that are just politically strategic but how my differences in threat perception shaped the way liberals and conservatives in general think about the subject of immigration\nYeah I really think you know immigration defense or police law and order but I think that's just really at the core of of who we are and at the core of political differences\nSo you know if I Am a person like Wayne LaPierre who uh who feels these threats and thinks they're all around us and it seems to me I Would want a set of policies put forward by our government that helps to reduce those threats and how am I going to do this\nI'm going to do it by allowing people to be well armed I'm going to do it by spending a lot on defense I'm going to empower police or I'm going to have the death penalty I'm going to not allow immigrants to come here or if they do they're going to be extremely vetted as the president wants to\nSo you know those I think to a threat sensitive mindset are steps that you know they only make sense does it can't really understand why anybody would be opposed to those kinds of things because this would help us to be a safer place\n\nThere are all kinds of confounding factors when it comes to studying how politicians speak in the actual legal considerations that are difficult to disentangle from psychological and biological traits but John another study these differences in experimental settings\nJohn one should liberals and conservatives positive and negative pictures\nAnd he found they reacted very differently a\nPositive picture it'd be something like a beautiful sunset or somebody enjoying themselves on a ski slope I'm happy child a negative picture would be things like I'm a house or just been leveled by a hurricane um or a guy eating worms or children who are malnourished\nWe had people hooked up to some physiological devices I'm the most obvious one is uh like fraternal activity or skin conducting which is a common way of seeing if somebody's just having a reaction having a physiological arousal to that a stimulus\nAnd what we found is that uh people do have arousal when they see these kinds of images because they're they have some emotional content but we tend to find that liberals were more reactive to the positive images and conservatives are more reactive to the negative images\nI understand that in one brain imaging study that you've conducted\nAnd brain activation from even a single image was actually pretty good at being able to tell who was liberal and who was conservative [noise]\nThat's true then a a three or four studies that attempt to see if the brain activation patterns of liberals and conservatives is different and the one that we did it goes back to kind of our favorite thing was to show them these these different kinds of pictures actually we have the most luck with a\nPicture self mutilation ... uh and and you're right when we did that it was very easy to categorize people you know without knowing anything about them all in all week would look at was the brain scan results and we could be incredibly accurate knowing whether they're liberal or conservative just on the base about\nLiberals brains when they looked at\nA mutilation images were much more active in a part of the brain called the U.S to come out of sensory too\nAnd this is part of the brain that will will be activated if you suffer pain so if if I take him in the ... century would be active but it's also active if you see pain and others and so if you would see a movie of somebody's stepping on a rafting now goes right through their foot you're some at a sensory too it'd be active\nAnd what we saw in these in these brain scans was that liberals were more likely to have activation and matter of sensory too conservative\nDoesn't mean that conservatives are hard hearted uh just means that that things are happening differently when they see these different images\nNow you could argue that a lot of this research is ... you could also argue that a lot of the patterns that John and others find are consistent with the power of upbringing in shaping political preferences\nHere's how let's see I'm raised in a conservative home I learned to be politically conservative from my parents but my family also influences all kinds of other things about me that have nothing to do with politics the shape the kind of food I like to eat the kind of movies I like to watch the kind of sports I enjoy\nBy this line of reasoning the fact that liberals and conservatives are different on all manner of things is it about biology it just shows you how your family environment can affect lots of things about you\nKnow\nThere's a really interesting way to separate the effects of biology from the environment and think about fraternal an identical twins identical twins have identical genes fraternal twins has similar but not identical jeans if you follow a group of fraternal an identical twins\nEach twin Paris raised in the same household each pet it's the same food listens to the same conversations watches the same movies now if you find differences between identical twins as it grew\nAt fraternal twins as a group that suggest that biology not environment is a driver\nJohn what such studies revealed about political preferences\nWe were fortunate to have access to a data sets a very large loads of thousands and thousands of of twin Paris collected by a guy named Linda needs a long ago it's fairly dated data set\nA but it was a valuable one for us because it included lots of information about their political views\nAnd when we subject these data to the standard twin design approach we did and did a fine that their political views were quite heritable [noise] um although people oftentimes must read this our results suggested that maybe thirty or forty percent\nOf our political views or come from a genetic but known that bothered a lot of people and this was quite a controversial study and political science many people didn't like that at all\nUh and they tended to over interpret those results and make it sound like we were saying that everything was less genetic but you know if it's thirty four percent genetic that obviously is you know fifty sixty Seventy percent comes from the environment so all we're saying is that that genetic component is\nIn zero but apparently that was enough that at some people were upset about that [noise]\nIs a closer laying in the political orientation of identical twins\nThen into political orientation of fraternal twins and that tells you that there is some element of the biology some element of genetics that is driving political preferences\nExactly no that's well put an end again it's nice to compare political views with other kinds of things height for example turns out to be about eighty percent\nA heritable when you see these you know when you subject to the same kind of design personality traits are about fifty six percent political views thirty to forty percent I Would say\nOne of the big implications of all this this work besides just being interesting in itself is that it helps us I think think about the political conflicts we have\nWhich fresh inside a and and you've made the case that in many ways the more we are able to see the differences between groups of people as inherent or biological\nIn some ways it changes the way we think about those differences talk to me about that idea Jon\nYes when other traits have been understood to be biological I'm thinking of something like handed us you know we used to think that uh if you're a left handed that was just because you got into a lazy habits\nMy father was left handed and the teacher you know this long ago would beat him on the on the hand with a ruler whenever you wrote with his left hand train them to write with his right hand so we do that as as a ... something that need to be driven out\nUh of course now we understand that being left hand it is very biological this is something much deeper than just a a lazy habits\nOr or course you know the big one today would be sexual orientation when people realized that sexual orientation is a indeed biologically driven and not something that they just had decided to do\nA then people are much more tolerant of that so we were wondering if perhaps the same thing might happen with regard to politics if we realize that our political opponents were not simply being a lazy but rather what oriented to the world and a different fashion that maybe we would be a little bit more tolerant of them\nThat this is the only way we're going to get anywhere for at least understand where they're coming from even if we still might deeply disagree with their conclusions\nWhat would you say to critics who would say you know the the argument that psychological traits in biological differences are beneath a deep political conflicts doesn't make sense because\nWe didn't always have this deep divide in our country\nBetween liberals and conservatives there was a time when we had many many more people in the center of the most liberal Republican was off into the leftist more most conservative Democrat and you know there really has been a sorting of the political parties in recent years what explains this change especially over the last twenty Thirty years [noise]\nWhat I Would say to that argument is that I Believe we have always had\nThis very same division this very basic difference between people who are fairly sensitive to threats\nAnd think we need to be vigilant and those people who are more into experimentation and try new things [noise] I'm Ralph Waldo Emerson has a great quote I'm Sorry I Can't give it to you for bait 'em but it's basically that uh the division between those people who are supporters of tradition and those people who are supportive of the innovation is very old and a structure the world since time began\n\nJohn hitting as a political scientist at the University of Nebraska Lincoln here spent years studying the psychological and newer logical differences between liberals and conservatives along with Kevin Smith and John Alford he's the co author of the book predispose\nLiberals conservatives and the biology of political differences John thanks for joining me today on hidden brain [noise] thank you Shankar it was a pleasure to be with you [noise]\nIn a sense the southerners those who are are going to favor secession\nThey're more committed to the institution of slavery than to the national democracy and so when Lincoln is elected and he poses the expansion of slavery interestingly he didn't oppose slavery per se wasn't calling for abolition at that point but he didn't want to see slavery expand\nAnd that was a very controversial issue and many southerners who believe that the only way to maintain slavery was for it to continue to expand maintain political balance between free states and slave states\nThey couldn't really tolerate the idea that the president the United states would oppose the expansion of slavery and so although he was elected and I think they recognize that he was elected in the fence fair and square\nThey just couldn't accept him as president and so what you see is they're putting a policy issue in this case an entire world view and way of life revolving around the evils of slavery\nOf the democracy so now the conflict just to sense into rancor and violence and so I think it's an important lesson of how our differences can be a source of strength that they can also be in a credible\nSource of weakness and the question is do we have something in common that's holding us together most in most of American history the answers been yeah and that moment in history the answer was unfortunately absolutely no\nAnd\nI'm Wondering is one of the things you're implying when you talk about the difference between productive and destructive conflict is that when people have productive conflict there actually\nWent in to say I believe very strongly that I'm right\nBut I Want to at least concede the possibility that maybe there are others who have something of value or it may be that history will show in the future Twenty years from now there is something that I don't know\nAnd I'm Wondering if if this is potentially one of the implications of what you're talking about which is the difference between productive and destructive conflict\nIs that an productive conflict people say there's a chance that I could be wrong sometime in the future\nThey don't think that could be wrong there's this fence that if you believe in democracy so much\nThere's only so far you're willing to go and so you know if you think another analogy would be a family writes a family we you know every every family people fight the coral they disagree about all sorts of things but if there's loving the family the conflict only goes so far the love breaks down than actually the conflict convict the family [noise]\n\nAnd the twentieth century the bonds of that democracy what tested again when we come back the political upheavals are the Nineteen sixties\nAnd there are echoes
