P. R. dot org Sheila how does how does somebody um gain inspiration or how do you may be harder you gain inspiration for the things that you do in the gardens [noise] well\nYou know when you work in a public guard and there's a couple of challenges one would be the weather which you can control and the other one is to try to invent yourself every year and try to create something that people haven't seen before like kind of like oh I've never thought about that\nSo we're always I'm always hurts searching for inspiration and I developed some techniques along the way and how I kind of a kind of go about um design and some of my gardens author or where do you do well you know I think color is it's inspiring to ... they go to a garden center they see something they\nLike as far as the color and they need it they do not quite sure where they're going to put it\nBut they needed so color is very inspirational and so I work off color to like so we we have these large banners that hang from the front of the mansion in the show our exhibition for the summer and it really get inspired by the colors of those banners and try to incorporate some of those colors into our gardens\nAnd another thing I Do is just you know if you've ever look at your closet and look at the colors and your closet\nOh those are the color is that your your favorite right and so you're kind of some fabric could bear rolling the big inspiration and sometimes I one time I took a slash slash of ... of fabric and I actually designed a garden bed I'm based on the colors of that of that bad so\nColored stick color is is is a big motivator really\nAnd I know I also try to incorporate um some vegetables into my garden because you know they're small spaces and Peter on incorporate these spaces and ... and get production from a ... year olds\nAnd so I use a lot of vegetables and not only because of the form of the vegetables but also the color so like a plant for instance men verbal yeah ... ... against that green\nAnd so that's a really good drawer but leaks for vegetables that blue collar makes a nice a statement a nice bike\nAnd say oh gee I don't know and it's really easy grower and so you just plan and they go on and you have that blue contrast with the crane\nNow partially is another color I use that green it's hard to find that mounting shape a parsley so I use that a lot of edging\nWithin like inspired by vegetables and their colors and their forms\nSort of Iowa I'm thinking about my own closet it's there's a lot of back and [laughter]\nThere's not room there and I mean you have a black thumb [laughter] so black what was already well well what I Do with black\nWell let's see there's a lot of black grasses are coming out right now the seed pods of a lot of plants are black right yeah so yeah you know in our parking lot I kinda wanted to have a little surprise I planted rhubarb\nYou ever thought about planting the rhubarb as an ornamental no reds dams largely leaves all that had it all the time so then it creates at big mound\nYeah it's really fun you're from a good ideas aren't ya well we're just starting Larry [laughter]\nWell let's take some more\nCalls your enough about me dead in Merced a McFarland what about you what have you gotten mine for us\nSo I like flu thanks for the show a great show I have a soil questions for that I just wondered if your inspiration a discussion my inspiration for gardening comes from childhood memories\nIn my grandparents' farm and then my mom's a yard and that's how I get inspiration but I just wanted\nA A R name yeah ...\nSure I hit my spoiled of minimum vegetable garden and it slow and potassium and I are funnier phosphorus and maybe just a hint of nitrogen needed enough I add to chicken Lee or some other kind of meat or I could be adding more nitrogen and phosphorus as it can you have too much of those things\nWhere are you going to have too much phosphorus for sure\nYeah you know if there's one thing that's the most important and gardening it's soil\nSo yeah so and the soil makeup is that kind of interesting 'cause we have um gardens that's been around for a long time that really have lots of good nutrients and lots of good micro nutrients and then we have a new gardens that we just put in and they have chemically us suggested soil but it doesn't they don't grow plants as well as\nAs as the ones that we've been working on for a long time [noise] so um\n[noise] you know I think I'm\nDan Dan's probably looking at long term may be some long term used here I mean there is pretty easy to find\nA ... this day and age in fact the zoo illegal in some communities the cells slots for fertilizer as part of a a you know in in cities situations because of the runoff so there's a lot of fertilizer you can actually buy now that are nitrogen\nAnd potassium so there's there's that but you didn't build a soil organically as well and maybe that's a way to go\nWhat are you well I absolutely believe an organic soil build up um we actually in the top of our leaves them put them back into the garden and we also use come posted a sheet manure about I mean that's a growing really well for us one thing I worry about ... salt are too high\nI'm much rely compost achievement oh yeah ... that's what we kind of you just because it's available and and it's complicated for three years\nSo it's pretty it's kinda like gold gold last\nYeah yeah so maybe think about that a day on a compost the treatment or perhaps if you have available ah again something that's been couples that for a couple of years\nYou can purchase often purchase though that at um garden centers yeah that's right and that's right I go a long term on or I Would too I I think it's important you know most important part of your gardening\nDamn thank you appreciate the call very much and let's go to Britain and spring grove Wisconsin Hi Brittany\nHi how are ya grade pre she had to call\n[laughter] I have a ... tree\nThat my daughter from it said back in high school so it's been over ten years um we bring it in every winter and put it back out in the summer except getting quite large um last year I got that new show coming up so now I got\nAlmost ... trees growing in the same hot\nAnd very hot at this time of year how much can I ask 'em that ever grow out of out of us here in Wisconsin Illinois\nFor any of those are all very good question I don't think I've ever grown avocado I have\nI've done it I did it as a kid or try to go dimes as an adult but I\nSure as heck Britain they ever got one for help on for ten years when he got ...\nYeah maybe there are there are a native cactus in Wisconsin\nYou had to put the prickly pear prickly pears or something of that actually would survive the winter I mean I they ... they lived through the winter so that would be one plant I think I definitely think about\nThose yeah you know lotteries kinda crucial so it's kind of a tough spot to be in the\nOther or you might of just off the top of my head or are there are some uh I don't know if you do prairie plants very much but there are some prairie plants she was at a do fine with out a lot of water\nNo that's true they're they're rich go down so cheap and so they find water sources other places other than the shadow shallow elements so I Would look into prairie plants ... plants how has also look into grasses and um if it's a shady area you know houses are are pretty terrible\nTo tell them live I've got a living just can't anti and kill them yeah I can hardly kill 'em so are there and there are some really protracted hostages are out there as well that some of them even do well in a direct sun but\nYeah I saw them like a little shade yeah and then the seed homes would would be okay you know something that's more of a psyche land you know that holds modern sleeves usually do better and dry conditions but I think no matter what it is you're still going to have to water it\nProbably a little bit of water there I mean has certainly to get things going mark a and then let those roots kid down but\nPrickly pears are going to live on [noise] yeah they're they're they're uh they're pretty darn hearty so you've got a combination of ah four or five things that are Sheila I'm In I guess they threw went into a mention and use it\nI think well yeah you know just repeat the patterns you know or or yeah bring some colors back from your house back into the garden\nSo you said maybe along the house you might set a I'm a setting that might be what five feet to six eight feet and then you could repeat\nThat yeah you know the I think that your mind sense is that it needs to see something similar are repeating and so even though if you don't know what it is in your mind's just repeating patterns any like okay I'm okay with that and some repeating is something I use a lot in elements in an alley form but color\nHuh that help you mark yeah we're good thank you yeah thanks a lot for calling appreciate your call and all let's go to Ruth and ship all falls I Ruth\nHello\nThank you for taking my call sure I I I live in an area where we have a little prairie down below our us our big building and we're all out to plant in there and I'd like to plant wildflowers and they're [noise] this big grass is taken over part of it\nAnd it's not pretty guy grass it's ugly\nOh it really it doesn't have a lot of faith on it I don't see any value in it but I don't know how to get rid of it [noise]\nDo you have is that what is the area what it's clay OK okay\nCould be anything and who might not be a a native\nRight I'm playing a that's a hard one have you could um [noise]\nYou could get a phone or a picture say a a long shot and then a close up shot\nOf it and um send it in\nProbably I'm trying to think probably the I even the ... disease diagnostic clinic would be able to take a look at it identify it\nAnd or even your your county horticulture agent your county agar horticulture agent\nCould probably take a look at it and tell you\nWhat you would need to do to eliminate my guess is that it grows by under ground ... eyes on the rise or yeah and there's always going to be difficult to to get rid of to be a way out and I think\nYou need to get rid of it before you start putting your prairie plants and and there's gonna be a little more competition and if it's if it's that massive ... planting there it's kind of a girl or a relative and so I think in order to be successful while far it's I think you're going to take care of that crash and figure out what it is and how gross\nYeah you need to you need to find out what it is an hour grows and I think probably you're like I said your county ... horticulture region or maybe even sending went into our plant disease diagnostic clinic at U. W. photos at least they can probably tell you a little bit more about it\nEven though it's obviously not diseased at the moment they could identify the plants but the county agent would certainly almost for sure though\nSo good luck with that I appreciate your call Sheila glass ski is the curator of horticulture at pain art center and gardens in Osh Kosh our guest on guard and talk I'm Larry Miller you're on the ideas network\nNext time when the people's pharmacy find out what you can do for shore stiffed joints\nOr you need their hits getting you travel do you take Advil or leave or Tylenol to ease the discomfort Arthur downsize to such pain relievers and are there other options and your questions and calls about arthritis and the next people farming at seven on the ideas that would [noise]\nSupport for WPRI comes from American transmission company\nWe're into communities throughout Wisconsin ATC owns and operates the high voltage electric transmission system that helps keep the lights on business is running and communities strong\nWPRI pod cast let you hear programs whenever you want here shows like the best of our knowledge and the politics podcast you can find out more about all the WPRI podcasts by going to WPRI dot org slash podcast\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

through the first two years of Donald Trump's presidents and he just kept the support of the core group of voters who propelled them into the White House\n[noise] there's only one part of that for a minor league level that's not a politician\nThe approval of disorders often white an often working class has meant the Republican Party as a whole has to be loyal to Trump\nView Republicans running for high office can expect to win\nWithout the Trump base as Trump himself once famously said\nI could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose any voters okay\nThis week on hidden brain we explore two competing perspectives on Trump's supporters and their motivations one paints a sympathetic picture focusing on class divisions and economic pain this\nIs a group that seals belittled and ignored and you know what some level they're right\nThe other is more critical race as we all know it's such a fundamental cleavage in our society I think Republicans are

the twenty sixteen election I'm Wondering if you could paint a picture for me Joan of who you include in this group and how you distinguish them from the very wealthy and the poor\n[noise] um in order to understand American politics really for the past forty years you need to find three different groups\nOne is the poor I'm within meeting annual income of around I'm Nineteen thousand dollars that's the bottom thirty percent of Americans buy household income\nAnd then that topped the professional manager of the elite is the top twenty percent by household income um and I find that as top twenty percent is by household income with one college grad\nThe group that's being called the working class is the group in the middle the middle ... fifty three percent with the median household income in the in the seventies that's the group that's called the working class although they actually are the middle class\nYou have some startling statistics about wages in this middle group over the last half century uh what's happened to them economically uh starting let's in Nineteen Seventy\nSince Nineteen Seventy the wages and economic prospects of this group have absolute be tanked I'm actually more recent\nStatistics have come out since the book and the most dramatic is that virtually all Americans born in the Nineteen forties did better than their parents virtually all\nBut today it's less than half and this is the group whose economic prospects has really collapsed\nOne of them had showed up with a shopping bag for Macy's um and she was furious because she felt you know she's on\nPublic assistance and she can shop at Macy's and hike I Can't even afford shop at Macy's so that was part of it\nI'm also ... she was very angry when the the she was in head start she was teaching in ... as a head start teacher some of these um ladies were late and she was furious because she had to pay a dollar a minute\nTo her daycare which she paid for when she was late picking up her kid and they were making her late and they weren't paying\nWhite Americans white blue collar Americans tend to have quite a judgmental attitude towards the poor and they're judgmental attitude stems from their own self image of themselves as\nKeeping their nose clean keeping on the straight and narrow hard work everyday forty years straight whereas the poor are seen as kind of hard living drug sex

help when my father in law had dementia and they\nDeliver it to help and they deliver it quite efficiently but it was that was not her selection you know it doesn't hurt job to know that it's the job of the people were designing the programs and of the political elite to make sure that Americans know that and they have seriously dropped the ball\nOf the things that people have often noticed is that there is a political gap between urban areas in rural areas but one of the things I took away from your book is that the gap is really between people who are\nAnd people who are not going to be people who are very much at home working in Washington or New York or working tomorrow in London or shine guy\nBut there are also people in the u._k. and in the U.S who are routed to the communities in a way that's very different and in some ways they resent the people who are costs will politician because they can pick up and leave and they don't have sort of the same\nTies are the same obligations to local communities that they feel that they do\n[noise] um that's very very true I mean there is that it does map on to class but breaks it end Trump's election we're both a revolt of the areas that had been left behind\nFor example if you look at the ... the counties that voted for Clinton roughly five hundred counties did\nI'm twenty six hundred counties voted for Trump but the five hundred counties that voted for Clinton represent two thirds of GDP\nThat twenty six hundred counties that voted for Trump represent only one third the people who voted both for brags it and for Trump where those people who were left behind economically\nAnd left behind culturally as you point out because these are people who have these small very localized very deep rooted um clique networks of family and friends they've known forever\nDay actually social science studies show that this group is more focused on um community and solidarity in contrast to the professional managerial lead or more focused on individual achievement and self development\nWhen you think about the ways a blue collar America and the elites relate to their work uh I I Want to go back in some ways to the the extremes that your husband had with his former classmate\nIn some ways by asking what do you do a elites are asking what another yes the it's a it's a form of social display\nBut it's also a former saying work is really how you define who you are it's an important part of your identity whereas as you point out in the book for blue collar America work is really a means to an end\nWork is what you do to support your family um so it's complicated hard work is valued among both groups and that's one of the key ways we should begin to forge a bridge between these two groups\nBut the hard work is a matter of of of persevering and staying in that job despite the fact that you make kind of hate it in order to support your family and provide them with a settled family lives\nOn elites are completely defined by their jobs\nYou know what am I I and a lawyer I and a techie on this total self definition in terms of your job is one of the emblematic elements of the elite many people maybe blue collar folks think um the elite is just a bunch of\nSort of pathetic power hungry pencil pushers who spend their whole life fucking up to each other and confused their jobs with their lives [noise]\nOh\nOh\nThere's also a huge class divide when it comes to the value of education many residue people believe that education is the key to a better life that if you want to get ahead you need to get a good education but as you point out of the book Joan this idea is a much more controversial idea among the white working class white [noise]\nTo college is really really risky for these groups um first of all of course\nIn recent years so it's very risky to start to go to college or many of them ultimately dropped out there's very much higher dropout rate among class migrants people from non elite um backgrounds I'm so often they end up\nPaying back large college debts on the wage of a high school graduate and they see that they see it as very very risky in addition that they they typically don't get in to the same colleges and social science studies show that\nUh if you give people an identical good record\nAnd one from an elite family in one from a ... a white working class family that white working class family has to kid has to actually be about three times as good as the delete family kid in order to get to be seen as equally strong\nIt doesn't end there in one study Jones says research was sent out two sets of resumes to employers the resumes what identical except for one difference\nOne set off a blue collar signals like pick up soccer like country music\nThe other set off elite signals water polo classical music on Mr water polo got sixteen times the number of call backs as Mr country music\nSo you may go through all of this process encourage all of this debt and then because you know so to speak you don't know what four to use you may not get I'm a ... a professional job anyway [noise]\nJune Williams argues that these class differences

states meaning that the majority of the population are made up of\nOf people of color and most of whom are an immigrant descendents so the U.S census predicts that by twenty fifty one out of every four Americans are going to be of Latino or Hispanic origin I mean that's that's quite astonishing\nSo while there are these large numbers of immigrant families in the United states do these families as you point out a calling for a relatively small share of the voting population and in some ways this is the source of the friction intention that's the heart of your book\nThat's right and you know I think part of it is that is an issue that is easily understood by the public uh the fact that undocumented immigration is a very easy issue in the sense that\nIt for the average American voter you can understand somebody who breaks the law and enters the country without proper documentation and that is a violation of our laws in orders that that can easily animate people\n... and it seems to me that's closely connected would walk polls show Morris uh half of white Americans seem to believe that immigrants or a burden to us society and the slack majority saying that Latinos out to the crime problem\nThat's right and again if you actually look at the data itself right those those perceptions are not the reality particularly when it comes to crime so\nJust like many things that's happening right now in politics what people perceive what the truth is and what the facts are are very different from what the actual evidence is\n[noise]\nRapid demographic shifts ... and high not argue have created feelings of threat among white voters especially the white working class these threats come in different forms [noise]\n\nEconomic threat as far as I'm concerned they're stealing draws political trends\nIf the threat of all she has posed to the country and to them\nSo you have multiple trends happening at the same time on the one hand you have\nThese rapid demographic shift you also have views increasing feelings of threat among many white voters and simultaneously you also have a situation where one political party is seen as being more responsive to the anxieties of white voters than the other one\nThat's right I think the Republicans have really taken all of these\nMultiple factors into consideration and used it to capitalize on a central message and theme that can really again mobilize their voters and the fact that their base is overwhelmingly white means that they can have\nA central message such as immigration that can activate and mobilize their voters into not only supporting their candidates but also supporting the kinds of issues that they want to advocate for\nThere's been some criticism that well this is a short term strategy and if they're gonna they're going to suffer in the future and that may be the case but for the president it's an extremely successful strategy as we've seen\nYou've also looked at what happens in states as the demographics of states start to change so as the Latino populations in states starts to increase for example what do you find in terms of the behavior of white voters well\nWhat you typically see is that as the population of a\nLatino voters have increased you start to see the shift in\nThe political behavior of white voters to support the Republican candidate and uh that would be consistent with the theory that immigration is explaining the voting preferences of white voters you know we wrote this book before the twenty sixteen elections so\nFor better or worse some would say that it was ... into the ... of the outcome but it was just remarkable to us that when we were putting together this this book and our analysis is that\nFrom all these different angles not just of you know I'm cool white voters supported\nBut also the kinds of policies that they favor that it was really just that immigration was such a strong and important predictor in all of these different\nA political outcomes that we were exploring and so I think that's where this idea that it was really this white backlash towards immigration that currently the political climate we live in today
