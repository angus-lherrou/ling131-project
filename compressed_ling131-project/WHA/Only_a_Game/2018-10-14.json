[laughter]\nI'm not even going to pretend care and I'm I'm a Homer\nBut Jason what you just said about being said is exactly my thoughts I keep hearing people say and this is crazy to me like oh the red Sox are playing a lot better than they have recently like there too and I'm like why are you talking about like we don't actually need another championship\nNever satisfy Karen hadn't to go you\nRealize care and that there are six year olds in New England who have only been one duck but Red Sox horrifying just it's it may have waited long enough of the children\nAll right so I Want to move us out of New England and talk about Jimmy Butler he had an exciting return to let it simmer ... practice on Wednesday Butler's looking for a trade and to facilitate a trade he reportedly\nPlayed brilliantly during practice well screaming things like you bleeping need me and other things I Can't see on the radio and then he sat down with ESPN's Rachel Nichols\nWhat is the right way to do it no I Can't control that when I'm Out there competing like that's my love of the game that's wrong me me and my finest numerous sure that's what you're going to do and saw the lines\nAnd this is a is it not the right way for it to come to think it was the wrong thing to do well okay thing to do I think that\nI was on his okay let's try that again yes yes it was the wrong thing to do what I Know it's ridiculous to expect athletes to be role models they're not elementary school teachers after all their athletes\nBut as frustrating as your situation might be if you were an athlete kids are going to do what you do so it's not okay maybe understandable but not OK Charlotte I Know you sometimes enjoy it when the NBA\nVentures into W W story so I'm not going to let you go to Mars you normally do a little concerned about very worried\nAbout my reputation look I think that what athletes are very good at these days is owning a news cycle Jimmy Butler new exactly what he was doing and the report about his practice came out and two hours later he was on the jump with Rachel\nI don't really care like I I don't know if I Would say it's okay or not I think that kids are going to act like idiots no matter what so I don't think that one athlete trying to get more airtime isn't necessarily going to be like a role model issue I Do think that if I were his teammates it'd be like\nMan but I I think that it's all pretty calculated\nCharlotte's so cynical you think the fact that ESPN was on timber wolves campus for this belt down with advanced warning was somehow\nA bit of choreography on team Butler's part\nI don't want to say I said that but I didn't\nCare and also I have seen you walk into the studio saying you believe in a [laughter]\nI don't know if you are one of the cast does you know this is where the NBA is now it's almost become less in common with a traditional sports league in more like the marvel comics universe where these players are kind of superhero like and they have enemies both on their own squads and on squads elsewhere\nI I'm just going to leave it at you know Charlotte made the point that the media is being used here and as a member of the media I'm just going to say hey I don't like being you\nYeah we'll get a clue that just just just use me a bill whether our gang you probably know that once more the Alabama Crimson Tide of the number one college football team in the country\nAnd you surely know at Alabama head coach Nick Saban hair is once again so key lobster [laughter] that's really nice\nBut all is not well in Tuscaloosa because those ... good for nothing Alabama students are getting increasingly ambivalent about attending one sided football games but once more Nick Saban is on a war against his own student body we're talking friendly fire\nFor their paltry attendance at Crimson Tide football games\nHis poor Crimson Tide players look up in the stands in the middle of games and it looks like a Miami Marlins game up there but here is a thought for Alabama\nPlays some exciting football games begin at reasonable times\nNick Saban actually got himself worked up about the student crowd at a football game that began at eleven am Charlotte Lebanon on a Saturday So they realize that it's legal for a college student to wake up before noon on a weekend [laughter] also\nAlabama was playing in Louisiana Lafayette I mean no no disrespect to Louisiana Lafayette but you know what the score was at halftime what was the score it was seven hundred and Ninety five thousand dollars [laughter] okay forty nine to nothing it was forty eight to nothing about half\nPart of this is a little weird of it take I realized pardon me kind of Caesar he's coming from okay I Want to hear and I do because like here's this\nTeam that you have you've devoted your life to making this insane powerhouse and you are the best college football team that has maybe ever existed and then people stop going to your games I'd be like\nWhat I like are you kidding I did this for you [laughter]\nI mean I also did it for the millions of dollars and the prestige and the chance to you know do whatever I Want after this but I Do kind of understand but surely you're a fancy\nPair of traveling Sports Illustrated correspondent now you have been to these major college events you know that big time college sports in two thousand Eighteen the last thing that has anything to do with our students boosters visually prime sponsor\nOkay here's a thought maybe they should pay the students\nTo go to the game now Charlie while they're out of it that are going to you and the tourism needs to die why would get you out of bed before noon what I Want to figure out a number on it doesn't take\nMuch for a college student in college if you pay me like

course he's certainly big he's seven feet tall but he says he can do at all which I guess means he can shoot\nA coach except for the Philadelphia Seventy Sixers are just had a stroke [laughter]\nThe college basketball corruption trial has been underway for a while now Charlie but the big allegations are starting to drop anything here that shocked shocked you\nYes what shocked me all along which is the FBI spending my money to become the informant arm of the NC double a\nThere is nothing you can do there isn't a bribe big enough\nTo make me care about their bribery trial it's rink criminalizing an underground economy the whole thing is just silly the players are the ones that are going to get hurt most and the NC double a which was on the ropes and staggering has now found its way back to what it perceives to be the moral high ground and I couldn't be more disgusted\nSpeaking of the players are the ones that get hurt the New York times brought up an interesting question this week and that's who's the real victim here the prosecutor say that victim is the university's\nFans might say it's us but the New York times suggests that it's Bryan tags Boeing whose father agreed to take money from Adidas and as a result tags is now playing in Australia at\nAll did on the plane and Australia certainly as a really nice place but it's also not national\nTelevision you know I think Brian Bull is going to be fine I think he's going to do as a friendship in Australia and come back and get drafted pretty high but again the fact remains is this this whole notion that somehow the universities have been victimized\nBy these guys taking money from shoe company guys as though the university's haven't been accepting that as business as usual for Thirty years is one of the ways they've turned the bribery laws in this thing into a pretzel\nCharlie last week on the show we learned that the woman who is accusing event is star Christiana ... of rape had compelling evidence in the form of a legal document and which one although admitted to non consensual sex\nNow we're in all this lawyer is saying that document with acquired in a computer hacking altered so now what well this is\nI think certainly burden of proof is on Renault on his lawyers to prove the thing was hacked that sounds like a very expeditious discovery all of a sudden otherwise let's let this thing get litigated but I don't envy the judge it All right because it's clearly a lot of money on the side of Mr Ronaldo was capable of buying a lot of forensics\nYou've written a lot in your other jobs about the nature of truth and how hard it is to figure out what is true and when people start calling into question legal documents I really get confused about what can we\n... well I mean you know given the nature of how much we rely on computers these days there's always going to be somebody who knows more about you do so I mean a lot of institutions have been undermined or quote unquote disrupted which is apparently the term of art for it I guess you just have to trust your instincts and understand that the legal process will grind on\nEuropean soccer has long had a problem with racist fans and Chelsea has decided that just banning offenders from the stadium isn't changing things instead they're going to give offenders the opportunity to quote spend some time with our diversity officers\nWhat you did wrong and this time isn't going to be spent in a classroom\nRight oh they're going to take them to Auschwitz which I Will guarantee you most of these people will not connect with the black people their insulting\nIt's a good idea you know maybe they should all get on an airplane and go to the new anti lynching memorial down in Alabama that Brian Stevenson is please put up I like inventive thinking on this sort of thing go on a road trip and go see what the end result of what you're doing it\nAnd finally Charlie I'm just going to let you explain what was mysterious about the guy wearing number Thirteen when Hawaii face Wyoming last Saturday Night\nHe was an\nOrder but it'd be Wyoming by the way in this game Seventeen to Thirteen but they're starting quarterback Colin McDonald he had some sort of injury that they did not want to disclose somebody came out onto the field warmed up wearing a Jersey [laughter]\nIt's just like you know throwing the throwing the potato to throw the guy out is or what did he does is a real thrill back to the the wild west days of sports and I love it I think it's probably something you can only use wants though
