I don't know if I have an issue at high school football as much as I Do like pop Warner ... really little kids but I think that you know at a high school level you know that's kind of like those awkward years where you're trying to find yourself the teams are usually pretty big and so you're a part of a really large community and\nI Know from my years from cover in high school football I Know just what that sport can do to just bring people together\nAnd to also raised this self esteem of the athletes that perform because you've got eleven guys on the field as one if you play high school basketball the gym maybe Mt\nIf you play um cross country for sure you're really by yourself 'cause there's no one there to cheer you even when you cross the finish line I Know that run across the country [laughter] but football\nI can totally understand why it's viewed positively by the participants that doesn't make it any less dangerous\nYeah I mean we were you brought up youth football and certainly the solution there has been just suggest that kids under fourteen just plays flag football and sad that they don't really need to tell\nIn there with that yeah and I'm totally ... reservoir and yeah yeah yeah and um you know Tom rainy and the Manning's none of them play tackle football until they they were a little bit older\nBut what was interesting to me in this study because I I have thought hey what if we just need high school football slide football like would would that would that community still show up would you still get those hundred kids who are all working towards the same thing\nAnd this study really made me question my own sort of point of view on that because then I Wonder\nThese kids who are looking for are risky behavior [laughter] I'm not sure they're going to find it in flag football so it's a problem there's definitely more work to do\nMichael a basketball we need some basketball help us out [laughter]\nWe have our latest effort to fix an issue for college basketball at all boys the obvious solution pain\n[laughter] me that the G League is a now offer an alternative to the and sees one and done rule by providing the ultimate incentive to have elite prospect from high school Eighteen years old ... before the draft to come and play for a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars a year\nYou choose a lot of money especially when you consider that this is more than the Mac salary for W. NBA player and that's another topic that we can discuss later but the best part about the select contracts with the league is going to offer is that the players are able to sell their likeness everybody signed with an agent\nAnd but there is a risk to this one being you're playing and ... so you're playing with grown men so you may not be able to establish yourself or separate yourself\nFrom the perspective as you say in college when you're playing against guys are on age also the G ... leaders not provide the platform that a billion dollar industry like the NCAA will while I applaud the Julie for trying to provide an alternative I think that the NCAA\nCould actually benefit their athletes and especially the elite basketball players but just allowing them to have the ability to hire an agent to sell their likeness and assign shoot is I think that could resolve the issue of paying the players I just wonder\nCan the NCAA ever just step up and just solve its own problem\nWell so I Would say that no I have absolutely no confidence in the end of all ages sort of one day waking up and deciding like oh we're going to do the right thing cool that sad probably the best possible outcome from this right or at least it's icy it wouldn't be that\nOf elite high school players going to the ... league instead of being one and diamonds would be enough to push the NC double A. to reform they're not going to do it on their own because they just feel like it [laughter] I mean I think the only way it works and it seems like a an uphill battle is is\nThe alternative is a good enough I can actually be a source of real pressure on the inside of light which would be the first time that there's an alternative that's been able to\nIf guys are actually getting drafted out of the G League into those top spots then I think I could work but Michael you promised that we can talk about it\nTo that WNBA players get paid less than these tough high schoolers would\nI didn't immediately make that connection like\nHey this is really prove that something is a little off here and it really shows how ingrained this idea is that men male athletes should always get paid more than female athletes\nAnd no one is suggesting that WNBA players should get paid as much as NBA players you know what I Do you know the bird has said that there's a bias that exists here and I really think the idea of\nMinor league players and a league that hasn't even like they don't they're not even on to not only ...\nAnd the fact that they would maybe Maureen has a better TV do really\nRight right I mean if we need a stronger indication that there is a bias I don't think we'd find one a minute [laughter]\nI totally agree I think it's really unfair Dennis Ross is my favorite basketball player like male or female like I Love seeing her play and then you have this deal that sort of like a slap in the face of sort of reminds you that yeah in this country we we reward mill um athletes much more significant than we do females\nWell we I mean the percentage of total revenue that goes to player salaries and the WNBA is significantly lower wanting to twenty five percent\nRight and ... percent so as it is only a game tradition we save our most important topic for the last ... who you yeah I think this I'm going to mark the end of my tenure as the Boston Globe patriots supporter because I'm sure that I Am just say is\nFrom a column for the spotlight investigative team I wrote a piece recently about touchdown and big play celebrations and it was kind of a something that the NFL has been letting players do a little bit more\nI Love when guys get really creative about it I went around and and did a little digging in the patriots locker room and pulled a bunch of guys to come up with kind of a grading system a figure out how to look at a celebration and decide if it's up to snuff and I have a confession for you guys because\nWhat all the patriots players said was that you just can't celebrate when you're losing and this that actually happened the cold got an interception a couple of weeks ago in a game and they were down by two scored\nAnd they started celebrating during this dad there you know towards the end zone cameras got them and obviously on TV you see the score right below and you're like ooh guys rough\nAnd I'm going around and they're all saying well you can't I mean you can't celebrate when you're losing and I'm thinking in the back of my mind and this is why I'm not a professional athlete but can't\nRadio on the air [noise]\nThat'd

stood up to the Nazis well look at athletes who stand or sit or Neal in protest but now it's time for this week's news with Charlie Pierce hey Charlie Karen\nIt's normal for us to start in the segment by talking about USA Gymnastics but these are not normal times we're going to take this week's developments one by one starting with the arrest on Wednesday as Steve Penny the organization's former presidents did you ever think you'd see something like this well\nFirst of all unfortunately it's becoming all too common don't we start to segment we talked about using true and for all the wrong reasons\nGuy symbol is this the penny guy he took it on the lam this guy rant on sports organization right and you know lamb and a half the track him down any gallons burger and they have to bring him back on taxes\nA grand jury in Texas has indicted penny for allegedly destroying or hiding documents relating to Dr Larry Nassar who has been sentenced to more than a hundred years in prison for sexually abusing athletes and I really really want to see what's in those missing document guy though you as\nNassar's victims I think one way or another either at this guy's trial er into discovery the eight zillion lawsuits that are going to be filed against USA Gymnastics we're going to see what's in the documents and it's not going to be great\n[noise] so let's talk about Mary Bono she was an which I never thought I Would do it again [laughter]\nRight right well she was announced last friday as USA Gymnastics new interim president by Tuesday she had resigned there were two major issues first stop does the fact that ... bono worked for a law firm that also represented Larry Nassar disqualify her from running USA Gymnastics yes next question All right next question [laughter]\nThe second issue to me as a bit more complicated in September a month before she got the job Mary Bono treated an image and in it she was using a marker that blackout this swoosh on her Gulf shoes and as anti Colin Kaepernick tweets go this one was pretty tame\nI might disagree with her point of view but I respect her right to express it\nYeah well first of all I missed the ... in which Mary Bono became qualified or on USA your true second of all she managed to alienate both Nike and Simone Biles\nWhen you have alienated the primary corporate sugar daddy and the face of your sport it's really time to go and it's pretty convincing evidence that you shouldn't have been there in the first place\nI mean what the USA Gymnastics do at this point at all bring anybody back\nThe Olympics will bring people back you will see what will probably be a Nike fueled run up\nTo the next Olympics where whoever represents the United states and God Knows Simone Biles is going to be one of them are going to be the redemption team they're going to be the ones who bring honesty and non criminal behavior back to women's gymnastics and it will sell because the Olympics will help sell\nCharlie you and I have been saying for a while that the best thing that the NFL could do regarding players who choose to Neal is absolutely nothing and they seem to have listened to us or are you surprised\nNo because we're smart caring and the more people to listen to it [laughter] no I mean the basic problem the NFL had with the whole anthrax thing was I got three or four owners who were off the reservation on Jerry Jones\nBombing narrowed down in Houston a church singing and kill and those guys are print pretty much marginalized if they didn't depart the league entirely white churches and once cooler heads prevail\nOr they realize that probably forty percent of their fans are at the beer stand during the anthem anyway and the ones that you know are offended by this they can afford to offend what I really love about\nThis story is that they actually came up with actual data\nThat showed that tweets made by the president didn't try fans off to football what turned fans after football was those owners speaking up right\nAnd finally Charlie I Want to draw your attention she they can yeah ice lions because the country only has enough ice hockey players to field one team they had never played a game against an opponent so why has this team made international news\nUh first of all I Want Jersey Jersey nice so bad [laughter] apparently Sidney Crosby and Nathan McKinnon help these guys come to Toronto to play against the team of firefighters and then Crosby image in and played for the gang [laughter]\n... which we don't do that the last story on our on our segment every week is usually a funny one this isn't a funny one this is an option McKinnon even said hey these guys came really fast which is pretty good considering most of them didn't escape before last year\nThere's a video because of course it's sponsored by a coffee company and my favorite but it's one of the Kenyan players reaches out and like pot Sidney Crosby on the face and says is a really huge [laughter]\nI've always been that you can sell hockey anywhere if you give it a chance you could sell hockey in Kenya I Hope the ice loss\n... they will be the biggest\nThing there you can find the sports writing a Charlie Pierce at Sports Illustrated from time to time and he joins us each week here on who may again thanks Charlie tanks\n\n\nIn the fall of Nineteen sixty three the beach boys celebrated a national hero just two months earlier Craig Breedlove and the jet engine powered spirit of America\nHad set a new land speed record\n\n\nBut ... didn't stop there only games Gary ... has the story [noise]\n\nOn October Fifteen Nineteen sixty four Craig Breedlove hurdles across Utah's Bonneville salt flats he reached a top speed of five hundred twenty six miles per hour [laughter]\n... had just surpassed his own land speed record but things began\nTo go wrong as he tried to slow down the first problem with the emergency parachute\nTo shoot broke off and I didn't know that that it happened\nBut he did know about some of the other things that we're going wrong the steering was malfunctioning and then there were the brakes\nHe tries to breaks they melt that's writer Samuel Hawley he has no breaks he's going five hundred miles an hour he's running out of course and he's got no way to stop\nSo I came down the course and went through the place that I'm supposed to be stopped\nWent through is an understatement in the extreme\nThat I was still traveling a good four hundred miles an hour\nCrew members gave chase in cars but their top speeds were just Seventy or eighty miles per hour they knew spirit of America wouldn't stop before it reached a construction site at the edge of the highway\nI had to make it over a wooden bridge that they had built and ended up knocking down a telephone pole by highway eighty and went over and embankment out at about two hundred twenty miles an hour and the car went airborne\nBreedlove wouldn't tell me if he was terrified when that happened he's too logical into analytical to portray emotion but put yourself in the cockpit of spirit of America as it launched skyward wouldn't you be and wouldn't that make you rethink
