stories you should know this week we're going to start with football you know soccer the sport of kings and then move on to the NFL I'm joined by SB Nation Tyler times whose work is featured in the twenty Eighteen best American sports writing\nIn bookstores this week welcome back and congratulations Tyler thank you and buy one of my very favorite investigative journalists you do not want her on your trail the terrific Jessica Luther Hi Jessica high\nYou are up first is we just go what do we need to know\nYeah so Christie honoring although the soccer superstar from Portugal who played for event is an Italy is the third highest paid athlete in the world and possibly the most famous he has now also under investigation by the Las Vegas police department in regard to a two thousand nine reported sexual assault\nA woman by the name of Catherine me or guys come forward in a long piece in the German magazine Der Spiegel she waited until now because back in two thousand ten and all those settled with her out of court and pair three hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars but the stipulation that she never talk about the report it assault again\nBut she has a new lawyer who is trying to avoid the settlement on multiple legal grounds there is a police investigation because she found a police report ended a rape kit back in two thousand nine the day after she says he raped her\nOr NATO has denied these allegations but in their reporting Spiegel says there was an internal document between her and all of his lawyers and which for NATO and met she said no\nThere may not be a bigger ... on the planet you'll see this getting any traction\nWell I think that it should be getting some traction but given that the week that we've had and also not just the week with a year you're looking at Ohio State and just of course the work you've done and Baylor Kavanaugh made me wonder how you're going to keep your enthusiasm level hide at least to be paid closer attention I'm going to try\nSort of traction but it made them it's going to it and that people are gonna pay attention to it I Wish I were more optimistic than I Am tired what do you think\nI Would if we don't have the optimism mostly because uh we live in a system here where the powerful or is always uplifted where the powerless or not\nThis woman has every piece of evidence possible you have sponsors who are kind of backing away from all the way you have teams who are suspending him and giving him a break but it should go much further than that to the point that a woman's fewer must be respected and so should her pain\nYeah and you've got Nike that's got a billion dollar endorsement deal with him by the way that is one billion for one player and of course a ... a sports has also said that they're monitoring the situation very closely just because this is the area that you trafficking\nWhen you saw Addison Russell get forty games were major league baseball after his domestic violence situation is this needle moving at all in your opinion\nYeah I mean it's moving it's a you know I always described us as like\nA giant cruise ship with a teeny tiny writer and turning this at all it's very difficult but you know for someone like me who studies college football and sexual violence and particular it wasn't much but urban Meyer he got a little bit of punishment but it it's going to take a long time and a lot of work to get the kind of change that we're hoping for\nTyler Europe so when the last few weeks one of the major dissenters in this athletic moment of protests outside of Colin Kaepernick his former teammate greed was recently signed by the Carolina Panthers read isn't all pro level almost all world level safety at this point and was one of the main people who kneeled next to Colin Kaepernick back in August twenty sixteen\nAfter Jerry Richardson's reign of massage knee and also sexism and also racism and also everything that in the world that could be around one owner him leaving the Panthers last shares opened up a new leadership where owner David temper has said that he thought that the protests that being said\nIt doesn't feel as if the Panthers have done anything monumental by hiring a dissenter hiring a protester who was ousted from the league has a collusion case with the NFL they've done nothing but hire the right person for the job but at the same time it almost feels as if protesters during the cap on the air are finding their way back into the league for us then\nYeah I think that number one do you get a medal for doing the right thing to you is that what we do here just to get my question for you on this I'm thinking is this cynicism\nIn met you finally got a player that you needed when you're the Panthers or is it the fact that now that you hire Eric read that collusion lawsuit that he's got currently against the NFL now goes away\n... does a good question I mean it doesn't matter that they hired him because he's a good football player [noise] I'm\nGoing back to the discussion we just had and Tyler brought this up um if we want to talk about the impact on me to on sports the fact that Richard since out there is because of Sports Illustrated reporting about his massage and races out of the threat that's tied into me to write so we can see a direct impact here\nAnd it's hard you don't want to give them cookies for doing the thing that they should do [laughter] I don't know it's so complicated I'm really happy that read his back\nI think we can mix a piece of actually being happy that somebody who deserves the job got one and also having skepticism that it took this long for it to happen in the entire NFC outhouse needed so they never happened\nIn the first place why why are we waiting until October for this\nExactly Arab greed was not on a preseason roster every was on the training camp roster it took notable mental fall and the gridiron for ... to even get proposed that he should have a job or the general manager Marty hardly ... strictly a football decision and that's when they start to feel duplicitous but we need to actually speak about it\nYeah and he's not being silent I always want to point out that that has presser raped by the way I Do think yeah I mean his unpacking of us history and oppression in this country should be used in classrooms and he's being very clear in his messaging as he has always been to\nAnd I talked about this at links during the twenty Seventeen season all year with the forty niners last year and I remember saying to him listen you can't beat the flag so you're going to have to go head first on\nStay on target if you don't stay on target them they're going to shape it for you and you're going to lose or what he did to me was fantastic\nI Am going to finish things off with football as well and people hate it when I say it but sports are filled up through the following one's white owners white coaches white season ticket buyers white media and black players\nThrough the lens players perform a service for the owners and they entertain the fan base they have no other rights or concerns they're paid a ton and they're expected to be grateful\nBut it'll Thomas the safety for the Seattle Seahawks he held out earlier this season for a better contract and everyone knows the dangers of football the injury risk the short window of opportunity and the fans called him selfish\nAnd he came back and what happened he broke his leg and well being carted off the field he flip the middle finger to his own sideline and some fans burned his Jersey my reaction wasn't to burnish Jersey it was to buy one Jessica\nWho got your Jersey Menino read in\nSome way to support and also to make sure that the right people are being hurt by this\nYeah I think that's a great point and it made me think a lot about this story with JR Smith they came up recently in the NBA and he put a tattoo on his leg and then all of this question about covering it up and and sort of this discussion of who owns and putting that in quotes like who owns the ... and whether they owe us Jessica\nSometimes refer to them as\nOwners [laughter] right yeah you talk about them is owners the language of sports is very specific right I think the anger that comes at a hearing some some of these decisions of the fact that we don't really understand the metrics of how capitalism can work right you belong to the people who pay your paycheck and that's wrong at the basis of it right\nSo the NBA says dearest but actually we do on your skin and he has one of two choices he they said the fact that we know you don't I Want a brand do my leg\nOr he says the money is more important to my kids but she did say I'm just going to keep pushing and so I think it's powerful that people like all Thomas and GR Smith are standing up to these corporations that are telling them they're not worth that much when the reality is if there's a lady on building the field as we've seen with the Steelers often\nOften doesn't go the team is bad losses a crew people get fired and that's just because you wouldn't pay somebody their worst\nMy guess for this week's edition of three stories you should never have been investigative journalist Jessica Luther thank you Jessica thank you and sb ... thank you tower thank you\n[noise]\nHere's something you already know
