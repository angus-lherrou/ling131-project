World Service with me how to marry him in each week one question for expert witnesses\nAnd denouncing [noise]\nIt's a sunny morning in Texas [noise] ... walking to a wandering she's going to find [noise] she opens the door to her nine [noise] insight tens of thousands of one recurring around in different books and [noise] she she is in Taiwan\nThen another ... ... ... [noise] what she think could help kill the bill is Eighteen condition known to us [noise]\nAging [noise]\nDiseases related to aging kill a hundred thousand people every day but it clearly number of scientists say it doesn't have to be this way\nOr the ... research the carried on multiple experiments challenging what we thought we knew about how life than\nBillions of dollars being spent all over the world in ethics to extend on line\nAnd this week we bring you some of the world's leading was sent it to tell me what they found [noise]\nYou'll find out what may wind discovered with one and one scientist was busty aging process in a sound\nAs we answer a question that own if you had probably ... [noise]\nHow long can we live [noise]\nAll in good taste [noise] ... well [noise]\nWhen you're having a tremendous development in life expectancy we have doubled in our lifetime in a very short period and we should really be happy that we were born right on the spot in history [noise]\nFirst thanks that witness cool Christians [noise] you know what does it don't sense and then ... then one day decided he'd had enough of treating ... [noise] he now runs the Danish aging with that sentiment well he's trying to stop people getting in and the first place [noise]\nWe'll end with aging ... from the outside [noise] what is actually the two parties\nWell each accumulation of damage from the molecular level then spread to the cells and tissues and organs and to the whole organism and it's kind of all the hits that we get all the time on the molecules and then when we can't keep up with\nThe repairing than a staging\nStocks and when does it all began when do we start to decline that is in the mid thirties this that and it's a sign says she sat in ... it's ... yeah now the parties thought Oh thanks for the good news [laughter] sorry\nAnd there's more bad news once we start to go downhill we go downhill fast\nIt's twice it's dangerous being forced you to compare to thirty five then again it's twice as dangerous as being forty nine compared to forty two and so on so your risk of death is increasing eleven twelve percent every year\nAnd then their mortality risk levels off around one hundred one hundred and five where the yearly risk of dying is about fifty sixty percent\nSo if you really optimistic type and you could say that it never get any worse than fifty fifty\nAnd when you're thinking about these ... that's a lump stacked against team when you age as your molecules tissues and organs get tired and damaged susceptible to a whole range of diseases\nTo study show actually they are like additional Oregon on to us because they can't even friends how while away they have\nAnd all of a show powwow will respond to different medications and sometimes they make us sick but on the other hand they also play very important to keep us how the\nNine one one to to know whether I'm Mike ... has an effect on how we age so she decided to do an experiment and what she needed was an animal with a short life span she chose a particular kind of one\nThey only live about two to three wakes felt that make them wander for law does not puff subject yeah [noise]\n\nShe wanted to find out what would happen if you go to the ones micro biome wouldn't live longer [noise]\n\nShe chose one of the kinds of bacteria that lives inside a ... gun [noise] tweaked it changed to make different varieties and then fed them to separate groups of one [noise]\n\nA few weeks later she went to see the worms expecting to move to the vet now they've reached the end of the lifespan [noise]\nI was so excited because when we find in feel cases animal I not that they're still alive when we checked them I was jumping up down because he is totally unexpected\nAnd how long did some of the ... about fifty percent longer fifty percent yeah that's extraordinary so you had the most of the ones who are living for three weeks and there were some that live to fool four and a half four and high school yes I'm was that much more than you would have expected\nYes I think scientists sometimes we do research is kind of like\nGambling [laughter] so we have some crazy idea than you know we we did find a way to test them but you never know why they idea is ride around\nAnd those moments where you find that reads out that's the best moment\nAnd so they went on to test other things would have different micro biome gift worms will Tony a longer life but the best the quality of life in their final days\nSo the way with the right way can look at how they if they have when they're older because worm when they get older their physical activity has declined so they move slower and also become a little bit of a coordinated [noise]\nShe's got a video of some of these elderly ones [noise] and she's right you can tell their own blog younger ones regal energetic around them the older ones move slowly the skin sucking as they go [noise]\nI don't think they show rank house but it can tell that body structure is not as good as it used to be\nThe ones with the new microbiomes will send the wrinkles around more quickly and their old age that they were less susceptible to disease to [noise]\nMake wine is now carrying out tests on money to see where the changing then like ...\nAnd so there's a jumps\nSupport for WPRI comes from you W credit union a local financial cooperative dedicated to providing savings and investment options to help members plans for retirement you WC you dot org your best interest always comes first [noise] so how long can we live full [noise]\nAbout also ... that could get us to a hundred and Seventy five [noise]\nAnd how it different micro biome could give us fifty percent more time on us [noise]\nThe bases inventions or a bounce addressing the symptoms of aging ... to ... [noise] well then if we can go straight to the tools [noise]\nTime for a final expert witness [noise]\nOh heart for\nFighting you're so but I Do oh\n\nYou wouldn't believe the number of people have had got in touch with me\nThat loan Harry's professor of molecular genetics at the University of Exeter in the u._k. a scientist who's ... is because a lot of people like scientists\nBefore now it's still being a bit of a holy grail actually ... enough they will now people are beginning to realize that this is a possibility and not wanting to get him that I think it's going to be huge\nFickle begins with the building blocks of our bodies ourselves\nSo basically the organs might have different type of tissue your tissues are made of different types of cells now cells get told that some cells and say your liver kidneys or whatever will be dividing to replace some cells to kind of dynamic I didn't want to know the more time to cell divides the greater chance of becoming what we would cool for NASA and\nSome lessons comes from the ... which means to grow old and that's exactly what's happening to these cells they've grown old income to the end of life cycle but instead of dying they hung around acting in a destructive ...\nThey can actually communicate with the cells ran them so it's in essence Sal will basically throw out to a bunch of chemicals which affect all of the cells ran them so it's almost like a self saying I I'm an old south and you guys have been around here about the same sort of a matter of time as I have so you must be able to say you should be thinking about ... says well\nWow so it's almost sort of contamination with with age\nExactly so it's basically sending a message which can drive to cells around it and just nothing\nAs we grow older more and more of a cells becomes innocent until a buddy is overwhelmed\nWill send you did they make the cells around them HPV Austin\nThese innocent cells still functioning\nAs they should which is to be one of the things that leads to diseases like dimension constant type two diabetes\n\nSuperficial Harry's wants to know whether she could get these cells still behaving like a little cells behave more like young one\nHappened that was I had a new is that true in my lab and she was still finding fates and we have some old south and I had some chemicals\nAnd she suggested ... percent shit that some of these chemicals on these skin cells and see what happened\nAbout a week after she came in with the dishes cells and showed it to me\nAnd when you look through the microscope what were you expecting to see\nThat they would still like also say they look kind of lacy under a microscope and we have a particular die that we can put on our fell coaches the tens blue if that's an excellent so when I was expecting to say\nIs that the south would be so blue and still looking old and she will they went they went blue and they had gone back to looking more like themselves to professor Harry said don't you've got the wrong side of these young sales go do it again and that and she did\nAnd she did it I think again yeah and and and then we'll have the same thing again people about me and I still I wasn't convinced because we were not truly ... suspicious scientists and yeah they were taught to basically throw rocks at your eyes\nHow many wrote city services are probably about nine [laughter] she did it about nine times and finally I kind of look to to ask them to actually maybe you're on to something had\nShe'd done something that no one thought possible\nSheet effectively ... to ... thousand ten men to young south\nAnd they just want to loan Harry's just now getting phone calls from scientists and investors from all over the well is the first experiment this reverse aging and human cells they think a discovery could be the secret to a much longer life\nSo when it comes to a lifespan think loan Harry's will be the most ambitious of on our expert witnesses instead\nAs human beings I think we have enough true maximum lifespan especially what I Want this research to end up paying is a new generation of anti degenerative drugs with sort of way off yet but in the future for things like dementia and cardiovascular disease what I'm hoping is that this will allow us one treatment which will address several of those at once say that people he would have\nDied on will then go on to live than not ... ... how long can we ...\nWe know the answer is at least a hundred and twenty teens someone's already go that far from what we cut that thinking it's like to ride with the discovery of an expert witnesses alone one day we may be able to replace the damaged organs\nTake supplements that give us a useful micro buying stuff ourselves aging [noise] how many years could all the saddle well if we go to ... prediction if you're a millennia like me\nBorn in Nineteen eighty one you should be able to get to a hundred and thirty five [noise] by the time we get ten and Twenty one sixteen who knows what else would be possible\n[noise]\nThis inquiry was presented by me had an American but she's my best to take a sentence and if he wants to listen to more episodes
