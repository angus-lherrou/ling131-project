{"month": "10", "state": "WI", "station": "WHA", "content": "The issue with the sexual assault kids was that law enforcement agencies looked at them in Wisconsin and said we don't need them to prove this case because the defendant confessed\nOr the um for defending pled guilty or there were others other evidence to support it and then they didn't test to get because they didn't understand that that might help prove other sexual assault cases\nWe didn't do the wholesale warehousing of kids like they did in Detroit so we didn't have nearly as many kids the city of Detroit had Seventeen thousand kids to test alone just one city\nHere Wisconsin our whole state we had forty two hundred kids I can tell you walk a short county where I was in the sense of the crimes unit and help develop our same team\nWe had only thirty nine kids that it'd be tested for walks or county because we were getting it right under my leadership and when I came to department of justice I recognized that we need to do it better at the state and we got this mission accomplished\nAnd now Mr shuttles question for Mr call Mr call you introduce yourself as a federal prosecutor on truth be told you spent less than four years in the U.S attorney's office\nWe scoured the federal court records and we can find that it appears you handled about twenty five cases during your time there that were assigned to you add appears he had three cases go to jury\nWe can't tell for sure it doesn't look like you've ever made a closing argument to a jury how many times you may have you made a closing argument to a jury in a criminal case\nI'm well first of all your facts are wrong I'm not sure where the twenty five number comes from where the three number um let me tell you about what I did in Baltimore\nI was a federal prosecutor in one of the most violent cities in the country I prosecuted drug traffickers gang members and murders and worked to make community safer and let me tell you about one of the cases I prosecuted\nOr the defendant was like a person named Tyrone Jonathan he was convicted among other things up conspiracy to commit murder and eight of racketeering\nOf his life in prison I'm proud of the work that I've done a as a federal prosecutor and I'm\nHappy to compare that record to your record as attorney general where on issue after issue we've seen failure when it comes to public safety the opioid epidemic has gotten significantly worse the math problem has exploded we haven't done anything to address our shortage of prosecutors in the state uh\nSafety on school safety you've suggested that we consider arming teachers and that's the solution on school safety that that you offered shortly after the Parkland shooting I think what we need some commonsense gun safety measures like universal background checks you recall the question\nHow many closing arguments have you made it to a criminal jury at it's more than three to recall my question about how many people have been in that sort of a crime you've made three as a result of\nThe recall how many people have been convicted of a crime as a result of testing a backlog of red kits and Wisconsin the answer zero [noise]\nWe're going to leave it there and we're going to move back to a talking about when you would sue the federal government we talked about the Affordable CARE Act but a more broadly you both said you had the same two step process and deciding when to sue in federal court\nYou ask does the law violates constitution does the law harm Wisconsin residents and yet are using these criteria you disagree on which lawsuits Wisconsin should bring against the federal government so the question is\nWhen should the states he the federal government and what are some specific examples you could give people\nOn when the state should sue the federal government uh this is the first to dress call\nUs so I think first of all when you look at whether a law is harming Wisconsin I I and if it is Harman Wisconsin science then the question is is the law unconstitutional or or is it otherwise illegal is there a strong legal case to be brought\nAt the answer is yes then I think the state of Wisconsin should get involved in a challenge and then I'll give you a couple of examples where I think the state should have gotten involved when net neutrality was eliminated a\nNumber of agencies brought suit more than twenty more than two million fraudulent comments were submitted to the FCC before that was a that that change was made um I called on our attorney general to join that suit um his response was that it was frivolous\nWhen protection for students who were defrauded by predatory for profit colleges were roll back\nA number of agencies stepped up and took action but our age was nowhere to be found\nUm what our energy has done instead is get the state involved in suits that harm the interests of Wisconsin writes\nHis challenged environmental protections are as you touched on before he is challenging the Affordable CARE Act and fighting to eliminate protections for people with preexisting conditions and he got the state involved in a lawsuit that challenged a rule that guaranteed overtime pay\nFor people who put in the hours and make between about twenty three and forty seven thousand dollars a year\nSo our agency with our tax dollars has fought against overtime pay for middle class families in Wisconsin I think we need better leadership on these issues from our age you\nMr ... same question when should the state see the federal government and can you give some specific examples\nElected based in part on my promise that I Would sue the federal government when it interfered with Wisconsin's right to make its own policy choices\nI I agree that the criteria is whether the law is unconstitutional or the regulatory rule is unconstitutional otherwise illegal and whether it harms Wisconsin\nWith net neutrality there was nothing about that that was illegal in the way that it was put in place the regulatory agency has the authority to make that determination\nThey did it and it falls with in the authority the ... the ... the legislature the Congress gave them there is no basis to sue there and in terms of harm to the citizens of Wisconsin it none has been a ... there's none that's occurred yet so it's all hypothetical nature now\nContrary to my opponents list checklist of people that he wants to go after we ... we we had done a fight things as well but with the clean Power Plan for instance\nThat was passed with out following the the rules and the the administrative procedures ... also exceeded the authority granted to the EPA by the Congress and in fact the United States Supreme court found our arguments so compelling that they did something they've never done in the history of the United states\nDate it poses an injunction or stopped or regulatory rule from going forward before there was ever a trial in the lower court and now the clean Power Plan has been withdrawn it would have killed tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs in Wisconsin\nAnd move to the issue of opioids and we're going to hear now from Watertown residents Todd Morris a tug Morris works as a volunteer at a youth rec center a cruise cod morning there\nKids that are being raised by their ass or the grandparents [noise]\nBecause of opiate addiction\nIt's really sad and I I Want something done about it but I don't\nMr call do you have a solution and if so what is it so this epidemic has been devastating for families across the state um and the problem continues to get worse ah\nYear we had nearly nine hundred opioid related overdose deaths in Wisconsin um that's an increase of more than forty percent\nFrom just twenty Fifteen um the number of kids who have been separated from a drug addicted parents\nContinues to climb and I think we need to start responding to this epidemic like the crisis it is at first I think we need to ensure that our enforcement efforts are targeting large scale traffickers who are sending drugs like heroin and ...\nAcross county lines and state lines I Am proud to have worked to dismantle drug trafficking conspiracies as a federal prosecutor and I think we need to do more of that or from our have our ages office play a bigger role in those types of cases but we also need to expand access to treatment\nFar more seriously than we have so far so that people who fall into the trap of addiction are able to get the help they need to get back on their feet and then I think we need an agent who's going to be serious finally about holding the pharmaceutical companies accountable for the role that they have played in this epidemic Mr ... [noise]\nHim I work in the walk shut da's office I met hundreds of people who buried their loved ones to opiate overdose deaths and I've met many more as attorney general\nBecause of that I made this my number one priority as attorney general and we're leading the nation in the work we're doing Wisconsin is recognized as a national leader\nI put on the enforcement side I put many more agents in the field work in drug cases I put regional prosecutors throughout Wisconsin to work on this we have increase the availability of safety equipment for law enforcement and increased their training to be able to do so effectively\nWe wrote and obtain the largest methamphetamine and heroin enforcement grants in the nation right here in Wisconsin and that's money we're turning out to law enforcement agencies do affect the work but I Know from my experience it\nUh mister show you have said that you would be open to arming teachers and would train them if lawmakers approved it why should that be part of a school safety plans\nWhat I said is that if that there should be a local school district decision and if the local school district decides to exercise that option and any teacher chooses\nTo to go forward with that right and beyond in the school if they do that I Will make sure they're trained for free at the department of justice so that they have the best training to do this most safely but ultimately that's not my decision to make but we did do at the office of school safety and Wisconsin is we put together a plan\nThat in the midst of all the arguing about gun laws we convinced a bipartisan legislature in a matter of a couple of weeks\nTo foot one hundred million dollars into funding making our schools to more safe from a physical perspective also engaging in more mental health training in those schools that are making our schools safer right now and in the long term will prevent more acts of violence in our schools\nEither the experience to put a get a plan like that together we got results our schools are the safest in the nation and that's why I'm the choice of law enforcement\nMr call ah what is what is your reaction to the um\nIdea of arming\nSchool teachers I think it as an alarming\nIdea or if we are teachers are schools will have a danger that isn't president right now\nIt will be they will be less safe um as attorney general I Will fight against any effort to arm teachers in Wisconsin a we need to do a lot more to address school safety than we're doing right now\nAwarded grants before the start of the school year um he failed to meet that deadline\nUp at the bigger issue as we need to make changes for the long term I think we need long term funding for mental health programs in schools so that schools can hire ... mental health professionals counselors and we also need some commonsense gun safety measures in addition to suggesting that we consider arming teachers\nOr Mr shovel has criticized gun free school zones I think we need to keep our gun free school zones and I think we need some commonsense gun safety measures like universal background checks\nOf factional what is your position on restrictions on guns are expanding background checks the\nAnswer to gun crime is to go after criminals who use guns that's why it plays to prosecutors in the Milwaukee DA's office who in the course of two years got convictions on a hundred and fifty\nGun felons in Milwaukee County got an average sense of more than ten years on each of them those are cases at the ... office never would have been able to get to that's your answer things like gun free school zones\nThey only affect law abiding gun owners it criminal who's a protein a school with a gun with the intention to commit harm doesn't care that there's a sticker on the door that's marathon\nOf that with a gun free school zones if a law enforcement officer sees somebody near a school with a firearm the law enforcement officer can take action because it's illegal to have a gun near a school\nOr under Mr ... suggestion his criticism of gun free school zones if a one forcing officer see somebody with a firearm near a school the law enforcement officer wouldn't have a basis for taking action uh I think the law enforcement should be able to act\nIn that situation to keep our kids safe\nWe we leave it there and it is time now for closing statements a coin toss determine the order Mr channel will lead off with his one minute closing around I think you\nI live my whole life right here in Wisconsin my opponents only spent four years of his adult life here I've led to Wisconsin law enforcement community for twenty nine years I work with victims of crime rate here in Wisconsin for twenty nine years my opponent has never worked for the single crime victim in Wisconsin\nForty years ago I detailed a bold and and defined plan to make Wisconsin safer and stronger and we've had great success on every one of the promises I made my opponent has offered NO PLAN\nHe talks talks invade political talking points\nI listen to Wisconsin nights in all Seventy two of our counties\nI brought countless partners to the table that's why over eighty percent of the elected district attorneys\nAnd sheriffs in Wisconsin or public endorsing that includes more Democrats endorsing me than are divorcing my opponent they know my experience they seeing the results I'm proud of the law enforcement's choice and I hope all your choice in November sixth for attorney general\nMr call now has his closing remarks\nWinning new leadership in our attorney general's office I'm proud to have been endorsed by sixty one former assistant AJ is forty five of them to collectively served in the age ... office for over nine hundred years signed a letter that said the ... office is a mess\nAnd it is a mess we need new leadership when it comes to fighting crime and getting justice for Wisconsin nights are rape kit backlog was mishandled by our current a gee\nWe need a more effective response to our opioid epidemic and we need a response on school safety issues that doesn't suggest that we consider arming teachers are but instead suggest some commonsense measures like universal background checks we also need an aging\nLaws that protect our environment and that protect consumers in Wisconsin we haven't had that approach with our current energy and our age you should be independent and a watchdog an agent who was willing to stand up against public corruption\nWho's going to ensure that Foxconn lives up to the terms of the deal that have struck and it's going to stand up for the rights and protections ...

spectrum of people like least scratch Perry and also Radiohead and last year her own album set it to his wine at the hearts of jazz lovers\nBut the title she picked for her album you might hear it
