Gonzalez I gotta tell ya musical genius is a title that's wild and for him\nChilies stopped by the cues duty at a place of music from his stunning new record solo piano three unless you're about to hear is chili Gonzalez breaking down how the piano works and why it affect you the way it does\nThe first time you're going to hear is called Chico and the inspiration behind it tells you a lot about that kind of genius Charlie Gonzalez aspires to be\nChico marks was probably the first non stuck up a pianist I ever saw [laughter]\nYou know my grandfather was all about respect for the composer yeah he was introducing me to classical music\nAnd then when I thought she marks play the piano and I think it's a night of the opera and forms on the ship and I thought\nHere's a musician who respects the audience I asked a composer so what specifically can we listen for that you'd be incorporated into this piece I Would just say it's the the playful nature the shifting temp pose a that is just sort of\nDrawing out the entertainment value of of musical storytelling I think that's one thing that I can remember when I was\nWatching that sequence\nThere's a lot of sort of false virtual city when I say falls virtual ... means that he's he's playing quickly in in a way that seems\nQuite technically accomplished but it's all in service of of the playfulness when you're a composer performer you write music for yourself\nAnd that means that I can write for my own technique and there's moments where it might seem very very true authentic but in fact all I've done is right for myself rights to my own strengths and that's the way of sort of getting around the idea of am I good pianists or not and I'm a good pianists when I'm writing for myself and I think that's what\nTranslates to uh what she called mark did when he was being a false virtuoso and and what I Do in this piece [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nUh [noise]\nUh [noise]\nUh\n\nUh [noise]\nUh\nDo\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nSo but when you when you're composing is that satisfying I only ask because I didn't know when you're in your composition whether it be and it can do everything you want it to do\nI don't think in terms of being a pianist I'm a musician who happens to play the piano the piano is this atomic level of instrument that means that if I Want to conceive\nOf complete music the piano is just the easiest way to do it my best teachers when I was growing up were guitarists drummers they taught me about music how to tell a story through court progression how to leave space what is it to tickle the ear of the listener these are all skills\nThat if you are stuck too much and you're instrumental identity\nYou'll never learned and I think it's dangerous I think for musicians to get to cut up into instrumental identity\nAnd yes there's different you know parts of the body that are engaged for different instruments and every instrumental is has his or her own map of music viewed through the prism of that instrument\nBut these twelve notes here in all of western music from classical through to today's pop music these twelve notes have still reigned Supreme you know you walk into a studio where they make rap music you're going to see some some drum machines but you will definitely see a synthesizer which has these twelve notes of the piano\nJust rent dirt on you know the keys are made of plastic and and there isn't an acoustic mechanism to hear from those right away but that prison is still through which musicians the music at least in the western world\nI Want to talk more about the conservatory or set up sort of a musical boot camp in in Paris tells a little bit\nMore about it and that was a performance boot camp I feel like music was performance for hundreds of years and there was an aberration\nOh there's a permanent record which is why it's called a record of a song against which all other subsequent performances will be measured kind of terrifying for a musician\nSo I thought how can I get younger musicians who have come up in this SoundCloud era who ... in a really wonderful way can make music on their own on their computer posted and feel like they're starting to communicate with their audience\nHow do you make sure that in doing so they don't lose touch with what music really was spiritual way music was someone in a cave hitting a drum and someone listening and maybe laughing or dancing\nSo how do you get young musicians to understand that that is not only the spiritual\nWay to feel connected with musicians that came before us but pragmatically that's also where you can make a living as a young musician so I went out of my way to sort of developed techniques that would\nForce them to trust their instincts to create a kind of control to discomfort within which they can compose and perform music\nI've done it once now they wrote music during that week under pressure literally with egg timers going for ten minutes or Fifteen minutes with constraints\nThey had to bridge the gap between coming from different cultures and different musical styles that was a rapper from Texas to jazz saxophonist from Ukraine classical guitarist from Guyana\nYou had a singer songwriter\nFrom Argentina that we make thing nicknamed Mexican faced at one point or so you had all these people that were forced to make music together look for that common ground and not have so much comfort that they feel that they have even the chance at perfectionism\nWe had cameras filming almost every moment of the actual work wasn't reality t._v. they weren't filmed in their personal moments but when we were working the cameras were on them and that was part of it they needed to feel that pressure that discomfort they need to confront the fear of humiliation you know when you go on stage you get an adrenalin rush\nWhich is replicating probably early man\nYou know fight or flight response was when they ... or something like ... are the stakes were very high life or death on stage the stakes are quite as high it's fear of humiliation rather than fear of death\nIf you can make friends with that fear of humiliation and even sort of acknowledge it even sort of let the audience know by taking risks\nIt's a little bit like a magic trick a little bit like Houdini saying I'm going to go into this box of water and uh you know and yet ... get my way out a way it is kind of an escape routine every time that you go up on stage you have to escape\nFrom the box that you put yourself in um you're going to do October third yes what's the significance of the data October third\nThat is a dates for I I Can't really explain the details because it's just too private and and uh so there are things that you have there's there's things you need to keep ... yeah I you know I I Choose what to share with my audience because I Know that if you don't share anything you're missing out on the chance to create a bond and maybe for the music to to have more resonance\nOctober third has been out titled because I wanted people to know that emotionally this piece is different\nPieces even dedicated to myself\nI Want people to know\nThis is the emotional core of the album but of course I don't want to say why\nDedicate yourself yes Jason back you're you're getting the real name\nI dedicated to myself because this is a a piece that I wrote on that day where something very life changing ran and and this one's different let's say I want people to know them as October ...

Murray Adeline she was born in the turn of the century um quite a sexual prude so it was a little bit of an inside joke between my sister and me and uh uh yeah that was where I got that name so why the student\nAh everybody was writing them under a pseudonym and it was also I wasn't sure of myself I felt a little insecure and I I thought you know if I fail I'd rather fail undermine Anna's name\nThan my own name and it's very it's a very different genre it comes from a very different part of my brain\nUm [noise] um and ah it was very plot driven and I'm not as sort of literary um it didn't come from the part of my brain that wanted to be surprised so much has wants to nail to sort of plot and the point of making\nWhen it started doing incredibly well was there a point that you were like I kinda wish I use my own they\nNo no no no I'm not I'm I'm I'm happy that it has its own life somewhere else the romance in erotica genre and readership [noise] um [noise] it's a very particular animal they like things a certain way um and I don't know if they'd be a fan of the stuff that I tend to write for myself you know like the winters for instance\nSo let's talk about the winters if we can really see Gabriel her new book the winter's came out this week so I mentioned this off the beginning it's based on Daphne ... Rebecca which was a best seller when it came at Nineteen thirty eight at the book it's never been out of print Alfred Hitchcock made a movie out of it that won best picture of the Oscars in Nineteen forty what's your personal connection to the original Rebecca\nAh it's fraught and lengthy I I'm Rebecca the book was one of three books that we owned growing up we didn't have books in the house we didn't have money we were library people\nUm the other one was one of the other ones was a collection of poems by Alfred our tennis and\nAnd the chariots of the gods so kind of explains a lot um I didn't read the book until I was in high school so my first introduction of the story was um with Bill Kennedy at the movies out of Detroit I grew up in Windsor and watch that black and white movie with my mother probably on a loop he didn't have very many movies in this collection but he would play the same sort of John Fontaine movies over and over again\nSo I I grew up knowing about the story watching the story then I read the book in high school and it was kind of blown\nAway because in the book maximum winter murders his wife admits it gleefully gets away with it and the narrator loves him more so for it and I never saw it that way growing up the movie the Alfred Hitchcock ... murder for obvious reasons and so it's a love story\nAnd they get away with it and live happily ever after\nSo let me understand as you're watching the White House you're watching news about the Trump White house you see Hope Hicks a Donald Trump's former adviser and it inspires you to revisit Rebecca my ...\nI Would go further back it was really the fall of two thousand sixteen um the actual election itself I was I'm\nNot working ... I was at home trying to sort of taught my next career move 'em my cat had died oh the election was obviously fraught for a lot of women and so I and I and I I'm a news to I'm a news junkie and I had enough\nSo shut off you know the news and started to watch my favorite movies to see if I could sort of get myself out of this funk and threw in Rebecca on both criterion collections of the movie and uh\nIt just was overwhelmed with the sense of you know max into winter gets away with murder and had the sense that men are getting away with a lot and ah you know came to me suddenly that it would be a fun exercise to write a book\nInspired by Rebecca wherein the men haven't changed max and to enter in my book becomes next winter Republican state senator uh but\nVery different than the original narrator she has more agency she's been older she's much smarter\nAnd I want it to experiment with the notion that I wondered if she was still is susceptible to that fairy tales you opened with off the top and sadly she is and to her detriment so then it turns into a thriller when she gets back to his mansion and the plot takes on a very different turn after that\nWell you said I was inspired her reimagining the world where the women have changed but the men have not so how have women in this book changed from the original out from state to say well\nI'm Talking about very specifically wealthy man you know with a lot of power or the election and everything that's happened since it it it really brings into stark relief just how little things have changed Donald Trump could exist in Nineteen fifty five\nI'm a lot of women nowadays don't live like that we have you know become much more we have more agency would become more powerful not powerful enough", "show_name": "As It Happens (CBC)", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "19"}
