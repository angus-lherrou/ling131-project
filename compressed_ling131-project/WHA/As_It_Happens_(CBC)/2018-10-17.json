the back of your brain people you return to over and over again just because you love the stories that they write for Rupert ever at the right or that top his last is Oscar Wilde\nRupert ever had played some of Oscar Wilde best known characters in films like the importance of being Ernest which I found out is not one of the earnest movies and an ideal husband but in his latest movie the happy prince Rupert gets to play Oscar Wilde himself\nIt's something that he's done before on stage but this time revert ever it also wrote and directed the project is basically a dream scenario this film that ... takes you into the last few years Oscar Wilde life after wild time in prison\nConvicted a charge of growth in decency way it's more or less meant the crime of just being an openly gay man\nWhen I talked to Rupert every it from a studio in New York I asked him why did is that it's drawn him to Oscar Wilde so often over his life and it turns out it's that last chapter that last chapter of Oscar Wilde life had a lot to do with it\nI suppose because for me he's the kind of a patron saint or a Christ figure almost um [noise] I think first of all obviously I was very attracted by his brilliance as a right to\nBut more than that um I think as a gay man I feel that he's the kind of Christ figure for for the gay movement and um\nAnd for that I find him a very inspiring and moving and are generally entertaining character\nI guess a Christ figure not just in in his inspiration but also the the dying for our sins way to ride kind\nOf because uh in one sense I think he's very much sacrificed himself a ... in ... and to create a the roads are towards gay liberation\nDo you remember the first time you read Oscar Wilde\nA I was raised Oscar Wilde a by my mother was ... and she read me the happy prince and uh I must have been ... five or six maybe seven and I remember it very very well and uh it was a great eye opener because I think now that my mother nor I\nProbably understood the text books ah because I came from a ... a rigidity conservative family or they ruined the military or in the navy and uh we wanted to kind of people who who expressed feelings very much and so to read the story about love and suffering and the price of love\nA was a complete eye opener I Am I looked at my family with new eyes I thought they must be does most of the life than just this\nIf it is the kind of work it's a it's almost like a ... a good television show or a great book and then as you get older you take more from it right\nYeah I think uh I think the the ... for me more than the work is the character of Oscar Wilde uh that's that's the thing that I find most inspiring I've loved being in a in the plays and uh I've loved I'm\nReading a ... and uh the ballad of reading jail and a and the picture Dorian Gray and the more than that I Love a\nHis life in particular the his life or on the skids this this idea of a kind of ... because he really was one of the first famous famous people he was cold\nI think this is not true is to do with the mindset in in what remains of the boys club of um the people in power in the executive branch and uh that has to that is the thing that still I feel needs to launch the\nChange I'm sure this is something you've experienced yourself\nAbsolutely it does it make you reflect on that I mean when I tell people I was interviewing you today I was excited talked about Oscar Wilde and and people still ... referred to my best friend's wedding day with him to a lot of the roles and you had in the in the nineties [noise] daddy reflecting that time now do you like thinking back to that time\nBut it was a very exciting time uh and I'm a number\n... time for me was like it was one of those kind of dream come true type of times in one sense that I could ... myself into such a\nA successful place for my best friend's wedding and uh that film went so I'm incredibly well for me but in one sense or a\nOr the you can only go so far I'm playing the gay best friend I mean you have to kind of be able to come up with something else along the line otherwise ah the audiences will get bored\nAnd uh I think from to graduate to any other kind of role was seemed to me to be impossible and then as soon as my gay best friend a road seemed to fail\nThat was when the lights kind of snapped out\nMy I I I don't think

you got the chance to head out to the pictures this weekend and maybe you finally caught a star is born which is sitting strong and number two at the box office right now\nRight behind that is the first man which is winning over a lot of critics as well but there's another film that's getting even better reviews than those two they hate you gave is already showing up in theaters but it will open everywhere this weekend it's already got a Ninety seven percent score on rotten tomatoes I cite that aggregates\nWhen you realize the book was based on this huge bestseller written by Angie Thomas the hate you give follows stark Carter a sixteen year old black girl it takes a closer look at everything she grapples with after her best friend shot by police officer and star happens to be the only witness\nObviously it's a very timely story it's one that spoke to Easter re who's an actor who's on the show insecure HBO show she created that show she plays April and the heat you give and she's an activist to star looks up to each race stopped by the cues studio right after the movie premiered at the Toronto international film festival\nAnd as we're about to hear this is the story is a feels is important\nAnd reliable I heard of the\nBook but I haven't read it until um the conversations about the film came out and when I read the book I was\nJust absolutely in Lebanon read the back story about you know Angie writing like as a singer these days than just the journey that she's taken is absolutely inspirational what was it about the book the month\nI mean the perspective of a young black female dealing with you know the aftermath of her friends that that do Allie of her role in in growing up in the hood of going to all white school is just thought incredibly reliable and\nJust the young black tea must perspective specifically you know you don't get to hear about you know there is Trayvon Martin\nFriend who was you know the the key witness and what she was going through and I think about Philando Castile was fiance like those are perspective and and the grief that they have to endure for such a long period of time it's just you don't think about that size\nWell like I said there was like so many complex issues in in the heat that you're giving me racial profiling police brutality code switching and as you point out we're talking about a movie but talking about a book here but these are real life conversations that people are are living in having all the time\nThat's the unfortunate part is that this will always be timely until it's not\nYeah it is the conversation happening in the book how closely does that parallel conversation that are happening in your own life just with you and your friend\nI mean there's definitely an exhaustion of discussing it you know we we all have our own group chat like there's so many\nGroups had said I'm In we're will bring them up I'm just as like what do we do or what can we do or here's another one and it's just like there's a feeling of hopelessness and I think this film in particular um it's about\nFinding your voice and that's also let's inspirational about like\nTrying to figure out what you can do\nIt just the stars of sixteen years old in the heat that you do um she's seen a a peace brutality death is as you said what is it about her the mixture so related to to make somebody people glom onto her\nShe's a teenager and I think we all remember during that time when you're just trying to\nFit in and try not to stand out you're just trying to also find out who you are and start happens to be doing all those things and happens to lose her best friend ... so I imagine\nTrying to figure out who you are and to find your voice when you you need it the most and um\nFor me it will make star labels that yeah I went to high school in the ... but also had an experience you know going to a private school and having to balance those personalities you know the degree that person is like she has to be a certain way\nOr so she thinks of white people and then gets to feel most comfortable in her skin with black people but also have to ... to a degree and um I think so many people of color been there\nYeah because the code switching the culture of having to change what they say around different folks for three and how you act yeah I I'm ... well who's your character here that you're a\nHigh play April who um is a social justice lawyer and too\nFind her voice you know she's an activist she's an activist and she's tired\nAnd she needs and when she needs\nUm you know I admire so many of these activists who are out there constantly rallying people and constantly bringing awareness and so often\nYou just don't get justice you know you always hear those stories about this cop was let free or this killing was justified and I'm April is on the heels of just\nAnd so now they're like clamoring for content from us\nAnd you're there to give it to him even though you may not use
