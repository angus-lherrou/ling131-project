C. needs them to be ... because she needs because she's starving right and I also think you know in a way I think well okay so how do you tell that story and I just keep thinking about this interview I did with um\nWith Trevor Noah from the Daily Show yeah it was about the Deuce but he'd seen the trailer for the kindergarten teacher and I sell um\nHe was asking me about it and he was like\nSo is it a horror movie yeah is it a thriller yeah is it an intimate movie about a woman's mind yeah you know and I think um I Love to that that he said that because\nThe truth is it's it's none of those things and all of those things because even the kind of funny sometimes it's a new form and I think it's partially partially new\nBecause it's feminine it's coming from a feminine place\nWhat do you think the film says about the value we put on art as a society [noise]\nWell I think one of the things that's compelling to me is like well who decides who decides what's valuable who decides that leads to poetry is less valuable than the poetry of their son a boy and I think that's really interesting right\nBut I think also it's interesting to think about the value that she places on earth herself ...\nIn the news there there are people like like the young boy's father I Know I'm getting into the weeds in the film here but you know he\nSure he can he can say whatever you want I Want to be normal life I wanted to be able to make money I wanted to be able to live you know I asked her to her children I Want them to be kind of you know no one's going to be a marine going to be a normal person shot yet she doesn't seem to feel understood she seems to be seems to feel almost\nLeft out of everything because they don't understand the value of of her or to her or the value of art at all\nRight right yeah and then she sort of thinks alive display understands yeah and so that like that's it's but it's very disturbing to see this grown woman go this child to understand the value of arts\nThe way that I'm going to be able to do something worthwhile in the world like it starts to get scary to watch the movie because this woman who originally you think like she says grade teacher she is\nLovely she's curious she's ... she's got these you know she's friendly and then you watch her\nI think it's saying something real about\nThe state of the world for women at the moment I'm this is a woman who is not fundamentally mentally ill should not crazy but I think you're looking at someone who is driven crazy by the culture that she finds herself in\nAnd I think for many women at the moment if we're honest I don't I don't know that I could imagine doing the things that Lisa does I mean it's an allegory she goes real\nFar really extreme I really don't want to be with you know that they are today that are very not related\nWill know well right if it's beyond a normal behavior of north but up until that point the ways in which she's out of control confused has no hell no one understands her um and I think is hungry for some kind of\nReal interaction in the world um is something I really relate to and I know because of what's the cultural conversation at the moment that half of you know the people in the world of women relate to it I mean basically we made them\n... in New York anyway there was this kind of feeling of like the radicalism mixed with Malaysia\nSo there were protests people were spray painting things on Trump's buildings there were it was there were there was a ruptured the protests and the street and then there was also a certain amount of [noise] well that's it that's what happens\nWe'll know there was a certain amount of oh my God look where we actually are yeah this is not where we wish we were [laughter] and\nYeah I think when you I think what started off all of this and the time's up and everything I Believe was Trump saying you\nCan grab women's if you want to and you have enough power and they let you and then there being no consequences for it and I think for for me I was like well how\nThings are bad and I looked at my life and I looked at the ways in which I had accepted all sorts of things I couldn't believe I accepted and um and I think that's sort of what it's about\nI mean I Do think it's about the real consequences of what happens if you starve a vibrant woman's mind and I think so many women right now are waking up to\nThe feeling that we've been starving that we've been accepting so many things bending over backwards twisting ourselves into pretzels to get the things that we need to survive and that it's not okay right and so I think\nThis is a movie about that made by a group of women filmmakers and so I think our our conclusion and the movie is like well what happens when you start vibrant woman's minded dire [laughter] you know\nI think Joe has been so nice pigs\nYou can see Maggie Gyllenhaal into kindergarten teacher this week it started streaming on Netflix tomorrow for friday night binge\nLeon Bridges coming up right after this don't hand over\n\nEvery so often the life asks you to reinvent yourself and that's especially true if you're an artist coming up after ten o'clock on to
