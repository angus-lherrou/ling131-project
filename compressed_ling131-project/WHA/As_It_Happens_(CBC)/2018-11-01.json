when I was definitely alone and I did that and all the\nLike freaked out awesome you mentioned you're Nineteen when when when you have that moment with your writing songs before that celebrated with I don't think a lot of people talk about this 'cause it's kind of the boring side of it takes a lot of discipline it takes a lot of like hours sometimes eight nine yeah Thirteen fourteen hours at a time\nSitting down and and and writing that's not something that could have discipline is not something that normally attributed to people who are Seventeen Eighteen Nineteen years old\nWell I was home schooled route yeah so I had a lot of time to any reason\nUm ... no not really much my daughter and we don't have to get it oh no no no I'm I'm I'm an open\nBook I'll talk to you that anything um
