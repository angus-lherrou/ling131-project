a stray dog and he takes it home and he's trying to give it to somebody's bag and people would take this dog of his sons but nobody will\nSo that in this book started writing and so for ... he's got a dog can go to the dog and again so that surprises me let me a bit of magic that is have you know what I mean writers have just kids who refused to grow up\nThat's what it was what we are we say we're still going to play with our imaginary friends we're still going to play with our toys are going to have this extraordinary interior creates of life that all kids ... and at some point the other world

that uh\nThat cassette tapes in a cassette player on my a piano bench and learn to do that like note by note why the piano for you\nWe had one you had an upright like old piano in the house and it was like a piece of furniture and you know it was just something that I just was gravitated to\nMore so than any sports or you know hanging out I just wanted to play piano wanted to be in a band and I was trying to learn theory and and I took a couple of piano lessons and the piano teacher told me I'm On teachable an artist something and then I should just\nGo year I Know I was playing sophisticated jazz cords or blues chords whatever was on my own I didn't know what the courts were but I was playing them\nWhat his hair and slap my us or anything satellites\nWas there a specific moment where you said I think I Want to do this from my life I Want to do this for my career to there was um\nI was just a kid I was about Thirteen Years old and I had this friend of mine satanic friend at the time she was a girl Alison match\nAnd her father\nTold me he wanted me to play piano for his guess because he knew I play piano or whatever and he was having a party was really wealthy guy yeah and um he gave me a hundred dollars after I played this song played like Bruce Hornsby or something\nIt got the best of me yeah and when when you once you go down that road you're not thinking clearly you're you're you know you read the thinking about how to get it and then oh well if I have\nA you know a yacht and a big bowl the cocaine I don't think I might have a problem getting in the girl that was when I you know you just start you're going down the roads are thinking about the wrong stuff\nAnd then then you're buying again like you're buying the luxury vehicles ten at a time ... while being high you know ... the guy you find talking about it now\nI mean it doesn't bother me you know what I mean it did it hurt a little more when I was completely broke but um you know seeing the light of day again and and and in a in a life is comfortable again for me because I'm working really hard and [noise] and um\nBut yeah you know it was something I did you know if I could take it back I Would but yeah you wouldn't you know what I mean but you know whatever brought me to this point I'm happy with where I Am in my life right now and I'm doing well one\nOf the things in the documentary about you as you say you don't think anyone could have survived but you went through\nThe yeah I mean I went for people are very forgiving and the music business or just in general you know and um you know I went through a time where you know hey\nAnd you would have to hear and read about all this stuff by yourself and you know it's crazy you know you have to deal with it but I'm I'm I'm thick skinned a strong stomach and you know I put my I got through that and you know I guess I was blocking out medicating when I was getting high but you know when I quit\nAnd I got sober and realized OK I'm trying to get back in the music business again and you have people take me seriously and you know fix the relationships that are destroyed when I was high and you know I was\nYou know unmanageable [laughter] it's so to speak for for ... hours or for even my management or whatever yeah you know are just I had to I had to deal with that that was the hard\nPart so how do you how do you get back into music that how do you make the priority be music and\nWell with\nSobriety comes clarity and you realize you know this is my God given talent\nHave to get serious about this you know I have to have a family to support and not have you know a life that I have to live and and um\nI had already gotten a taste of the good life and I wanted to do and ... and you know an arrest on my laurels I I don't care

was\nA\nThat is true for your abs and taking a walk you said he's the future\nHe's part of the my future collection yeah he's amazing though he's he's got his own style he's he's definitely like a rock star to me I could production has changed a lot since you started making music though like how do you find production and twenty Eighteen\nUm I mean it's constantly evolving yeah I think\nThat music is a great place for producer like myself because a lot of key were driven stuff melody driven stuff and [noise] um I think people are thirsty for something new that's where you know those type of records come from and it's not like your traditional track record than you would think that you would get something like super\nInto a trap e or whatever from from a young artist trip you read but

but earlier this year there was a bit of an upset in the book world had to do with the man Booker Prize which is sort of the Oscar sort of the enemies of literature so the upset was for the inclusion for the first time ever a graphic novel in the list of finalists\nThe book is called Sabrina by mc there now so it didn't end up winning the prize but it did get people thinking about the boundaries we set up between one form or another and why why do we feel the need to differentiate between art forms at all and that's something that Catherine ever met has given some thought to\nIf you want a governor generals award as a poet and came close to winning a second as a novelist for a book you might be familiar with called the break she writes children's stories and most recently she writes graphic novels\nHer first one came out last year it's called American wars and she's following up with a sequel at the end of November and if you asked Katherine ever Matt how she manages to move between these worlds that institutions like the man Booker or the governor general see is entirely separate\nWhile her answer makes a lot of sense\nThey all are about you know kind of me I'm I'm all in there somewhere as as we all are an artist\nAnd they they seem to coincide like it's a chronology you know they seem to go one after the other like after the documentary the graphic novel feels very close to that because I was working with collaborators and I was with people who are much more talented than I was\nAnd really kind of directing how things look and I got to do that visual stuff and the graphic novel but you do very very differently and poetry and in prose\nSo does feel more connected maybe then um say the other earlier stuff\nI find through all the all your work a lot of a lot of it focuses on youth or like teenager years adolescence what what do you find so fascinating about that\nWell I I really started the book of poetry came out when my eldest daughter was I think twelve\nSo I was really kind of coming explained my own adolescence as I was approaching these these two teenage girls who are about to uh take me through the ringer so a lot of that would be from my girls and from their friends and my nieces and nephews\nBecause they're really of that era but\nYou really remember the things that happen to you as you you came of age she really they're very impactful you as you go forward [noise]\nUm I Know in in studying different like you know education things about the brain and how when we're teenagers we actually hardwired all of those habits are so that we actually do remember things when we're Seventeen a lot better than we remember things that happened say when we were twenty five [noise]\nUm and the way we deal with things in the way we look at life is really made in the course of those those times when our brains are actually forming around our hopefully good habits mostly bad habits when my case anyway you\nDirected a documentary called this river you want a Canadian screening word for it and that documentary tells the story of your brother Wayne went missing in guide and then maybe the reason I'm asking so many questions about those teenage years because I was really struck that you were just fourteen when he disappeared and like why would why was that the right time to tell the story\n[noise] my part in the documentary came about 'em really reluctantly I really wanted to talk about a drag the red and the efforts that are going on right now with people who have a loved ones who are murdered or are are missing\nAnd then I guess through that I realized how close that was to that story and how much I really felt\nUm a kinship to these efforts in in bringing awareness and in some cases in the case of drag the red literally looking physically looking for these lost loved ones I'm part of it was the idea that\nIt's so unfortunately so common in some\nThat no one's untouched you know and during the course of that documentary no one that we worked with didn't know of or was close to someone who had been murdered or missing and was being searched for so it was it was part of that my story is one part of many many stories\nIn the documentary you say that everything you've done comes from that experience of losing your brother ... what would what would tell me about them\nI think that that sort of grieving and I think this is similar to many types of grieving which involves a certain amount of helplessness [noise]\nYou you feel like you have to do something you want to do anything um anything in the terms of helping whether it's helping yourself or helping your loved ones are helping make sure that the situation doesn't happen again which unfortunately keeps happening so [noise]\nSo it it kind of spread it in me this idea of um education and awareness and that really started in my youth with educating and making aware myself and making sure I understood what these issues where and and how and where they came from to the best of my ability", "show_name": "As It Happens (CBC)", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "26"}
