stand up and the first place\nIt was a good night we were in this great theater with a really excited crowd and you know again it was the kind of occasion I could've dressed up for which can Jong politely reminded me of\nI'm Glad you took the effort to to wear a great jacket for the kill you to wear a blazer time they didn't know this is Brian Adams con here [laughter]\n\n\n\nYou don't you start doing stand up he took a break from it when you were doing movies and TV but you got back into it this year so we talked about how\nHow does it feel to be back at it\nOh man this is unlike any other feeling I hadn't done stand up in ten years and for me to to come back at this level and and and headline and also just kind of tell the stories of the past ten years of kind of why I quit my medical job to go into acting it's it's been so\nI'm unexpectedly cathartic and therapeutic and I really get to kind of without any editing really just kind of talk about my life in a sense that were sometimes when you're doing television and movies you know you're always eat either being directed are being given notes on development and it's so nice to have like a platform where I don't feel restricted at all for better for it\nI feel different I mean now that you're you're you're already famous is doing standup feel different now than it did when you were starting out 'cause he did it start right\nYeah if it feels a lot different because starting out you know just um\nFor me I I'm I'm kind of a shy nervous guy where I didn't I felt like I really had to prove myself especially doing stand up especially I got my start a jail cell in Montreal and you know you you just all and not just me every comic you want to have that that really killer ten minutes you really want to just do a tight set you really have to grab their attention\nAnd it's nice to know that you know usually they're my own fans coming to my shows and and I really I don't have to have I'm already gotten that ... that passed that first level of dating if you will run you get to know me better yeah\nChris Rock says you only get five minutes though he said when you're famous you get five minutes that free\nYeah did you end up you're less famous I guess you know five minutes I have one [laughter]\nYou know what I mean by that like you get five minutes where everyone can laugh no matter what these are grace 'cause they're expected that you're there have you found that as\nWell oh yeah oh hey you gotta come prepared and and that's that's one of the reasons why I didn't want to\nIt because I've been offered to to do a lot of stand up just in general over the last ten years I didn't want to use my old act and I didn't want anything to sound data because you can post on that fame for just a few minutes but if you don't have an act the the audience is very unforgiving in stand up audience are actually very smart they'll know oh he's just ... you know\nA like a uh forgot what I was saying I just enjoy talking about myself\nWe were talking about that\nWhen you're with us it yes there was a change in how you approached your career\nLook on a if you look in the Blu ray DVD of hanging over one\nThere's me in the desert I'm doing this improper ten minutes and it's not really into this refined UC be kind of in ... it is like I'm literally channeling me being really mad at the demons of at the world for you know cursing my life with cancer I remember that deadly and I was just like shouting of screaming the most\nPolitically incorrect things I still don't remember what I said but\nIt was just raw as I've ever been on any set and I just remember yelling a lot and and I got this big applause at the end of it and uh I went to Todd I was like man this is this is this is what I knew so therapeutic so I just remember\nThinking that and I would think about trans cancer while onset just to get me into character plain mister chow as aggressively as I did so they kind of taught me that life is you know\nIt's the whole adage of life is short so you might as well while you're here just make the most to whatever opportunity you got and I definitely channel that in the hangover movies because it was like that\nThat right there it's just kind of you know\nWhen I think about it it's it's it's complicated for me watch it because especially the first one because I ended up thinking about ... and and then but also on a on a on a positive side I end up thinking like wow this is this is you know just don't think sometimes just just do it you know don't don't don't over thank\nYou know happy she's going to better she better and she's grey she's so support to this day she is she\nWho told me she ... we had just gotten married when I when I was going to quit I was always Korean into being pre\nMed I thought it was my Korea an obligation as a first born son to never to stay oh I'm going to be that talented guy who could have been after that the doctor the rest of my life I really thought that was my state right and it was my life is like that doesn't have to be your fate and I don't want you and especially after filming knocked up she was like we we had just gotten married and she was like\nI'm not going to have you resent me the rest of our marriage I'm not going to hold you back\nYou know ... if you're looking for an excuse to not do it I'm not going to be your excuse\nDo you remember when you were young though I mean I'm trying to factor in all of the reasons perhaps you you thought you had to be a doctor do you remember seeing Asian Americans on television in comedy when you were young\n... is the only one I really remember you know from the karate kid you know and a Henry Joe when I was in college a lot of people don't talk about him but he is a a Korean American comedian or from Knoxville, Tennessee gossip ... is really funny\nAnd you'd be he was on Jay Leno a lot I remember he was a big influence and then obviously Margaret Cho was really the pioneer into this to this day she is still like\nThe the I don't know she is kind of the godmother of contemporary Asian\nAmerican Asian Canadian comedy she really is just kind of the reason we're all here\nWith like the next clip pick them up at the\nThey had a real problem with me because I look it's way that I talk this way [noise]\nThat was like a problem that needs to be sensitive about it they're like Margaret we don't want you to take it the wrong way that could you be a little bit more I don't know Chinese [noise]\nWell actually I'm Korean [noise] whatever [noise]\nOn the show and how you're supposed to do\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise] wrong [noise]\n[noise]\nKind of the algorithm of every Asian American ... you know comic F when you start out is that average talk about family you talk about the household is everything ... you know that that's the starting up ... every Asian American\nCommunity but she's also talking about the expedition put on her yet as well\nYes it's all about expectations is all about you know I mean and I even in my own act I do a version of that which is like tonight where I I talk about how when I left my dad my my dad was not happy when I left medicine and and so he was like you were ... family\nAnd then after the hangover we are so proud [noise]\nI'm so proud of your tiny ding dong [laughter] how can I get as plasma SADs [noise] and and I did I got into [laughter]\nTalk about it so much was made a lot so much talked about what crazy Rich Asians I don't know if anyone's lawyers are crazy Rich Asians [noise]\nEnd the conversation was about how far we've come how we've far we've come in and representation how how far become an Asian American representation in in cinema\nAnd the point and I'm not I don't have a clip of the problem is but the point we had come from being like sixteen candles like long ... sixty got I'm going to do you remember that one like that was another kind of what you saw on TV right\nI mean I I think now you know crazy Rich Asians that is like the first project I the first major movie that's become this global head where I don't think about oh what's in it for me you know did this the first movie I\nWhere I'm like I Am so happy for the movement as opposed to the movie John Chu the director is like this is not a movie is a movement and we're all drinking off of that Kool Aid while we were filming it just is not about\nI mean we all news really not about us it's not how to get to that at least for me it's not how to get to that next level it's like I I have friends of mine um that I I I quietly\nAnd it produced other life or in a very talented Asian American filmmakers and and um I've finally produced and even finance them in independent movies and one of them\nWent to Sundance when I think about crazy Rich Asians and ethics that I have you know I'm thinking about friends of mine that are tech to me like oh my God my mother did there just green lighting my project

like Colombo right now but I'm realizing even though I'm Still in my early thirties that there's an entire generation of adults now who have very little memory\nOf life before the Internet and when you ask these people what it was like to grow up on line to get some pretty interesting answers so take el mills for example\nAs a kid growing up an automobile she always had a camera in her hand she shot home videos these turned him to short sketches eventually into short films\nNow not so long ago a kid like el was probably destined for film school but as she grew up and when she did el mills have something else in mind she started her own channel on YouTube people started watching elves videos\nPretty much immediately these days for YouTube channel has more than ... million subscribers she goes on tour people lined up for hours to meet her after the shows I mean that's a dream come true right\nWhen according to el mills yes and no you're about to hear that all that attention all that fame all that success\nIn a new media space can be kind of overwhelming even if it is something you've always dreamed about\nI always wanted to be in the movie the TV but then when you became a thing when I was like in like five six middle school\nAnd like I knew that was I wanted to do 'cause it's just so festival to drop out of school to yeah I dropped out uh I did a semester where a auto you for marketing up cool you know uh but that might ... channel is blowing up and I decided I wanted to focus on that so I decided to take a semester off there\nAnd I haven't gone back how did you have that go with your folks both of them were like shocked at first um because I was I was a academically driven um but um my mom was very supportive she says whatever you want to do\nUm and my dad was just a little concerned for sure but now he totally understand that because he just didn't understand like the holy to both in that\nWell yeah I mean when your parents were ... they there was no YouTube now so to them it probably does seem like staring into a camera from the older generations perspective obviously I understand what it looks like it looks like just someone making little videos on line yeah but so much more than that this the on social media world has become a whole different thing is\nInsane now are so tell me about how long does it take to make videos than the ones I fear like between four six sometimes eight ten minutes how long did it take you to me [noise]\nI'd say a solid week of fake state work so like every day every hour I'm working for a week it's it's become a huge production at this point yeah I just keep I keep raising the bar and just keeps getting bigger and bigger\nAnd part of this is getting so much of yourself in this to you you get a conscious decision that you wanted to reveal a lot of yourself ...\nYeah I I I I just find my life I don't know if this is not to speak to say that I find interesting [laughter]\nI just find that it's not me it's the people in my life I find them fascinating they're all such characters to me and I find that in any person you meet you could turn them into\nA character I liked the idea of like showcasing that because I found my family especially very interesting and they're very believable but also just so unique like you've never seen something like that before you\nUsed to use some of the most personal things a person can do as you talk about in these videos\n[noise] [laughter] humans are so strong to repress I figure that out in ... is a Nineteen\nPerson I had known for went out and I may have had a little too much to drink person I was trying to pull me aside and I told him and he don't want your money for something to celebrate and went back to auto within a day\nOut you know [noise]\nI Know you should have been The Simpsons I came back home in September now you know why\nThe few too busy with almost four million views covered by news outlets all over the world of view [noise] coming out yeah\nMe coming out that that he has a video of me crying and my dad was for a very odd that as almost four million is\nHow do you decide to go but let's start with how do you decide that this is how you want to come out\n[noise] I'm so bad it being vulnerable which is surprising if you look at my age of channel ... vulnerable in person so I find being vulnerable on camera is kind of loophole to that because when I'm being vulnerable\nShirt is being showcased to millions of people but at the moment in at the time of me being vulnerable I'm by myself with a camera so I'm like catching the system I'm being able to being vulnerable without having to be honorable loophole yeah love it\nTell me about the moment you made that decision though to do that do you remember was there a time was or space where you somewhere he wrote a table in the back of a car like when did you decide I was going to make this video\nIt's when I decided it's one I figured out as bisexual I was like okay now I Need to tell people could have something that's been like\nA like a weight on my shoulders for a long time and I as keeping a secret and I know I knew my my mom would especially she knew I was hiding something from it so I knew it was time to just kind of like really sad pressure and so I just thought\nIt was like I thought making the coming up video will be like killing a ton of birds with one stone like I Would not have to sit down every friend and sit down every family member and tell them how to those who didn't tell personally feel about that [noise]\nYeah I I realized after their ultimate you know I Know I Know there's some people like I didn't tell my sisters\nI just found out through video because they were raised very religious they are very religious Christian folk yes exactly and so there are ... upset by that um they shouldn't find out what the rest of the world they should find out oh just maybe a few seconds beforehand\nBut I guess yeah I I I I learned from that experience so but after that you start getting thousands and thousands of more people subscribe for you to channel do something you noticed yeah that that coming on video blew up like nothing I've ever seen before it changed the videos than you were making afterwards\nIt changed in the sense that I I started putting a lot of pressure on how good the videos are they cause I felt like a lot of the ... the coming of video blew up because there was like\nA you know I came out and everyone's just trying to be supportive but I think a lot of it was they they were intrigued by the storytelling and how I made the actual video itself\nAnd so I was like really worried that the next video is not as good or something so that to a change really but it wasn't like oh I Need to give way more myself now know a little bit ... right after the video I was like okay I Need to do more and he'd go bigger\nAnd and you pick it up later the cookie or how do you think it was\nJust to me in on the little ... looks much and I believe I Will be the last ... well me being I just got a good idea to do\nYour job is very very [noise]\nWhy\nNot having enough I was you know on the way you must not around me\nSo that's about ... video called I legally married my sister's boyfriend\n[laughter]\nI learned already married for for a walk the walk us through what we just heard yeah I'm a centrally the video I posted\nRight after my coming up video um and\nI decided it would be funny because it's a joke that I'm going to be the last ... kids get married that it'd be funny if I went to Vegas and legally married my sister's boyfriend\nAnd that's and that's what I did I went I went in the morning and I came back at night and I was legally married and then what happens we tell the family and um the reaction is not as great as we had expected from the family the family you know and now now the family find that funny", "show_name": "As It Happens (CBC)", "year": "2018", "city":
