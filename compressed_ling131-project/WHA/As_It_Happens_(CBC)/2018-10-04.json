I read that when you joined the b._b._c. trainee in the early fifties you had very little experience of it you'd you'd barely watched it is that right\nWell nobody had really I mean not just fifty two or the number of people you couldn't see TV and in London you couldn't see anywhere else in the country are\nOn the number of people who had sets are numbered in in a few thousand\nIs that uh so uh how'd the end it but he had seen television and the cameras were using and the students are using were the ones which provided the first television public service in the world ever so and when he was still using it and they started in Nineteen thirty eight I think that a six sided check\nSo what was the potential you saw for nature and television programming\nUm well at the time we hardly anybody done any programs about anything really I mean except um what would the cooking and knitting and politics hum I'm quiz shows and gardening but a ... is\nBut so they actually going out into the wild uh wasn't what TV did a television I hadn't nice job speaking now the BBC in London\nOr we didn't have the money to the fast you go to Africa let alone the costs of making films television or was it an offspring of radio on the people who run radio said most of the money is ours I Would just give you a little bit don't spend too much of it is the same time I knew something you don't spend it on the F those\nSo it wasn't until I I've been in the business for a couple of years and I managed to persuade people to let me take a film camera to Africa One\nOf the first show that he did was zoo quest you would travel around the world filming London Zoo staff getting animals for the zoo we have a clip from that show from Nineteen fifty six when you were in Indonesia\nOne man said that when he had been in the last few days ago kids see you ... snake in one of the tree maybe he said it's still\nShort and I found it [noise]\n\nAnd they know this is science a mock case I was ... or does it goes up by the national non poisonous which was something of a relief\nFor granted bail as soon as you've grabbed his head otherwise Iraq has great ... around you and give you a very nasty squeezed\nVery nasty squeezed from Nineteen fifty six [laughter] goes what goes through your mind hearing that\nWell all I remember most is it a lot of thoughts of the time that things will void was to get to go you know the ... the head out talks about ... but actually the worst jobs you grab the trial because it wasn't a snake was that size is being picked up its quote something from it\nBack and get rid of your closest some days to come in [laughter] so\nIt's a disaster catastrophe you have to time he'll punches\nAre you hopeful for the future of the planet\nI'm actually I'm more hopeful than I was\nAbout ten years ago really um ah well I I I couldn't see the disasters were overwhelming or an increasing number and I I couldn't see any way out of it and I couldn't see any beams hope\nBut actually the the whole issue has become global in the last ten years now I mean China for example which used to be I'm pulling up pulling fumes into the atmosphere\nChina has realized that they can't go on this way China's done something about getting it smokers fuel projects going\nSo that I'm ... and and all around the world I'm a people begin to realize that they have a responsibility not only about the atmosphere but about the oceans are some things are moving and we have after all stopped a for hunting wells which was\nOf fifty years ago was a major major problem that's as good but that's not to minimize the disasters as a looming I mean what what's happening to the seizes is catastrophe\nAnd how are we going to fix that international it because it has to be out internationally I don't know but at least more people are aware of what the problem is the ... and eventually I just hoping that as it were people power is going to make the politicians take take notice of what has to be them\nSo David you know when you when you look back at everything you've done so far is there one is there one moment\nSupport for WPRI comes from American transmission company ATC provides a path to

of the memorable as far as I'm concerned was the first time I put her on scuba gear and dived a on a coral reef a and that was in Nineteen fifty five um and then you are surrounded by\nA hundred or two hundred three hundred organisms you've never seen a lot of new life\nThey are incredible beauty extraordinary things you never knew existed there's no idea what kind of things happening all that's on the reef and amongst mold animals are not frightened of you and they swim all around you that is a breathtaking moment sure never forget\nAnd it's one of the great tragedies is coral reefs are on the way out unless something really extraordinary happens and the nation's world really do manage to get together to do something about marine pollution and about a study pollution and gun temperature

a warning does coming\nAnd uh you know your your our generation ... you know like it I have to make fun but it's interesting to think of when the show started wreck Mercer the biggest the first big get they got who was a celebrity actually did a show with Peter's asking right who gave them a lot of support\nUh and so I felt it was important to keep the ties between CBC Radio and uh our show by mocking\nYou yeah of course I've really you know over the country that order Canada\nMarket the new book is called son of a ... a child is new memoir it's hilarious it's it's also like heartbreaking it's beautiful mark joins me in Studio ... tell you about a high high buddy how's it going very good it's interesting to have this\nBook out because in my eye when writing it you're just alone you know when you're typing typing away and you're all in your own head and then last night we had this first kind of an event where\nThese lovely folks in the book club came and they sort of asked me questions about the book and my initial reaction was well how'd you do that and I realized oh wait I published I so yeah so it's interesting to see how people reacting to it in the world\nWell let's say I was when I tell you were putting out a book you would have been forgiven for putting out a book about your exploits about you know about you know everything you're done and twenty to everything you did before that but you told them really personal stories here well why was the impetus of that when they started going down\nThrough the the the story of of your childhood I guess I guess is pretty reflective and I think there was like a it's a it's a natural thing is to censor yourself and going on I could put that into our shouldn't say that as as a certain point I just decided okay I'm not going to do that I'm gonna I'm gonna write watch what I Want to write what I feel like I should write well I'm drawn to write\nAnd some of that was funny and some of that was sad and and uh and all came together or hopefully in a way that's enjoyable one of my favorite characters in the book is your mom or this is one of my favorite\nQuotes you write she drove a car or the way someone might fire starter pistol for the first time eyes closed and facing\nAway yeah my mom would go in there kind of like back in the seventies is evil can evil being strapped in and it's like a shot across the ... but she would often accelerate and close your eyes and get into I remember once we're in driving down came I wrote a big major highway and St john's and moms say oh that's been as in the wrong lane I was like no we're not wearing\nThe bank and then we'll come into the back passed\nOut of a of a mount these car and they can't be driving back and just coming to and looking back at that I don't think that was weird well I think was that they just at the end those days as advocates knocked out we'll put them in the backseat till he wakes up like there was no different got a new Finland shout or he'll be alright shake it up\nAnd you didn't you're talking about going to school century says that Monday pond which I really should not be so colloquial about you were insane traces which is a school in east end at St John yeah\nA Catholic school an area we we know is Monday pond yeah a beautiful part of town is a bit of a hard part of town it was harder than and it was you know kind of a I guess you'd call a tough school like you know like\nOne of those places that don't go up around ... dollars\nKinda more generational going back and has a reputation everybody where this there was a lovely but I mean kids who went to school there many of them had been in fights and stuff like that and I had never been around children really because we lived\nFar away from the center city next to a radio station where my where my dad worked\nAnd he was sort of the emergency go to guy uh so we had to live next to the station in case a DJ fell asleep during the night or a translator with that so there were no other kids around so when I went to school it was my first kind of interaction or with other kids so I'll be sitting there ... and then they could smell the fear in me you know\nSo that was overwhelming\nYou were bullied into most new Finland nerd kind of way which they stole your Pepsi oh yeah not coke no your head of the yeah you're ships yeah and your cello yes the nuns maybe played cello 'cause I was the huskies child and they're like we think you could lift the ... which is you know as all great maestro are chosen by the instruments they could you know\nThe the the people with avian bones syndrome a hollow bones they they play whistles and blue and then the husky our children are given shallow and uh yeah so these guys there was a family of them like everybody was like as one of those places were like oh I'll be back to school and my brothers are coming there as a before cell phones but somehow at three o'clock\nSeven brothers of varying ages who look just like the guy the weight like a hard you'll shoved my broader at race that's grown mad about what we're going to fight that we don't have children and so these guys stole my cello which is like\nI never got to be jak for a cello sick what are you going to do with the ... there's a big guitars and you don't even know what it is you're stealing and yeah that I had to get my cello back so that\nWas a a that was a [noise] it's it's hard to feel tough after ... but it led to a really beautiful moment and lead to a moment to at least great empathy you go to the ... house yeah go to ... house and the cello have been heading back yard and um so we're going through the house and and we had to get there and his father was kinda passed\nOut asleep watching wrestling shirtless or without some cans of beer around and you know that great new Finland version of a thinker and we went down to the back yard and and I find my cello\nAnd I'm lugging my cello back to the house and I was like oh I had to call my parents like you can't you can't you can't do that you wake him up and I'm like ... I'll be quiet and then it's like uh I I call home and I'm like Oh hi and as he wakes up and it's like you are what are your own and are stealing our phone and kind of like\nIt was like well there's no test drives me money it's a local alone veal bones of the world and it got really\nAnd and then he he ah hit my friend and and we made a break for it and then you kind of realize like oh I see while you're like yeah I I see why you're you're ... you're paying for it and then after that you know we became you know kind of close friends and uh and he's kind of protected me uh but yeah\nThe ... the great story of new land is going to get things stolen from there but some of my favorites my brother told me about his buddy who got his dog stolen from his backyard one time and he went down to his house knocked on the door and said excuse me I think it's still my dog and the buddies father when no no I didn't steal your dog and he saw the dog in the back in the kitchen\nTable and really yeah I I got I was going out with a lady and a malamute was stolen and ... and and then there's almost our dog was stolen and the guy called said he wants the money for it and this is the name I gave his name and phone number and I was like [noise]\nI Know him and then I had to go to his house and I knocked and everybody was walking to was a guy who got dog stolen that that's probably down there and I was like okay yeah so I go in there and he opens the door like\nHigh there and he's like Ohio and we went to school together and you got a dog and the dog's name was Scott ... dog hair and I said\nHere Scott Scott Scott Scott and the dog came running as well just keep this between ourselves and then her parents thought I was connected to the underbelly of dog thievery and I we had to break up I just assumed you were if you just\nAre here I speaking with mark Critz you might be of a seeing him on December twenty two minutes he just released a new book all about his own life a son of a crutch a childish Newfoundland memoir\nUm I thought you open the book by explaining that new Finland is can lay claim to almost anyone as a fellow new Finland are gene Simmons\nIs from New Finland that me James girlfriend is from New Finland limits is neutral enemies cases new Finland banned exactly I mean this I get this all the time people new lenders right into this show and saying when you were talking David Attenborough one time he showed a puff and oh yeah things are new plan so he's kind of a new lender John Williams\nThe guy scored Star Wars or he he of course you've got to start at CBC Radio in Newfoundland during the war so he's a new for the lander for Bill Cosby spent time in ... in the mail for a long time he was a new for the lander but now he's in American again we don't want him and he's now he's like oh yeah well he was only wasn't here very long tall\nSo I thought we play a game I I wanted to challenge you to claim the following people as new lenders assert okay first is one in the book which is the current prime minister Justin Trudeau", "year": "2018", "show_name": "As It Happens (CBC)", "city": "Madison", "day": "04"}
