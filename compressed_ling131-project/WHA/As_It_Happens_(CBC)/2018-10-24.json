about successful fashion brands you might think about runway shows and red carpets and very thin models and most definitely clothing that doesn't seem to be made for your body or necessarily your life\nWill tend to Taylor has been challenging that ever since she started designing women's where Kenyan make clothing that's really expressive sunny it's optimistic bold prints geometric shapes bright colors\nAnd just like real life optimism it catches on her clients currently include Taylor Swift beyond say\nFor us a first lady Michelle Obama but these are not the type of clothes that are just meant for the red carpets and models among us time to design clothes for all ages all shapes and I think it's something that a lot of her peers just don't do I'm excited to talk a little bit more about it and I'm excited to have perhaps Canada's most prestigious designer right\nNow China Taylor in our studio high I thank you for having me it's such a joy to hurt or hear or you grew up in Toronto\nGrew up in Toronto I went to high school here and then ... university then Parsons in New York\nSo when you were growing up in terms of the world of fashion seem accessible to you\nI don't even think I knew there was a world the fashion when I was growing up in Toronto I think my world fashion consisted of my mom and my grandma and how much they loved\nGetting dressed up playing with close playing with color but I didn't realize that it's an industry and I think it wasn't until I moved to New York and really saw how creative\nAnd commerce can kind of co exist and how beautiful it is to have kind of both of them in a job and in a world together\nBut the ... side of you like you grew up painting is yeah\nSo my mom um she we had a rec room in the basement and it probably 'cause I was an only child and I needed some activities to keep me busy she gave me free rein to paint anything I Want it on the\nWall food out full only child stuff that ... family of six [laughter]\nPaint your imaginary friend [laughter] so\nI did I recreate it into this retro landscape of like old cars and old um Hollywood actresses and very artistic lotta paper mash a a lot of arts and crafts my house and I think that that was kind of starting point of expressing myself through painting and through creating things slow\nAnd forgive me for this because I mean as you I wore my best bomber jail every guy I wore the best stuff I have\nI Wish you guys can see it I or the best stuff I have for today I feel flattered so forgive me if I'm gonna I'm gonna try this but I feel like when I see your work I see elements of paintings ... times you've worked feels like a campus with paint on it\nThank you well we paint all of our presence in our studio in New York and\nI never intentionally started the company thinking that would be how we express the story or tell customer what we're feeling but it's kind of the easiest most personal way to do it and I'm so we spent weeks just painting and then we create them we create all of our fabrics based on our paintings\nSo I'm gonna ask you to do something a little challenging for me okay can you describe the aesthetic of tiny trailer on the radio\n... there's a lot of movement it's optimistic our girl is going somewhere in it it's very colorful it's very happy and you want to talk to her if you saw someone walking into the room wearing our brand you want to ask her question\nMentioned optimism a little while ago yes so in researching a little bit about you that were comes up a lot mhm why is that\nI think that fashion should be a positive representation of how someone's feeling and I think that it should be optimistic I think when I was in\nUniversity there was this poll towards creating dark fashion and strong lines and this intensity and what you're designing and I never felt connected to that I always felt like I wanted to create things that were really light and really\nOr you had like a Starbucks or in like do you go to Starbucks all the time or is it started with having a cup of coffee and civil walks in wearing your clothes yes it was a few\nThe coolest that's that's when you feel like you've got a gold star that day [laughter]\nWhat do you mean like whenever I Would do something good at home when I was a kid I've got a gold star on a little piece of paper in my bedroom and it just feels like an achievement it feels like it's quiet you don't need to celebrate it in a public way but it feels like you've done something where you'd made that person's day better\nIt must be feel so rewarding it's rewarding definitely is so great talking to you I think there's a lot of people listening to this who who like myself sometimes find the world of fashion I'm a little bit scary sometimes I'm definitely getting better at it but it's a lot of people who can't afford expensive clothing\nMaybe people when they read vogue when to pick up a little bit um see themselves reflected in if you're someone who I was a cares a lot about inclusive of the what what are your food and\nI think fashion as approachable I think that magazines aren't necessarily where you need to look to be inspired for fashion and I think that just being out in Toronto or being out in a city and watching how women she'll ...\nIt's probably where to get inspired what do you think of as the motivates you\nMaking women happy I Love doing that right now through clothing but I think that we have found ways to partner even recently with\nYou know hospitals and different organizations to start spreading a message of color and joy and that makes me really happy but it was a ... yeah it's we did one yesterday as sick as hospital and\nBecause we paint all the time we've decided that we want to take painting to pediatric hospitals and they start at ... New York\nAnd we host at painting class in their community center and kids can come and join that their siblings because there's a lot of activities that are\nNot geared for both of them to be able to kind of bond and be kids together and yesterday me does that tickets and it's awesome it's the kid says the technology to actually film you in a studio painting and then they broadcast and each of the patients rounds so it's it's pretty ... it's ...\nIt's it's really cool talking to you well thank you very much thank you for ... it's so nice to meet you too that was a Canadian fashion design to tend to Taylor she's\nBased in New York or you can head over to our website to check out some photos from her her recent collections and I think she might have like my mom or jackets so a loved it so I think ran out of time they were up to a good start [laughter] [noise]\nUh coming up Jason Moran is responsible for a lot of people rethinking jazz one of his compositions is inspired by Chinese stock market report and others inspired by skateboarding Jason Moran finds jazz and very unlikely place you're going to hear him talk about coming up right after that\n\nYou are listening to the ideas network cue continues and just a moment and stay with us at nine for BBC Newsday then at ten on Latino USA a conversation with democratic candidate for Texas Governor loopy Valdez\nSupport for Wisconsin Public radio comes from the second century and dumb and fund aboard designated endowments on providing ongoing financial support for WPRI in its second century of service to the residents of Wisconsin\nSupport also comes from one or two remodeling dedicated to improving updating and beautiful buying homes inside and out showrooms and want to key and on or dinner wrote in Madison window kitchen and bathroom galleries at one a key remodeling dot com\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio joined the conversation by emailing ideas at W.
