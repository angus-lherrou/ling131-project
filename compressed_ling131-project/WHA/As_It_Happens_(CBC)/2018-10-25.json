not you probably see a young kind of clueless version of yourself trying really hard to fit in\nWell I'm Alexander has a new book out called swing and a father two teenage boys were knee deep and all of the drama of high school\nAnd navigating first love the freaking out about making the baseball teams are throwing house parties and short swaying is full of those kinds of moments that mean everything to a kid\nAnd Kwame Alexander sees the poetry and all that I mean literally swing is not necessarily a novel it's a story told through four hundred pages of verse I'm I'm only sort of getting into the plot of the collection or the book or the novel\nBecause um it it takes in terms of my talk a little bit about that too but I'm happy to say the Kwame Alexander joins me live in the keys to do to tell you more about it how's it going\nIt's great how are you I'm very well I was going to have a six fingers have the book is so centered around baseball I was reading it last night while watching the world series I was like well we're going to start out maybe by talking about the the Red Sox and the Dodgers but you sit down and right before the end if you start to say I don't really know anything about baseball\nYou know I don't I I Know a little bit I've been to a couple of national games right I used to go to Yankees games as a kid when I Lived in New York\nUm and I I've written a book about basketball but football about soccer and this is it like my truly American novel I feel and so what is the American sport and it's baseball I mean at least from Americans prospective maybe hockey next\nYear I'm for us up here yeah there you go Kwame Alexander is going to kick things off with the palm of ... what are you going to be first first I'm going to read the first form in the book good I feel good about it All right All right let's do this is that called me like under reading from swing\nWe we're halfway through junior year rounding the bases about to score walk was still pretending like he wasn't weird and frightened cool Sam was busy being cool and firewall her boyfriend cruise\nOf the I'm so cool even my temper is lukewarm club\nAnd I was in the dugout mostly happy just watching trying to get up the nerve to get into the game things were pretty much normal baseball is still king\nBut people were also talking about the American flags randomly popping up around town on car windows in malls in graveyards her feet on the freeway exit signs anywhere everywhere we were best friends around in the base is about to score\nEverything was cool everything was co pathetic my best friend ... like to say until it wasn't\nComing Alexander reading prologue from his book swing you're the first author\nTo come in and read and not look down at the page [laughter]\nOh you got to think about it like this I'm I've read that poem hundreds of times in the past week\nUm stared it'd be right in the idol you did it I like to make connections with my audience I appreciate the I mean it's a\nIt's an interactive experience you know I'm not just trying to read to you I'm trying to sort of read with you if you may recall in school\nIn my mind I was I wrote love poems like the router and I played tennis [laughter] so in my mind I was cool but nobody thought I was cool until senior year when I was the number one player in the district and\nAnd the most beautiful brilliant girl in high school we had a four point five GPA went to a problem with me because I had written her love poem so it took like a long time but finally senior year the poetry and the tennis so they kicked him but I always knew I was cool even if everyone else didn't think so\nWhen you went to schools to research this book um did you learn anything new about perhaps challenges that young people have to face now that we didn't have to face when we were in school\nWow I mean I think it's the same challenges it's it's a it's first crush is it's a an required that love it's a it's homework it's a family dramas sibling rivalry it's\nYou know it's it's it's it's elevating escalated probably because of social media and you get every sort of you know\nOut of of information about what's happening in our lives but I think it's the same things and you know when I wrote this book I tried to write a book that I Would have wanted to read when I was twelve\nToday are team did anything strike you as being different and how you approached writing the voices of these students than you would have written your own voice in high school\nNo no not at all I mean here's the thing ah my dad always said climbing if you if you are yourself\nIf you are constantly just in your own authentic self you will never go wrong\nI don't try to write to kids and I try to write about young people for all of us so I'm not trying to find the latest slang or you know trying to be hip and cool as it is deemed hip and cool and two thousand Eighteen I just want to write a good book that tells a good story and I find that if I enjoy it\nThe likelihood you will probably you know amps up a bit yeah youngsters to rent I got a ten year old and a twenty seven year old a different perspective to be so I've been through those teenage years with the twenty seven year old and and I guess I'm about to approach them and\nAnd apply everything I learned or didn't learn\nWith the rent or buy them to say you know how does that sound at the same time if you want to read\nMy ten year old read all of my stuff and she's you know she tells me when she thinks I'm not cool which is about Ninety percent of the time but again I think and this is one of the points of the book\nCool is defined by you I Can't allow other people to defy you're cool for you and I think that's what ... are trying to figure out oh maybe ... sorry figured out no is trying to get there\nYou're going to be another pollen from the book right now or what what's it going to be\nI'm going to read a poem called the\nYeah I should have had this poem sort of earmark I got him earmarked here if you want to or we live yep this is alive yeah OK I'm going to really want that\nThis is great I'm going to read a poem called we fit okay I Love it I have an ear marked on mine I got to have a producer ban did that for me I did not do that myself yes Kwame Alexander came prepared to the show this morning [laughter] we sit in the top role of the bleachers like we owned a field drinking fountain eating hot dogs and salted pretzels before the game starts\nThe players on both teams crossed their arms over their hearts for the anthem and unity\nI get up to do the same but she pulled back down\nWhat are you doing I asked were taking a stand no actually we're fitting families say exactly why if you don't stand for something you'll fall for everything\nEverything's not political I'd do it actually she says everything is you either uphold the status quo or you see what's wrong and try to change it hey
