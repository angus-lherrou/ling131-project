staying and Elvis Costello and feisty Katie laying all gathered to celebrate Leonard Cohen music one year after he died\nAnd I realized the last time I had the chance to talk to Adam Cohen about his father's music was just weeks before Leonard Cohen passed away that was actually the first interview we aired when I started hosting cue\nConversation focused on what will be his final album you want it darker which Adam produced\nBut as maybe you've heard there's a whole new Leonard Cohen album that in the works right now Adam Cohen took some time from a studio in LA to tell you more about that and I bought a new collection of poetry coming out tomorrow it's called the flame and any you'll find never before published poems that Leonard Cohen wrote in the final few years\nOf his life [noise] and welcome back to Cuba Oh thank you for having me in the forward to the flame you talk about Leonard's notebooks your father's notebooks almost as if they were an extension of demand themselves can

of writing everywhere at all times and he would wake up early every morning and we'll just sort of developed sense of purpose that resulted in this tower of song and this and these Tom's in terms of excellent work\nAnd um he wasn't doing it for a for anything but I'm a sense of vocation calling\nAnd it's true it to know my father was to know a man who had no books uh practically falling out of his pocket and they were in every drawer and as I send the forward I even found one in the in the freezer one time when he told me it gets to ...\nYou wrote that he wrote religion teachers women drugs

dealing with and\nHe comes to me and dreams still I'm embarrassed to say it's been two years since these past almost and uh\n[noise] you know I'm I'm even\nWas tasked with finishing a few more songs

making you want a darker\nAnd sometimes I Would implore him even though I knew he was in a delicate state it's a dead just just read this just read this poem to a to a metronome\nAnd we'll look at it later and there's some of my favorite poems of his are actually in the vault and I was tasked with finishing them and that was also beautiful about them is that unlike a the the very the\nThe gravity and the nature and the tenure and the tone of you want a darker a nice to have a sort of more miss so romantic or\nIn a kind of tone that resembles his older work something more romantic so that's also more surprising is that daunting for you to have to to finish your father's work like this\nIt's such a luxury it's such a treat and as I say it's been a meditation because I have a little studio in my backyard and\nI go there with a a mug of coffee and and areas again singer is powerful distinct voice who happens to be particularly stirring for me 'cause it's my father and the sense of

your father songs I came so far for beauty and I left so much behind why did that line come to mind when you were thinking about your father's life and legacy\nIt reminds me of a few times um towards the end where we'd sit on his front lawn\nAnd pause would\nWould occur in conversation and he would reflect on all of the compromises that he made\nAll of the all the romances he left all the family a scene that he felt\nThat he had hit poorly acquitted themselves of\nAnd he said you know of all the strategies I tried to employ really nothing nothing really works nothing offered the solace that work blanketing pages being a poet offered me and I felt like he was apologizing\nAnd\nOf course that song immediately came to mind which is you know became so far for beauty he left so much behind but of course it wasn't the truth that all you know the amazing impact that he had on our lives on anyone's life he came into\nAdam I really appreciate you taking the time to time I know it's a as

funny part maybe you know someone like someone who enjoys a good glass of scotch but not the kind of scotch but you could pick up at the liquor store more like the kind where if you have enough of it in one night you may as well have sent a kid to college for a year\nThis also might be the kind of person who owns a nice watch or five maybe you haven't actually met someone like this but you can imagine someone like this red to kind of watch as they were on the risk of bubbly buy you a couple of houses in Vancouver in Toronto the stuff that happened there back pocket to probably cancel out all your debt\nBarry Cohen is definitely one of those people buried Cohen is the fictional protagonist in a new book\nBy Gary Stein guards called lake success and if you've read one of Gary novels before you know a lot of this work takes this kind of funny but also reflective look at the times that we're living in Gary stunk artist here with me in Studio right now and I should point out you were in a\nPretty nice watch Oh thank you it's great to be here you're a bit of a watch guy or a little bit of a watch nerd um this watches interesting it belongs to Richard Nixon space advisor back in the seventies risks yeah so this was probably privy to a lot of\nDrunken rancid the Nixon White House you know or Jews colonizing space or that's the exact well that's exactly what did you give them a through a friend of mine was a watch dealer and it was an originally at Christie's auction oh my God yeah it's got a lot of a ... that's what they say it's a very Cohen is your fictional\nCharacter I Know you spend a lot of time with the\nThousand dollar ... uh what what did you learn about yeah I remember we once drank an entire thirty five thousand dollar ... scotch and I realized that we had just drank too Hyundai Sonata worth of a\nScottish today's any better it tastes pretty good but and I ask you a Hyundai Sonata is good and um\nIt was very stressful uh these guys are you know they they're stressed out all the time they drink quite a bit uh there were times especially when\nThey're hedge funds were taking that I ended up going home at five AM and my wife was sort of an button in my shirt for me 'cause my fingers wouldn't work and I was born in Russia so I Know how to drink a few uh ... uh but it was you know and they're not very happy people that was the big\nThe higher I went up the food chain from you know sent a millionaire a billionaire I was like oh my God these are not happy people when they leave these very motive existence is where they don't really leave their Upper East side apartment there club there Hamptons uh stayed there for their funds and so\nI became sort of the hedge fund whisper and I would take him to things like cheap Korean or Indian restaurants and they'd be like oh my God this is actually tastes great ... what a life you live what were you curious about what questions you have for them\nWell that was the question is I knew that many of them came from these sort of lower middle class backgrounds they grew up in the edges of places like New York or Naples or Moscow and my my sort of feeling was and I also came as an immigrant so I knew the sort of the hunger and their souls and the idea that\nYou know we grew up with tough parents the only thing that could make up for it with billions of dollars right um so I wanted to see if upon achieving that wealth if if if things actually did improve\nBut you know studies show that if you win a million dollars in the lottery or you lose a limb and about a year and a half you're basically back at your same level of happiness and that's something that I found true for almost all the people I interviewed\nYeah I've heard people say that once you can pay your bills once you can pay your bills and once you're you're you're safe and you're like you know what you you took your debt paid off any money after that it's not really going to make any happier\nYeah but it also works here perceptions I mean I met a currency trader at a bank and and you know and he said I'm\nProbably those countries the play the middle class and I am the middle class and I said wait how do you define the middle class it just people struggling earning between two and four million dollars a yeah poor folks were folks so you know so I think places like Manhattan have just become these sort of weird gated communities where nobody really understands how the world\nWorks and I think that that that because that is our lead in the United states that leads to problems like a certain election in two thousand sixteen Mac begin to know what you're talking I don't know if a if you grew up in Russia I was born in the Soviet Union or in a dictatorship and now I'm living in the United states so yeah it's just\nBad news keeps following me around I guess what was your impressions of American wealth when you were growing up\nEverything seemed incredibly wealthy you know we were we started out we were on section eight housing public housing food stamps all that stuff and\nThere's a scene in the eighties movie called Moscow the Hudson with Robin Williams that kind of captured that moment where Robin Williams cat a character walks into an American supermarkets these five hundred different types of coffee and he says coffee coffee coffee and he has a heart attack\nAnd and that's kind of how we felt almost all the time when we came to America so this is a long time sort of obsession early interest you've had in the lives of the super wealthy well when I was a kid you know I remember watching the movie Wall Street and we were the poor I was a poor kid in my Hebrew school called the ... school of queens that I was wearing\nA coat made out of some Soviet ... or something that had a very unattractive smell in the ... was my nickname so we were very poor and and and back then at least I wanted to I really did want to make money I remember watching Wall Street thinking oh my God this is a the Charlie Sheen character up until he gets arrested that's that's the life\nBut after spending time with these guys I'm almost allergic to money 'cause I see just how how how little it does for anybody and these poor families you know um\nWhat hedge fund wife was telling me my little kid and he was applying to schools private schools in New York which can cost fifty sixty thousand dollars a year and so I Love the diversity of this one school because some of these parents or\nIt's just they're just doctors or lawyers yeah right [laughter] poor thing for the but I I say that if I I feel like I'm I'm being unnecessarily harsh year 'cause I feel like I can but one of the things that the your book in the electric fence looks at is the inner lives of these hedge fund managers of the of the billionaires\nAnd at one point um your needs care tobacco companies criticized for like not having much taps not having an imagination you having a real soul or did you learn anything about the inner lives of hedge fund managers\nI learned some of them had in our lives before they got into a fight it so I learned that many of them especially those that didn't have sort of business careers but but we're PHD's and math and physics and were somehow roped into that somehow but\nWere invited to instead of becoming assistant professors at North Dakota state are invited to be you know send to millionaires um I learned that there was a little criminal of that inside of them but it's been so suppressed by the fact that they spend their entire day's", "year":
