continuing his father's legacy finally Britain country music and after a Bradley solved Lucas backup real young at a concert is actually said to him teach me how to be a country star so I can play one in this movie Lucas ended up writing the songs they sang and well\nYou'll hear him talk about all that just a minute plus Richard Reid Perry from rocket fire is here to perform live that's all that coming up on cue\n\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm Janine Herb's democratic Senator Joe Manchin didn't have to wait long to see how Brett Kavanaugh's opponents would react to his decision to

the thing is that when you see somebody who is able to make a living\nAnd keep who they are yeah that's really worth the titles celebrity that's when we really can celebrate somebody that's one I think it's worth it because if you see somebody out there like like Gaga like Stephanie or Bradley who's made it\nAnd the successes there but the fame is almost more like a symptom of the success because they're just driving their driven they want to do the best they can and what they do and that is worth celebrating\nTo me and I will say well I Know just from playing folk music I play the traditional music from Ireland yeah when we talk about\nHow to do it\nWe would talk about artists who seemed to have maintained the right way to do this thing exactly a celebrity you're talking about because your dad comes up a lot on your ad wars of what will you know any better but Willie Nelson of so many people is is the right way to do it and I I I have to ask her is is does he ever talk to you about this\nAh well yeah court sort of I mean dad and I talk about a lot of things where you know we get for a lot philosophical we see things I and a and I you know he's taught our family our family my mother and my father or are there do the good people and they raised is with you know a conscience\nAnd and I think about them when I'm making decisions in life all the time if uh you know and it you know I don't think it matters though that I was a musician or what\nIt's all about staying true to who you are really life you know resisting temptation is it to the temptation to lose one's self for again like the Beatles said um gain the world and lose your soul you know um\nWe were talking about the space between us oh what's that song and\n... never blames the truth then it's far too late fees and they ...\nAs a with a much within you without you with a new without you one of the more beautiful lyric ... songs I you know I Love George Harrison too you know because George was one of those guys I mean the Beatles Paul McCartney\nDown to earth people you know yeah sure they're around a lot of famous people and there's a scene that always around people who are elevated like that in different ways but\nThey've kept you know there are about goodness they're about bringing goodness to the world and loved to the world and standing for something and they have something to say like in Jackson says in the movie if you don't have something to say you're not going to have legs\nLook it's it's been great talking to you before we go I'm a star is born is I get the feeling an influence a whole new generation of musicians what are you hoping young artist take away from watching a star is born\nI Hope that it inspires young people and old people it doesn't matter how old you are you know inspired you to want to do\nTo want to slow down and do something for yourself\nYou know and then have something to say I think the rat race gets us all caught up in what we feel like we have to do to make ends meet and yes most of us have to spend all their ... all of our time if you know making ends meet [noise]\nYou know but even so if you have a little even the hardest working of us you know in in countries where people have nothing you know they have art and they have music and they bring that into their lives and enriches their lives\nDespite the haves and the haves and have nots you know in life and and I think that so no matter what you do in life if you can sort of find music\nYou know I think you'll you'll do better things will be better look effect for talking to me today man absolutely it was a pleasure\nTo be looked as Nelson playing with his band promise of the real in a star is born movies today fast track is also a day and on and you'll
