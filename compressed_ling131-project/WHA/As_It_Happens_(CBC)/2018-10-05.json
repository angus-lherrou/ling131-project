everything everything going on right does it feel like it's going slow just feel like it's going fast the guy you're about to me I guess this we couldn't go slow enough for him his weakest going pretty well and that has a lot to do with this\nFor the rather or better [noise]\n\nThat is walking Phoenix and John C. Riley in the sisters brothers they play to guns for hire in the Old West\nThese two characters that is the worst southern accent in the world by the way the two characters come to you directly from the imagination of a guy named Patrick do it\nThat's the way to the Canadian author who wrote the novel the sisters brothers back in twenty eleven it was one of those big instant hits it when the governor generals award and the writers trust award and made the short list for the man Booker and the Scotia bank killer prize which is kind of like\nThe ah Grammy's and Juno's\nOf literature and that's about as good as it gets for a novelist in this country and this was only Patrick to its second book\nAll that attention was pretty new to him than I mean this is a guy who before he was a writer\nWith a high school dropout he was a bartender he was a house painter well fast forward a few years and you should be starting to get used to the spotlight not only does the sisters brothers hit theaters tomorrow Patrick ... new novel French Exit just got short listed for this year's\nKiller prize so when we talked I had to start out with some congratulations\nPatrick welcome to Cuba rats and together nomination\nOh thanks very much it feels like a good week to BU man [laughter]\nUm yeah I I I have no complaints things are going well with the new book\nWell and also the sisters brothers movie opens this weekend is it true that the whole idea for this story began with two words you wrote in your notebook sensitive cowboys\nThat was the very start yeah and that just um resulted in a in some dialogue between two men on horseback it occurred to me I mean growing up with my father I watched any number of westerns with them but I was watching I Believe it was one of the spaghetti westerns and I think it was leave increase to such a stylish villain in some of these films\nAnd I begin to wonder you know where does he shot where does what does this by his Cape and and and ah it occurred to me that the interior lives of the characters of westerns and soft and obscured so I think that was sort of a where the sensitive part came in you know what what makes these men tick was the question\nThere's something really beautiful about that that this started with you watching an old western and believing cleave and now the sisters brothers is a western movie itself so when you were writing it wasn't unfolding like a movie in your mind repatriating the scenes and more cinematic terms I think that I was\nLargely because my reference points for the western are more cinematic the literary so I was imagining it's I'm as no through a camera I think it's a book that from the start want it to be a film\nTo it the film adaptation of the sisters brothers opens this weekend so John C. Reilly stars as one of the sisters brothers is also one of the producers of the film with his wife Alison Dickey at you met them through film called Harry and you wrote the story for that film before the sisters brothers came out\nI saw an interview with John the Reilly says something like a I promise Patrick to where I Would do my best to make the sisters brothers the best they could be and I I remember it because you don't hear many kind of movie stars in Hollywood use the words I'll do my best\nYou know stores where people were selling horses or whatever it was and it was very elaborate and labyrinth thin and thorough and just a you know what what a treat this was for me and how and how strange to get to experience this\nAt the trap the really really [laughter] not not not to use ... the language you are but what a trip that must have been it really was yeah uh so you've written already written a screenplay for your new novel for French Exit why did you learn from this adaptation of this down the sisters brothers that you can take with you as you make\nStories into films [noise] right I don't know that it'll necessarily influence the way I rights I think that my we're generally lends itself to screen play because of the amount of dialogue and so much of the story and the character um progression or are they all three of the things that they say or or don't say [noise]\nBut um I learned through this how difficult it is to make a sizable picture I mean John had this property in his possession before the book was\nPublished I think maybe before it was\nProperly accepted even so this is eight years ago and he's been working tirelessly he announced and to to to realize this film and it's taken them this long um it's just the um [noise]\nAs far simpler to write books you know I mean writing books has its own set of problems but you just sit down and do it you know but they're collaborative nature of film is something that I was just really impressed by how much\nUm discussion and and um how many people are involved in the making of a film so I was humbled by it in a way it also made me appreciate my own focus um fourth relatives\nYou know I mean seeing I'm seeing sisters brothers film and enjoying it as much as I did it made me came to do it again you know so I think um it was a best case scenario and then I think I could have come out of his experience thinking well I don't want to do that again but in fact I feel just the opposite so\nSo we mentioned the French acted as a discussion painkiller congratulations again by the way Oh thanks very much how do you find out your shortlist did you get to the phone calls it an email\n[noise] well it was there was an email but I don't have email homes but didn't get the email till that afternoon and my friend ... who um will direct French Exit she actually called me and he assumed I knew but he was one to tell me\nSo that was nice but then ... a moment after my father called and he was at the airport I'm heading actually to Paris himself\nAnd he said in his typically aggressive style he said well you made the short list you kiss ass [laughter]\n... you've been winter big awards before and you've been asked about\nWinning awards before um I I I Hope I Hope you take this in the way it's made but the sisters brothers was short listed for the killer it it didn't when I Do want to ask you because we never hear this perspective what is it like to be up for a huge prize and and not take it home\nYeah well I think the experience with the dealer and then with the book or as well um my feeling with with these two prizes as if you've made it to the shortlist than there is a sense that you one already and and I don't really have that hyper competitive spirit that\nI'm sure there are some authors who get to this point and then if they don't when they're disappointed or angry or or there's some you know negative response and with both together in the book reading feel that at all [noise] um\nIt's a it's a natural feeling to want to take it to the very end but it doesn't override the you know the sort of wondering and and the brilliance of just being there in the first place so I have a feeling of being pleased that it's on the short list and I'm not really worrying about what comes next\n... would've been nice talking to you know he was well thank you I'll see you at the at the killer I'll be I'll be at the table excellent\nYou can see the sisters brothers in theaters from tomorrow and you can pick up a copy of French Exit which is Patrick ... killer

there happened last friday that shook up the world fashion and had more than a few critics seizing okay so let me give you the lowdown because I'm wearing a ... jeans today so this is how I understand it\nThe designer heady slum and showed his first collection for the fashion house saline about heady is a guy who's known as a bit of a troublemaker what they call them ... in the world fashion shaking things up as his kind of thing\nHe was on cue a few weeks ago when he whether we were talking about him he made the controversial decision to remove the accent from the e in saline but now the fashion world seem to close he designed for the brand and some are saying it represents a step backwards not just for Celine\nBut for women in general queue fashion contributor Moshe Ya'alon strip Halbert is back for another round on this story which is intersecting intersecting I should say not just fashion but also politics high motion how're you doing\nHi Tom oh my gosh we've got so much to discuss about this today I'm\nSo excited to get into this we need to know about the woman that heavy slum and replace so Phoebe silo was once the in charge of saline is that right [noise]\nYes so the calls now it's on ... are that in uh Nineteen Ninety seven she succeeded Stella McCartney ... and was the creative director there um she took a bit of a break from fashion and to have children in two thousand and eight she became the creative director and board member of\nSaline and um this was a house that really had a lot of just classic bourgeoisie codes in French society and she really revolutionize debt\nOn and she came at a time when you think of the other designers that we're really making a splash with names like John Kelly yeah no Alexander McQueen mark Jacobs\nThey are masters of artistry and bold creativity but not necessarily where ability and here comes the ... she really represented for a lot of woman women the working woman who isn't perfect who's Harris and always done just right who doesn't look like\nSome kind of other worldly creature but really a real life woman that just wants to get down to work and on with her business\nSo I was looking at a lot of big sweaters are comfortable parents like it's it's tough you can kind of where around stuff that that seems pretty comfortable\nYeah part of her magic in a war with the fact that these were all closed that you could\nPicture of yourself jumping into and having in your closet even if the prices were oftentimes astronomical the idea of that perfect she sweater or tailored trouser that was also a bit on the side to side an oversized jacket on these clothes felt very comforting a an effort less\nBecause she's out she's replaced by heavy slim man who is this heavy slum in character again\nSo how to use them and as a German designer ah he started at sound the wrong and he very famously kind of revolutionized the male or a job\nHe really can be credited with Harold and the return of the skinny suit\nThis kind of beetle style tailoring that really became in fashion in the um early to thousands and it's still very relevant today very rocker music inspired and slim as you like very very skinny

moment way back in time your favorite work of fiction still probably has something to say about the real world\nTextbook like uncle Tom's cabin or The Handmaid's tale these are novels that forced readers to look at the world around them I really consider how far we've come and history and where we could be headed\nRight now in the U.S the investigation of judge Brett Kavanaugh is unfolding with all the plot twist of a political thriller and people are so invested in the story because the stakes are so high\nA lot of people say that if Kavanaugh becomes a Supreme Court judge the highest court in the land could overturn roe v Wade women could lose legal access to abortion\nTo some that will be an incredible victory to others and unimaginable laws that raging in the background a new novel hit bookstores this week it's about a shooting at a reproductive health clinic the last place in Mississippi where a woman can get an abortion\nIt's called a spark of light and it's the new novel from Jodi Pico one of the best selling author is around right now\nJody joins me from New York City to tell you more about it I Jody high your author's note at the end of the book which is really as a as a resting as any other part of the book you write laws are black and white the lives of women or a thousand shades of gray tell me more about that\n[noise] that's actually why I wrote the book when I was in college I had a really good friend who was seven weeks pregnant I unwanted pregnancy very upset and she and her boyfriend had many tearful nights and finally decided to get an abortion and I supported her a hundred percent\nYears later I was pregnant with my third child I was seven weeks pregnant and there was a complication and when I went to that\nIs going to stick or it's not and I was devastated because to me that was already a baby and I couldn't figure out how I could hold both of those things in my mind that two seven week pregnancies you know one would be okay to go and have an abortion the other one\nTo me it was already a baby that I wanted\nAnd that to me made me think really hard I think how we define ourselves is not just a matter of whether we think we fall into a pro life or pro choice camp I think that for the same woman over the course of one lifetime you may sway a little\nWhere do you find yourself right now\nI Am very strongly pro choice\nYou talked to people all sides of this debate in the book what do you think people on the pro choice side might get wrong but people on the pro life side\nExactly what I did frankly you know I went into my interviews with people who are pro life making assumptions that were dead wrong\nI thought that these people were crazy religious zealots\nAnd what I found was that the people I spoke with were really nice people and they were people I Would have been friends with I Would have gone out to dinner with them we had tons of things in common we just didn't happen to agree on this one issue and people who are pro life the vast majority come from a place of deep compassion and deep conviction\nWhat about the other side did you find the right things are pro lifers or people in the pro life so I didn't know about people in the political side to perhaps they should\nYes people assume that women who have abortions are using it as birth control that is a flat out lie no woman and I talked to a hundred and fifty one of them goes to get an abortion just because it's easy it's not easy it is emotionally draining it takes a lot of time and a lot of money I I should\nSay for people who haven't haven't read the book that when you read this book you you you don't just get the perspective of people who were at an abortion clinic to didn't abortion you could was through no no no you get the respect of the of of of the doctors working to get the perspective of anti abortion protesters Jodie is it hard to write with empathy about a character with whom you strongly disagree\n[noise] I think it's my job to do that I Do not believe that as a writer it's my job to tell a reader what to think\nBut I Do think it's my job to present very fairly all sides of the situation lay out all the arguments so that as you're reading you can go through them and figure out why you believe what you believe you may change your mind you may not\nAnd yet I bet it may be the first time you've ever really listen to what someone in opposition has to say yes you know we we tend when we know someone doesn't believe what we believe we tend to immediately judge them particularly in my country right now which is really broken and where people are on great divides\nWe've got to figure out how to have conversations and just listen\nJody go in your new book spark of like the story unfolds during a mass shooting a hostage taking out a women's health clinic in Mississippi one called the center I'm you spend a lot of time in clinics like the one in the story in this book\nOne of the people who worked in these places tells you about their experiences and their fears about the kind of violence that you described in his book\nSo it's it's really fascinating and and frightening ... even in a city like Boston where a abortions are readily available and there are lots of clinics um when you go in there are guards and security and metal detectors and uh it feels like you're walking into a prison\nIn the deep south it's very different because although they also have security measures there is a gauntlet of protesters that you have to walk through just to get into the doors of the clinic\nI mean that's a lot emotionally that's a lot and if you are there to get an abortion that's also a lot 'cause you've you've really struggled believe me to come to that decision\nThe doctors who we're bulletproof vests to the summit yes I mean I'm sure this is really saw\nYes and it's interesting I I did a lot of work with a man named Dr Willie Parker who\nIs the basis for a doctor ward in the book willy is a remarkable man I Love him and she is a devout Christian who says he provides these services not in spite of his religion but because of it he had a revelation while listening to a sermon about the good Samaritan and thought if I don't provide services for people who need it the most who will\nAnd um he flies around to all these clinics that are under served in the Bible belt and the deep south up providing abortion services to women who otherwise can't get them\nAnd um she very deliberately chose to not wear a bullet proof vest he had colleagues who would put masks on\nTo go into the clinic so that they couldn't be identified by the protesters there are some very um Arden protesters who will keep lists of the um the license plates of doctors and track them so that they they put these on Web sites they tell you where these doctors lives so that", "show_name": "As It Happens (CBC)", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "05"}
