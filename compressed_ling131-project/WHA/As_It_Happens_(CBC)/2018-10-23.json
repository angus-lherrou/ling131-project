foundation [noise]\nMcEwen CBC Radio one serious exam one sixty nine from public radio international\nWhich goes by ...\nHilary Swank is one of those actors who you'll never be able to pigeon hole what I mean by that is you can basically work with any script you throw it or I mean just look at everything she's been in over the past twenty five years there's the next karate kid there's Beverly Hills NATO to winnow the million dollar baby there's PS I love you\nBut why she might be best known for is her\nBreakout role the one that led to her first Oscar shot her into super stardom\nBoys don't cry boys don't cry was released a huge playing back in Nineteen Ninety nine critics praise Hillary Swank performance as brand and Tina a transgender teenager which was pretty groundbreaking roll\nIt was hard to find transgender characters anywhere in film or a TV at that time but looking at that film now in twenty eight team it is often challenging to see it in the same kind of light\nMay consider the backlash scarlet Johanson face earlier this year for being cast as a transgender character I had the chance to ask Hilary Swank by her thoughts on all of it and a little bit about her new film what they had which deals with something that every child has to go through at one point or another what to do with your parents when they get old\nWe talked about that when she stopped by the cues studio during the Toronto international film festival [noise]\nSo I read this thing about you I'm a talker I Want to talk about what they had a I heard that when you you do a very simple thing with scripts to help you focus on the character that you're playing is that right you write something on the page\nUm well it's not very simple actually it's really um complex because\nUm it's my character analysis and break down so it's like a type of Bible I thought it was like one line per page no okay I Know what you're confusing I got it so what I Do is the script is um I breaking down into one sentence\nThat story the story of the stories about into one sentence\nAnd you're going to ask me what I was this one about but it's it was now over a year and a half ago so I'm not going to get the exact sentence but what it is is I take the essence of this story\nAnd in one sentence I say what is this story about and that is on the front of my script but then the inside is really you can barely see the lines\nWhat do you do that one line well why do you need to crystallize I like that\nUm because I feel like that is the essence of the story and that everything should lean back to that essence and if it doesn't it usually doesn't make a movie\nDo you remember an example you can give me I I Know I was going to ask you I was going to ask you about what you're up for this film but if you don't remember that's fine\nYou remember um I think like if we go back to maybe boys don't cry I feel like that is a movie that transcended gender and it was about love\nSo it was you know it was about something bigger that we can all relate to because everyone wants to give a lover be loved right everybody that's the one common thread through no matter what race or gender or what your creative says that's the one through line so\nI think everything had to go back to that in from the scene as kind of folk that example\nBut what they had is is a story that seems like it's about\nWhy should be clear it's it's a it's about an older woman with with all ... your your your mom and the film you're coming down you're you're trying to talk the father and mother trying to father into letting you put the mother into a care home and and the father going to a facility as well but I also feel like that\nI'm and I'm so I say oh I'm an actor you know that that's what I and that's for since I was Fifteen that's what I have been doing and so so much of who I Am is defined within and taking time off made me realize that I'm so much more than that\nUm and\nThere was freedom in that somehow I don't know I don't know how to say do you think the change the way you after well that would also happened on the flip side is it made me fall in love with acting in a whole different way because I appreciated\nAll the opportunities that it gave me and it to see the world in a different way to walk in someone else's shoes and I'm\nExpand my ideas of how I Walk in the world you know every character I play from\nBoys don't cry to ... million dollar baby to conviction to Freedom Riders these stories of these women all of them being true other than a million dollar baby\nI'm are just they are in the now and I see the world and a richer way because of them so it's been life and reaching it's been um\nIt's incredible to be an actor and so I have a deeper appreciation after\nStepping away for a little while so nice to meet you nice to meet you too if I Want to thank you for having me award winning actor [laughter] it's true I think Hillary speculated for cold weather here\nSo nice to get to talk to other was Frank uh my name is Tom power you're chew and we'll be right back [noise]\n\n...

directors guild of Canada awards took place in Toronto the directors guild of Canada words is meant to highlight the achievements of Canadians in film and television and here's the winners from last night Paul after Barry one production design for his work on the film the shape of water you might remember he won an Oscar for that to\n... took home the Alan King award for excellence in documentary for the documentary about the tragically happened long time running\nBut the biggest awards of the night were for lifetime achievement these winter directors big Sharon Norma Bailey and Allen ease of bumps when I was on cue or not that long ago we were supposed to talk about her an album the thirtieth anniversary of her album Bush lady but\nGiven that we're talking about the directors guild awards and he's also ended up talking about the importance of telling diverse stories\nMy my main interest was education so they did a lot of tools in schools across Canada to educate the student that one that the students to you [laughter] and there's a story instead of them when they were learning to a history of Canada which was really floor\nAnd it was really designed to get people to hate us and I thought flipping I Do and the only answer that could come with I thought the children have to hear another story and I'm a story you tell it and that's how it doesn't\nSound nice of bumps when that whole conversation is available on our part kept another award to mentioned this time out of Canada last night Julia Louis Dreyfus was honored with Mark Twain prize for career achievement in comedy

it's also the alma mater of Dr Christine Blasey Ford who accused Brett Kavanaugh of groping her in high school sluggish economy war Julia Louis Dreyfus made reference to Dr Ford testimony as she recalled high school performance of the play fair antipathy thing\nI can remember every single aspect of the play that night so much so that I Would testify under oath about it but I Can't remember who drove me there or who drove me home [noise]\nAh try\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\nMan\nPlayed Twenty years ago that a share her\nSo you hear how\nLike a robot no one had ever really heard anything like that before you might now know that that the result of something called auto tune this software program that tons of musicians me pretty much every musician\nUses now um that takes a note that might be a little bit flat ideally take note that might be a little bit flat or a little bit sharp and and it makes it the perfect that you're looking for but use kind of turned up on a lab and turns your voice sounded a little bit looked like a robot and you hear that now with you know calling us the bunny there and the pain even fiance is used out of town\nI don't think it's a stretch to say the auto tune is one of the most revolutionary inventions and all the music history so what are the producers here on cue wanted to track down where auto tune came from and the answer led her to an electrical engineer who once worked for Exxon I'll let him pick it up from there\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n... soon was designed to be used in a way that you don't know it's been you can do to fix the pitch of singers there was a setting that you can adjust so that you can't control the rate that the pitch moves to the correct note\nAnd just for fun I allow that control to go to ... instantaneous transition I did that just because I knew that no one in their right mind would ever use that setting share use it in the song believe [noise] and uh\nThat's the first time people could hear auto tune being used as a distinct sound\n\nMy name's Andy help and brown and I read is part of\nI work for axon for three years doing physical size word processing and then I started my own company and about ten years later I got involved with digital signal processing for music and\nThen the early Nineteen Ninety five I was meeting at a trade show with my distribution company the owner of the company was there he ... he had his wife there we were having lunch and we were talking about what products that we might do next\nAnd she said well why don't you make me a box of an average singing thin [noise] I knew that I could do that but I looked around the table and every ... every one looked more or less dejected that the idea so I went on to do something completely different\nAnd uh I did that for about six months or so and then I figured well what can I Do so I thought her idea had marriage so I went ahead and created auto tune within a few months I had that back at the same trade show\nAnd uh there was a big hit so that's where the genesis of the idea that [noise]\nFor me and despite some of the negative feelings about honest to what what what impresses me is the threat of ... which are the students use almost everybody is familiar with ... and pop music\nCould you know I\nSupport for WPRI comes from legacy private trust company and Nina dedicated to providing exceptional

I mean after all he used to sit in this very chair as a host queue we were really excited to have him back into the studio to perform some brand new music\nSee since he was last year behind just Mike he's been really busy\nShed been hosting the Peabody Award an Emmy winning series hip evolution which just premiered its second season on Netflix he's been interviewing some hip hop's biggest stars for that while also working on a massive new record of his own\nCalled a short story about war at the concept record that follows three different characters the sniper stone throwers and the fool each track takes you through the different perspectives on things like greed and the environment capitalism which might sound pretty dark but as you'll hear and just a minute if you know\nHigher messages just underlined with hope for the record drops this Friday here's a bit of a preview of what to expect recorded live and accuse studio shed with sniper on cue or\nYeah yeah so um\nA young boy that week not running as a lawyer\nAnd all around them on the night when the sound\nJust only learned that the whole world with the devil\nAnd in fact the whole world would that world\nEveryone frightened

grow up and you're in the business world and they tell you if you want to be successful you that is that people eat at it for people\nThat when you got any paid me pockets and take classes like Bob and make\nSomething guns and I don't run and I don't miss it I don't know I Know what I'm focused still pay the\nWhen I brought 'em in the high stakes for the only thing but in any spot\nMono lake station the ball and saying that you\nYou know the land is dirty their hands dirty man already saw that I\nMean really shadwick ... studio snipers is one of the characters you'll meet on his new record a short story about war with shops on friday yeah and it's it's all that good\nCheck I tell you more about these characters in just a second but first you know when he stopped by I I had to kick things off a little bit of a catch up with what he's been up to since he was last year\nAre you I'm doing great have you heard about being here doing All right oh I feel good yeah ah this is a new room\nYeah I should say for listening to defend the radio were upstairs yeah I kinda wish I could see the older I gotta yeah we'll go we'll go after and now you're doing this incredible hip evolution documentary\nYeah Peabody Award winning how do you how do you find sitting down with these people the guy looked up to your entire life I'm guessing well again you know what it's like\nI guess you know what I mean yeah like a you know you you sit across these people in there and they're really fascinating and uh their contributions obviously to the culture and the music that but I Love and it's given so much to my life\nUm you know are are remarkable and then uh you know the cool thing\nYou know your job is uh is these people are also stunned as stunned as you are by them they're stunned by what they've been able to contribute and or be a part of so um yeah they're they're super super fun conversations interesting\nHave you had any moments of he can you name the one particular moment of like wow I just can't I Can't believe I'm here right now\nI mean the one I'd have to say stands out the most is cool her who's kinda recognizes the you know the father of hip hop\nAnd uh we have the opportunity to interview him or in front of his building in the Bronx where he grew up in where he kinda famously started throwing his party's in this particular style that you know became hip hop so that was very surreal he's not a guy that's very public he doesn't do a lot of interviews you know so\nTo be with the guy that basically started hip hop at the place where he started hip hop you you know and look at the building and speak to him and hear his story and then kind of gave out at New York and the world\nAnd it all moved to the beat of this music that he has a Thirteen fourteen year old pioneered\nSo I'd rather I got to think that some of his mhm like getting to talk to each other like either on this show or or or any type of evolution of getting to talk to some of these great mind must have\nImpacted this new record somehow [noise] um no the weird thing is only indirectly\nBut I'm\nNot in the sense of like cleaning anything from there like musical genius oddly enough you know if there's anything that impacted this record I think it's kind of the experience of meeting so many people\nAnd meeting them in these particular situations like you and I are in but I mean we know each other so you know when you sit across from a stranger for example and just that dynamic of\nYou know you're coming with whatever you're coming with however you're feeling that day or whatever nerves you might have to they also are nervous 'cause they're about to be interviewed on the radio you know in front of the country or whatever and that energy and what we bring in our posture that we bring to social situations to\nEconomics too political conversations that is basically what this is about so very indirectly well not necessarily indirectly but not in the way that people might think that these experiences I went back to the music but they have impact\nAnd if not like you you you hang out grand master flash for the record sounds like where I'm at ... not like that exactly there's all these things yet but it does like it's\nA very unique kind of experience to meet so many strangers into yeah\n'cause I always think that the other person is super cool and and confident and or strangely aggressive\nYou know what I mean this is what the albums about that what's in your imagination about another human being so\nYou so when someone comes in and you know when you when you'd be in the studio you're doing hip evolution and someone comes in and you haven't met him before and they're kind of a big deal to choose someone you know totally and you don't really know them that well in order to you know there aren't that well yeah and you are scared a little bit yes and\nThey're they seem a little I don't know the grass was the right word well I mean you are met before they walk in I met here where everything is for the worst and a lot of the album is about\nWhy and why why have you have an answer [noise] um well fear you know like I'm but I'm\nThis question of is it all illusory because it is because how many people come in to the studio to talk to you that strangers and your bracing herself in the worst how many of them actually attack you are like zero percent yet like very almost nobody yeah virtually zero percent\nSo then why do we ah approach each other with that posture and not just each other but you know the album is is also political and a sense why do we approached\nOur our financial um um\nSituations also like with with that kind of posture of either defensiveness or or aggression yeah why why why a concept album at all but why not a song about 'em because actually the first thing they grabbed me was this concept was basically a story that appeared in my imagination and I'm\nRight away I started to see all the parallels to our world so that is really it's it's the thing that inspired the whole album so that's why it's a concept album otherwise uh yeah I mean I liked I actually like to be a little bit more plain spoken and and to the point but um\nBut it's it's been a while to her for me at all I mean the the the Toni Braxton record but before that it's been awhile since last how long it's going to be ...\nAh first first last shot album last rap album was like five years ago so does it feel like a bit of a risk to come back with a kind of a grand concept I'm not really I mean in the sense that like it felt the ... it felt like the most inspiring or sorry inspired", "year": "2018", "show_name": "As It Happens (CBC)", "city": "Madison", "day": "23"}
