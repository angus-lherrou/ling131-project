I. public radio international I'm way low end for\nHere's a question I'm sure every directorate Hollywood has grappled with at one point or another how do you take a story that had been told nanny many many times and turn it into something new something gripping\nMaybe wondered about this with so many ... boots and revivals hitting TV including just the other week when the latest version of star is born opened in theaters and that story has already been told three times before and it with a ... the Oscar winning director of la la land\nSet to uh make a film about Neil Armstrong's journey about a trip to the moon that we all know about\nObviously that was going to be a really big challenge the first moon landing stories one you've probably heard about in school in history\nHe took a bit of a different approach the story with his new first men there were some mixed results in the process he\nLeft out a few details about the moon landing and that is straight up quite a controversy the hero impacts some of that and fill you in on some of the challenges of making a film like this\nWe have gathered the cute screen panel hello to both of you I Am joined by Tina ... and John suddenly who both write about arts and entertainment high there while John I'm going to turn to you first\nYou have been to the theater you watched first men and we know that this is the story of Neil Armstrong the first man on the moon but give us a little bit more contacts with the story telling us\nWell I think there's a couple of things\nThat make a district of the first of which is what makes these sort of early space travel expeditions seem very tense very gripping a sweats will start forming on your browser watcher Neil Armstrong spacecraft bounce off the atmosphere [noise]\nAh so I think that stuff for me was kind of the main event uh undeniably throwing in large scale on an IMAX screen or the other thing that tries to do with sort of delve into a psychology a bit more by exploring his relationship with his family\nAs kind of is I think sort of a stock deadbeat dad who was too obsessed with this mission to really care about the people around him who care about him a so those are the things that I Try to distinguish the film and if I haven't talked to my hand I think the former stuff works a lot better [laughter]\nI Want to play a little bit of a clip from first men [noise]\nNeal is this like do it on and just\nLooking at those do you have about ... [noise]\nThe last\n... years we'll be all of this\nIs going to [noise]\nWe read\nIt has all the elements obviously the big rise the tension the drama you can hear that we tempting grand is about to happen that there is a clip from first men in theaters now and this story is one that's been told so many times Tina dispersed men add anything to the Neil Armstrong loom ending story [noise] I don't\nKnow about that I mean like I feel like it is trying to in dear you extremely so to Neil Armstrong's personal psychology and I actually had the reverse reaction I'm with John like I thought that the emotional stuff was very not very effective it was more like I knew what the film was doing\nAnd I kind of let it wash over me and I'll say that you know it was starting to tear up near the end\nBut I I cannot deny that it's kind of need and\nYou know I I mean I've seen this story being applied in a million other kinds of stories I guess now Neil Armstrong as getting the treatment I thought\nThat all of the suspenseful stuff where they're going up in the air\nWas not a factor for me you know like ... um he recorded all or if he filmed all of this on like old film stock on all the equipment that they're using\nIs I guess supposed to be accurate so looks really ugly and it's a very dark film and I just ... I don't know it was really dry and boring and I didn't care that much every single time that they went up\nEarlier honky or the Armstrong\nRoughing star Ryan\nGosling had there's tons of close ups on him and every single twitch of his face has been captured for us to enjoy forever even if he maybe don't want to remember Neil Armstrong and he's\nMuch habit of eating maybe knowledge that surround sound like it's so ugly I guess I guess with the film is trying to say like oh yeah the sixties this is what it\nActually look like they also I think that you get a real sense of how terrifying it must have been to take this rattling box up into space and and take people with\nWas a great moment of farmers say to you and I saw the phone together theaters last week and a fellow behind us is our phone kept going off from it\nOh uh we'd have more technology in our pockets been was used to go to the moon [laughter] so when you're actually washers sort of rickety old spaceship messenger bar and he's gotten a call from his mom or something I don't know kind of amusing for did you\nFind that the director managed to keep it interesting for the most\nPart yeah I mean there I Will say this when they get to the moon spoiler alert a and the sort of camera opens up on this broad lunar panorama I mean obviously is not real and go to the actual moon for this movie but there was like an an odd question the audience which is something you hear very rarely and I thought it was quite a beautiful it affecting farmers\nTo silence as well in order to deliver that and and again it ties back to Armstrong's personal story like um the the the beginning of the movie um deals with like the fact that he lost his daughter to cancer of like the daughter is extremely young so there are lots of flashbacks to that\nUm and that carries all the way to the end of the movie including\nThem in landing I Want to go to a bit of a controversy that opened up over the course of the weekend first men um doesn't show Neal Armstrong planting the American flag on the moon a huge moment in history that we've all lived and relive many tires parodies of may even made of it it's been repeated\nIt's kind of this a steady backdrop for history and and that's caused quite a bit of controversy online involving Florida Senator Marco Rubio and many other people have chimed in John can you unpack it for us little\nAfter ... after being mindful of a public radio standards when I was going to fight it's so frustrating I mean this movie has American flags all over there is a huge shot of the camera going up the side of the ship but says United States these people are clearly American and everybody knows it you see the flag on the moon you just don't see it being planted\nSo the claim that this movie somehow not patriotic enough\nAh watch why people who I presume haven't seen it a is ludicrous and I mean it just says a lot about where we are today that everybody wants to sort of make these things political\nYeah like there's just no like there isn't as much fanfare like there might have been in earlier movies about American space travel and and and I do think that would have not seen the film when he tweeted that so it's coming from a place of ignorance it\nIsn't the only commentary that really tells you a lot of it you can have commentary like that go out and then it kind of the fires up to the point where it may have compromised Oscar possibilities for this film\nI'm so we have this claim that it's unpatriotic I'm I'm Wondering what you think about the\nThe need of a story like this to be so called patriotic especially that planting of the of the flag what was the idea between for for cutting that out literally deciding baking it sets a clear decision they must have sat at the creative naval and decided we're not going to have the ethic moment everybody knows all about\nBut it's not a story about that moment it's a story about Neil Armstrong's interior life right it's not it's not a story about America getting to the moon it's a story about a scientist who underwent extreme psychological pain and and all this stuff in his own life\nAnd his pursuit of this impossible dream and actually achieving it well what about the performance there does Ryan Gosling bring us that in her life I think so yeah and I mean the thing the thing is that like\nThe the film shows aren't start to be this extremely guarded person who was not aware of his own emotions and that's where I'm I Believe the wife character plays a very I'm supporting role in forcing him to deal with his emotions at one point actually saying you have to sit down with our children and tell them that you might not come back right which I think the trailer and said\nI Am ... and for Tom power if you're just tuning in you're listening to\nQ. I Am with Tina his ... and John sadly who am I guess they are the cute screen panel we've been talking about the new film first manned within switch gears now for a little bit just have to listen to this\n\nJust see so much\nWhy anyone\nBut like a lot of their previous albums you'll still find pretty hardcore punk songs in the next haven't completely deserted who they are they're just trying a little bit of new territory\nDamon Abraham Mike how the check and joins taco they piled into the studio with Tom power and the story um I just make you think about all that social media that you're plugged into\nAlmost the moment that they mean Abraham sat down in the studio with Tom he admitted this record almost never saw the light of day once ... finished their last album he thought they might actually be done\nGlass was was really kind of the like and in a blood in the event of a thought it was like you know or certainly the end of my [noise]\nNeed to be creative and the band like I think last words is ultimately a compromise you know Mike came in and he's like no one who is crazy elaborate thing and I'm like mom I don't have any interest in doing that I Want to do a strip them shredded park record and with with after it's impossible to get a straight up\nStraightforward hardcore record and we got ... which I I Do like that record I Do stand by that being like if I never write another album where the lyrics again in my life\nI said everything I wanted to say on that record you know I think by between all the records but like all the things that I felt I I\nLast ... they had had a period at the end of that sentence and I think yeah like you felt like I felt like the end of a chapter in a in a big way like and I think you know it felt like the end of the book for me but I you know definitely another chapter\nAgendas tell me about the first sort of an impulse is to go into the studio after class boys the first impulse to go to the city to make those you dream and I would say that there was very little impulse to go into the studio to echo some of the things that Damien saying in a way\nI'm at and to bring in what Mike was talking about glass boys being a challenge it was kind of exhausting to get that done and get that on paper and the idea of having to go back into the studio in turn something out creatively I feel that there was a big void for us it was lucky that we always have these and\nOther projects that we can work on this zodiac series where you can sort of get ideas out of the way kind of them as though you need to over cook a few things before you get what you do get the recipe rights\nAnd going back into does your dreams we had absolutely nothing a\nPrepared and nothing plan so the prospect of going into the studio was kind of the same as sitting at home where you where did you wouldn't go into the studio at all like I've been just judging by what did what Damien just said er I actually I didn't have that worried and\nNot to try and take the the rug out of what what do you think about it as the creativity and what he needed to say I just always assumed that there's going to be some project that up is going to endeavor to be a part of this in the studio\nReally became a tool for us real conduit for and songwriting became an instrument almost and some somewhere between glass boys and and does your dream so I just assumed it would be there to tell you the truth I have no idea in what way but they never ... I Can't get over\nThe range of of genres on his record and he really even like to talk about genres that much but I I Do hear like like I mean we heard a bit of a sort of disco and under your dreams it's pop it it's hard core there's just like do up tendencies on this\nMike was was the intention to try out a bunch of different genres or was it just things were coming to you and you wanted to put them out in the way they were they were coming in your hand\nYeah like we weren't really writing an album we just had it was sort of like we had studio time we were just writing music and it wasn't until like a year later that\nThe songs we got started to coalesce into a fully realized thing so I think me and John I just spent so much time together and every one of the band is into so many different kinds of music and sort of like scholars of music that we just had a lot in there we want it to sort of flex and just see what kind of stuff we could make\nAnd it wasn't until a lot later that those songs started becoming a ...\nA game in ... as we kind of pointed out from talking to Mike and Jonah safari you weren't there for all this with what was your reaction when the ... uh well they are like kind of three stages I'm Jonah was there for the first stages\nUm I got brought the song we're we download a couple yeah we're definitely other versions of some of some of the song yeah um and it was one of those things where\nYou know like I forget which one it was and I I remember being in there and being like I'm not how can I write to them so I was also limits the kind of producing in in in hosting this wrestling TV show us was traveling like all the time really focused on that and the and it was just so\nDifferent you know and it was just so different ... different ... I think it was different from what I wanted the band to be right you know and I think with trying to write the way I write to\nThose songs I was having a lot of problems like it was not a productive session I think we've got a couple we gotta beside out of it and I remember like the four\nOr five days and the leaders are writing really lazy you know and I was just like what am I going to write about you know I wasn't writing to some it was before the concept was kind of introduced and we were just kind of like writing and trying different things out and uh I I just couldn't really find it and I remember going to my can be\nReally work and and uh then my came back and said I wrote everything and that at first was like you know my natural reaction was like Wal Mart saying everything you wrote like all that we run my own songs and then\nYou know he just kind of had it all figured out you know he had this whole kind of plan in place and so for the first time instead of being like well how do I fit into your plan I was like which is something that I think Jonah has done a long time in the band been like how do I eat this plan\nIn it coming to fruition and joined did that for me when I was writing songs with the ban certainly doesn't for Mike and so that's what I decided I was going to try and do this record you know yes and if I had heard that simply hard like I think I think it's hard to put your ego in check\nFor for anything you know and especially in a band especially being a lead singer in a band I remember Gore told me one time like go down towards counties are those like the worst name dropping ... Downie said too said to me one time there's like a a lead singer is where it differently\nYou know like in the lead singer you have to take in\nAll this energy and that's positive and negative and I think you do that night in a night out you do that every time you write a record and that's that's training and you know as a lead singer you have to have this ego defense that's up in place I have an ending empathy for\nYou know people milling music do silly things non criminal horrible things I should but that's why but like people that do and say\nDum dum Saddam saying yeah yeah because I think it's just like it does pickle your mind eventually being in in a band\nBut I Want I Want to talk more a little bit about the record or you're just tuning into speaking with ... Damien making Jonah from messed up about does your dreams keep pay a little bit from the record them [noise]\n\nElusive Welsh singer called Nigel bonds and not good enough [laughter] no I cannot wait to see you do that live by the guy I tell you what that's easy that part\nI Want to take a page from the Sloan book at that point and I want to do like a switch ruined were you play drums or something like that oh God if I did that there'll be no Wyoming I mean we used\nTo do that we have we used to cover and all the New York ... sort of art punk song and dance and got on drums and I got and guitar I Would say to success but see it again\nI think the thing about drums that I have a really unique approach to it like most people think that it should be the rhythm of the band I think it should be able to leave free for oh\nMike I'm this is this is a a an album that has a a narrative arc um I I Know this is radio show and we don't have a all the time in the military can you can use to simply summarized the narrative arc for me\nIt's just about a guy who has problems in his life and he um finds the help of a homeless shelter ... elderly woman to to help him and then he finds release at the end of the record what\nDo you find useful about telling the stories of a character as opposed to say first person narratives [noise] well\nI realize later that the record is about me and my journey of being in a band and really coming okay with being a weird person in a weird band it's so weird life and it's your you know living up in opposition to\nMost of the people you see in the street every day to realize later on this record was about me becoming okay with my own life you know\nSo you are using a care you are in trouble you you were just kind of guide said making to try to be kicked off of stock of his life a little\nBit yeah and using a character let's I mean I realize later what the what I was even writing about something using a character lets you think of sort of your own life in a more objective way to write about truthfully maybe one\nOf the things I thought about when I was listening to this record Mike and I'm you know I'm usually lows to try and put any intention anyone's record\nI read the PDF like I guess and PDF sort of about the record about this story the record us um and there's a lot about the destructive power of capitalism of greed and one thing that came up twice as social media social media's effect on us I sought to come up twice in the same description of\nThe power I have I think over an oil conglomeration is like a super real thing but it's sort of abstract to me but I I interact with my phone twenty four hours a week I I I've been tracking it and I find that really disquieting so I'm Wondering in the process of thinking about all these things going through your journey now that we understand that it's the first person narrative\nHow are you with social media these days if you have to check the phone out where where are you with him\nNo because I have to do this stuff for the band festival you know I mean I mean yeah I'm it's insidious in my life as it as anybody else's and that's yeah one of the one of the threads of the record it's just about like you know choice and destiny and people's dreams and what what people want life to look like", "show_name": "As It Happens (CBC)", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "16"}
