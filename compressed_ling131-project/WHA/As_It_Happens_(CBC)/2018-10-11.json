the bookstore or at a library I'll pick it up off the shelf ... flip through it all expect to hear how they prepared for this big Hollywood role or like or what it was like to win that Oscar what it was like to meet Warren Beatty Harvey's\nWell if you get the chance to pick up Sally field's memoir in pieces which you just published\nYeah you'll get a few glimpses of film sets but you also discover a story that's far more personal\nOne that Sally Field hasn't talked about publicly before\nShe takes you back to her childhood home in Pasadena, California she reveals she was sexually abused over the course of several years by her stepfather\nSally Field gets incredibly honest about how that trauma resulted in deep seated anxiety the followed her right through her massive Hollywood career so have you can imagine putting this together was a process for Sally Field it took about seven years top to bottom to put this memoir together but as you're about to hear Oscars aside\nIt ended up being one of her biggest achievements\n[noise] so I feel welcome to thank you how are you doing I'm good how are you I'm very well I have so much to talk to you about okay go ahead I mean some of the stuff is not so easy to talk to you about but I have to say I have all the book interviews I've done I rarely start with this question of fact I Can't even think of entire rest on when\nYou started the books called in peace and I would rarely start with the title is what I mean it seems like when you read the book to your life is truly\nDifferent pieces of your life it was a little bit about the title [noise]\nWhen my mother passed away on nice sixty fifth birthday seven years ago um I thought I had done all the right things you know I have those conversations and we we had um you know it was solved anything left\nThat needed to be resolved I thought and yet it was so deeply disquiet it like there was something urgent thing something fast during on me and I couldn't find out what the wound was\nAnd I I I I felt I had to dig and\nFind all the pieces of my life\nAnd put them out in front of me and\nPut them together piece them together to see what picture it was that I was missing that if I can do that than I Would never be able to move on I Would always feel this deeply just quieted I'm\nAnxious feeling inside of me and so that's what I did I began to uncover and look for the pieces the parts and pieces of myself and was looking\nFor my mother I was looking for some resolve inside myself with my life with me which had to do with my relationship with my mother and that's what it was told me about your mom\nShe was really a complicated\nWonderful person but very complicated very human um and she had she was an actress you this\nVery beautiful um she was put under contract before I was born with somebody who just auditor and in in a theater during the war when my real father was a way in the war and World War two and um she was put under contract paramount\nAnd she'd never thought of being an actor she she just meaningless and she'd been going to um City College in Pasadena\nGenerally it's an interesting time to be having this conversation began book\nYou talk about a director FU to kiss him before I'll give you a part in the film she comes out and says that's completely on true I mean a lot of the current moment is about survivors to come forward stories like you and whether or not there believe so I just want to know how how does the field right such a painful moment and then just have a denial thrown back you're like that\n[noise] um\nYou know I don't think about that I I certainly think about Dr Ford and how the greed just it was yesterday I couldn't even watch yesterday and President Trump apologized\nUm you know to the ... you know on behalf of the country um for\nJustice Kavanaugh's ill treatment\nAnd that's a great just as far as I'm concerned agree ages and um [noise]\nI you know it's it it really is you can be outraged and you can be you know incensed in or any of those but that doesn't get anything done ultimately to have to be on something on the other side of this and certainly I I personally could not thank Dr Ford\nMore as a human being as a woman I think are deeply deeply and profoundly and we have to keep going\nI Can't imagine what it's like you to say something that's so hard to say and then had to be doubt it\n... ... you know I I was raised in the forties was born in the forties raised in the fifties came of age in the sixties you know ... it's hard to think that people would take you seriously I mean it's ... that's the hard part so you know\nNavigate through that is second nature to me a ... because that's all there was so um I don't I Can't pause a and feel what it feels like to be a you know\nTreated with such great disregard and how you're not believed and your trivialize that you can't ... it it takes too much time to stop and feel it you have to just keep piling on\nThis is a really powerful book and I I Want to thank you for coming in I I started the interview right after you but the title would just sort of like I've never done before I Want to end it was somebody of never to either I'm gonna ask you about the cover recover and I will point to some people listening on the radio so the front we had a big part of a discussion in the office about our or interpretations of covering the phone isn't asking oh\nI think on the front refuse it as a young woman a beautiful photo but we'll do the conversation was disturbed so if you're on the cover seem vulnerable does she does she's seen tend to do that on the back is to you now you're you're laughing you're you're joyful using genuinely happy\nIs is that intentional or do something to be taken from those two images\nWell I think it's the fade out fate in if if if nothing else just in age wise you know a lot of um I'm twenty seven and I'm Wondering about the one in the back I'm like ... you know probably close to seven eight sixty eight or something uh [noise]\nAnd if nothing else it's just about long like us producers to does I feel like the same person do you\nAs the one in the front and back mhm no no I mean it is the same person I feel very much the same ingredients but um I I have the ... of history holding up my legs so different than I had in the front cover girl\nI Do think that writing it all out like you did reliving these moments of giving you an additional sturdy means\nYes no question yeah\nAbsolutely but tell me more about that I Would have had that how do you feel about\nWell I didn't for so long I I was um when I was just finishing this book last year um\n[noise] I think what month was I doing this I was\nI had done a play on Broadway and um my son Sam was finishing up a a graduate degree master's degree at Columbia and I would go over to his apartment in Brooklyn every day after the Sunday matinee so this was in may or something of last year\nHe was the only one of my an anyone that I Would sit and read some of it at the end because I couldn't figure out what I learned my son\nSam I have I done this what ... what if I was like looking for what did they gain what did I learn what was the meaning of all of this I just wasted seven yeah I don't know what I'm doing and why I what am I learned\nAnd Sam said my God mother stop stop and think from one minute\nDon't you see how different you are today than you were seven years ago\nHow differently you see yourself\nAnd I went oh oh\nYes yes\nHe was right it took me a moment to really to gather it all up to realize that I I in that seven year period was able to incorporate\nFeel though the reality of my own history of my accomplishments I've always before that felt like any bit of accomplishment I'd ever done with it and it was like I was a cop with a big crowd\nVery quickly and I would go back to feeling that it was a failure and I realized that I didn't feel that way anymore that was just gone I had something that I had done all of my own my own two feet and after all this time I owned it\nAt the place all of us would love to get I'm so happy to get to talk to

Canadian phone ringing\nI didn't I had I mean I knew that he wrote songs and he played music um that was about it like I I knew sometimes his songs that come on the radio when we were in like ... or something you know and you'd hear Anne Marie Singh when a dad songs and\nUm but I don't know just it was something that kind of wasn't really talked about I didn't really know and you know during my years he was mostly a you know playing\nNot he wasn't really playing they chose I never saw him play much except community fundraisers and like school friday concerts are also much prior to your age and yeah yeah it was it was really cool and he was always really generous with his time he's always doing stuff like that\nWhat was the relationship your dad had with the success of like ... to put your hand in hand\nI only know it through kind of research and watching interviews and stuff because we never talked about it never\nNope I'm no we never talked about that stuff I didn't know anything about my dad's career directly from him so part of the great thing about this documentary with it I got to really go back and see so much about him and there's some really great interviews from the early seventies when things are just starting to happen and\nYou know he's living in a house on the east end of the island with you know no phone no plumbing and you know snowboard has just become a massive head and put your hand in hand is about to be too and it's it's um it's interesting to see him because he really wants nothing to do with the money part of things\nUm and that's yeah I think that sums it up he was very bad with money he gave at all yeah yeah and uh\nAnd it was it I think charming but also you know made life very challenging from time to time\nI bet it did so your mom in the film says that your dad was never properly diagnosed\nMhm like he was diagnosed as depressive um but post mortem diagnosed as bipolar from really digging into his you know what was going on in his life and um\nYeah it's a strange funny thing really did people start to kind of snapped together for you like oh well now some of that stuff starts to make sense yeah it took a long time for that it took a lot of reading about mental illness and I'm discovering kind of my own depression anxiety and stuff [noise]\nBefore I really\nStarted to even I guess yeah I had a bit of knowledge of what was going on but I didn't really\nUntil you experience it yourself or you know witness someone going through it I don't think you can really understand it but um we didn't talk about it in our house so I didn't know what was going on I mean people just kind of didn't talk about it all back then you know and so there wasn't language to put around it and I think that's\nOne of the things I've learned from reading is that not being able to talk about it keeps people from getting health and it's you know that's the biggest thing the stigma about mental illness is is the greatest barrier to early detection treatment and so that's what my goal is to get people talking\nSo after your dad's death your dad died by suicide um you you become introspective you kind of retreat into yourself at least that's what I get to the phone right I mean I was always\nFairly shy um as I became a teenager [laughter]\nUm but yeah I definitely went into my room for a few years and learned how to write songs and um yeah I definitely live inside a sort of bubble for a long time of not really knowing who I was aware I was going oh yeah [noise]\nUm but I think yeah grief took a long time to unfold and\nI feel like I'm just starting to live a life of my choosing you know where I'm actually making the decisions and not just following\nThe river or yeah yeah like I don't even even when I first met you Katherine I'm I think everyone several you know that's that's Katherine McClellan nice to meet or do you know do you know her dad is you know\nYeah it was definitely challenging to to live under that shadow and I I don't\nYou know they want want me to to be like him or to do what he did and it's funny because I feel like I kind of I have done that of by accident you know I've followed in his footsteps and now I'm really honored to to be part of that lineage and I really I'm excited to share his music with people and and to tell the story because\nOn lots of levels you know it keeps his music alive which kind of keep them alive but it also is an opportunity to talk about the hard stuff\nUh my name's Tom power you're listening to Q. I speaking with a musician Kevin McClelland about\nA new documentary the song and the sorrow where she examines a relationship in the history of her father or the late great Canadian songwriter gene McClellan and the depression he battled for much of his life and which uh she has struggled with herself and that's that's that's quite a thing to come out with yourself to to talk about that in this documentary as well\nYeah I guess I've been talking about a long time just among friends though and onstage and it doesn't feel uh that part doesn't feel vulnerable\nOr what but at what point did you realize that you share that with your father\nOr those kind of a slow discovery I'm\nA ... in my early late teens early twenties I started realizing that I had this problem with depression and\nI think that was where the real journey of discovery started happening was because I started to get really afraid that I might end up like my dad and and so\nIt was out of pure you know self a determination that I didn't I didn't want to end up like that and\nI didn't want to suffer the way he suffered and I didn't Alto want other people who suffer the way that our family suffered and so I just kind of made myself better I made myself get better [laughter] or at least I made myself or you know get some tools\nOr get ... get on the road to getting better because I Know because that's all I can really do yeah I mean we all have our own challenges whatever they are and you just have to have tools in the documentary in the documentary your mom talks about and I think I can just what I Know no disrespect I could totally understand is but she didn't want the kids to see your father's illness\nIs this something that you have to navigate with with your family yeah I mean my daughter\nShe'll be Thirteen this month and a lot of you know the early years of her and I together I was a single mom and so when I you know there was some pretty rough bouts of depression in those early years and\nYou know there'd be a week where I was just on the couch and I had to explain it to her I was like I'm actually not feeling very well today and as she got older I was kind of able to explain more of what I was going through and um lots of people in our ...\nWould affect her directly that I kind of had to talk to her about and\nSo she's so great you know when I if she sees me come in the door and maybe I'm not having the best date she uh you know she'll be like a cup of tea [laughter] that's awesome and so I mean there's also something that's very sweet about um\nWhen it's just you and your kid in the world together you have a special relationship and we definitely take care of each other it's pretty lovely just using the doc [noise]\nNo she's in it though I mean [laughter] I think she should see it at some point\nOne of my favorite parts of this film is I'm just watching\nPeople tell stories about your dad happy stories about your dad my vehicle lands and this and I'm Ann Marie yeah delayed Ron Heinz was such a great run I used the", "show_name": "As It Happens (CBC)", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "11"}
