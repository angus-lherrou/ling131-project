G.\n[noise]\nLeave you on CBC Radio one serious acts and wants to be nine and from the our eyes that his public radio international\nI'm going to say two words right now and depending on when you were born they will mean two different things\nThe voice okay so see if you're under thirty and listening to this\nA welcome to the world the public radio and also you'll probably think of the reality show the boys you know the little green like Sheldon Christina Aguilera but if you came of age in the Nineteen eighties those two words the voice can only mean this [noise]\nThe voice was the nickname given to the singer you heard right there Steve Perry by one of his biggest fans Jon Bon Jovi as the front man for journey Steve Perry's voice defined the big soaring sound of eighties rock\nIt also transformed a struggling San Francisco group into one of the biggest bands in North America\nBut success took a toll on steep Perry both physically and mentally you stepped away from journey essentially in the late eighties at first and then in Nineteen Ninety seven they got back together for like a little while and then he stepped away for good so\nThe voice had gone silent it would take Steve Perry more than Twenty years to find it again\n\nThe parent thing there I Know it's been a long time come in\nNo or race in the lead singer from Steve Perry's first album and twenty four years traces you don't hear\nSee Perry talked too much about the early days in fact you know here's the Perry talk too much at all he didn't just with the music industry\nHe kinda quit to impress quit doing interviews so when a rare interview today Steve is going to tell you all about the long and at times difficult road back to the spotlight and what he's learned along the way but before we got into all that we took a trip and what he calls the way back machine [noise]\nJourney performing wheel and this guy on the old midnight special TV shows forty which [laughter] I was thinking that sounds like to midnight special forty years ago oh my gosh I can remember what I was where he was wearing all white [laughter]\n\nPets white shirt you know long hair she was lovely by the way she was about like\nThey say that you are that that was the performance they really introduce you to America is the lead singer of journey what what else do you remember from that night\nWell it was just surreal to be on stage to midnight special I mean that was a dream come true and what I Do remember was the venue wasn't as big as it looked on screen it wasn't that big a major went Lynch's can do you know\nThere is something I Need to tell you first I said well what's that she said well she was in remission but it came back and [noise] um\nIt's her bones and she's struggling for her life right now and\nJust I don't I don't know what to do now I I just there was something about her when I saw that just went through me away it jumped out at me I Can't explain it was a connection and the next thing I Know\nI'm looking at Patti should send it send email she sends it so I sit on pins and needles for two weeks\nWaiting for her to get back [noise] I keep badgering poor Patty and she's ... and I you know so finally kill you got back to her in one night she got back to me an email gave me her phone number so I called her and um\nWe were talking we started about six thirty at night we talk till midnight and then I remember June\nFourteenth I think it was she finally was back in town and we went to dinner and same thing happen from six to midnight that night we closed that plays out we just couldn't separate ourselves from each other we were just so connected and I never felt like that about anybody in my whole life so\nWill tell me a little bit more about how she ended up inspiring to music\n[noise] well one night as many nights we would go to bed after we moved in terms of lifestyle or if we would talk to sleep you know I either talkers sleeper she talked me to sleep and when she heard I Need to ask you a favor I said what's that she sat down\nAnd you should make the problem is awesome well what's that [noise] ah something were to ever happen to me she says promised me you will go back in isolation for I think it would make this all for not\nWhole statement sounded like she was looking at the entire arc of her entire life\nAnd and I said I promise that she wasn't talking about you know\nGo into the ... going to the movies or dinner she was talking about isolating from singing machine she'd heard some of my sketches but I was still reluctant to get back in the music business because it's just not a friendly place you know the music is beautiful but the business is not it's and so\nAnd it comes with other stuff so I don't know I think I had already emotionally been a little bit too burnt out where the before and I didn't want to open up the demons about that so but I did say I promise and then after I lost her for two years of grieving\nMy passion for music came back and a\nMan these songs starting to show up and I'm so glad to record got done now I mean I think it would have been a big mistake for my heart and Kelly's promise to not do this rather\nSee Perry while you were making this new music he returned to the stage for the first time and twenty five years to perform with another popular California rock band that wasn't journey\nThat is ills the band back in twenty four team that perhaps deep period back to the stage for his first live performance nearly Twenty years as if I just watched that on YouTube maybe a couple of hours ago for the first time and I think that I think that the audience\nThinks ... from ill is lying to them I Know he 'cause he's got such a dry sense of humor I Know they think he's just putting them on yeah lady gentlemen here's the period and I was like no one clapped they're like yeah right right and then you watch that\nSomebody is coming out of your well he's been he he left because he just was a feeling it any more they kind of laugh like what is he talking about\nAnd then you walk out and the price goes to their feet and they're yelling and screaming\nAnd he'd be back to that what was it like stepping out in front of an audience for the first time in two decades\nI honestly didn't know what to think so I I stayed out of any expectations backstage because there was a different time years have gone by I'm an older guy I not been on stage and twenty five years and it's it's an eagles crowd you know which is an indie crowd which every every every generation has her own stamp\nAnd so that was an indie crowd and I thought gee you know I'm an eagles fan but\nYou know they're not going to know much about me and so I walked out there and they knew and\nI was a bit overwhelmed to be honest with you and I was amazed to\nSee if it's been so great talking to you I mean I have I have so many other things I could ask you I was going to last me a couple more you've got some time now I was going to ask you stuff about the journey I was gonna ask you whether you were ever ever find yourself going back with them or anything like that\nWell you know the thing of people have asked that question you know I'm I don't know if anybody can never go back to anything I I start to really believe in life that you can't go back you got to move forward and for me right now where the passion is in my life\nIs this new music that's the sort of life sustaining for me um uncle Steve was no spring chicken that's for sure and\nAnd I am I'm I'm loving the discovery of the passion that I had lost for so many years for music I rediscovered it in fact if anything I'm a kind of off the wall with it nuts about it again everybody I'm listening to now and\nIncluding some new music I'm writing so I'm more into exactly this new record in the passion for new music\nSteve Perry former from men of journey just released his first album in twenty four years it's\n\nThis election
