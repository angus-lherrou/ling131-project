Thompson doing things no one else was doing at the time\nThey poke fun at corporate culture before it was cool they joked about quote unquote normal families they played women without making them the punch line and one of them Scott Thompson was was openly gay at a time when that was a huge deal in the world's comedy so there's a new book out that takes you through the\nHistory of that group it's called the kids in the hall one dumb guy it's written by Paul Myers musician author and worth mentioning brother to comedian Mike Myers um and his is the first authorized biography kids in the hall I decided to tell you Paul sitting across from me in\nThe studio right now Bruce ... stuck in traffic is going to be here I Am yeah he's he's on his way it's not a comedy bit so this is a\nExactly shopping costume and a couple of minutes or there is he's here right now\nAnd it's funny you should say that because he's actually walking through the door how 'bout that we would find it really perfectly Bruce Tom hey man I ... to how's it going you did a great job here when I had that on behalf of Canada\nI appreciate am I speak for of course he does that mean I I I I I really appreciate that kind of you so it's one of the thing that stands out to me in this in this book is that um you guys are just\nFriends you guys are just guys who got together and you even what what's the story here that you like you start companies have joined the group 'cause we were driving down the road yelling at him after a show\nSort of he he actually came to one of our least successful shows um and through jelly doughnuts had us which was a ... a bit from the show that we had before ... had put a donut under the seat\nUm that was part of the thing and it was a very poorly attended show and he started heckling us and throwing donuts at us and then later said I'm going to be part of you and we said yeah right and of course he was that's that's very so you you ... I should say like you you fall kids in the hall in the early\nDays yeah you're not you're not an outside observer here\nNo I Would say I'm not I'm not outside groups are so so what surprised you the most and writing and researching this book well just the complexity of their relationships are and also learning about their their um their roots like so you got mark and Bruce who had met at West in Calgary\nAnd then you've got Kevin ... from the suburbs of Toronto and then Scott who's more or less from brampton and thunder bay\nAnd he they ended up like converging and they have like similar backgrounds they all have sort of suburban ... backgrounds except for mark\nWell we're all losers from the suburbs really a sense I mean he was more diplomatic rattled fall back\nThen what was the what was the perspective of kids in the home when they started coming out when you go to the ... yeah I Would go down the river in Toronto and there'd be like some nights like five people there but that towards the end there was always a packed house even during a blizzard there would be people lining up to go to see the kids in the hall\nAnd the room was electric I mean that's a cliche probably but you had like cars and the bartender doing parts of the sketches with them and they use the whole room I thought that was fascinating but they would have liked to set up in different parts of the bar\nToo because it's an exchange I'm just we're just all people um but I think now that I've gotten older and I've ... I could let down my card I Know that they're going to be playing to Dave's my not my funeral and all\nThat and I and I I used to fear are fans because of but now I I embrace them so yeah the fact that we're still reverberating for anybody is fantastic So Paul last where do you then what is it\nThat makes the kids in the hall timeless I think it's that thing that about speaking to like you said corporate culture and social\nThe social sort of thing and there's still a suburban culture a and there's still a sense of who's inside who's outside so there that stuff will be timeless and they never dated it to any specific reference there is no references to any particular era in that gets in the hall it it does have a certain through line that is not dated to one era\nWas that intentional by the way it was that intentional at the time I ...
