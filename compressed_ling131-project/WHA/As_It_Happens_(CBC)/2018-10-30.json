intrinsically Canadian and experiences watching a hockey with your friends and family is there seemed to be a another deficit of that having being articulated in any kind of art form\nAnd and I think like\nYou know we we are all well versed in the romance of pick up hockey on the pontoon back yard a well where's the romance of the crowded living room and kitchen or on game night you know and and

Bush has launched war against Saddam Hussein we can tell you that these targets of opportunity have been hit\nSo let me ask you first of all of our crew there are you and uh and ... and all are well\nWe're a little excited David and I'm sure is obvious but yet we check\nIn the American media in particular had totally dropped the ball they didn't see what was coming they all endorsed it knows a lot of the consequences\nAnd the blogging and eventually pod casting became one way ordinary people to speak their mind on the subject that you know the great wise focal our society had completely missed that was the beginning it was people looking for a way to speak\nTheir mind [noise] where I Want to ask you the route political question which which has to do\nThe Bush administration and new in the war in Iraq\nIt seems to me we've never had less debate left dissent more confusion a more general mass deception about\nWhat we were getting into than we've had in the last six months or a year since nine eleven it has not been an explosive period of expression comment criticism investigation\nUh what's missing a big question I don't really know I mean it's one thing we felt like explorers and a new land and what does it you don't need a license to do this now you don't have an opinion and to get it out you didn't have to go through the FCC speak your mind you can use four letter words if you're ... you're just saying you can dance\nAnd ... once you get into that mood isn't holy moly it wasn't\nAnd ah after we had our conversation\nFor power in the blood I didn't want to get off the phone she said to me that she didn't want to get off the phone she's had allowed and I was like oh my God that's amazing ripped out and um I really left that injury wanting to think about writing an an authorized biography above St Marie\nSo Bobby was it hard to put the trust and someone to tell your story\nNo not really and I was so glad that I'm\nI'm you know a couple of years earlier I had read and read his first book we ought to know [noise]\nUm because uh there's ... there's so much that comes through in her writing when she's a beautiful writer she's real intelligent is real funny and she can see if she can just kind of see the between the lines of um [noise]\nUh both to show anti business [laughter] and that's always been real important to me both of them and it really is a difference between the show and the business and so she could see that I kind of been abused and kicked around by the business that the show is still a little ... a whole lot of fun for me and I think that's one of the places we really connected on\nWell you're so funny and like your music is so full of hope I mean it's none of none of the things that have been sort of like done to you arguably\nHas dampened your spirit at all and I I\nAm one thing I Love this book does is that it does set the record straight\nGet wrong about ... feet for example you you didn't play Woodstock\n[laughter] [laughter] I Know I Am story there's always been a woodstove a Andrea in the book she pointed that out and young people almost every concert in the U.S someone will come up to join you say you know we're so good at Woodstock I just love you you were just the best friend and I would start [laughter]\nWhat do you go I spent some time with Joni Mitchell and they tell her the same thing it was so good at Woodstock and she wasn't there either I don't know I guess I don't know what they were uh uh smoking that day but you know drugs ... and they were there\nThe assumption is that you would be because you were such an important part of that time so I feel like people just create the scenario they wish that had existed\nBut it's interesting that this myth of some times bigger than the actual story itself and it leads me to some of the challenges he must have had an injury I mean you knew he was born I reserve somewhere around Nineteen forty one but there aren't a lot of records from that time was what what is it like to put together a complete story above your life with such little information to go on\nI like the fact when I'm because I Do care so much research and I really care mostly about sort of people's lived experiences so\nBeing able to like just spend so much time with Buffy like she was so generous with her time we were on the phone constantly so she really was able to fill in so many different gaps where she could and then I Would be able to sort of bring 'em a different sort of lends from the music industry point like the fact that she's\nNever been nominated for induction into the rock and Roll Hall of fame and these other huge life that's Donovan gets a lot of credit for her song you just you know terrible I'm very frustrating so these kinds of things are where I can bring my lens to it\nI think this is the I think this is the part of the book that I find the most fascinating is is what Andrea on earth things about you that you have perspective on it and we we need I feel like you and I both learn something new about your story ... an example of that is just take a listen to his\n[noise]\n\nThat is not cracker ballet from Tchaikovsky for ... ... if you're just doing it by the way this has not Saturday afternoon or the opera [laughter] you are speaking with other legendary Buffy ... Marie and our official bark for entry Warner above your first crush was check off\nA little girl is piano when I was by age three and I fell in love with it the way on the other kids love sports in Barbie dolls I loved music and I I started playing fakes confiscated very young age\nBut after you you found something interesting in Buffy the love of took off he ran\nWell I you know I think one of the things I just thinking about what it is to um come out of trauma and where you place your trust in people my assessment was that you know it makes a lot of sense for one's first crash to be won a national musician I'm a dead natural musician\nDo you find safety in in um sort of someone's you know hypothetical arms that isn't there at all but ... you can take a lot of comfort in from their music because you love it so much and I think ... and that was sort of my assessment was\nThat it makes sense that you know a a young girl who's coming out of sort of uh some traumatic situations in her childhood will gravitate towards like a dad gay classical musician and and I think I think it's a beautiful you know there's a lot of there's a lot of hope there but there's also a lot of sort of that darkness that we we moved through as well\nAbove you is it is a challenging for you to relive some of this and the writing of this book to talk about early trauma intimate partner trauma um ... episodes of heroin or these hard things to relive no ...\n... but it it it's something that I've held back on\nOffering is part of my showbiz bio yeah but and we have a you know the respect really is neutral because I really think that she has a ... per writer you know when we first started Andrea said you know if there's anything you don't want to talk about we just won't but and I don't think anything ever came up that we didn't want that we weren't both interested in exploring\nAbsolutely and I and I feel like from the very beginning you were very clear one you didn't want me to put you on a pedestal and I'm not super interested in that myself 'cause I don't I think actually when you put someone on a pedestal you're doing them quite a disservice like you're not actually treated them as a person and I really think that all\nAll of us needs views are treating each other as a as people because I sort of create community crates compassion models ways to live and our environments um\nAnd I think that that I just think that's a that's so important I can still be a fan of your work and I'm Still obviously deeply sided with you um but I also\nI also want to see you as a real person\nAnd I think that was that was pretty vital to the the writing of a biography like that\nAnd I think I think that oh shit Andrea dug into the songs which made me happy because for me it's never been about I'm being a show business personality so much as\nThe conscience of the songs is what I was trying to get across yeah that's why I wasn't so mad at Donovan yeah [laughter] I I wanted to get the message out in a Andrea seem to be responding to those things in the songs that I had really intended and I felt as though we were both aiming for the same target\nBut they are you there were issues around that that brings up an interesting point because the the focus on the songs um and and the way to record labels and other people in the business didn't want to focus just on the songs or something that comes up a lot in this book stuff that I didn't know about it and I found really interesting you describe\nThe feeling of a lack of creative control over your music especially when it came to your first record label on on on on vanguard he told me a little bit more about that\n[laughter] well it was a little bit on I mean I\nHad just gotten out of college that I was going to India I was playing and I'm trying my luck it folks singing in the village are doing pretty good vent got records wanted to signed me I went to sign with them I almost signed with Blue Note which is a jazz reading level by the way\nUm but I went into vanguard and they said who is your lawyer and I said I don't have one they said that's OK you can use hours\nThey signed me through a seven year deal I mean [noise]\nAnd um you know a lot of the early people in management they ... they just didn't know what to do with me you know they didn't mean to be mean to me or [laughter] you know a particularly colonial about it or you know any of that\nThey just didn't know what to do with me they many of them wanted me to where you know come up like Pocahontas infringes they want to play that you know the most of them come from a you know real New York show business thing we got to have a gimmick\n[laughter] and they will and they were so they they didn't know some of them were afraid of the fact that I was outspoken I think they didn't know what to do with that they thought that I Would offend\nThemselves and and also I wasn't very smart about social things I didn't grow up\nLike in a social climbing environment or in a business environment where the family has you know they're talking about business at the table like there wasn't a lawyer in the family or business I'd never met any of those people\nIn party and go drinking after either exactly reactor too\nYoung and when you don't when you kind of is when you kind of you know I don't know I go home and rice\nWine for me and for me to go to a an after hours by our everybody's getting half ... and I don't drink at all um I even unintentionally insulted some people I didn't mean to but for instance in France there was celebrating\nFour hundred year old bottle of wine and I'd say oh no thanks I don't drink and that's not cool yeah\nI didn't know that you were supposed to kiss businessmen on the cheek I hold back from that and because they didn't go out drinking after hours where the ... and the ... and everybody else went that's the way the business deals were made so I missed a lot of business opportunities and social opportunities\nFor memory with I felt like this book was I felt like it was you taking control back from these people who try to control you you know\nWell I guess maybe that with Andrea take that in mind here that's my intention like give all the autonomy of active\nBuffy and and and sort of like I mean because because I Do\nGet frustrated like a again things that you know like it's been your life so you just get to you you live at and if you're allergic France and then I can be this outsider being like", "year": "2018", "show_name": "As It Happens (CBC)", "city": "Madison",
