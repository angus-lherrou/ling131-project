R. dot org and like us on Facebook at the ideas network\nWMGK studios in or something I don't know but we're concerned broad germs or so for your ... gubernatorial giving\nThan democratic challengers only\nNow here's a bone version\nRadio and television stations\nYou to the to win a title debate between the race is leading\nTo make a longstanding commitment\nAnd supported by in grant from the Wisconsin association of Independent Colleges and universities\nLet's go now to ... moderator a veteran Wisconsin broadcaster\nThe WMBA hall of fame\nProfessor of leadership and integrity at Loyola University in Chicago ...\nWe are Eighteen days away from election day on Tuesday November six voters decide who will be their governor for the next four years our goal tonight is to help Wisconsin voters make informed choices as the two major party candidates incumbent Governor Scott Walker and state school superintendent Tony ... meat in their first debate\nThe candidates have agreed to the rules we will be clear on the time allotted for replies we start with Ninety second replies then moved to questions with one minute replies and then finally a few with thirty second responses the candidates and I can see countdown clocks\nWhen they hit their time limit I Will advise them and if they continue on noted and their microphones\nNext question finally if a candidate fails to answer the precise question asked of them I Will exercise the moderators option to call that out and given them just thirty seconds to give a specific answer\nThere will be two minute closing statement the order of the closing and the first question was determined by a coin toss with that let's begin with the first question going to Governor Walker and asked by Jessica are of W. I. SCTV things\nWith us having tonight with starting tonight with credibility Governor Walker as of this week four of your former cabinet secretaries have publicly criticize deal\nHere former transportation secretary says you're inaccurate about state highways secretary of financial institutions corrections and economic development say they initially believed in your vision for the state\nBut described your leadership with terms like schemes and cover up and quote micro management manipulation and mischief including directive not to leave a paper trail on major decisions\nHow does the fact that four of your appointees are raising these allegations affect your credibility\nWell thanks for the question and first off I Want to say it's a good evening and uh it's a little bit hard for the imagine being here tonight without my father and the audience I Want to begin by saying so many of you've offered condolences including you Tony thank you very much for that [noise]\nEight years ago to Annette and I were worried that our kids weren't going to be able to find a job I don't want her career because the unemployment rate was nine points three percent\nAnd since then we've seen a tremendous turnaround more people working in the state than ever before which is why we're working on workforce and over the next four years I'd like to continue to grow that and keep our graduates here\nWith Jessica to your specific question it's simple I'm not afraid to help people with diverse opinions in my cabinet\nFor years I had a cabinet member who wanted to raise the gas tax and I told the voters clearly I Would never raise the gas tax without an equal or greater reduction elsewhere in in their tax burden overall\nOr even an addition of my cabinet when I was in county government I had a member of the cabinet there who worked for a Democrat a United States Congress and I even had a personal late in the past\nWho worked for Joe Lieberman who was a running mate with Al Gore when he ran for president two thousand I'm not afraid to have people with diverse opinions out there but why always will do is be straight with the voters of the state of Wisconsin I'll tell you what I'm going to do and then I'll follow up and do it\nAnd I hope you can see based upon our record we've got more people working in this state than ever before some of the best schools in the nation\nAnd your property taxes are lower today than before you started\nThank you go to your response to that Mr even\nAnd thank you very much and thanks for their Wisconsin broadcasters association and the folks here tonight asking the questions and also in part to a particular the viewers watching provide and go over or is let's not forget about that\nSo it's a great question around that we've seen a playing out over the last few days of a Governor Walker talks about diversity but I look at this in a little different way and that is it's about how your governor and how the people Wisconsin trust you\nWhen you have for your top lieutenants and uh you you hire them a Scott Walker\nAnd a and they're talking about things like you know a looting food not being truthful um making sure that ah ah that transparency was not an issue hiding things from the from the from the from the media\nMaking sure that uh making sure that uh there was lack of integrity in state government and the bottom line is and this is the thing that I think is most important of time and time again in in this discussion that we saw today we saw people the people that were your closest people out of attendance and and and the advice\nEverything was very important what you put your your uh your political agenda a head of the people Wisconsin of that is something that frankly is is very frightening to me as a citizen and I will change going forward in fact I Can't imagine another governor that\nHas Mr even as you're out of time we're going to go to the next question and that is to Emily than in a W KLW\nKeeping the focus on credibility Mr Sievers political reported today and your department of public instruction confirmed that for passages in your recently submitted department budget were plagiarized\nThe sections include Fifteen paragraph that had been lifted from a blog post and other paragraph that were taken from a ... entry without attribution\nYou've been a lifelong educator and your own department of public instruction Web site warns about the dangers of plagiarism\nJust as we ask other Walker what does it say about your credibility that this would happen under your watch\nWell if this is about Scott Walker has he doesn't have much I'll tell you that we dropped a few um a few ... of citations from the back pages of a budget\nWe talked to the people involved it was just as a mistake and they fixed\nNow the last thing I made in my life is to have Scott Walker lecturing me about the issue of uh of of of plagiarism frankly\nHe takes budget items directly from national organizations and high high a high dollar sponsors passes on into law without change I rarely changing a word issue about my budget is this\nIs going to ask for a one point four billion dollars extra for the kids who Wisconsin that's what's important to be not citations\nDuct one point four billion dollars is is what we are going to be used to take care of the eight hundred million dollars of Scott Walker took all of a bunch of just a handful of years ago\nBad is what this budget is about we can talk you we can be diverted into talking about citations all night but at the end of the day we know the kids are Wisconsin need a better budget than we've had for the last ... years\nYou Governor Walker your response sure well first off on the previous point let me be clear the Wisconsin council for freedom of information actually give us an award for open government\nAnd in fact you can literally go to our website open book and see all the finances to state government and one of the national organizations gave us in a ranking rank and is the number three state in the nation for openness and transparency\nBut to the issue that was just raised in that question specifically I don't know if a teacher out there that would allow a students a hand and a term paper they plagiarized major portions of a document without a tribute particularly for what ... out there but but that aside let's talk about one thing I'm happy to copy and that is my friend Tommy tops\nYou know years ago when I served in the legislature when Tommie was our governor we funded schools that two thirds Jim dog got rid of that we funded schools that two thirds and we still lower property taxes and this last budget we'll made the largest actual dollar investment education in state history that Tony actually called it a ... budget\nHe told the media at the time that his priorities were line was ... at least that's what he told them when he was running for his third term for state superintendents he's running for different office but the facts haven't changed our budget invest record amounts an extra two hundred dollars for every year for every student in every district across the state\nAnd we're up to four hundred dollars on top of that for kids or rural school districts you know we're focused on improving education but we're doing it without raising property taxes Tony eras for years has advocated raising your property taxes I'll find two thirds funding and still continue to lower property taxes with good fiscal management and reform\nIf the ... the response or as a breathtaking a fellow clay by the governor here's the deal folks\nScott Walker was running for president\nToo long ago and he decided that being against the Affordable CARE Act was important piece to be in order to succeed in that\n... that didn't happen and as a result of that decision he has hurt the people was gone and he didn't not only that he would oppose Obamacare but as a result of that opposition he did not take the Medicaid expansion money that\nThe Wisconsin ... citizens deserve so he left hundreds of millions of dollars on the table\nAnd the reason why Minnesota has lower rates in Wisconsin does\nIs because and I talked to a person early on the campaign and and he said\nYou're living in La Crosse I'm going to continue working here but I have to move to Minnesota to get their health care about that were driving people out of the state\nWe can't do that in addition Scott Walker\nI going to take that Medicaid money and we're going to we're going to plow it into the system and make health care more affordable is all but pre existing conditions are two point four million people in the state of Wisconsin that care about that including me I'm a cancer survivor\nScott Walker is talking on both sides of his mouth he wants to see if they have a a pre existing conditions then but he's in federal court to get rid of Affordable Care act which will get rid of those protections\nSo Scott Walker I've asked you a lot of times and having to answer why should drop out of that last time is up we're going to go to the next question with Lee ...\nHave a number of conversations on social media about mental\nImpact area family is and I can tell you that I see the pain on the faces of our residents in their stories in fact we have a few to share with you here Sherry from Madison says parents do not get services and cannot see their kids need how\nAnd Danielle from Portage says the biggest issue is access\nNow a new study by the Wisconsin policy forum says a shortage of psychiatry in the state leads to more than half of adults who need care not getting it\nWhat is going wrong with the state and what do you plan to do to fix that Mr Sievers\nAll start out with uh my my wheelhouse of K. through twelve education\nWe put money in the last budget and uh for mental health services and I'll tell you a quick story how this played out in the state of Wisconsin in Ashland school is that far north part of the state\nThey went to referendum they they uh they modified some other schools that button every ... every school building they put in therapy room so that people can receive that therapy and bringing in a ... a practitioners from the area right in the schools so just rather that stigma\nSo he put that money in the budget is starting to work we're asking for sixty four million dollars more in the state of Wisconsin\nThat's what that's what we're going to be doing\nAn addition is does have to do with taking that Medicaid money I I'm going back I go talk to people all across the state of Wisconsin practitioner as as well as house\nHospital a executive bad money goes towards reimbursement of services if we don't take that money there's there you're going to be ... there won't be the higher level of reimbursement that's needed as a result\nPeople do get services is pretty simple\nI I was just with the folks over at the Medical College of Wisconsin and they're doing some very innovative things at the state needs to ... to support\nHaving a psychologist actually work with a family practitioners northern Wisconsin where those people don't exist but if we want to have a healthy healthy society and especially in this area a mental health we must make that commitment and frankly we must take Medicaid money coming to walk\n[noise] well and most of this issue I think Tony and I agree the only to section is we just talked about\nUh if you go back and look at politifact the facts are clear when Minnesota took the expansion premiums went up the premise didn't go down until this year when they adopted almost the identical plan to what I just signed earlier this year will go into effect in January so we don't want to have happened what Mark Dayton a Democrat said two years ago and that is the Affordable CARE Act is no longer affordable\nBut when it comes to mental health services related to that you're right we actually do share a lot of the same place we took what was included in his budget request two years ago 'cause when I traveled to state listening to school officials that many of our town hall listening sessions that was an issue they said over and over again\nAnd they said we need it in the schools because a few years before that working with the legislature we actually provided the largest increase in mental health services and more than twenty more a governor had done in more than twenty five years\nBut still not enough we've got to work together to only a mental health but on trauma informed care my wife turnout is active in that than we know dealing with trauma an adverse childhood experiences are incredibly important we need a partner together with the state with nonprofits with school districts and social service agencies all across the state of Wisconsin\nAnd as you mentioned with some of those a social media contacts out there I Know it's an incredibly ... personal issue\nMy father who just recently passed away was a minister for many many years and throughout that time he suffered with certain levels of mental illness as well and it's a struggle for many people we've got to break that stigma so people get the health care that they need to be healthy going for\nThank you and thank both of you for keeping time so well we're impressed let's go to the next question Emily found\nNow are transitioning to transportation\nWisconsin nights are concerned about the quality of the roads and bridges when it comes to solutions Governor Walker you've been clear that you won't raise the gas tax and some ideas that you're open to Mr Sievers you said everything is on the table\nWhat can you commit to this evening to help crumbling roads and where will the money come from\nThanks to the question you you mentioned polling actually the latest Marquette polls show that Seventy percent of the people in this day believe there there are roads and locally are good excellent or fair so only thirty percent actually think the poor and we need to work on that all over the state\nIs why since I've been governor we've invested twenty four billion dollars into the state's transportation fun\nCompare that to the Twenty one billion dollars Jim door put it in fact during his time near the end of his tenure Jindal took over a billion dollars in rated it out of the transportation on we had to pay that back in\nListening to local officials as I once was and county government they told us they needed a better partnership and so in the last budget we gave them the largest increase in Twenty years for local governments to maintain the roads and bridges were doing the same for a state highways and you did mention you're right there is a contrast\nTony and said the day after the primary right here in Madison everything's on the table\nAnd he was asked does that include a dollar gas that gal or excuse me a dollar a gallon gas tax increase he said everything's on the table\nNow in a minute he'll say it's ridiculous it's all why any number of other things out there but in the end you're not telling them what it is if you don't have a plan till after the election ladies and gentlemen need to be ready for a massive gas tax increase a dollar a gallon would be twelve hundred dollars for a typical family\nAre broach going forward is to get local governments the largest increases they've ever had maintained are state highways and do it by not doing massive new energy just in Milwaukee as the state has done over the past decade thank you what are you saying Mr\n... or ... or what I say uh\nOf course people Wisconsin understand except for Scott Walker keep repeating it a dollar a gallon is ridiculous it's never going to happen but let's go back to what doesn't work\nScott Walker's policies Scott Walker has drawn a line in the sand or own transportation and as a result our roads are crumbling we have people in northern Wisconsin are scraping the ... uh VS fall off the roads are driving on gravel roads think about the uniqueness of that idea\nWe have to change us in the state of Wisconsin I don't I was just for the engineer the other day she was she was telling me she's worked on bridge project she's afraid that there was going to be fridge calamity in this state so as we sit around and talk about a dollar a gallon at how ridiculous that is our roads continue to crumble\nGoing forward and I have to tell you this twenty four billion dollars of our Governor Walker talked about but if you put that ... against inflation worth the lowest level in Twenty years so going forward what we're going to do is really roll up our sleep for him bring people together\nRepublicans and Democrats get this idea the only person in the way of solving this this infrastructure problem in the state of Wisconsin as Governor Walker going forward or I'm going to bring him to gather Republicans and Democrats were not going to have a preconceived a solution\nI Would prefer not to raise any taxes on this issue but I'll be listening to the people that were working to solve this will move onto the next question it goes to the ...\nNow let's talk about the kind of\nWisconsin unemployment rate is ... percent\nBased also along with it has been fun at the gate at the same time a recent study by the United way signs that sixty two percent of Wisconsin night ... less than twenty dollars an hour and ... percent\nThat report also reveals that many people with cats you can't afford basic needs what can be fate due to prove conditions for only walking people\nWill say either do a farce\nAnd thank you for bringing out that the United way study that was an extraordinarily important issue for us you think about it there's over six hundred and\nBut he also can because this was a nation of laws and a stable government and so we need to uphold those laws and Jessica that question probably would be best suited for the U.S Senate a primer or ... US Senate debate I should say because those laws are addressed at the federal level\nDo I think we should have immigrants are open ... open to immigrants here in the state whether it comes deals with their ... yeah\nFor illegal immigration in the state of Wisconsin we need people to come and we now have more people in the workforce than we've ever had before and the state's history we now we need to keep our graduates here we need to bring people in from other states and other places to help us grow the economy\nIs Davis when well first of all we heard that a Governor Walker said no to the doctor ... and as far as in state tuition other states have done it in under the same circumstances but what concerns me the most as we continue to\nPass on this issue with with our president and this this campaign this campaign is not about Donald Trump as it's about Scott Walker and Tony years but it is about the governor's ability to call out\nBad public policy at the national level when when a young people were being ...\nBorder and people ask the governor Wisconsin whether he thought about that and he said it's a federal issue well it's not it's a human issue to human issue and the governor of the state of Wisconsin needs to weigh on them that the governor of the Wisconsin is a way on on the issue of immigration I Will work hard we have to have a comprehensive\nReform in the states we must be able to do that\nIn addition I Would provide a driver's permit for people that are working in Wisconsin and I go out on that goes to our next question picked a month or two\nAnd keep it on immigration so many of my radio station listeners lend me to ask you this question about say what's license\nThose up the idea of what a driver's license in Wisconsin I shouldn't have required to show\nProof of citizenship\nShould they be a way to license and regulate undocumented immigrants who drive oh Wisconsin's roles\nIt's saw how and when will it be done going to walk there you are first\nThank you again as I talked about before we're a nation of immigrants but we're also a nation of laws\nAnd that put really puts us in violation of the federal law that's the reason why we need federal officials to stand up and make positive affirmative changes that allow for legal immigration and then the state from anywhere around the world\nAnd the reason we need to do that is precisely what I mentioned the last question and the answer to the last question which is we have more people in the workforce in the state than ever before and a history\nWe need to bring more people under the state to work is why we're out actively recruiting people whether it's Midwest millennials or whether it's a alumni coming back from our public and private institutions or whether it's a way around recruiting veterans at sixteen different military bases around the world and when things I'm particularly proud was where the number one state in America\nFor veterans benefits all those things are about bringing people into the state of Wisconsin\nBut we need to be sure that were in compliance with federal law and that means that address issues like this when did the federal government to make those changes\nHistory of it by my father in law came from Holland took a farm in ... county for years and then that worked at color company and then the next wave of immigrants game and then the next wave of immigrants\nI can tell you that that is going to happen as long as I'm Alive in the state of Wisconsin or any any one of us we have to accept that fact so do I think that we should have a ... driver permits for undocumented folks that are working in the state of Wisconsin answer's yes\nPeople are undocumented folks are working hard jobs all across the state of Wisconsin paying taxes paying into Social Security\nThey should have the opportunity to have permits but the state of Wisconsin also has the opportunity to hire good workers\nIn addition when you get fat permit you have to you have to learn how to drive safely and Wisconsin to me if it wins for the economy in a way for the workers and it was for the people the Scots time's up\nOr go to the next question and that's Leno's\nTalk about drunken driving and first offense criminality drunken drivers kill or injure someone every three hours in this state according to the DOT and yet Wisconsin is the only state in the country that doesn't consider a first offense drunken driving charge a crime\nWe talked about this on social media and Christine from Madison represents a lot of the comments we saw she said if God Forbid you lose a member or two of your family too drunk drivers then maybe you may think Wisconsin drunk driving laws need to be changed to\nHow long each of you respond to Christine\nOh just talking in a in a different way\nBe our work in our schools around alcohol and other drug abuse has been very successful we're seeing a sharp decline of number\n... uses of drugs and uses uses of alcohol also and and less of Britain binge drinking also so the good news is that we're trying to corral this problem that we have in Wisconsin driving drunk driving is a serious of a fence\nAbsolutely and I believe it was I Believe there's ways that we can we can get there yes it should it should be\nFair eastern issue first timer oh there's no question about that I Would support that but we also have to make sure you know just throwing people into the criminal justice system is not going to solve their problem\nIf it's as if it's a serious offense are viewed as a serious a fast we have to provide alcohol no other drug abuse we have a ... a proposals we have to provide mental health services we just can't incarcerate people think they're going to get better that's where my concern is governor [noise] well this is a very serious issue\nAnd has been for years I remember when I was first in the state legislature from Wall with us uh uh the port family and they just had a horrible case for a family member I think was\nIf I remember right I think the individual who killed her family member head\nHad been a repeat offender I think it was nine times\nIt's one of the things I'm particularly proud of his having worked with Alberta Darling a gym up and really on a bipartisan group to a further criminalize multiple repeat offenders because at some point you're ... you're right we've got to provide help and assistance but at some point when people are out multiple times on the road\nA with drunk driving a fence that is putting a risk to all of us in society out there\nAnd beyond that is part of the reasons why raise concerns after talking to law enforcement and public health officials are about ... of legalizing marijuana you know I just saw a report from Canada that said I Believe in Canada now they actually see a higher number of vehicle related crashes related to drug as opposed to alcohol way\nTo make sure we don't have any impaired driving whether it's alcohol related or drug related as well governor I think the question was first offense criminality as opposed to civil\nBut my point on that is we need to go after not just not so much the first offenders although we need to make it a taboo for anyone to be driving under the influence from alcohol or drugs or anything else\nBut where the biggest threat has been and why we cracked down on that need to do even more is on people who are out over and over and over again on the street changed the law in the first event you know I don't think Tony said that either I don't know they said that\nHe was just to be clear I Would I Would I Would look at a ... making their criminal but I also it would have to be tied with ways to not just incarcerate people but to to help them returned to society thank you both for that clarification Jessica\nThat's come back to agriculture for a moment\nWisconsin the dairy state has lost more than five hundred farms across the state this year\nFarmers say record low prices for milk or driving them out of business a tentative new trade deal with Canada and Mexico promises to open new markets for dairy farmers but a serious problem remains there is simply too much milk being reduced which the state in recent years has encouraged\nAs governor how would you remedy the issue of too much milk production and what steps can be taken in Wisconsin to faith family farms governor we can\nNext Jessica well this is a serious issue we're talking about for some time I was out the world ... which just out with a bunch of farm groups who endorses yesterday in ... county I Know having a grown up with a mom who grew up on a farm and that farming is more than just a job it's a way of life for a lot of our farm families and they're hurting\nAnd I was happy to work with the president a year and a half ago to say that the the problems in Canada were causing a lot of farmers to get cut off from groups like grass and ... and it was so pleased\nMake sure those changes were made open up more markets\nAre simply board to actually one ways we got to open up knowing more markets but all of your home could eat more cereal and eat more cheese quite frankly that's part of the challenge out there not enough people are eating ... out there and so we've got to find other ways to open up markets around the world we've been aggressive in working with Sheila Hart storefront our team at the Wisconsin department of egg trading consumer protection\nBut the last thing we want to do is raise taxes on farmers Tony Evers is talking about raising taxes on farmers and manufacturers I don't care what size they are the last thing they need at a time like this is ...\nI'm sure glad you brought that up so I have a chance to rebut down I was trying to do that before my tax plan is going to work well for for farmers in the state of Wisconsin\nI it's a ten percent tax cuts and for those that are getting the agriculture rebate up to three hundred thousand dollars and there's not many farmers in the state of Wisconsin that will pass that limit so I'm confident that we're going to protect those farmers", "show_name": "As It Happens (CBC)", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison",
