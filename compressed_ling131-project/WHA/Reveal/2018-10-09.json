[noise]\nI also went to another city that's really comparable to New Orleans to find out what their da da\nNang minutes away just up the Mississippi River the populations of east Baton Rouge parish and New Orleans or about the same and some of their demographics\nAround half white half black their da ... is really comparable to for starters he's from New Orleans just like Leon cannons arrow\nAre losing a shark and house or oh you did you ever been to so I'll be going on ... street\nHillary more attended a private Catholic high school which actually played sports again scan is there is private Catholic high school but they are white men both have been da ... you\nKnow for me others will soon as just another statutes another tool that we could possibly use\nDa more saves this law for when someone is really dangerous\nThe bottom line of everything is public safety can you ... with no charm a Jew or goes public sector really demand tunnel ...\nAnd the ten years he's been da has office has used this law sixty six times\nNow let's talk about what da Kenneth Arrow does in New Orleans he wouldn't tell me but I got a hold of court data and the same ten years Ken is zero has used the same law more than two thousand six hundred times [noise]\nI shared this number what the da and his spokes men denied it the da's office only started keeping data on the habitual offender statue in twenty sixteen so I asked them to look at the core data I\nIn an email the DEA spokesman said their office uses the law judiciously against people who quote resist rehabilitation and choose instead to commit more so many crimes against more innocent victims\n[noise] the reason these two da's act so different is because every da ... discretion to charge people the way they want to the bottom line is if friends have been prosecuted for drug possession in east Baton Rouge or almost anywhere else in Louisiana [noise] he'd likely be home already ...\n...\nFrom what you're saying it sounds like ... have the power to selectively enforce the law\nIn a way I mean the age do take an oath to uphold the law and Ken is there are always emphasizes this oh his duty not his discretion like here at this other city council meeting where he's defending how he prosecutes marijuana crimes\nRemiss if I had what I consider to be a profitable case and simply said I'm not going to prosecute is because I just don't agree with the law that's really not my call desperate you guys do you make the decision whether or not\nAnd if if it is a law I think I have a responsibility to prosecute it just the facts in fact support death\nIn other words I don't make the laws adjust enforce them or as we sing in New Orleans [noise]\n[noise]\n... is I'm just doing my job why is he doing his job so differently than any other da in Louisiana\nBecause the New Orleans when it comes to the habitual offender statute that's how it's done and this man just hearing from a very squeaky chair can explain why\nMy name is Ken Jones than I Am ...

came into office he used a multiple below two shows up on this issue of society that he's going to put people in jail for the rest of the day that\nKind of was the da of New Orleans for Thirty years and kind of a tough on crime trailblazer he first ran in Nineteen Seventy three and promised to use the habitual offender statue much more aggressively here's one of his newspaper ads\nAs district attorney already comic but just to use the powers of hers offer to help her image or your system but time and time again returns habitual offenders to continue their uninhabited crimes I give you some sort of [noise]\nThis was the Nineteen seventies and crime is urging all over the country people were scared\nSounds like kind of played on that for you so he brought this law back from when ... when did you start\nWell the first mentioned I found in Louisiana is from Eighteen thirty three\nIf any person shot a third ... be convicted of any primary shall be considered as I'm it's just a ... isn't that a labor for life\nThrough this whole story I I've been thinking about how race is connected to all of this and and that line unfit for society I mean it it just sounds like something right out of the races handbook right\nYeah I I talked to a historian about that John barred studies the history of incarceration in Louisiana at Tulane University\nI think the fact that ... really came into their own as part of this intensely racialized mass incarceration undoubtedly speaks to smashing the conflict as scary African\nBut there was some kind of object he's done that we've been told you know well if they don't do it over here\nIt might go across the street and aggravated battery and so they'd be looking at twenty to life on it persisted there to fix my here saying that they would change the charge so that they could then him for the multiple bell curve back and there was no record of this\nNone it's behind the scenes part of verbal the negotiations between prosecutors and defense attorneys\nAnd remember in these cases the d._a. never officially charges that have digital offender statute his prosecutors just say they will if the defendant doesn't plead guilty so all traces of the law just disappear\nSo we don't even know how many people were talking about here\nWe know cannon Sarah Hughes the law in over two thousand six hundred cases but that number is just the tip of the iceberg [noise]\n\nOf course Ken of their refused to be interviewed for this story\nWhich is frustrating because he's an elected official\nBut he did offer a statement about princes case here a few
