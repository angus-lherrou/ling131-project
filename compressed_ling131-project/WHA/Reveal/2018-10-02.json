S. and work\nRuby says Cindy's case to stay here as a strong one one of the strongest she heard during her visit to port Isabel Sandy also told ... about her four sons she hadn't seen them in about a month she described a moment her baby was taken from her\nShe told me that the card so they had to take her baby away\nAs she said but I'm Still breast feeding him you know [noise] and there's it doesn't matter she snow but I'm a breast feeding and they said oh he felt that take 'em and\nThey are [noise] God Forbid took breastfeeding a baby [noise] oh is\nIt just couldn't believe it\n[laughter]\nWhat else to say about that\nI was never able to interview Sandy in person but I did get a chance to talk to her over the phone\nSandy happened to call while I was visiting us his apartment in Southern California she was calling from the detention center to talk to her mom\n[noise] part of our family and ended up how are you my daughter\n[noise]\nSandy says she's desperate to leave I left has gone did you talk to the kids money [noise]\n\nCindy tells you about that whenever she talks to her kids on the phone they tell her they want to be with her she asked if you'll have been able to talk with them\nAnd they have to get all it'd be at ... am over that yes\nBecause on friday they called I spoke with one of the kids and he said to me he said mommy I Want to leave here I Want to go if you don't mind me\nSandy says it's not just hurting punished it's the children to [noise] when Sandy says this looks like she's about to cry\nNow that that means nothing will the truth me uh I don't have words for you I understand you as a mother\n\nAnd he tells you that there's no one there to hug the baby no one to make him feel the warmth of his mother\nDo say ... yes that was something else to children complained about that they don't let the kids hug the baby not the twelve year old eight year old or five year old almost all the way how is it possible that they don't let them hug each other you know how that'd be a new styles that but I they are brothers they have never been apart\n\nWhat torment Sandy is that the baby's finally getting old enough to recognize people but the only people he's seeing are strangers\nTo ... you have to have faith my daughter came in because it's the saddest thing for a mother to be separated from her children he also I don't mean it was\nOkay and then what I mean that they at that and they had not yet okay we have a good night we'll talk tomorrow ... ... ... okay blessings make we couldn't they have in the in our family by my sweet girl\n\nNo does got her own story to tell you just have one that connects to Sandy's to hit us in the way she says her family's\nBeen persecuted in Guatemala for generation I mean she lets her shirt to show me a scar that runs across her stomach and we can wow you ... it looks like she was cut in half and sewing back together you would have been for years she's avoided looking at it in the mirror was\nTies with one of those things maybe you don't put 'em in Jamaica and\nShe tells me it's a reminder of when she was kidnapped raped and tortured and killed his family was in the military during Guatemala's bloody civil war she thinks that has a lot to do with why she in Sandy were targeted it's ill to who encouraged Sandy to ask for asylum do everything legally\nBut down at Sandia and the kids are locked up in a part of the says it feels like the whole asylum thing was ally\nI reached out to ice and customs and border protection but they couldn't answer my question why did the government takes Sandy's kids this summer when there's no evidence that she crossed the border illegally\nAnd it wasn't just Sandy many parents who were never prosecuted for this we're still separated from their kids there are dozens of examples listed in a lawsuit against the government the American civil liberties\nOver for separations of asylum seeking families\nThe lawsuit was filed back in February months before family separation was really in the news\nThat cases famous now it's called miss el versus ice in court documents the administration has to try to explain why it's separated those parents parents who hadn't been accused of entering the country illegally reading through you can see the government's argument shift\nBurst and says it's separated the plaintiff and child because I wasn't sure they were really related\nBut they were that was proven by a DNA test so then the government argues different reasons about why they needed to be separated those arguments worn enough to persuade the court\nThe judge ruled that this type of family separation went beyond it's lawful reach\nIn the end I Can't tell you why the government separated children from parents like Sandy all I Know for sure is it wasn't about a crackdown on illegal immigration it wasn't about the Trump Administration enforcing the law\nBecause many families didn't break it [noise]\nLate yesterday at the California judge a Bush appointed by the way issued a nationwide injunction ordering immigration agents to take several new steps first\nIn late June the judge in that court case issued an injunction now there was a deadline a ticking clock the government would have to reunite families who've been separated whether they cross illegally are not\nKids would need to be back with their parents within thirty days the youngest even sooner\nDeadline to reunite the youngest of migrant children with their families and our less than a week away\nSeparating families was one thing that could the government put them back together and wasn't clear there was ever a plan for that it was a massive logistical challenge we're talking about thousands of children and shelters across the country parents locked up thousands of miles away how is this going to happen\nThere are reports of mass confusion surrounding this process joining us now as Alex is are the health and Human Services secretary Mr Secretary thank you for your time this morning there does seem to be a lot of confusion on this matter what can you tell us this morning declare some of that up\n... thank you uh first off there's absolutely no confusion on our part uh we have the kids and we're working to comply with the court's order and what that involves you know with\nThe government says everything's fine but with a deadline of July tend to just a few days away we call Sandy's mom you'll to [noise]\nLike um like yoga has no idea what's going to happen next you know the tells me\nThere's a lot of confusion she's had trouble reaching Sandy and attention and now she has to hand over documents proving she's related to the grandkids\nYour warm or he doesn't know when or if Sandy will see the kids again and if they're all back together how would they get to ...\n... yep letter of the\nDay before the deadline the Trump Administration admits it's not going to make it maybe only half the youngest children will be reunited with their parents Sandy's cancer at a shelter for migrant children in Phoenix, Arizona it's run by a Texas based company called south west key so I call it the company [noise]\n[noise] Hi sister so he just needed to teach them or quarter calling from the tribute how are you going\nThat's Jeff ... a spokesman for southwest key many of the kids separated at the border are staying at southwest key sheltered\nMinuses is whether this is about the plans for redefining as you know these are the shelters rests with it [noise] where where are you to court to sort of where you are and what do you hear on the next step surely officer British secure\nHaven't heard any plans to step away from them I just should we were reading this year on next sketch from the office of refugee result I Would imagine that you all would have liked to get some information about how this will be transported that's just what I'm trying to figure out [noise] we're waiting is", "year":
