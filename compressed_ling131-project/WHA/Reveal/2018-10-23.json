brands he's voting as a right and a privilege so he disagrees with Reverend ponder who says voting is a right period\nBrian sings registering ahead of an election is important because it shows someone's educated and engaged enough to deserve to vote\nYou want people who have been following the election to some degree or who knows what the issues are and what the candidates stand for I don't believe in the same day registration because I Do think it's that administrative headache because I Do think it distorts the electorate Abad I Try to how does it distorted the electorate [noise]\nI

Duncan picks up the story [noise]\nYeah yeah so uh right now I'm In the machine in Logan lamb has a voting machine in his living room [noise] this is what one looks like on the inside so here's where in regards to [noise]\nLogan is a cyber security researcher in Atlanta his specialty is finding new ways to break into wireless networks and new ways to keep the bad guys out\nThe touch screen voting machines she has is the kind Georgia uses edits polling places the machine is bulky and book shaped with the big screen it looks kind of like a cross between a Nintendo and the Bible Logan boots it up\nSo it was actually touch the litter and then it's decompress being the image is one funny thing I've been wanting to do is pull off that full time at the beginning and use that as every time\nThis is a direct recording electronic machine or DRA it doesn't produce any sort of voter verified paper audit trail from Logan in other cybersecurity tight that's a major red flag\nIn fact the areas have been criticized by technologist basically since they were installed across the country in the early two thousand one alternative to these machines is paper ballots and in recent years more and more people are pushing to start using them again\nLike last march at a Senate intelligence committee hearing on election security Ron Wyden a Democrat from Oregon had some questions for homeland security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen\nYou wanted to get her official position on electronic voting machines\nAnd I'd like to get your views for the record of whether you believe the continued use of paperless voting machines in this country\nA breach into a voter registration system is not a breach into the voting system in Georgia because those are two distinctly different systems distinctly different secured systems\nIt's worth noting that cyber experts disagree with is strongly met Bernhardt is a PHD student at the University of Michigan he studies the arteries and their vulnerability that says the problem with George's system is that unlike a lot of other states it's all interconnected like a giant tree\nHe told me the secretary of state's office is the roots your counties or like the upper branches and your precincts are like little leads\nSo really you can inject information or inject basically now we're a virus and part of this tree the way it's set up that virus could get transmitted to every other part of the tree\nNot long after Logan downloaded all that data a second time some election integrity groups filed a complaint against Brian Kemp for violating Georgians constitutional rights to have their ballots counted correctly [noise]\nGeorgia to switch to paper ballots before the November midterms [noise]\nThere was a hearing in September in federal court in Atlanta was grueling took all day you at cyber experts on one side explaining why Georgia's system is so vulnerable\nOne of them even hacked a voting machine right there in the courtroom\nOn the other side we're camps people telling the cyber experts hey you don't understand how Georgia system works a few days after this hearing\nA federal judge deciding again adapting paper ballots over electronic winds for the midterm elections\nJudge any Totenberg filed an order in favor of Brian Kemp she wrote that switching to a paper ballots just weeks before an election would create total chaos but she also spent dozens and dozens of pages validating the testimony of cyber experts and scolding the state [noise]\nI'm going to read just a little bit from the ...\nWhere is gravely concerned about the state's taste in responding to the serious vulnerabilities of its voting system by the way throughout the hearing kept team tried to paint the cyber experts as out of state elites judge Totenberg was having none of that\nHow can she wrote is here to stay and quote defendants will fail to address that reality if they'd demean as paranoia the research based findings of national cyber security engineers an expert [noise]\nSo that's where we are Georgia's barreling towards mid terms with the vulnerable systems the machines that very few people trust Kennesaw state is no longer handling elections now the secretary of state's office does\nThe people I talked to say that change won't really make much of a difference they say if a hacker got the info Logan got back in twenty sixteen they could still use it to disenfranchise voters in twenty eight team and it's worth noting here just how much judge Totenberg has ruined resembles the logic Kennesaw state right after Logan first you know that\nWe know are elections are vulnerable but we can't fix them because the elections are so soon\nBefore Logan I parted ways I asked him a question\nLet me ask you this how sure are you that somebody didn't beat you to this uh there's there's not really a way of knowing at this point huh I mean still to this day I'm very concerned\n[noise]\nReveals by those who brought us that story\nEarlier this year Brian Kemp established a commission to look at options for replacing the curve voting system by twenty twenty oh and the other four states heading into the midterms that use touch screen machines with no
