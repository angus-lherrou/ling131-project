I'm not rich state of being in there and sometimes I Do that as well\nSo I just try to be applying the wall and try not to interfere as much as possible\nTo science say take discipline that you want to back the results of your experiment that's\nVery true yeah I mean I basically tell them right from the beginning I'm not going to answer their question unless they get really soccer you know I don't want to interfere 'cause they can't ship me in the box I have to rely on the real fat and that's where we find out where the holes in the rules are\nAnd the creation of those rules is an international business world ... to ... to legacy versions of pandemic [noise]\nAre always tough because when you learn a game you want to get into the game right away so you don't want a lot of rules and then you get stuck in the middle and you need something very precise or you're trying to write a book that's full\nCasual and breezy but oddly specific at the same time\nOne of the things that helps us is\nA this game as translate into a lot of languages including German which is a very precise language so we will finish our rule book we'll send it off the translation and we will get dozens of questions from the German translator about where English has been incredibly sloppy or have to meanings\nIf we have time we always go back to the English rules and rewrite them based on all of these questions and really get that precision that only comes from having someone have to word by word translated into a more precise language\nLanguage is from other countries so Trump ... game design\nIn their culture and the language of other countries all if you're doing is going to be globally all affected in some way I mean you're like in Germany can't put a tank on the cover of a game\nPut that on the cover you just won't sell it in Germany so it it'd be a thing of the culture you have to think of the language that we think of how to play\nSo we kind of postal German fatigue with combat games and things like that did not feed into the creation of cooperative games like that [noise]\nIt fed into what were called German games the nineties and then euro games which was the interesting thing because of the post war fatigue and cultural sort of a version to direct conflict\nThey had to design games where you really didn't take anything from anyone else and send you sort of passively aggressively got in a place where they wanted to be so if there's one space and we can only you can have your person there I can and I get there first I technically I haven't taken anything from you know I just prevented you from getting something\nIs is both the same in very different but it led to a whole other way of thinking about board games like what if we were all just racing to do better\nAnd there's been this blossoming of game design over the past Twenty years just from the host more aversion to direct conflict [noise]\n... probably around five hundred game developers general cone on selling gangs of everything you can imagine titles about ... you know ... ... ... creations of supernatural steam punk\nIt's tempting to think in a world of PlayStation ... spoke\nTo the ... trade current that\nTo him about his Korea\nOut that the work that he said\nIt's still having a much influence on the way that we live now\nBut I I moved out to Silicon Valley in Nineteen Ninety seven I got a job at a ... corporation\nApple so it was like this exciting sexy job as they happen to leave Midwest and and make my own ... California\nI think they're all four months before I got laid off and they're like I got a sense of what this whole lifestyle as ... much security yeah exactly there's a lot of turnover but you just kinda got adept at at\nSwitching jobs and you maintain a big network of people and it was really exciting\nOn the right in saying that you were working on what we call the personalization of the wet\nWhen I was working we're just starting to do what with social networking those apps are just kind of coming out of the scene that was working on Yahoo and it was the lead interaction designer working a lot of their social I guess what now you'd call social networking applications\nFor something that no it was really defining tech coach a ton of stuff\nYeah I mean back when I was working on this that people didn't want to put their photo op on line because I thought that was being too public a set that we take for granted now or was it was really on the edge when I was working on it and we're just beginning to understand what they like to like making up a gate that you'd share with people and now you know as ubiquitous you see it on Twitter is you know basically ... everywhere\nBut it back into time we were just kind of learning with us interaction patterns were so I was hoping to document those when share those ... those across the opposite\nSides of the defining still for coach now isn't it yeah I mean it's like I said if you can see it everywhere I mean people are checking and I found hundreds of times a day\nMuch really struck me the these days is that you know work in an old ... failed he's kind of on plugged from something that society is awash with now social media because about face to face\nContact yeah it's one thing I really liked about tabletop gaming it's very different from a electronic gaming and that you know you're playing with people across the table here making eye contact it's like this medium for connecting across your dining room table it gives people an excuse to to be with each other and that that's one thing I really love [noise]\nWhat's the importance of this time away from screens that games while you'll allow\nBiting their devices that really isolating you know you're not on your eye pattern honor X. box or whatever they forget to connect with people who sell games off of this great way especially cooperative game to operate right way to really communicate with people and connect to reconnect\nYou're listening to in the studio from the BBC Wilson if I'm Kevin Call and I'm In Indianapolis in the United states I Jang tone one of the world's biggest full game convention to meet monthly called the designer of\nJen ... he's I should have died\nA few blocks away to a\nTwenty exclusive looking hotel hair that's the full players chosen from the intellect packed punt on they like to see see straight [noise]\nIt was really thinking about the excitement with which people on the floor of the convention center ... stopping in ... to grow up [noise]\nA golden ticket so those game as such like entering the chocolate factory [noise]\nThey will be among the sauce players to get their hands on they gain [noise]\nHigh right now than\nThey are in a cage was being paid and we're heading into this week's\nShow are doing this I'm going to try to say well it's possible that there are more like an anthropologist I guess that\nSit right now has ... ah the latest version he is presenting it now see the guy in test as as they sign some known disclosure agreements that they are not going to talk about the content of the game\nBy\nAnd tunnel ... trees and they kind of games\nThat absolutely as working together\nOn planning out are turned somebody might have a great idea this time but maybe next turned Greg has this amazing idea this plant cell funding able to work together and kind of play off of each other\nAnd it's just wonderful game there were already familiar with but then a layered on top of that is is uh is this intriguing story that unfolds as you play a twist you know twist your approach and you have to constantly be adapting\nWell good luck with the\nSame way in the middle of the testing process now how is it was going really well they just finished up the prologue game gone through all the rules are when the prologue to hang in the January game so crowded they feel that they won't be happy that they won a pretty good players bend a", "year": "2018", "show_name": "In the Studio", "city": "Madison", "day": "10"}
