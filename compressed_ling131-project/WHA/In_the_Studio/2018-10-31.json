I'm\nGood to me thank you for letting this time\nBut\nBut but you know how to sit in separate\nYou don't think that you know something like this guy had to you know it has been two years this coming week they're like my husband right over there just about welfare do with land pulled him out over here did CPR on him so that is watching the house you know I could sit in the spring of the day or the night or what ever be in it and just\nContinually see it the way it was you know it's too hard\nAs well as after your husband died um you felt you found an appointment card and you decided to\nCall the doctor's office yes I call it he had an appointment therefore September eighth them he died on the seventh and I called them on the aid and not I told them pretty much what I said was this is Lee ... both hands white\nAnd he will not be able to make it for his appointment today because he's dead he died last\nNight at twenty two Seventeen pm why were you might have to make that call\nBecause of blame the doctor or his death I really do because I feel like he's like a big contributing factor in it\nIf he wasn't on the medications he should not have been on I feel like he was still be here if he had had the proper treatment he should have had all along what I Would like to see happen to him as he's thrown in a house and the key throughout the why are they can never find it because I'm not as for giving us most people\nThey tell you\nYou believe in God and you're supposed to forgive people and all this sort of thing and now I'm just not that way I feel like if you have done harm to people then you should pay the price [noise]\n\nI'm Emily Walden\nI'm from level but I'm In Lawrence for Kentucky today for an event held by parents of addicted loved ones are having music speakers and a candlelight festival\nToday to talk about\nThe issue and the loss of my son\nIs pretty difficult to our struggle each and every time\nBefore that I never spoke to in front of a group or anything like that\nAnd it's been very hard for me [noise]\nDC so she's a chance\nTo see to me I have a fulltime regular job that I get paid for and that's just my volunteer job and I'm probably forty fifty hours a week on top of my full time job [noise] yeah I Can't seem to stop I we've got to make this right and a little while and [noise]\nThe pharmaceutical industry wants\nYou know they want to talk about it\nWay that people may not\nLike and we've had five\nThe hall and\nPaying for\nIt was Wesley Duke and I am a assistant director of the Medicaid fraud control unit at the Kentucky attorney general's office\nI'm Emily Walden was finally be yeah you too and\nOf of I've heard that story and it ...\n... a little background we have like yogurt currently right now seven lawsuits filed against various opioid manufacturers and distributors we've alleged well first of all violations of the Kentucky Medicaid prostitutes\nThat day of a cause fraudulent claims to be made to the Kentucky Medicaid program we've also alleged violations or the consumer protection act because they made representations through the public to physicians that these things these drugs are safe\nAnd let me clarify that I'm not going after death because my son died that dropped on going after that because after the research I get and what I found out about\nIs the reason that I have ... death he should've never had access to it many many other people should not have\nThis was a systemic issue you know we're all the way from the manufacturer all the way to the position down the line there were problems\nWe're seeking financial day which is so this is this is a case about money and you know and of course they'll never be enough money to fix all the damage that was ... you know that's just the fact that so I and as far as far as the number out of out of a couple of talking about that today at this time to do all this but we're talking a significant sum of money that will\nGo to address the problem\nAll what's interesting as some of these drug companies are trying to get these cases all news to federal court yes because\nI think they believe that they possibly could settle for less money\nTo the cases we've discussed today or civil actions not criminal you would have to prove your criminal liability and you'd have to know that the executives\nWere aware that possibly could\nExist but uh as far as these cases here today or civil you know and um and I don't want to say that there could not be criminal liability because it could potentially exists but we've not gotten therefore you here\nThey do need to go to ... I Would like to see the federal department of justice file criminal charges against these companies and parents back you'd ask her what they have John\n[noise]\nThings are moving forward and I'm very pleased about that how I get banks are correct that it'll take some time and and I'm okay with that let's get it right I'm heading to Washington D.
