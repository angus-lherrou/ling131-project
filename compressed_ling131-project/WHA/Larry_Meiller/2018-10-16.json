disorders [noise]\nYeah I think um well I Will say that\nEngaging in a diet as a risk factor for developing an eating disorder but there are plenty of people who who do diet that don't develop any in in as far as er an eating disorder Israeli characterized by by the really to start the start at a um\nThought someone has about their body and you know developing a low body weight and and the the behavior is really kind of taking over their life\nUm and really having a negative impact on their life you know the obesity medicine field is um has had some growing interest in intermittent fasting I think it's really important though when anybody as as taking on you know diets to to really have on their ...\nA risk factor of any diet is developing an eating disorder that doesn't mean that it's actually going to happen and that doesn't mean that dieting is eating this as an eating disorder there is that there there's some gray there and there has to cross the partial to tell when it becomes a problem\nOkay thanks Justin appreciate the call let's go to Mike in Cleveland Wisconsin Hi Mike\nBy Larry to push it can adults developed um\nViews or leave a jury purposes um issues with\nGetting

to the food's\nGood questions my thanks for calling doctor Lankford\nYeah you know as far as that that just for um the different foods what we usually when we're starting trip I must somebody we would like to identify what are quote unquote safe to set us our food spat\nDon't typically cause the individual huge amounts of anxiety and and we like to offer them those sorts of frequently asked as we can and then over time with the support of the treatment team we like them to branch out and start to um expose themselves to foods that are more challenging so if\nWhat we don't really have a lot of sushi in the hospital but if she wants to say food that would be um something that you know we would encourage them to eat initially but we definitely\nReach recover away by the time to to be able to branch out and to be able to eight of RIT if it's in a variety of different settings as far as uh age of ... um\nAdolescence as a as a common age of onset but eating disorders can can occur really at any stage and someone's life we see them happening earlier now with younger adolescents and then we also see that I see them I'm showing up in later life as well so so really if they can occur at anytime\nI noticed any time okay actually in Milwaukee will turn to you know I actually\nI I have a daughter who is in high school some weeks on\nWhen you look to the attrition told her it was but it could happen to you it was the problem [noise] and so she lost\nThe wrong with them and access to see it was\nA little over in Italy will eat Donald really living off of vegetables and humble popped

a job\nIn sight it looked like she pulled out skill though but I Know would it do the peak of you know\nYeah yeah and you know it's that's a frequent um trigger for\nYou know get people to be told by by really well meaning um adults whether it's a a physician or couch that I you know they maybe should lose some weight or need to watch out for further waking can can pretty frequently trigger an eating disorder um with what you're saying it sounds like your daughter is\nReally following a predator restrict a pattern and my guest Hassan you know maybe fears about branching out on her eating

don't do Marcy wrote this story for us to talk about what part of town and maybe seven thousand people could have four five six car dealers even and\nThrough the summer toward the end the summer they would start advertising letting people know that the new models were coming they would build up the suspense\nWhat were these cars going to look like and and these days now\nCars pretty much all local local life Mercedes looks like a Toyota Corolla looks like a ... you know and and I think that's because they get some focus groups together and you know all the suits figure out what everybody votes for what they like they all like the same thing apparently and\nThat's why everything's from Adrian has\nBacked them they had artists make these cars out of clay you know and design them and then worked with the engineers on them you know tail fans are the biggest uh uh thing people talk about [noise]\nBut people couldn't wait for those cars to not only being town but be unveiled and and the
