P.\nR. dot org and\nAre leaning new Berlin up with a question for your comment Hi Arlene thank you for calling\nGetting learning Larry and thank you for having this show I'm really interested\nIn where you can get certain things but I'll give you a little synopsis my mother was born in Austria and she came to this country and ah and then in the forties when she got she got married we used to go to a grocery store in West Alice said he was slowly and then he did his old cutting up and everything\nThe one thing I Know that my mother used to make is a good chicken soup pot\nYou have to have eighth doing chicken and if you go in this grocery stores and you look at the check and they're all stripped and the chickens chickens you buy I wouldn't give that to my dog [laughter]\nWell and I don't I Would like to know where I could get ugly stealing chicken because the soup that you make from it is that die for and it's the best thing\nFor a cold they're going to go yet my answer off the air\nAll right thanks our ally in a well let's see uh who wants to try that one bad or jobs\nThat I can make a little comment about the science scientific side of of of a that's a question and comment and then and then there was there was a really really great question and comments so stewing chickens are older now so they have more college in more connective tissue\nOr from a from a a of a flavor standpoint from making stews and bras and so forth it provides a lot more that flavor and Dan Dan Dan is well versed in understanding that that that that technique for making really great great products in his restaurant\nBut those compounds so those I'm a college in connective tissue fibers they've also shown in research to uh provide I'm a human health values so so there are some have medicinal type type type purposes Arlene\nWas kind of ... may have been right on when she's talking about that product or that soup or whatever as a a helpful in the cold [laughter] you're likely so lightly so a damn cabin\nUh watch that she's absolutely right that's exactly I go through an older stewing in every time that we make a full flavor chicken broth I'm actually very happy with that came up with a U.S almost ... lost now how do you find them\nI Would say if you go to your local Bush's especially more uh unfortunately outside of Madison um they should be able to find a older stewing ... doing it for you and I even think if you do go into places like McAfee markets or the ... cops in town\nUm and you asked the Bush's behind the counter I think they're becoming more well versed on these topics and willing to go outside of their I Know I get asked ... what was your cropping back us we're products are at about ... you know things just like that\nOkay there we go John in okay ... thanks phrase driving you're are you driving your combine right now\nThat is correct or what good I'm I'm I'm calling or two things first of all I'm at a gas for recognizing that are\nAll at agriculture um make a contribution and I really like to comment about a various ... doing their part whether their grass fed or conventional organic it's that's that's great thank you for a second of all\nI'm I Am a dairy producer and O'Connor mark and I read recently some calling area magazine about age ... beef eating beef from old old in cows are old theory elves\nAnd how it's becoming a sort of a trend in upscale restaurants is there any truth to that than it is a market it could be developed\nOh well let's go to Dan facts first\nAh you while you're kind of letting up one of our secrets on [laughter] no I just yeah you're absolutely right it is becoming a trend or to get um I saw that kind of starting in Las Vegas for the chef Jose Andres was starting to market\nAre older ... as far as revise and whatnot um yeah and we are we very much are starting that now as far as looking at its utilization for older animals um and finding an outlet for them um and we've actually taught summer Amish farmers about crossing hosting with Angus\nI'm an utilizing some of those older breeding stock\nUm I think you're absolutely right I Do think there's a market for them I think the trend is starting yeah it was ... just barely starting\nBut ... you know this this um this is not a new technology applying it to the whole team breed likely is a new a newer technology but aging has been had been gone on for ever and in fact aging\nEvery piece of meat that we purchasing consumers aged to some degree an aging as a find as a allowing natural enzymes that are present meat and technically they're called ... and ...\nAnd allowing those enzymes to slowly break down or the structure of meat so they break down that connective tissue and some of those harder parts that make meat tough and chewy and\nHave will will function in a given enough time they will actually a critic ten rising effect in at a certain point which is generally about two weeks that tend to rising effect is maximized\nAnd then you continue on with those enzymes attacking proteins and fat and college in connective tissue\nAnd buy them working on those components bachelor relief they actually released very unique flavor interim compounds so if you've had a\nForty days right steak or sixty day Dr steak you'll notice that they have a very different flavor profile and that's because of the enzymes that are active that are that are basically digesting and breaking down different flavor compounds\nThat technology to hosting beef is really really phenomenal idea\nNow and you're going to pay more for that of course because if you're going you you don't just set it outside and let us let at age it has to be aged in proper temperature conditions and so forth and that all costs money\nYeah especially with the water lost touch with a concentration of flavor and the trend that ends up yeah it is going to cost a little bit more\nYeah there we go [noise] uh ... John thank you very much for calling appreciate your call and let's go to Jenny in Placerville Hi Jenny\nI was calling with more combat\nQuit barking where I come from like I said I Want it [noise] but I'm fortunate that there are still very butcher shop and not everyone has that option\nYeah that that's [noise]\nAlthough I think that's changing all of a little bit Jeff\n[noise] it is and um [noise]\nTo be honest I'm not exactly sure where things are there it's it's it was it was a program that was initiated lots of controversy among producers ranchers and a governing bodies in an association such as national ... beef association national port board and the poultry council and so forth\nAnd and um the challenges the challenge was and still is today is the value does a value exist does it help or most of the consumers who wants to know where their food comes from in a way that it's that that that that that that actually does does so\nIn because of the intent of um the government who initiated that made that a law uh for for a period of time uh it became\nA very difficult logistical challenge of how do you manage and police this right so ... are animals born in a country raising the country they spent any time in one country another\nBe at restaurants and or a customers that are just the average person wants to buy something and then educating them on why your product stands out from the product they can get at the store yes that that's basically it\nAs you park came up here Andy from a I'm Sorry Judy from Stevens Point called to ask if there's any hope for fatter pork future or pork chops gets so dry geez I served\nSure hope so I'm a ... I'm trying to build a career and that's a\nAh we know we started marketing or you know or the other red meat um as far as pork has concerns I trying to get away from the stereotype of a kind of what happened in the seventies of you know remarketing pork after uh people were were scared of disease or if it was how\nHealthy to eat and then of course there goes all the fat marveling uh as far as when he got into a conventional raising\nBut as we said earlier fat is definitely flavor uh we are a big proponents of bringing that\nBack um and I it's one day at a time yeah\nWhy do a ... just from a cooking\nSide of things if you've got whenever pork chop Judy's guide hot as she does prepare that pork chops so it isn't dry ah the easiest thing I Would say is a\nBrine brining I'm I'm a huge\nUh a huge supporter of renting any leaner cuts especially pork or poetry or my ... Brian recipe is a gallon of water half a cup of salts and a quarter cup of sugar\nAnd you bring that up that solution up to boil you let it cool down or in the in the in the cooler down forty degrees you pour that over your pork chop\nYou let it sit for six to twenty four hours and that's a that when it takes on takes a salt and sugar into the the pork chop it really helps kind of keep that that cut of meat moist\nAnd Dan is explaining the occasional process of what a lot of pork in poultry in supermarkets grocery store I ... which is enhanced meant or injection with a solution\nA small amount of water salt and then in a couple of their functional ingredients to help help prevent that I'd also I'd also throughout that uh for for for many many years a kind of driven by concern about a ... a pork has has has has no tourists have been overcooked\nA recent ... a couple of years ago USDA United States the primary culture came up cooking guidelines new cooking guidelines report\nExplaining that one hundred and forty five degrees internal temperature result is completely safe pork and and and that would be that that was a long ways in in helping helping keep port from drying out so good meat thermometer [laughter] else\nNo doubt about it well uh\nI have a question regarding when it was mentioned about I'm\nGrading a ... you know the grass fed 'em how do we know or how do you feel that the grass is where the fields the gray or what they're eating out there is it's clean it's good that the fields have not been um\nDecide so many other things out I'm a I guess a basic question\nOkay that's a great question I I'll throw my comments which which won't be a lot because I'm not ... strictly experience in this area\nBut ah I I I Do know that um you know are not only am our culture but but production agriculture crop crop agriculture has come a long ways and and there's definitely\nResources such as a uh extension specialist in crop and soil scientist is University of Wisconsin Madison who can give you specific an accurate highly accurate responses but in general\nYou know they're ... just like him a ... culture a production agriculture crop agriculture is also seen seen a lot more stringent regulations so\nA requirement of pesticide applicators licenses in in in and approved in grants that can be sold and banning of of of other ingredients\nAre so uh that is kind of a skirting around your your your your direct question but ah ah it's it's I'm very unlikely that that that there really any concerns about ah insecticides herbicides pesticides\nAnd it does go back a little bit I think to what we how we started this by you know talking about artists and meat production of you know\nIf you go to a local shop and you know\nYou you know you learn who is who are the farmers and how do they how did these farmers raise their animals\nI think damn that gives you a\nA little more comfort I think\nYou're absolutely right it's it's known your farmers knowing or food comes from and that that level of or if someone's not willing to be transparent do 'em in if you're asked to go out to their farm or you're asked uh the butcher where the animal comes from and you're not getting a straight answer non straight response I think that would be the first uh\nThe first level books on ... and that's got the whole idea behind the local food movement is just really knowing\nThe point a to B of a where you're where it's coming from\nWell there's a lot we uh haven't touched on here that we could be touching on but uh we are out of time I want to thank Jeff and Dan thank you both very much ... or perhaps we can have your back and do this again I it'd be great to do it\nYou have the time went by so quickly [laughter] they'll re five minutes goes pretty fast food restaurants around here thank you again so much and uh we'll have them back it will do this again with them just send all our you W essentially made scientist\nWorks out of the U.

P. R. dot org love to hear from you before we go back to the phones are our previous caller mentioned a very late for in his mind canoe capital are twenty some pounds\nYes I'm the aerospace industry has ... it's a technology to to paddle sport that's where all this came from\nA U.S you're getting you're getting your ... down in the Nineteen pound range right now and that is the number one impediment for people paddling is being able to get the boat pick it up and put it in the water put on their car\nYeah especially putting it on the car I think is almost the worst part\nThat is the number one impediment and so we're seeing white or boats were also saying people purchase small trailers and um they actually will sometimes when their boats on their trailer and then when they want to go just hook it up and go\nYeah which makes a whole lot of sense to me well Pam in Madison has something for his let's go there Pam Hi thanks for calling\nGood morning or good afternoon I'm I'm Wondering about any of that might be a very well\nOver the last couple of years I used to canoe and and the kayaking but over the last couple of years I've lost the use of my legs and so I'm not able to get myself in and out of a boat anymore and most of my friends and husbands do not know how to figure out how to help me\nDo that and I didn't know if there's any kind of um lift system or any kind of option available for me or people like me to get in and out um where we are unable to do it for ourselves\nYou know yes there are um actually there's ... there's quite a few um in the American ... association actually has a whole program for the call and for adapted paddling towards people and we've had\nI've also seen some of the eye wise or YouTube using chunk of PVC pipe and eating ... do you have any thoughts or you know of a different product that I should be considering the corner of my kayak\nDo um it's actually called Q easy\nAnd uh we've got to the shop and so by the foot and it's not two hundred dollars it's like four bucks a foot or five bucks a foot something like that [noise] um what it is actually a no one invented this for kayaks right this was an adapted product\nWhen you go to a factory and you see a cement floor with you know forklifts running around there's lines on the floor\nWhen a forklift drivers over a line and turns its wheels it's just going to lift the paint right off right something and then in this this material to plastic material with a super super sticky and he has the backing and they put that down on the factory for ... for the friends over doesn't left\nSome smart person figured out that that's really awesome product to put on boats so that protects the key line so yeah it's um it's great stuff and what's it called again he'll easy and kill and then easy\nBut I think if you heard of them are Aaron\nI had not but I appreciate the information\nAll right thank you very much for calling appreciate your call Jim in St Croix falls let's give you a chance to hide Jim\nHi um my question is a criminal loaded throwing clue um devices can recommend or I'm Sorry decides not to hurt because I use a string level but when

take a you know is there any leader dry bag insult with water and you know waterways to mourn two pounds per liter so I got a sixty homes wait more or less right\nAnd dropped that in the front of the boats across the bow down a little bit um so that's one thing you can do if you're just going out for the day\nUm as far as trimming at what some people do is put their boat in the water and they'll get a grease pencil go down in the market little mark where the water lines are and then they'll add space to that so when you put your boat in the water you can you can look at it and tell us your term or not\nThe other thing is some boats have a a bottom paint like water line they'll paint underneath the water line when you put the bottom water you can see immediately if it's if it's true or not\nOr or your friends can see for its term or not\nThere you go so a couple of different ways including even a magic marker\nYup the use of Greece pencil because then I can go back and use or something else um killed papers all even pain that sometimes\nThere you go Jim thank you so much Suzie a new Berlin year tour and Hi Suzy\nHi Hi I'm calling about the woman who I'm looking for places to go paddle boarding yeah a lot of people paddle board on them Milwaukee River it right into the downtown Milwaukee I don't know if anybody goes out on the lake I wouldn't but I'm\nThe Milwaukee River like in Petersburg is a smaller river um and then as you get into market keeps getting wider and wider and now that it's clean and safe\nUm you know a lot of fun and uh there's a lot of a lot of things to do on the river you can stop have lunch\nThey'll get a drink only one while you're on the water um that kinda thing and I'm quite sure that he doesn't ran paddle boats are at the park at all of a sudden I'm blanking on what the name of the car is\nAcross from the market editor they rant all kinds of both kayaks and I'm pretty sure they do ... they are now too\nThough yeah the the one thing he has to be careful what malarkey river is depending on where you want to go there are a lot so then you have to find out how to handle do but it's not you know it doesn't stop it from a\nThat's a fairly new outfit or they're they've been there a couple of years I think maybe three um but yeah the Milwaukee is a great example of a turning their turning their faces toward the river again you know most rivers\nYou know early twentieth century were seen as you know basically a way to get rid of waste and you know when you go along the rivers in some of the urban rivers you'll see just the backup a factory you know and what a what a waste right\nAre you so you're seeing cities um Austin or inside San Antonio is probably really great it's a good example of that as the river walk so they're they're starting to see the river as an asset not as not as a liability and Milwaukee certainly has done a good job of that\nAnd just thinking on Wednesday I'm going to be doing a show on Milwaukee and some of the great parks there there's a new book out will be in the name of the book is just scraping me but we'll be talking about they've they've done some amazing things down there with their nature centers\nAnd when when when people take pride in ownership in their community or you start to see things like this and and um [noise]\nThat that urban paddling gets a bad rap sometimes it's like oh who wants to paddle there I Want to be out on the woods with the birds are seeing and all that it's like yeah that's great but um you can't drive for hours up north Everytime you want to go out for a paddle\nChicago it's like kind of like the Grand Canyon except the kings are made out of you know pretty cool but it's really cool and and you see architecture you know you
