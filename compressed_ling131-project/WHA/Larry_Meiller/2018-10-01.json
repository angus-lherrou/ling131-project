I can get out ... nobody can get instills ... that that they have that same a system that are regular computer does so this is that Google Chrome or is it a lot of the full system around here too\nYeah I don't again unless it's you're disconnected\nThere's no one hundred percent you know being safe\n... apple systems don't typically get viruses but they're not one hundred percent immune um\nIt's it's just you know the tax come through a lot of them come through fishing\nWhich is to say you know a comes from your bank comes from your insurance company\nComes from somebody you know comes from a company you did business with says hey here's an envoys click on it\nYou know and you're like oh I didn't get an and voice I Wonder what this was about so then you click on it and then you find out you know was it was an envoys to take down your system so unless you you know the device that you're using is connected uh has protection\nYou know you're not completely safe and you know not to scare you but yes to scare you okay not pets you took down a company that employs eighty thousand people in two hours and\nSo if it always pays to be careful whoever was in charge okay yeah it was a window seven set up okay and so you know they learn their lesson in a in a hard way\nBut who's to say that a Google's system does not getting infiltrated by backdoor who's to say Apple's you know really pristine operating system\nDoesn't get infiltrated by you know instead of some you know employee being really angry and pulling out a gun and doing the stuff that they've been doing decides you know what everybody that gets the next ... upgrade is going to get host\nYeah you know we don't have those kind of you know controls only people that are in high places in those companies that are trying to make sure that their assets are protected but again if you're not a disconnected from the Internet you never a hundred percent protected\nPerry go Nancy ... thanks thanks a lot not the most cheerful information you'll get today [laughter] but actually at a honest\nAnd you know as a Larry ... been talking about not being you know unless you're disconnected hundred percent safe we've been talking about that since the Internet really came into\nThe forefront have a we have thanks antsy pre she ate at Tony I'm Glad and it's your turn Hi Tony\nThanks for taking my call today um I have a program on my computer that Microsoft program and it listed as as the the house to host operating program there is a sub program to at called super fetch\n... apparently tries to guess what you're going to search on the computer my question is is there a way I can turn off the super fetch program because it's using like a hundred percent in my memory while it's Ronnie ...\nUm there's probably a reason why it's using a hundred percent memory there might be something running el else running in the background if you're going I Believe if you do a search on admin controls or you can probably look at turning that off\nThe site as I've gone to like cast manager and ... and task and gone to file location\nRight but it it was just at the house that doesn't give me the option for this sub program super fetch that's running in the ass vc host program\nYeah uh I Believe the ... the super fetches for the operating system to that's basically like indexed your system in looking for files a but there's something\nThere's some other\nIt's being action that is now made her yeah it's being made to run in that high speed you know a hundred percent mode because of something else it's prompting it to do that what have you tried clearing out ending up\nHave you tried cleaning up your registry at all\nYeah I've done everything I've done this and I've done this clean up said done everything but\nYou actually have tried to eliminate bad registry entries fight\nGas not\nOkay a utility that I've used there is a is called C. cleaner and you can use that to clean up the registry and see if that eliminates that you know from running a hundred percent of the time\nSome of those things that you see running or running as a function of the operating system and it's part of its due to your ... you know if you're connected to the Internet they're going to run in the background um and depending upon what software you using some of those things\nI'm so shutting 'em off may you know make your system actually worse even though it says it's yeah for senator your resources because when you go to use other programs they may be you know knocking edits door and saying hey I Need you to do this for me and yet it won't do it because it's not there\nSo I Would try you know eliminating bad registry entries first I Would then also clear up a temporary Internet files\nAnd uh maybe switch a Web ... your Web browser to a different one and you know see if your system performs better down there you go and keep things up to date and that's one thing I Want to talk a little bit about is keeping you know windows ten up to date we've had this tug of war Larry\nIn the past year because of some of their updates what I found helpful\nIs and I posted this also on the top of ah the um uh info star virus info center page and also in the top ten or links\nIs that I found it useful to go to the Microsoft catalog site\nAnd when they push out an update instead of having my system go and say hey I'm going to do an update and it's run in the background I actually go to the catalog I've done this go to the catalog site\nGrabbed the the update that I Need download that and then install it and see if it works if it doesn't ... if it doesn't if I have problems with it then I can and install it very quickly\nI don't have I don't I don't have to go through the pain to find out all my system is updated the next day wire things not working oh yeah it's another Microsoft Update that I got to deal with\nSo um you know go to their Microsoft catalog site and you know grab the update that you need and um I I just found that a lot easier to manage than just letting them push it out to me and sitting there waiting for my system to update and I'm Wondering if they're going to work at\nNight yeah there you go to Tony good luck thank you so much for calling appreciate your call a Lucas and walk on Iowa will go to you next Hi Lucas\nDoug ... thanks for taking my call sure\nI'm just got a question about um getting Internet access where we live we don't have Internet access were very rural and a very rugged area and uh we don't have a hard line for a telephone either so I guess we're looking at satellite Internet I just wondered is that the only option and\nAnd um what what is the speaker think about that\nAnd it's a little bit more robust it's a and I've actually communicated with them because they said hey you guys have a conflict with windows update and I had on install it across my entire network and I said that was not fun and they said oh we got that figure it out so I'm giving them another chance\nThe way I look at it but don't do it to me again [laughter] and make sure your communication with Microsoft is good I think is not it's not fun when you have done install it across an entire network\nVicki I Hope that helps a thank you so much for calling and Susan in Madison we'll turn to you know Hi Susan\nHi what can we do for you and thanks for the call sure\nYeah I Want to hear why and I asked about it and I drive to their computer shop Harris by by\nUm so you're talking about using secure wife find your home [noise]\nYeah like for instance that just seems like such a ... like an apple or should it be and more secure I find that it was like well\nI'm you know having a secure wife ... basically you know the uh the encryption when you log in and actually having a log and so if you've got a wife fight home that has that secure log and then your connection is secure\nOkay if you're\nYou know out and about\nIn a wife by where you didn't have to log in but you have access to it that's not a secure connection and there's a term that is given to that and it's called war driving where people drive around in neighborhoods with\nA laptop or a smart devise a tablet or whatever and they look and see if they can log into somebody's or tap into somebody's wife ... that's ... that's the term they've given his called war driving so if you have\nA wife why that's open or expose like that then it's not secure but if you log in with a password than it is secure and it's okay to use and\nSo you can use it at home\nAnd I recommend people turn off their wife by it or not and that and I\nAs long as ... as long as it's secure um there's no reason for you to turn to\nI fight for homes are typically not hacked into I'm not saying that that doesn't happen but if you leave it on secure you're more likely to have it hacked\nYeah there you go and thank you Susan appreciate the call and\nSarah and Nina your turn Hi Sarah [noise] I think they're taking like a sure thing what's on your mind\nI have an eight year old I Am now and it's running really really curious if you got the letter I repair or replace it and as I said I'm curious how about have to accept other photos I add on it [noise]\nOkay um so he said it was about eight years old right yeah so it's being\nThe operating system upgrade for that is is sunset it by apple in other words not allowing you to move forward to upgrade your operating system\nI'm usually the window for them I think is like five or six years I'm so you might have um you know I don't know the hard drive space on your system but maybe\nYou talk about photos if you're using a lot for photography and storing digital photos in accessing all of them\nAre you might have an issue where you're getting cramped on you know free hard drive space and all computers use what's called swap space where it's kind of like a a a chalkboard and the right to it so they need\nSo if your if your system has let's say a gigs of ram that that chalk board space on the computer is hard drive might be like sixteen gigs of ram so it's being used by the operating system just to function properly\nSo if you start bumping up against those kind of limits that's where things start to slow down\nSo you could try to you know take a look at what you have for hard drive space and see if that might be an issue in free up some space or in terms of moving your files you could just get a you know large thumb drive or an external hard drive\n'em and hook it up to your USB port and copy the files that way and I would hope that you're using something for a time machine to do your back ups 'cause that's another\nYou know form of a backing up apple systems is time machine and I use that on a regular basis and it's great because\nIt tells you the date and time of the backup and you can drill down to it and you could see every single file that's backed up on your system you can pick ones that you want backed up and you can eliminate you know exclude ones that you don't want backed up\nThere then and then as I have I have a ... that's a couple of years old\nI'm I think they're they work great if you you know you still like a you know want to stay that way you'll be pleasantly surprised with ah with especially with the screen of yeah you know the retina disgrace screened the displays or nice yeah yeah I'm\nJust saving looking at the screen savers are fun\n[laughter] I Hope that helps does that help you\nThat's wonderful thank you\nAll right good luck thanks a lot for calling peanut green can cuter
