that will be our focus\nWith our guests Bryan huddles when director of the plant disease diagnostic clinic in the department of plant pathology W Madison so take a look at what diseases Brian's been seeing a lot of this year and who will talk about how to clean up disease plants and of course\nAnswer all of your questions love to hear from you you can give us\nA call at one eight hundred six four to one two three four email us at ideas at WPRI dot org and if you've got a garden photo or maybe a picture of a disease plant you can send it\nIt W. P. R. dot org and Brian welcome back good to have you with it yeah thank you very glad to be here again while we recently been talking about um doing last fall clean up on the show as a matter of fact ah for winter interest and and so forth but\nUh I there's some things that we really should be cleaning up in the garden in the fall\nActually lots of things this year because in many areas of the state it was really a great season for a lot of plant diseases and most of the organisms that caused the problem survive in old plant debris that's died at during the fall\nAnd if you leave that they're an allow it to stay there in the spring you're just going to have a nice source of the pathogens to re infects your plants next year so if you don't want to do it in the fall because of\nWinter interest or make sure you do to clean up in the spring before the plant sleep out okay what were the main diseases this year that pretty much everything under the sun really dependent upon where you were in the state because we had some areas of the states were relatively dry for much of the season but here in the Madison area we seem to have rain pretty much every day or at least it seemed that way\nSo we were seeing all kinds of fungal leaf diseases bacterial diseases\nUm there was actually a new pathogen I'd never seen I knew of the pathogen from pictures I seen and we might bucket list to seek called a crystal Larry Ella\n'em and um what the heck that well his cousins zone eight we spot and it was very interesting the county extension agent in a marathon county sent me some photos of maple leaves them when I saw the symptoms I was\nPretty sure it was this particular fungus that was causing the problem and I basically told her send me a sample I Will do the diagnosis or freak accidents on my bucket list as the\nAnd interestingly the same day that sample came in and it was this um\nA particular fungus I also got a a grape sample that came in and I looked at it right after the maple and I saw the same sort of reproductive structures on the grape and I thought and cross contaminate samples that sure enough the pathogen goes to both host and so was separate the same disease on two different types of plants so\nI was pretty psyched and then we incubate it believes in moisture for a while in this particular pathogen\nAt the end it that way well okay okay okay okay I got like a white no ill tell where that\nThen yeah where did the leaves are brown up afterwards or did you just see kind of green leaves with white powder on the surface and wasn't on the upper surface of the leaf or the lower surface of the leaf\nIf a white powdery um coverage as well as a flower\nOkay it's probably pottery mildew and we had a relatively good season for that in certain areas ... tend to do better when we have somewhat dry conditions but really high humidity\nSo it's oftentimes a pretty cosmetic disease so I wouldn't worry too much about it unless you're seeing a lot of leaf browning associated with the motives we sometimes see that when we get powdery mildew on flocks are minard is\nBut I have not seen really severe powdery mildew on black eyed Susan so I Would be patient with it um if you can send\nThings around that particular plant open up the Airflow that oftentimes can reduce the humidity and you'll have fewer problems with powdery mildew there are some or fungicides options if you really want to go that route or we do have kind of a home remedy that we sometimes recommend it's based on some research out of Cornell University\nIt's a tablespoon and a half of baking soda\nAnd you can get off your kitchen shelf\nAnd then a tape of three tablespoons of a lightweight horticulture oil these are paraffin based oil's a and a mixed that in a gallon of water but you need to apply the this concoction before you see any symptoms to preventative treatment\nAnd that can sometimes get give you some control of powdered milk juice or it may simply be that we just had a great season for the disease I Would you may not want to treat next year see what happens and may be that the plan a look perfectly fine 'cause powdered bill news they're severely can vary from year to year\nHow their ego Wendy thank you so much for calling appreciate your call Bryan Adelson are against any director of the plant disease diagnostic clinic in the department of plant pathology at the W.

P. R. dot org and like us on Facebook at the ideas network\nZeroing in a bit on plant diseases here on the ideas network garden talk show Larry manner with my guest Brian Adelson director of the plant disease\nWe've got one open line yet at one eight hundred six four to one two three four email last year photos and our questions at ideas at W. P. R. dot org\nAnd speaking of our ... ideas network pay a page Jose e mail ... sent a picture of photo and he wonders if his fur is disease that tips are losing needles and that shows up pretty\nWell here um yeah my thought when I look at that as it might more likely be an insect problem there may have been some larvae and that we're feeding on those needles it could possibly be disease\nWhat's interesting is that it looks like the needles near the tip and also the bud looks pretty good from what I can tell from the photos so\nUm if it is a disease it was probably very much or um environment related so maybe a whip period last year when those needles got infected and then they've shut this year but again I Would get out there early next season and watch for any larvae that might be associated with the new or the last year's needles yeah I think you're right and\nWe'll take another call all league in rice lake turning to you know thanks for waiting what's on your mind\nShow I actually I just like you can also according to first get\nSo oh so how do you like to watch and also\nLike to swim there okay focused struggled pledge causing trouble\nYou know I'm not aware of any fungal pathogens that are moved around by honeybees but certainly there is a major bacterial pathogen that penny muse can move around and that's the one that causes ... light on apples and pears how when you have a tree that's infected with this organism typically in the spring\nThere will be cracks in the bark and then he gets his losing material that comes out and it's a combination of plant sap and bacterial cells\nAnd honeybees like to feed on that it's quite nutritious for them in in the process they get the bacterium on their bodies and then when they pollinate to actually drop the bacterium into the neck trees on the flowers and then it gets into the tips of the branches\nAnd you get this branch chip die back and that can be quite serious disease or for Apple's crab apples pairs a lot of other different types of ... plants as well\nSo that's an example where a honeybee can cause a pathogen but it's not fungal if you look at the other way around are there are other insects that can move from pathogens around yes indeed and kind of the classic examples\nOf two diseases where there are insects involves would be Dutch disease where there are bark beetles that will that particular fungus around the tunnel in to lay their eggs and if the tree happens to be infected they can pick up spores and then move that the pathogen from tree to tree\nAnd then also ... is another disease where the pathogen can be moved around by insects in particular sap beetles\nThat will visit the trees pick up the fungus and then\nIf you have an injured tree they're attracted to the wound and they'll drop the fungus off as they\nVisit the wound did did you mentioned molds I he he asked about molds intimate yeah molds are basically of fungi so I'm okay you know certainly they could be moving spores of these organisms around the question is whether or not they're actually disease causing organisms and again I I'm trying to dredge my memory of their any\nFungal pathogens that are moving\nOr it may very well be but there are none that popped into my mind is is I'm thinking here it's really that fire blight that's the classic example [noise] and that's bacterial\nOleg thank you so much for calling appreciate it as Sam in Madison it's your turn Hi Sam\nI buy it and Larry I'm I have a number of trees on my property at I lost a hand old too old well what should I expect a tree service it when they remove the data oak tree or prevent the spread to other treat area\nHow close are those trees together well my first question is do you know for sure that it's ... have you had the trees actually ousted for oh quilt\nHaven't had been tested by air right out and show it all the comments signs of of ... they died very quickly OK\nI'm that's certainly a possibility by due caution folks that before you jump to the conclusion that you have a quote that you get a test on 'em because there are other things that potentially can mimic oh quilts all want us to line chest that bore which is an insect pests that will come in on trees that are under stress and can in very short order kill those trees\nWe do have another fungal pathogen\nThat can cause issues are though it's usually a slower death um the pathogen has called our malaria\nAnd it's a mushroom producer it produces these really weird\nShoestring or ... like structures that grew out from an infected tree and kind of search for other routes systems too in fact um I Would suggest probably getting a confirmatory test or before you jump to that conclusion let's assume that it is oh quilt\nIf you have other red oaks or so red oaks or the ... one of the oaks with kind of pointed Loeb leaves you have other pointed Loeb oaks in your yard those trees could be re crafted\nAnd so once the local fungus gets into one tree can actually move from tree to tree via ... craft\nNow there are also what's called the wider group of folks which have the rounded lobes those tend to pretty frequently ... as well you can occasionally get ... between the pointed loads and the rounded loathed um oaks as well so you could get some transmission between both of those those are a little bit less common\nAh but you could have trees that are already infected in your yard that just aren't showing symptoms right now and ... question about how far away the trees are now that will determine whether or not there Rick crafted so how large a property do you have and how close to the trees\nAre a lot about two acres adding um they're all fairly forests grown though they're they're pretty close up I'd assume that there'd be a craft I don't know if I tried to around that would help ...\nAnd I'm happy to talk to your phone if you want to send me photos or we don't charge for that so you can send me photos I may not be able to diagnose a lot from a photo but that's certainly a place to start\nAnd again I just see this box with light is getting progressively worse here in this state it's not going to go away\nAnd uh if you want to see some scary photos just do a search on box with blight ... put it in a state on the east coast Maryland for example\nYou know see these properties that are just loaded with foxwoods that are all basically dead for a boy and I did a program at over gardens this year and I was shocked at how many box which they have there and they're just going to have to think about probably replacing some of those eventually as well [noise]\nThere you go just thank you so much for calling appreciate your call I I Want to give done an apple two and a chance to join in done hello to you\nOne way or you can improve ... tissue fertilizer trees and fertilizer in the late\n... well you know I I wouldn't I wouldn't fertilize a I usually don't recommend fertilizing trees and shrubs unless you have a soil test that says that they need to be fertilized\nSo and definitely I Would never fertilize late in the fall because what you oftentimes Dubai fertilizing particularly with nitrogen is you keep the trees physiologically active so they don't harden off properly for the fall and you can make them more prone to winter injury\nSo I I Do not do that and that at all my own wrinkly and quite frankly don't necessarily think that you would probably need to fertilize folks or other trees period\nParticularly in a forested area yeah for sure you might want to send a letter to the editor you ask them where they got that information 'cause that's a very very odd recommendation in my mind yeah it's it it is indeed Don thank you so much for calling appreciated and please do send a note to the editor of about that because\nYou don't want people doing that for sure I served in Greenfield it's your turn high\n[noise] or a gentleman I'm taking my call\nI'm ... and my question we have an indoor and as a two part question I Hope I'm a lemon tree that it looked\nInto that and we ate from those delicious ... it's a smoke inside\nAnd I'm a last year and many last fall and this fold it did not there in your food\nWe took it outside in the summertime it doesn't look to have\nSupport for WPRI comes from the Ashland chamber of commerce Ashland county has more than twenty five large outdoor murals painted on buildings throughout the county mural information and fall color updates are available at visit ... dot com\nBoom I'm enlarged the pot at all\nYeah we did we did I understand you have to remember before I'm your daughter called apply me with just\nYeah [laughter] [laughter]\nOkay and uh uh we we ... we we we put it in a bigger pot um at one point it has and the default it a little less time as a um ... what it looks like some kind of vigil on on the leaves\nAnd now we can put down totally a and I'm a girl that and as I said it looks like healthy leave\n'em but uh nothing no blooming were were\nWere were you fertilizing it at all\nI did all of the month and a half ago I'm One of those like medical uh um socialized er and then he was actually a little bit less than that of commended amount um\nOh that's probably a good ... less fertilizers probably\nUm maybe better in your circumstance if if the if it's really fertile it's possible that's why it's not producing\nFruit you get leaves instead of flowers and also I'm Wondering if the pruning you proved off the bugs that may have turned off the flower buds\nUm well I mean we're trying to get rid of whatever that was technically that ... uh and uh and he did it go more uh ... branches and you leave and so forth so\nSo I I Would and you did that this past year so right\nI Would I Would hold on and it's good and healthy or get it inside or put it on some girl lights maybe if you can that's what I Do with why Amy\nAnd I'm I'm willing to bet\nThat you're going to get some flowers or if you're going to get some more lemons again it may just have ... it may just take a year given the pruning had to do\nPushing ahead on the granite which are again in the past\nIt did bloom and you get those little tiny or you know it's just that but I I'm trying to enjoy it and then they all fall down and and right now it's the old it's Lee ... and this is we bought it and again a couple of weeks ago because it started getting\nA little bit colder at night and a and right now it's just I'm hardly any he's on it\nYeah that's probably a a function of light or when you bring it into the house you're you're losing a lot of light and it's very common for a plan to lose their Foley edge\nFor a while now this one this a pomegranate may come back uh but you need to give it as much light as you possibly can\nUh that that\nI wouldn't worry too much about it frankly I I think and maybe I'm wrong you Brian do you have anything that\nOftentimes I'm not that familiar with pomegranate but again I've heard of other types of plants where they've been grown up outdoors and then you bring them in and that because of the change of environment they tend to shed leaves but it's just a matter of being a patient until they are relief yeah yeah there you go so hang onto it [laughter] I sit there\nHopefully you're going to get some uh lemons and hopefully your pomegranate ... plan is going to come back\nToday Brian Adelson director of the plant disease diagnostic clinic at the top of your Madison within the department of plant pathology I'm Larry Miller regarding talk here on the ideas

C.\nThere we go now we will turn to sue in Appleton sue hello\nLarry and Brian thanks for being available to us sure um I have a shape our kick retreat and all this summer summer is get rid of it had like a quarter inch brown spots in between ...\nAnd only looked a little bit Claire attic strapped to leave early okay\nI I had no clue what's going on my other one that good\nIt could be a fungal leaf spotted some kind and sometimes trees will vary in terms of their susceptibility their plants are kind of like people well some of us get more diseases and other than others and trees can be the same way if it is a leaf spot of some kind good fall clean up is what I normally recommend\nAnd then the other thing you might want to consider would be uh doing a ... nutrient test and see whether or not there may be some fertility issues associated with that particular tree that you need to deal with and that can be done through or you W soil analysis lab which is up in a ...\nMy neck of the woods down here in the Madison area in southern Wisconsin here farther north in the area where the girl a lot of potatoes you could be seeing early blight yeah slightly different fungus that causes that disease\nThe reason you see more of that a little farther north is because that particular fungus will in fact both tomatoes and potatoes that are ready source of that fungus sand the Steven's point area where they have a lot of potato production but they both in fact the lower leaves where it's a little wetter\nAnd then they'll work their way up to fully the plants and usually leave some fruit that are on blemish but usually get a reduction in yield and also the fruits tend to be a little bit smaller\nIn terms of why we're seeing more but I think more people are probably growing tomatoes that are more of these fungi out and about in the environment\nAnd so it's hard to get away from them we've also had some relatively wet growing seasons recently in some areas of the state and that will certainly make these diseases more prevalent what are the plants are for a longer period of time the more likely these fungi are going to cause\nProblems and our typical recommendations are good fall clean up\nA rotation some move your tomatoes to a different area in your garden next year that's not a great management strategy for these diseases because this worse than to blow around a lot but we always recommend rotation just to prevent a wide range of other diseases\nOr you can certainly select resistant varieties although sometimes the flavor of the fruit of those resistant variety is is not that great\nThe big thing culturally is good plans facing so Spain our plants are far and clumsy together my recommendation is when you have full sized plants you don't want any of the foliage to overlap you went good air flows if the leaves get what they dry quickly\nAnd then judicious turning print off some of those lower leads cut out the suckers to open up the canopy and a lot better air flow\nUnderneath the plants I Would also mulch over the area where you had tomatoes and potatoes last year because you're just trying to block any sports that are being produced a little bits of old debris in the soil from getting into the air to blow around\nAnd then if you're absolutely desperate there are fungicides treatments but at that point if you think you need to do that my sister's out of your local farmers market and buy some tomatoes\nI grow my tomatoes in straw bale so and that can be successful um but I Would not reuse the straw bells on more than one year because that can be a source if you get all those old leaves me get a little the disease it hangs out in the straw than if we replant your new plants are going to get infected [noise]\nYou can join into eight hundred six four to one two three four we may have time for you Harold in Burnham went up next to Harold Hi\nGood morning or good afternoon [noise] um I got\nThat part of it for over a regarding that people would just show apple trees I got the idea of [noise] a generally collectors ... W O Twenty years ago was doing grafting things instead of just one of the ... tribe begging your apples and what I get time to get\nA fair amount of really good success and I'm just wondering if there's a bit more\nTo it and what are you doing I'm just using a sandwich bags cutting off the audience to corners and stimulate on with um [noise] I get a box of fifty or a hundred I get some really nice apples yeah\nYeah and I'm betting that person you got this from a stop to that much because that grabbing stuff enough yeah\nYeah he's a long gone unfortunately we did a lot of great work with apples and other types of fruit trees and yeah I think bagging can be very very useful I think probably with plastic bags to be useful for Disease Control but I think that the biggest impact is probably for insect control quite frankly\nHave to be a little bit of careful if you've got a plastic bag you could get a lot of moisture trapped in there and then you could potentially if you do get pathogens in there they could go really wild\nUm but if you're having good success doing that my suggestion is keep on doing that I can tell you everything under the sun that I think will work nothing is really better than success in hand so of having it it works for you continue to do in\nThe midst Bob told me she was a regular guest on this program and a great guy yeah I knew him for years [noise] thanks Harold Dennis into rivers your turn I Dennis\nOkay I just heard the voice not to reuse strong delve yes yeah my question is what should we do with the strong bills after we use it for a year can you compost okay so that's not going to cause any transference\nNow what I Would do if you do good hot composting where your heating up the pile and turning it regularly to get that straw to decay from a disease standpoint I wouldn't expect anything that would likely be in there from typical vegetable gardening or to cause a problem if you reduce that material as long as it's completely compost and\nI didn't see I you know if I don't see any disease and the plants that I used to like this year what I did was I put all of the straw in a big pile and then I got my seat potatoes and I threw the seed potato ...\nThrough amend the bile and now I've got potatoes yeah\nYeah the the real issue is how much disease you have in what's growing on there and that's the same thing for whenever you're growing in a regular gardens sending as well if you don't have a lot of disease in your plants you're you don't have anything to carry over but in general we recommend kind of recycling this material if you can buy composting\nJessica ... thank you for calling\nHim that question I had to put that God what a\nUm and we had recently saw a driveway and was asked and I'm about two years later I'm at spring I noticed that part of the tree where it's like the ... old\nBut then I forget the name of that the blight tours of the goals that whole golden tanker that's right a beautiful thinker tree yeah and\nUm it didn't leave out and I basically just set the out I Try to do to remedy is with different soaps and other things that that would just have a joke I think yeah I Know I had other dogs that are kind of\nPart of this and that are like ... feet tall and in that same area and I'm Wondering if I should try to like cross like anger or what I Do\nYeah we usually see a lot of ... of golden concurrence would go to the dog would win the trees are under a lot of stress of the planet in an open area rather than in shade which is their natural habitat if they're drought stressed are probably the construction of your driveway stress the trees as well\nUm that will predispose them to getting infected by this fungus the causes again a very beautiful looking disease but it's a very good for your tree\nUm if these other dogwoods or in a shaded environment you're giving them good water your mulching them properly then I Would say probably won't have a lot of problems I Would simply monitor if you can catch the golden tanker early enough you can actually printed out for him down about four inches\nBelow where you see that gold color and then just infest your tools Seventy percent alcohol for thirty seconds I'm is a good way to do that as a dip\nThere you go thank you so much I Want to go back to that Twitter account you were talking about your Halloween though you've got to host Dr death Halloween is and I I I put up my my three favorite creepy crawly diseases so there's that girl saw fraud are malaria roots disease and a commencement of corn\nSo you can read a little bit on that if you'd like to a ... you can eat that if you catch it early enough if you let a spoil it it's not very tasty at all but yeah you may have heard of it as we look coach Jae which is a very common delicacy particularly\nIn Mexico and cook it uh and and that account again to get to that\nYou W.
