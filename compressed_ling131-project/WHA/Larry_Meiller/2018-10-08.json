W. Madison College of engineering we're looking good to have you here to thank you for joining us thank you I'm Glad to be here\nSo as you listen into these two experts what's on your mind about nuclear energy what do you want to know about nuclear research may be going out at you W\nCurious about nuclear reactors what's good joining give us a call the number one eight hundred six four to one two three four or you can email us at ideas at W. P. R. dot org\nYou know and we talk about nuclear energy were uh [noise] I think the mind goes quickly to nuclear reactors\nIs there more to nuclear energy than reactors a relative who you want to comment on that\nWe that that that answering that question is similar to answering the question about it they're more the chemistry now um that that we know that matter um\nThat Adams they're made out of nuclei in electrons and chemistry has to do with what electron do and nuclear technology has to do with what the ... the protons and neutrons to 'em and so why ignore half of when that is made up\nUm so yes we we um nuclear technology um has to do with pets implications and agriculture and industrial processes and food and nutrition and water and health\nAnd medicine and energy um for example I'm\nA pest management for the virus um has 'em using nuclear technology um\nBreast feeding education I'm across the world using nuclear technology ... I'm ... really quite a broader range of of applications that touch all of our lives\nThe president recently signed the nuclear energy innovations capabilities act I think I've got that title a correct It's expected to speed up\nDevelopment of advanced reactors or what Mike ... by the water a day of the reactors and how do they differ from traditional ones in\nWell I I'll ask of removing it helps and she's an expert in that area but I'm currently we have about Ninety nine reactors in the United states all light water reactors they called white water because it's cooled by ordinary water\nSupport also comes from the Wisconsin Historical Society with the James Madison lecture series investigating Thomas Jefferson's ideas about higher education in Madison and Milwaukee in early October more is that Wisconsin history dot org\nYou are listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

W. Madison great to have them along can you can join his at one eight hundred six\nFour to one two three four email has that ideas that WPRI dot org\nOr John in Bay feel county we will turn to you next Jon thanks for waiting what's on your mind\nWell I I was just going to make some observations I'm really glad to hear you are are in the program a nuclear engineers I'm just as a bit of background I Am a electrical engineer and ... nothing to do the other\nI have a solar powered house that I built a busted inland power so I'm not anti knowable at all but I think that the need for nuclear power is going to make any progress for warming\nIssues grossly under status and understood of society and I have all the praise and University of Wisconsin is doing on the program that's great\nBut unfortunately a lot of the University of Wisconsin so loaded up with people that really it just all your programs like this and I think it's something that was a big family in her city\nTo support of reach in the real information on this is how how long long overdue and I'm really happy to sit around and I think the idea of\nYou know solve molten salt reactors and use the waste fuel to generate huge amounts more electricity that was it a little bit um there's there's so many advantages here I'm ... [noise]\nAll right thank you very much for calling John appreciate the comments um [noise] uh do you want to go ahead ...\nI I absolutely agree that we need to realize how pressing that climate change challenge the global the global warming challenge isn't and when you realize that we need all of the options we can use including nuclear\nUm and um [noise]\nAnd I think to to make that happen nuclear technology needs to meet the needs of the current market and to be economically competitive and\nUm and at the University of Wisconsin we have quite a bit of interface would start up companies that work on commercial ... new nuclear technology that can be comical competitive and most importantly that can be deployed as quickly as possible because\nI knew a nuclear reactor that that's going to be really too late we need to deploy a new technology that's commercially competitive as as soon as possible and that is that is putting\nDown and say you're working with many\nCompanies we work with several companies that um my area of research isn't ... um and sold cooled reactors and uh we interface would start up companies that look to commercialize\nThis technology and on our end we push the science to uh to help them to help accelerate the commercialization\nUm and then on there and they teach us about what are their most challenging turning technical hurdles and how can we help them um accelerate\nNow interesting ... do you think we're Mike do you think we're falling behind staying abreast of moving forward ... you mean as a nation yeah\nWell I think that um I mean from the standpoint of of of magnitude were still the largest users of of nuclear energy for electricity production I think we will ... started the whole thing off very well by pointing out we have things in medicine\nIn his charity that nuclear is is the technology is used for but you do see a around the world that the two countries which are actively engaging actually a number of countries but the ones that you see are China and Russia are offering the technology broad broadly around the world\nOr the Koreans the south Koreans have been quite successful recently and what they've offered to uh countries in the middle east where they're building plans for the UAE he\nBut uh I think we have to maintain our\nOur activity in the areas we're going to lose our influence and part of that influence goes beyond just electricity goes into security goes into a maintaining a peaceful\nWorld yeah and that that I think translates into continuing to invest in the technology\nNow there we go thanks for that comment that Mike in Warsaw it's your turn a what's on your mind [noise]\nJak program on\nFire are really going to get it as well I I was I felt\nLike I don't watch it\nAll up at five after that\nYeah that would act [noise]\nAll right ... ... I'll I'll start with the first one I think religion can handle the second one so I um this is Mike ... made the comment on Mike I the one piece of information that was news to me as of about two days ago is that the union of Concerned Scientists which has historically been\nQuite against nuclear energy has just come out with a new study and release their findings that without nuclear power the ability to have ... deep deep carbon position in the world is essentially not going to be met which is a tremendous change in opinion I'm\nHistorically ever since I was in school which was a while ago I won't say how long\nThe union of Concerned Scientists was quite a against nuclear power as a as a source of electricity or as a source of of energy and they've changed that primarily because they see the inability to continue to fight\nA global emissions and C. O. two missions in particular so that's that's one big change from a quite a while\nGroup yeah red looking and I'll go back to the conversation and we had earlier but communication I think\nThink it's unfortunate that the conversation about nuclear tends to be so polarizing nuclear or no nuclear I think the conversation should be more around\nWhat kind of nuclear and what are the expectations of nuclear energy because there's a there's an enormous range of technology options in terms of nuclear technology there's not one kind of reactor on one kind of plant\nUm there's a range and so I think that uh the outcome of\nA future of nuclear industry I'm being impacted by this conversation um it it would be most\nBeneficial if the environmental movement engaged with nuclear technology to said this is what we would like to see of nuclear and that and if it Nicholas excess would be following points then and we think this is it's fun to technology rather than being sort of black and white we don't like the word nuclear and therefore will push it out on principle\nAnd yeah you were talking about the different types of reactors that went about their I've heard about small or even Mike Rowe reactors what are they in good they become a reality\nWell so those are kind of definitions of of all the technologies that very Luca went through when they call it when they used the terminology small they're assuming I ... I think they mean\nA small power output something similar to maybe a it was all you want to use an example he won he was approximately six hundred megawatts electric\nA small modular reactor is considered something that's about half or a attempted that's OK okay so smaller and smaller module or a smaller component which have many modules together on the site\nThe new terminology that now is being used micro reactor is interesting because in fact just than ... twenty Nineteen defense appropriations bill was passed\nAnd they put in there a section in which is asking the um the defense department to consider for remote sites off the grid or away from major cities to essentially have a stable secure power source of a small reactor and now we're talking small\nIs about a hundred times smaller than cue wanting so instead of six hundred megawatts electric like six megawatts which would run a small community for example out in the mining areas of northern Canada\nHe'll does what it is is the size of it but for different applications in different areas\nSo very interesting my faith you again for calling appreciate your call Joel Joey in Warren's Wisconsin let's go next Joey thank you for calling\nThe government is beginning to support and what where are we at the university I'm working on in terms of advanced manufacturing and ah and reactors advanced reactor that can be commercialized quickly\nFound if I might I'm the one thing that unfortunately we\nFell into in the United states is we lost our ability to build many things not just nuclear power plants\nIf we take a look at the same technology that's being built in Georgia which is called the um eighty one thousand plant\nIt's as the gentleman said on the phone is a cost overruns but at the same plant just went critical and is an operation to plaster critical an operation\nIn China same technology exactly and they were only about six months behind in their overall schedule worm years behind so I think part of it is historical use that we've lost her ability to build things in the last the supply chain\nSo that has to be reestablished and that's I think part of what ... was pointing out with smaller reactors advanced reactors though the hope is you can essentially it's a reestablished supply chain and they're much more of expeditious manner\nAnd to be a little bit more specific went under challenge with building a large nuclear reactor is this the civil infrastructure building the building building large concrete buildings\nAnd so we have to either me learn how to build those kinds of buildings on schedule hum or we have to me think was whether we really need those enormous concrete buildings um can we just build nuclear technology in a factory and ship it and\nPlug it in press go ... I said that's what we mean when we say advanced technology in advanced manufacturing its um me thinking what kind of construction needs to be done at the site but I'm probably both need to go hand in hand we need to learn how to build that the\nThat the ... and we need to um create a different types of plants that don't require that kind of complex um um civil structure management\nInteresting Bob thank you so much for calling appreciated and ah Joel Claire I think it's your turn let's go there Hi Joe\nHi say a earlier caller talked about waist and in your discussion you one of you mentioned the French reprocessing technique for a concentrated and reusing the fuel\nAnd with food fuel that we have now stored spent fuel ... the French technique the useful at all in saying that you know\nThe answer to your question Joe is yes we\nEarly because of costs it costs money to build the reprocessing plant and then to essentially recycled fuel as you said and we have a ... a very large amount of uranium both in the country and that we bring in from Canada and Australia so from a strictly economic standpoint gets an additional costs that current\nThe current ah technology has chosen to not not to the French the ... the ... the electricity market in it in Europe is quite different quite much more expensive that allows the French to have that capability or use that capability indifference to us why we have much lower electricity costs in the United states\nI Would assume that we'd be able to you know we've got it all sitting there at some point in time would we be able to pull it out and Henry\nIf we if we chose to the older spent fuel probably not a newer yes\nNow and then in terms of new reactor technologies weekend design them to facilitate that recycling of spent fuel for example ... reactors\nDirectly facilitate the separation of what is useful and they use you and what isn't ideas for New Year's fuel and um and to a practice that you might tell them in production which is called electro reduction said just that\nSo the new processes are are going to make life a lot easier when it comes to that correct yeah yeah what pollen whitewater thanks for calling\nSafe here I Want to just just fake in support of the safety of storage or my wife and I have a friend who currently is retired but lives in New York or excuse me Connecticut\nIt worked for approximately Twenty years I Believe on the nuclear storage projects in Sweden\nA matter of fact we were just in Scandinavia and we have the drive five part of our tour the facility that he helped to build an established and basically what I Would want to say is if they have had at that\nParticular facility absolutely no safety issues whatsoever in a operating that storage facility of is\n... ... if you will to me it was quite simply that there are clear storage is exceedingly safe and can be so uh yeah that's my part\nYeah Paul thanks for calling a red Luca\n... I I think that's absolutely true if you look at a hum operation of a waste repository within\nTen years Twenty years a hundred years two hundred years we have pretty high confidence that those facilities operate safely I think the debate is really around uh the millionaire operation had ... should we be putting material underground that we have to ensure will not\nContaminate civilizations that we can't even imagine a million years from now um I think that's the way that the debate is interesting and it it it goes in the realm of engineering ethics\n[noise] well I tell you what this was a enlightening a\nShow for me and I want to thank you both very much hopefully we can do this again down the road I think it'd be great good thank you that's a good conversation here\nMichael Korea dean a former director of the Wisconsin Energy Institute and professor emeritus of nuclear engineering he founded the Wisconsin Energy Institute in twenty six\nRelocate Scarlett is an assistant professor\nOf engineering physics in the U.

B. R. dot org love to hear from you [noise]\nUh so joined in Belinda email by the way to say she has built tele farm macular dystrophy how does that compare to macular degeneration a and R the side effects and outcome about the same\nAnd the talent farm macular dystrophy is different from a empty and generally milder so ... means yellow and we see a yellow deposit and the retina\nUs somewhat similar to AMD but it has a distinctive appearance you do need to see your retina specialist to have that diagnosed but generally it's milder with less chance of vision loss oh\nSo better news is or other treatments for it and so forth that can be done\nThe only treatment we would use is if there's believing it set up so we can use injections the same a medication we would use for what macular degeneration but otherwise we would just watch\n[noise] we have a call from ... in Port wing let's go there thank you for calling what's on your mind\nA flow I Am a visiting from Germany I live in Germany but my parents I was born in America\nAnd I will it's assisting a couple of people with macular degeneration and I know it evolved because both my parents have the disease and have had injections and nothing has helped and um the thing is I found in a book\nThat Dr Stanley be covert in the United states does in jak or I think he's dead already but he did injections with loot the own and it was causing immediate and significant improvements ah with macular degeneration\nUm he had he said that he doesn't know why it doesn't work in the world for him but the injections do and I'm I'm just reading that funny how the procedure works at the giants quite simple we purchase intravenous fluid that the all from the ...\nI really want to try to help her as much as I can she probably has like um I think she said she has to start a cataract things like that is they're things that they might be able to do beyond\nHelping the macular degeneration that might help her vision\nYes also\nOh and also a sorry third time I I heard that there was like a macular degeneration study on children that had at that was like Ninety nine percent positive when they replaced it with themselves so I I was just concerned are wondering about that ...\n... two things I think you brought up on is what can we do about other conditions in the eye definitely we want to treat the call call mom we want to prevent any vision loss from Oklahoma and generally eye drops can really help in that regard\nAnd then cataracts cataract surgery may need to be done when the cataract is more severe it's everything gets cloudy it's kind of like looking through a dirty windshield so that can help but your mother still may be left with central vision problems\nThe study are referring to in children are most likely refers to a genetic treatment these are children that were blind from a specific genetic disease one dizzy one gene\nAnd there has been a treatment with gene therapy injecting cells under the ... not that carry the new gene healthy gene that can restore vision so unfortunately not related to am deep but really exciting news for those kids\nYou know for sure and the the stem cell research you talked about stem cell research earlier but you're my mother just exist\nProgram within the university and specifically in our department to work on building stem cells\nFor replacements so of course we'd like to avoid getting to the stage of needing new cells but for patients who have lost the center of their vision and this is a a hopeful future option where stem cells again from the patient's own cells can be built a\nTo replace the retina it's a complicated structure of the retina But Dave camp has really done a and his team has done a lot to bring that forward\nAnd Aaron thank you again Robert in Milwaukee your turn thank you for calling\nSeth I'm I'm a big believer in preventive medicine I tried to do that in my life and you mentioned that kicking the supplements were speaking about when people develop the disease\nPre op before it happens it doesn't help how could you substantiate that to you know to help the listeners appreciate that\nYes in this study a large and I study looking at\nThese supplements ... one thousand patients had no macular degeneration so there were the same age as those that have the macular degeneration one thousand patients with no macular degeneration were also given the supplements\nAnd over seven years that it didn't change now you could say what about a lifetime and we don't have that information the lifetime of that patient but over several years with very close to follow up\nThere was no change in the risk of developing the macular degeneration it helped the patients that had macular degeneration prevent them from getting to the end stage\n... interesting Thanks Robert appreciate that question a Carol in Janesville your turn Hi Carol\nFellow thank you uh about six or eight months ago I was diagnosed with central cherished Retton apathy\nAnd the doctor said that it might go away I'm just to keep doing my normal thing and I still having trouble feeding and I wondered if is there anything else I can do I do take a vitamin\nAnd that Dr also said that perhaps they could do\n'em laser surgery but I might wind up with a a blank bat or red black spot and he also mentioned that this is the condition that usually effects very young men rather than a woman in her seventies ...\nThank you for calling Carol a doctor ... what do you think\nIt it is a condition that typically affects younger people but it can it can happen at any age and is typically agree\nWith the doctor typically resolves on its own so over months uh this condition will get better if it doesn't we do have a cold loser treatment and by cold we're not using the laser to caught her eyes were using the laser to sort of speed up the\nThe resolution of fluid so the laser treatment kind of speeds up the tissue under the retina to pump out fluid and so you may be a candidate for that cold loser treatment called photo dynamic therapy\nAlright dynamic photo dynamic okay All right good luck question him I think very much for the
