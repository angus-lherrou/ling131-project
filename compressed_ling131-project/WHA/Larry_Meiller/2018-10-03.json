P. R. dot org and we\nAlways love to see those photos well\nI have not had a problem I you know this house I've lived in the house now for seven years and I have yet to have my first mouse\nWhich is\nI'm not going to get the knock on some would um\nHowever I was talking to some other people who will remain nameless or who have said that they have already had mice come into their house\nOf this fall season so what's the best way to keep them out of the house\nWell with the onset of some cooler weather um it is an absolutely perfect time to be doing some preventative measures to keep small small animals from getting into your home so\nOne very important role here you know if you're trapping those mice or squirrels and your attic and releasing them you're going to continue to have the ... have a problem so you're going to continue to have problems and animals entering your home until you take the time to properly seal off\nFirst of all ... and then seal off all the entries possible entry points so now is the perfect time to be walking around the exterior of your home and looking for holes or cracks pain ... special a special attention to the ease the facial board and flash means and any places where you have damp would\nThat should really be replaced as well it's a it harbors insects um which can then encourage other animals um to come after those insects so\nThe other one I've heard was found ... but ... be careful about that that um engine generator you\nWell that's why they're probably telling people to put them in their glove box yea how is that John out then I won't get any mice in your blood but [laughter]\nBut that's because they can't open the box thinking over the ... box they probably have been there even with the soap oh boy thanks very appreciate the call Joel in ah like I don't\nKnow what's on your right or you might have just covered it I don't know but I'm In the process of trying a botanical road trip with that comes in packets like strong fine\nAnd I had some success for him for like three days and I'm getting from the trips right now put any faith and so this is a\nJob this is I'm I'm assuming they are supposed\nTo be an odor repellent not that that they're not that they're necessarily biting into the packets right yeah so yeah so older repellents\nUm are are more hit or miss than our contact or taster Palin's for a variety of reasons but number one um depending on where it is you know that animal is most likely approaching it from up wind at some point and so anything up wind that is not going to be as effective as if as if it is down wind\nUm a lot of times if you get some kind of precipitation that can at least a mute if not altogether or erase the odor that's coming out of that\nAnd um and generally uh animals you know especially in a in a urban type environment think about how many a human oriented smells these animals are exposed to every single day\nAnd the idea behind a some of these other Republicans is to try to give them something as foreign to them that that kind of catches them off guard or makes it a little leery about being there and\nIt's just such a hit or miss type issue so I think depending on what you're trying to do what what kind of damage and trying to stop 'em that most likely the most effective um an effective management tool if you're not opposed to a trapping them is the trap them and you're a kill trap\nBut there are certainly live traps out there as well if if you're not um if you're if you're ethics are not in line with killing\nIs wrong by may trip [laughter] I Would\nJust get some I Would get some you know would based a mousetrap spade with peanut butter as it sounds like you're doing that already and and I would I not with the more money on the botanical wrote a repellent\n... they are the other thing that struck me about that job to was the the fact okay it they avoided it for like three days the set was probably stronger those first few days and then they realize that there wasn't any big red and ...\nAnd a lot of dissent based or Palin's work okay or if they're going to work they're going to work in a confined area so when the ... but when you get to an open environment that now that centers really dissipated\nKeep dropping Joel thanks a lot for calling ... that\nThey have in Glendale will get you in just a minute but just to remind or do you were talking about all things wildlife we've certainly zeroed in on the road this but we can take either questions as well with our two guests David Drake and Jamie knack for him you W extension and the

P. R. dot org that's our email address [noise]\nBack to the phones days in greenvale here ... Hi Dave thank you for allowing way\nBack in my car I just had a question um I built a place in northern Wisconsin the heating and cooling people said not to put caps on because they would they would stop\nA and then get blocked and because the winters are cold up there in the in the water comes out it's that cold air I just wondered if there's an alternative to that and and\nJust as a as a side I've got a modern\nSystem up there with him take them out and about two years ago we turned on the east and it didn't work we called him over and in the cage to flying squirrels that fall down there and blocked it so the first and then there were two two bedroom\nFlying squirrels in the in the ... once you clear that it was\nDo you use this all year round so you have heat on all year round up there Dave\nWe we keep it hit it a little bit lower when we're not there but yeah we keep the heat\nOn all yeah then it's just that it shouldn't ... no it shouldn't and the type of too many caps you know the ones I'm most familiar with as they have some kind of cross hatched a metal um screened material but there's usually about an inch or so gap in between the cross hatching and so that should provide enough air flow um that it shouldn't frost up\nAs well and for your intake so if you take some harbor clauses Jamie mentioned the front of the show\nAnd just um secure that over your intake so that should prevent anything from coming in and and those are those flying squirrels are also capping nesters so that's why they're looking at that intake because of it the diameter of that are kinda fits perfect fit for what they did so she had with the natural cavity so no I think you should be okay with Jimmy caps and and um\nIt it definitely has a a better prevention than having raccoons rather live in ... Jimmy\n... what kind of caught for that\nThat's also like screen yeah hardware hardware class like what'd you gotten your screen yeah yeah and it was something like that you know\nYou just want to make sure that whatever mesh size you use that as long as I'm Sorry the mesh size of small enough to keep out the animals you're trying to prevent from coming into the intake valve or wherever they are trying to get into your house so however cloth is usually about a quarter inch mesh size that's why we recommended\nBut sometimes screen material um can be a fine and other than to fight and it doesn't allow the Airflow depending on what the situation is and chicken wire also can work as long as the the um ... and the chicken wire is not so large that allows mice and things like that to come in\nAll right there you go thanks they appreciate it was the other day this one in Waukesha hello they have\nA question you were talking about will tell us before a barn store in the show and raccoons and they're always dies or anything you can do a Ella was on the lights on or anything to keep the raccoons\nI've tried trapping more than a girl but they're just go\nDay that's a great question and I certainly am sympathetic to the situation I realize some of those old buildings are really hard to completely seal off um I Will tell you if you make the effort to try to seal off\nAny openings cracks repair you know repair areas it'd be well worth your effort because it prevents them from coming in and the first place um that being said you can continue to trap and a remove those animals but it's a great habitat you're going to probably have more come in\nUm folks that have a situation where they've had raccoons dining in an attic in a home has had some success being able to put on lights and blaring or radio to make it uncomfortable enough that the mothers relocated her young um\nWhether that is\nEnough of a measure to deter you know it's a balance for the raccoon on how great that habitat is and and that location and what they're willing to tolerate for a disturbance so\nI'm the only other thing I Would say I'm sure it's there for for the dining purposes but if there's any type of food or other attractions in the building to remove those or um concealed hammers fill them up in a in a different manner but\nAgain proof you know trying to add add some more material or um block the entry points to the barn would be your best bet\n... the other thing I mentioned quickly Dave is if you're not interested in the trap and if you go to Wisconsin ... association\nThere are ... are either in Waukesha county or in neighboring counties that would be interested in uh having access to a for resource like raccoons that would come out and trap for you I'm In exchange for that for weeks or so or they would obviously be most interested uh during the the trapping season when the first primary in during the winter\nSo you might want to look at that ... that website Wisconsin trapping associations if somebody can help you trap as well\nThere you go thanks so much for calling tied in Delaware and would like to know if humming birds are now gone from South eastern Wisconsin there is some later rose some late relievers yet or J. yeah I think\nWell see that's not a whole it's a depressing okay that that the Berlin has caused the the soil to think\nAnd so the the the depression is probably about ten to twelve inches the than maybe Eighteen to two feet wide and and the um the ... that it doesn't seem that the ...\nThe infiltrators septic system the tiles for you know where all the water goes is Seventeen years old and she said it'd be very unusual for that to be collapsing you know\nAfter Seventeen years initially you know if you start first put in you might have some ... you know think age but not in this case and so that's why I thought it was probably ... to see if we don't see any any\nExit holes on the top of the soil it's just all this going underneath and when we were the other way it looks like there was something digging but it looked too small for I'm like what Chuck\nYeah yeah well the new one one thought would be that you know this might be damage that occurred\nAt another point in time and it's it's ... now but the damage in the animal has moved on so I think I'd be tempted to fill that area in and then pay attention to it so once a week take a walk over there and er when you mow the lawn you pay attention to that area so\nAgain with malls I'm the methods for removing them as either um trapping them with a specialized trap that deploys below ground and kills them or using a toxic bait\n'em are usually the common methods in order for those to be effective we need to be able to find the tunnels and they need to be kind of in the in the surface area that you can get access to the malls\nI I think it's more instead of malls from the description I think it's something more to Berlin rodent like groundhog or\nChipmunk researching like rounds grow because those animals actually have a borough system where they'll have a boat erode rooms or or areas of the kind of congregate in and they store food\nA mall has more of a straight line tunnel system and it doesn't sound like a total system would create that size of a depressed show I mean I I think that if you either was a groundhog or a ...\nAnd like Jamie so it sounds like it may have been passed damage and just now does it finally the uh the the substance or a of that area has finally collapsed yeah\nGood luck thanks so fill those holes in those depressions in and then see what happens to thank you for calling Mary in lady Smith let's go to you next time Mary\nWhat's on your mind oh okay I have backyard chickens and this July eighth\nThat hasn't emails showed up and she said all summer and I'm now she won't go in the house with a chicken she says outside ... make it through the winter\nThat's a good question so they're an exotic um species to Wisconsin so they're from China and a variety of different strains\nThey are part of a putting take 'em pheasant hunting program in the state where birds are raised and then stocked and there was also um a lot of experimentation with developing a suitable habitat\nAnd being able to have native reproducing populations um are not native but like a naturally reproducing populations of wild presence on the landscape that's been a bit challenging with um the lack of conservation reserve program habitat\nFor the birds um more fragmentation predator issues lots of issues that it's been difficult to have a naturally recurring pheasant population that being said where I Am in Columbia county the property that were adjacent to we do see wild birds year round um that are so it's possible\nBut it it they really needs to be a quality habitat and mostly not just food but also hiding cover escape cover from predators so depending on your surrounding area she you know she may very well stand a chance to survive the winter and\nNow she's got a vigil waited to the feed those from the sound of it so that could create a problem for if there is no natural food supply in the winter like\nFeed the chicken but what what I'm trying to think or should I filled her like a little shelter of some sort or catcher in the for the chickens are out all day during the summer\nWell because there's still a wild animal managed by the department of natural resources you you really cannot legally take control of that animal or bill or you know kind of possess it without a permit um\nSo I wouldn't encourage you to go beyond feeding a or to go beyond by building the structure or something like that if it occasionally feeds on spilled seat at a at a bird feeder or something like that in kind of incidentally\nI think that's you know if that's fine but I wouldn't go out of out of your way what it does is it creates dependency on you and if you keep those chickens up during the cold spell in the winter and forget to put food out um it just keeps it relied on natural uh covering food\nVilla consideration Mary's I'm not sure what you do to knock your chickens but obviously the president be wild bird is going to be exposed to different diseases and perhaps your chicken is and the more the pheasant mingled with your chickens there is a potential for disease transmission between the two species homes\nSo probably things to think about their very thanks a lot for calling appreciate your call David Drake and Jamie neck from University of Wisconsin extension of the department of forest

R. dot org there you go let's take a call Lynn in Bay view it's your turn I live\nI thank you for taking my call her what can we do for you I have to think when it's a question and one that's a comment of course my quest and I live near Humboldt park which is a rather large lose\nIt draws lots of different species in coming and going and coming springing going in the fall and in September three ... an adult female and chew juveniles 'em and they stayed in aid and said they might still be here it rained yesterday that check it out but um\nI was wondering if they have time to migrate to wherever they go\nYeah yeah it was a nice photo and they said journal the Wisconsin state journal this morning of a ... where they think the Boot Hill and it okay well yeah nice yeah so um that's a double cross the current as a species that we have in the state here there are a couple of other species occurrence in uh in especially in the eastern half the United states but\nUm yeah ... will have plenty of time to get out of here and go south\nI'm obviously what what drives the migration or in both spring and fall is the daily linked to the amount of of sunlight um\nBut then the other issue that is that are more refined factors of the birds are flying south for example this time of the year\nIf we have a south when like we do today we've got a pretty brisk south when none of those birds are flying today because they're going to be burning too much energy to try to fly into the headwinds so they'll just sit down and wait until there's a favorable tail wind and that being out of the north right now\nI'm requirements are also an interesting the bird they've had a really interesting history here in Wisconsin where they were during native species or they were pretty powerful and then uh they started declining now they've come back to the point where they are are viewed as a ... and many parts of the great lakes region\nFiled that's interesting and I just I like fishing last week in Washington and I saw one on Lake Michigan flying well\nYeah no they're very a wonderful birds there need to have around unbelievable efficient ah Fisher's things yeah um and that's part of the best part of the conflicts with humans [noise]\nYeah that's fun on my second concern was um I'm allergic to the fighters so I bought a product for eliminating spiders from my house and that's just a little sonic advice that I plug into outlets and that\nYou feel like an anywhere near six\nMiles of horse property we do have better medication for it now um but they are an issue for the horses and that's where you know we learned about possible controlled\nOh yeah yeah well I have heard that remedy for with the um the kitty litter so I don't know if that was somebody's excuse to to try to have somebody else take care of their litter the litter box or um where that came from but I've heard that works as well so\nGood for you Alice and six miles yeah that's about\nIt well usually recommend that you know a very busy eight lane highway in large river between where you relocate or were you drafted\nBut six miles also works maybe thanks Alice free she ate at Venice in Hartford Hi\n[noise] hello gentleman thank you for taking my call uh I Hope this isn't the issue that you've talked about so far but I just turned in a little bit of golf\nBut I have a question on the walls of whether the front [laughter] ah it seems like every spring or the year uh my yard is all tore up with ... action over the winter months and I'm Wondering if there's any preventative measures I might take in the fall to prevent that\nDentist that's a good question so we are talking about medals most likely it's V. O. L. E. there's four species of wools in the state of Wisconsin but especially in yards and suburban type areas as the metal ... that is the the culprit for that\nUm and it it it depends on the extent of the damage so um what you're describing where when the snow melts as the ball you see the bull runways on the surface of your lawn that it really is more cosmetic damage than as anything else once the once the grass started rolling in the growing season or does it becomes active that wall feeling\nThis will go away if they don't go away altogether even though the goal is still presents or the bulls are still president your yard so it does is just that I probably wouldn't even worry too much about it because that is a more of a cosmetic issue um\nBowls can do pretty significant damage to woody vegetation and if they're they're damaging a valuable vegetation planting or other plant things like that\nThen maybe that's something you might consider but bowls are active uh especially the medical they're active you are around and are they are what we call ... animals so they will operate or ... or be active underneath that snow layer between the bottom of the snow later in the top of your ground layer\nUm and so ideally if you want to reduce the problems in the spring now's the time to start knocking Volpe population down and and there really is no other way to do it I mean you can live travels but you're going to it's not the most effective way to do it so\nIf you are going to try to um in enact some kind of solution either bait a bait a mouse traps with peanut butter and then put those traps the trigger the trap\nIn areas where you see evil activity um you can use ... reference toxic ... attacks against a while ago if you do use toxic and just pleased to the extent that you can collect all the carcasses because other animals read those carcasses and you can get secondary poisoning\nThrough that way I'm so by the time to time to really start demands the population is now a not so much once winter's yet because once winter's hit a ... your ability to manage that population is pretty limited base in the snow fall and things of that nature\nAnd and then it's just one other thing to add to I don't know how long you've lived where where you have and how often you have this problem um are you see signs of the problem every spring but Volpe populations do try kind of ebb and flow a little bit\nSo it might be something you just kind of tough out you know on the on those years as well to rake in oversee the grass areas so it might not be something you deal with on an annual basis\nYeah and then the other thing that I should mention too and that's a good point to me the other thing I should mention is um you can also try to attract predators in so if you've got the ability to bring hawks are housed in their great predators and bowls a red Fox or as well um raccoons and things of that nature so\nWhere do you have predators they also can be effective in in the least regulating that bull population for you so you may not have to do as much of anything at all\nThere you go thank you so much for calling appreciate your call Mary Lou imprint as we go to you next time Mary Lou\nSketch I actually live in the southern states\nA chicken and last trip says that criticize each or something I didn't like chicken coop under that go around somehow came up chicken wire and then he'll make chicken which ... it day\nBy day ahead and try to bring it to the old at the end what guys only probably about two and a half inches\nWide yeah let animals did it how do we make chickens and getting out of this year\nThat is a common issue with a chicken owners um is it obviously there's a lot of things out there that won't eat your chickens from owls to hawks raccoons to a domestic pet dogs to um make in a variety of other type of weasel species so\nFrom the description of it what you're talking about it especially the size of that whole I'm guessing as either a mink or or perhaps they as one of the result species like a ... or something like that\nFor one thing that makes them weasels due in particular is that they will sometimes surplus skills so they'll they'll come in and they may only eat one chicken\nBut they'll kill all the chickens in there in the coup and the other thing that they typically do is they will attack that animal the chicken from the back of the neck of the base of the head and sometimes depending on how severe they bite through that that's fine they can\nUh that's something else that would be a sign that it may be a a maker of weasel species\nAll also captive their prey quite commonly so but it doesn't sound like the from the scripture how the animal got into does not signed on all more like a banker weasel species so that the best thing to do is just ... secure your fences\nOr Newton may need to stay down the bottom of the fence or even dig a bit of a trench and then bury the fence into the into the trench and then backfill that trench\nMary Lou our family's been looking at them getting chickens this next spring and this is certainly one of the things that you know we have to prepare for and it is a very common question that I get as well with all the urban backyard chickens so but in looking at websites there's a lot of chicken coops that are built with\nThe foundation um all the way around having papers or ... blocks that concrete so like you can set that you either take a trench input papers at all on 'em around the perimeter of your of your run that can make it very difficult for anything today because you've got a concrete over there\nBut the other thing that night if you can secure chickens in the coup ah because a lot of these predators are active at night uh they're tapping your chicken so if you're going to secure them in the coup that will also help and if you have some bright motion sensor lights are around that also may Detroit the predator or at least somewhat\nBecause those small places parents why couldn't you just run or have some way or hardware cloth or not maybe not hard work off but some sort of fencing rights as a floor yeah you're under the ... you could\nCertainly do that as well ... absolutely yeah the idea is essentially just want to completely in case those chickens in fencing to some extent yeah however you decide\nYeah you'd have to put some dirt over ... ... you know need to stay occupied they don't pick on each other that oh yeah you can hadn't thought about that but that's right yeah but you know ... for sure\nYeah I and I'm sometimes they are they're they recommend digging down and then putting fencing don't a lot and then making an El Nino land land you know they can't uh\nYeah so does the men can make and uh we are not true to dig into animals they're not a Berlin animal so what most likely to happen even though it was around December it was a mild winter last year and so the soil of his organic enough they'll jails are just scratch away and they can actually create enough of an entry point for themselves\nWhile with that [noise]\nI'm Sorry Cathy we didn't have time to get to you because we are out of time with our two guests today\nDavid Drake professor of forest in wildlife ecology you W Madison ... says and wildlife specialist and Jamie ...
