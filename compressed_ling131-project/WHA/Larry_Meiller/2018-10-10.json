P. R. dot org love to hear from you well let's talk a bit more about cold temperatures [laughter] they're probably on the way our day and we went to um a\nHoney repair or water feature when it comes to that for a poor that winter weather you talked about the filter I think you're doing right\nThey did yeah so one of the biggest thing is is if it's a a pond and you have fish then you have to set a plan are you going to take the fishing for the winter\nAre you going to add a heater um and if you have streams the big thing you have a lot of water loss if you leave them running throughout the winter I'm so you'll want to basically what we do is basically a turn the pond backwards so that that's not running down the stream anymore so you are bubbling in the bottom so\nUm it just helps keep it in for infiltration if you have fish okay Joe ... or the oxygen levels I\nYeah I Do I Do uh I I Wonder if more people\nThan uh just drained it out for the winter or is not the case\nOr what not by a snow [laughter] ours have\nA tremendous amount of fish so I'll get rather than hauling them into an indoor aquarium they actually just throw a little pond heater and you don't have to feed 'em or anything you just have to keep an air pocket open for him\nAnd keep the fish eating birds on [laughter] well yeah definitely [laughter]\nIsn't it Oregon let's go to your eyes isn't\nYes I have a question about what sort of landscaping would health if guys a utility boxes and electric meters right next to the foundation outside I guess there's an Eighteen inch Clarence necessary but\nYeah that's what I'm Wondering oh you're you're probably not the only one wondering that a question Susan ... income\nYeah I can take that one [noise] um well first the Madison gas electric actually has a nice little flyer about that so um if you have access to to them you could awesome for that but\nI Would not use any shrubbery or any trees of course I Would use only perennials with shallow routine systems um nothing too deep um 'cause most of those utilities are buried about four feet down but\nI Would use crosses our wonderful solution and some of the toilet perennials uh if if if you can stand that kind of size in front of your house they really do a great job of of disguising boxes\nYeah value out as a that sort of thing well I tell you what we've got um I'm sort of winning up here but I I wanted to bring up that you've done a lot of work in this again a little off topic in some ways but you've done a lot of work in\nSouth Africa was a talk about a little about that sure well you know I Am originally from South Africa and uh I've been here for over forty years and ... as I've gotten older and looking towards semi retirement\nUm I've been spending a lot more time in South Africa or with an ... nonprofit organization that some friends of mine and I found that many years ago called kid links and we work mainly on on projects that support children\nAre especially children with who've come from a HIV family or or are HIV positive HIV and AIDS\nAnd and very disadvantaged children to I've been working on designing and building playgrounds and a a food gardens open food's gone so that's been become a real passionate mind lightning\nSounds wonderful and has it as informed your own work\nHere well I yeah I in some ways we we don't do play grounds but I'm I've become very very interested in designing playground for kids you know natural playgrounds and playgrounds had help with early childhood development so you know any time something\nLike that comes up I'm ... and I hear there's a lot of you know all that well that\nSounds absolutely wonderful I Want to thank you both very much for\nComing by and being with us today I learned a few things that are better listeners have to I Hope we can do this at some point like thank you very much there it's a pleasure to be here\nThank you [noise] a ... foot and Becky kill strip ... is the president of a month

twenty thousand species of bees in the world Larry meal or hear [noise]\nGrey tabby along on the ideas networking where we'll be talking now with tore Hansen tourism award winning author biologist\nHis books include the triumph of seeds the impenetrable forest and I interviewed him about his book feathers and they have a lot of fun with them doing that so we're we're going to be talking with him\nAbout his new book it's called ... was the nature and necessity of bees it's a fascinating look at the species\nAnd how important bees are to you and to me so what would you like to know about\nBringing more base your garden perhaps or maybe about um your own observations of bees we'd love to hear from you joined in at one eight hundred six four to one two three four\nOne eight hundred six four to one two three four email was at ideas that WPRI a dot org and Torry Hansen with us by phone sorry thank you for taking time to be with us today\nOh it's my pleasure Larry thanks for having me on again\nYeah well I tell you it was so so much fun as I over the last time which was a long time ago but what I read your book again I thought you know we could get away with starting with the flight of the bumble bee because he's that kind of guy he can get along with that\n[laughter] [laughter] oh how did you get so interested in these\nMy interest in these really dates back to\nLarge rain forest trees down in Central America and I was interested in understanding how the trees function as a population\nAnd what happened when the rain forest was split into fragments and divided by pastures and just sort of thing that was going on in that landscape so what I did was go out and genetically fingerprint every individual adult tree but particularly species in the in that particular landscape\nAnd then with that genetic data I could see how seeds were moving around and I could see how pollen was moving around and I knew that something was moving Paul and not just between neighboring trees but among individuals as much as a mile and a half apart\nWay up there out of sight and the rain forest canopy something incredible what's going on and because that tree was a member of the pie family and had these big\nPurple flowers just like the sweet peas or a garden peas in your backyard I knew that that something had to be\nSo I a co opted a friend of mine who's an entomologist into joining me for a couple of weeks and we hired a local\nField assistant who was handy with across the bow and we spend our time shooting lined up into the canopy and hauling up all manner of insect traps and catching a grand total of zero\nBe wash out it was a flop\nScientifically and I never did learn species of bees that were doing all that work up there but the experience just sparked this fascination within me that wouldn't rest and so I've been looking for ways to chase after bees in my work but also just in daily life ever since\n... and it it's so amazing to me how many people are you all the different folks you talk about in the book\nI got turned on and they were going somewhere else in their life a an bees came a tractor their insurance and they went from going to medical school to be coming out of mileage is\nExactly what they're they're certainly\nOverlooked wonders you know I mean we hardly stopped to listen to the buses emanating from a Patrick clover but when you do\nTake the time to pause and investigate it you find that these are just absolutely fascinating creatures not just their biology and evolution but also the deep deep human connection to them and I think that they captivate people uh when when they come across our radar screens\nLawrence Lawrence hum hum Packer I think and saying that honeybees get too much good ... press\nYes Lawrence is a specialist on well it started to variety of native bees are and he had this great comment that\nYou know the domestic honeybee which is a fabulous be but is a a domesticated species he said you know if you ask him a question about honeybee it's like asking an ornithologist a question about a chicken\n[laughter]\nOh my oh my goodness um and you mentioned um you mentioned the well we're talking here a little bit about uh honeybees but I I'm skipping to a different part of your book where you actually talk about being in South Africa or one of our last guests moves from South Africa originally but\nA good a good deep frost the instead of them that are remaining there should have perished\nMurray thank you so much for calling having a a great time talking with Torry Hansen about bees is he is the author of the book was the nature and assessing the of bees is a fascinating book\nUh enjoyable reading and he'll be within ... twelve thirty will take a look at the

question maybe have a question about the book I Hope you'll join in at one eight hundred six four to one two three four or send us an email to ideas that WPRI dot org\nAnd tour I should have asked you this earlier but maybe you can um tell a tell us about how you've got your book organized and and and more about what it's all about\nWell sure yeah the book is really an exploration of these red large when we tend to think of these of course our mind leap mind leap immediately to the beat we know best the honeybee but as we mentioned earlier the honeybee is really the exception\nLiving you know and they're highly social colonized by the tens of thousands and most abuser solitary creatures [laughter] so I wanted to look beyond the honeybee and examine this great diversity of bees and how their biology and evolution\nOr make a wonderful story from their evolution from the last you know back in the Cretaceous period all the way up through their co evolution with the flowers which led really contributed to the great diversity of flowering\nPlants on the planet and also to this great diversity of bees so this is a a book that features things like ... that we don't tend to hear about and\nMining be and the bigger visas and leaf cutter be than or it could be a carpenter bees and oil collecting be at all of these fabulous creatures are spread around the world that are interesting and also essential in that they provide the pollination services\nThat make our ecosystems tick and that also pollinate such a huge proportion of our crops\nSo it's a a deep look at the University of the evolution and our deep an ancient relationship\nAnd we we get to meet a lot of interesting people who are have studied and lived and worked with these their whole lives too which is a fascinating part of it for me as well just hearing about them\nBetween these domestic abuse the European these and our native species are often out in wild lands in places where a large numbers of domestic ... might be basically put to pasture\nIn a sense so in here where I live out in the west we have the mountain meadows that are wonderful bee habitat and there are beekeepers with many many hives who who keep commercially and and and and pollinate a crops like ... and Apple's which is an essential job\nBut then after the season they need a place to keep those bees\nRight and so they often will take them up in the wild places\nAnd that's a situation where the experts do worried that the direct competition\nFor a limited number of flowers can have a negative impact on the B it's less of a worry and sort of the backyard beekeeping situation where the real emphasis needs to simply be\nImproving conditions for all ... and a final worried that people have about our domestic are wonderful domestic honeybee is the fact that\nDiseases can be transmitted from domestic be used to wild bees and this is worried because once the disease gets out in the landscape that's something we have very little control over\nIt's not one of these other stressors on these like the lack of flowers or the use of pesticides that we can control it you know in in one way or another disease once it's loose or is\nIt something that's very hard to manage and so that is a reason that people are beginning to look for ways to get crops pollinated that may not require so much transportation of bees over long
