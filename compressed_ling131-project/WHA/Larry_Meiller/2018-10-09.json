A. T. H. L. E. N. E. R. N. S. T. dot com\nYard ... dot com there we go you can join into eight hundred six four to one two three four you know one of those things that you know trees have come up and logging a few times and in the history part of the the book the when a Sarah fame\nSurfing caffeine\nSurfing and her husband arrive along with other family members they they think they're going to be walking out on a a into some crop land that they can farm and instead it's virgin forest it's virgin forests yeah and you know I've forgotten\nThe the magnitude of those trees talk a little bit about that\nWell it's hard to even imagine um you know T trees broad enough that two or three people could hide behind them and these people had come from a place that was very open land with very precious or they were used to sunshine and and and that type of terrain\nAnd they ended up in these dark forests and had nothing most of them had nothing but hand tools and there was nothing to do but\nStart the amazing process the backbreaking process of trying to clear the trees I was just saying about taking an ax yeah how do you I mean if you're going to do that in thirty minutes you\nThey would um girdle the tree cut to cut a strip of the ... all the way around and that would kill the tree and often they would just let them die or they fall right um and they had to start as soon as they put a lot of the immigrants arrived in fall\nAnd um they were out of money so they did what they could over the winter as weather permitted\nAnd then a lot of the men had to go leave the farm actually farm being a euphemism still at that point I think\nAre Milwaukee somewhere so it was a very long and painful process to to turn virgin forest into farm\nFields and then when the ... and the women were left with the children to write\nFor weeks or or even months on and the women were left alone in in what in those early years for the first ah two or three years of of arrivals was they were pretty remote and isolated a outpost\nAnd [noise] and they and and they did get some help I Am in the the history part of your of this book or any of your books for that matter the information you provided about the time and so forth is pretty accurate it's as accurate\nAs I can make it I Am writing a novel so occasionally I a\nChange of fact a little bit but I always try to let readers know in in the preface to the book\nUm for example one of the sites that featured as the Belgian heritage center in more Wisconsin where Belgian descendants have done a fabulous job of creating museum exhibits and cultural programming and they've done a great deal and eight years but it was it did not exist in ... at the time of the story\nSo I was so impressed with the work that they're doing that I wanted to include it so I don't put a little note in the front of the book and explain that I shifted the timeline they're a little bit\nAnd you keep the timeline pretty much in a while you keep a timeline of the eighties I get all your books\nI Do a time is passing as the series goes by but it's passing relatively slowly of four books take place in one calendar year\nAnd I keep it to the eighties in part because that was when I was working in the museum world and so that's what I Know and I can remember um and I will also say it makes it easier to write a mystery if the sleuth can't foot whip out her cell phone and Google the answer to any information that she needs to find\nThat that makes a a lot of sense to me it's kind of fun ah as well too you know when you you talk about having to go and find a telephone somewhere or whatever and you had to find that they go oh my goodness I was\nIn my younger readers get a little confused about some of the details like why how could someone find a phone cord around their finger while they're talking on the phone [laughter] so I can usually get those questions I have to explain but I think people my age and an older I appreciate the little flashback\nOf for sure summer kitchens are an important part of this book yeah\nI'm tell us about them\nWill separate kitchens where we're often built on the farms to get the big heavy uh cooking and and processing meet after butchering and things get that out of the house itself so the heat of the fire and the workspace could be separate it was convenient to the house but it was a separate small building\nWell it was a it's a very good pie I can tell you that [laughter] I'm enjoying it as we are as we jog good I'm\nOh and before I before we get too far afield I Do you do have some appearances coming up on and make sure before we get to the end that we bring those uh\nI Do think you the official launch party for the ... maker secret will be a mystery to me which is a a independent bookstore

P. R. dot for again and a doctor does we were talking about PSA tests\nUh before we as we were breaking for news or the anything to add to that I Know I wanted to ask you about the elevated you know an elevated PSA level what it might mean and so forth but maybe you can add to that [noise]\nYeah no thankfully for bringing that up and we were we were leaving off on maybe who not to screen for maybe I'll pick up there for our listeners so and um the American urology association who is my professional association I'm recommend that\nFor men that are greater than Seventy years old who had less than a tenure life expectancy to not screened\nFor prostate cancer so um hopefully men have been involved in prostate cancer screening before that time but let's say someone has not and Seventy one or Seventy two year old male or showed up or you know came and talk to your primary care physician\nUm the recommendation would be not to screen and let that person said that\nOh yeah I've got two brothers who were you know there Ninety eight or something um then we would say okay let's have a a shared decision making conversation and kind of the the meat of 'em where we should screen is really for men who were fifty five\nSixty nine years old and they should get a PSA test and instead of it being every year now our guidelines are recommending that that ... can be every two years um depending on if it comes back in a normal range\nAnd not on my values usually less than four\nAnd a the normal value less than for what and if it's above the normal value an elevated\nYeah elevators yeah what what the next step B yeah\nYeah so if the PSA value was above for then we um [noise] the possibilities could be from an enlarged prostate or from prostate cancer um it could be from infection so the prostate specific\nAntigen test is not specific and so it doesn't equal cancer um and so the next step is to go ahead and do what's called a prostate biopsy where we get tissue from\nIt um [noise] at such an early age then I Would probably go old school and I would recommend for for your son\nTo have a conversation with a with a his or her primary care about getting screened at forty and I think getting an early PSA and seeing that that values hopefully lower than I Would say one would be very reassuring and then I Would probably now look at screening every two years\nIt's a little bit off a script because this isn't a typical case if they were really really concerned they could look at um cancer centers like ours to meet with a genetic a screening I'm a professional to kind of draw\nThe family tree and see if there were other test um that should be a order if it were a woman right we have the brac gene so you could be tested for that we don't have that gene and men yeah but there may be some ... you know they may tests for like a Bracken a male\nAnd that may be um helpful but I Would just summing up in I Would say I would definitely have a deep conversation about getting screen old school style probably in the forties if it's less than one I'd leave it alone and screen in two years\nAnd if he really wanted to drop the family tree would be to look at it probably Cancer Center in a geneticist\nTo kind of I'm Mark things out and find out if there early markers that would be helpful\nAnd Pearl thank you again for calling and Dr ... maybe talk about this since the ... school of medicine and public health or a Cancer Center and what all is ah you bring a lot of different people into this don't you\nYeah we Larry thanks for that um that opportunity to share yeah so we're I'm so when you look at um health care centers and definitely cancer centers they really get a grade it very stringently and so we're uh we had the highest distinction of a comprehend\nOnly comprehensive Cancer Center in the state of Wisconsin and uh to reach those metrics you have to have everything yet to have not only good er physician to see you in the office and take care of you you have to have a research that it's actually making discoveries and helping to cure cancer is um\nYou have to have that not only in the political round but also in the basic science around you need to be active in ... certain clinical trials to give the next new promising agents to patients to find out what will be the next greatest and latest some cure

just for prostate for for all cancers\nAre and we really want to be the Cancer Center for the entire state of Wisconsin you know that's really maybe a lofty goal but it's really something that we had hold I'm near and dear to our heart\nOh thanks for that one for those come as a doctor does I Want to give a couple of other people a chance to visit the Robin Burlington your turn Hi Rob thanks for calling\nHello I I've got a question about any studies that would show any kind of a correlation between prostate cancer surgery and peripheral neuropathy [noise] I've I've had the surgery in subsequent to that I've got peripheral neuropathy\nAnd they just don't know if that's a coincidental or\nYeah read some stuff that it might be I'm not sure Dr down\nAnd I um I definitely would want to kind of know where the peripheral neuropathy is located\nAnd um and then also kind of I'm no if he'd received any medications\nUm ah that may have contributed so I'm so I'll just kind of do my best to kind of I'm kind of handle this question or answer to the best of my ability um so when I think about the ... surgery and having a peripheral neuropathy and\nWhat does that mean that would be like in um [noise] uh let's say in your your ... your your your feet or your legs um where they feel kind of numb and they they ... a little bit that would be an neuropathy\nAnd um when you have a surgery we have you in a position where sometimes although we do our best to patch you well that sometimes that pressure against the nerve long term could lead to a peripheral neuropathy\nIf he's referring to something like maybe in his fingers or his hand um we're the sensation of different um that's rare from surgery um unless there is a real hyper extension of an arm or something that tends\nTo be more related to different chemotherapy agents\nUm that we give for a lot of different cancers\nI'm so those are some some reasons um where it's hard to really get to the bottom of it is in a a true trial or just kind of figure it out we're there we don't kind of go into a trial knowing if we can figure out if someone's got peripheral neuropathy we kind of find that out\nBased on kind of reported series of surgeries medication so\nSupport for WPRI comes from boardman car a Wisconsin law firm dedicated to the heart of listening and the power of informed discourse serving businesses individuals

of the twelve corps was positive with three percent um and he had some MRI scans which of the prostate which are now really good they weren't good ten years ago now\nThey're really spectacular and um
