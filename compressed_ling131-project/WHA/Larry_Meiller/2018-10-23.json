P. R.\nDot org you know I I started by saying if you've tried to do you know give us a call and tell us your experience as a problem for any people out there who have tried it yet but let's get some some of the basics um\nGive us a fuller understanding of what CBD Oil is maybe isn't\nOh okay well CBD is short for can nab a dialogue and can avid die out or a CD is the active\nComponent of the hemp plant and planted otherwise known as ... so the CBD is an extract from that plant that has medicinal properties that's kind of making it and the ...\nUm and it's extracted almost like an essential oils that's put in to attend church or an oil that can be taken and then has an effect on the body that way\nThe biggest thing that kind of keep in mind as ... which has the hemp plant is also\nMarijuana yeah um so that's a big distinction to be made although it's the same plant there are two different colors of ours are actually there are more than two but different cause of ours that separate marijuana from hand\nAnd the active ingredient and marijuana is called T. H. C. and THC is what is regulated and pacify turn Wisconsin as a drug\nUh and that is the component that can cause psychoactive here on the on a part of CBD it is not a part of CBD no\nWell I actually I Know a few people who've tried it for the on themselves wasn't actually was some really good results how's it being used to treat\nWow I don't like to hear that\nThanks very much for calling so there is a positive vote for it for sure\n... I Know and that is you know what the caller mentioned using CBD Oil in conjunction with medications and works very well so you can decrease the amount of medication that your pet might be getting\nOh thanks again ruin Sandy clearer let's go to you next time Sandy\nGood morning your morning what's on your mind I'm having trouble hearing you right now\nOkay well we're here or so ago and we can hear you well so go ahead\nOkay good um I just wanted to make a comment to also my daughter and her family live in Colorado Springs and pay lay their golden retriever\nHad been doing acupuncture for probably about nine months on her spine because she was you know having some probably that osteoarthritis um they spend their summers back here in Wisconsin\nSo Ellie was concerned and subsequently ended up um her vet gave her I'm pretty sure it was pill form of the CBD which she took all summer\nAnd she was out chasing here in ... and whatever and I should probably mention she is Fifteen and a half years old wow\nSo really good results\nYeah yeah they're pretty pleased and I don't she's still had some anxiety during the fireworks so it didn't it was so much for that but it did great for her back legs and so on so good job I'm Glad I'm Glad more vets are considering this for animals as well\nAs anti thanks for calling comment from you\nYes absolutely am so glad to hear that as well\nI you know and and and using the CBD in combination with doing the acupuncture and that's what I hear from a lot of pet owners as\nYou know older tags and play you think about that Fifteen and a half years old is just amazing by itself but to hear that that dog is running around and playing is just remarkable\nSo great great to hear\nThank you again for calling appreciate a doctor carried Donahue our guest today she is the owner and founder of full circle holistic veterinary care in Madison and\nYou can join and we've been talking about CBD Oil but we can take other questions as well about your pets also add one eight hundred six four to one two three four or email us at ideas at W.

it\nFor your pet your cat or perhaps your dog or our guest Dr Cary Donahue from full circle hopes holistic veterinary care in Madison our guest\nAnd joined in with your own questions comments or maybe your experiences to share a one eight hundred six four to one two three four and you know before we go a little further we probably should\nGet back to marijuana for just a minute because marijuana can be as you were telling me toxic to pets\n... yeah it can be very toxic to pets\nUh so it's very very important and dogs they actually have more receptors\nFor THC that psychoactive component than humans do this and they're even more sensitive to the effects of marijuana so it is important to kind of make the distinction between hand and marijuana whereas hand with CBD is a very safe marijuana with THC as not safe at all\nNo safe but also keep that in mind or Lucy and brown deer will give you a chance though Hi Lucy\nHi how are you today great appreciate your call what can we do for you\nOff I have an eight month puffy we adore him um but he likes to chew on wood and I'm Wondering if you know why that is and how we can curve that when he's outside he'll chew on twigs and acorn than anything he can find an inside he's chewing on my dining room table\nThat guy but Dr Patricia McConnell or was that called dogs to that age a mouse would pause [laughter]\nIsn't that the truth you know it is possible\nThat your dog well can grow out of that habit potentially as it gets older\nAh so yeah but I think probably the best thing to do would be maybe try to replace the wood with other things that they might be interested in chewing on potentially\nA\nYou know have you tried something like ... ...\nLow fat is\nSomething in there as you can get deer antlers you can get out and there is a quite a variety out there that even just taking that if it looks like your dog is going to chew on the table or some kind of would tape object inside\nTrying to distract it with something out of it and I think maybe an aunt there would be something for you know some of something else that I might like to chew on\n'em but when it's outside I mean that can be very difficult to really try to curb that activity besides just keeping a close eye on him and removing him from the situation\nGet Herman giving them something else to do that they might like better now there we go thank you very much for calling Marty from Douglas County I\nCalled couldn't stay with us but um she says a friend's cat had skin cancer and there were lesions on its back those areas\nThe for didn't grow up in those areas so they rubbed CBD Oil on those lesions and and have really good results note he doesn't say what the results were either I I don't think they cured cancer but maybe in pain\nAnd you know I think that the studies have yet to show what CBD can really do for cancer there have been some positive results in\nCBD that can nab annoyed\nI'm going into the body and helping to stop the growth of our cells it also can work on the immune system and strengthening the immune system so that the immune system can do what it should do which is clear out any abnormal south or any cancer cells\nBefore they turn into something like a growth around mass\nSo it's good to here and there are topical preparations of CBD Oil that you can use that are specifically to use on the skin that you can use for hotspots that you can use for scratches burns anything like that that will help the skin to heal figure\nAnother call a loose term we're going to Green Bay and talk to him ... thank you for calling\nThank you for taking my call I just adopted a pill mill loyalties\nAnd I'm supposed to give her a heart worm tablet and the\nLiquid to flee into it just seems like so much stuff for such a little bitty dogs and I'm Wondering if there's something natural that I could use or an alternative [noise]\nWow the good news is there are a lot of natural options for fleeing tech\nRepellents so and you know sorry we're kind of getting into the season where the ticks are active right now there soon they won't be as active as we move into the really cold weather so my typical recommendation for a pet owners is to\nStop giving ... preventative in the winter so you know you could go for maybe another month if he wanted to use the conventional fan tech prevented have\nOr if you wanted to move to a natural alternative the one that I liked the best that I sat in my clinic is called wonder side and it is a theater oil base to spray\nAnd you spray that on your pet a couple of times per week and that prevents them from getting ticks and fleas I mean of course nothing is a hundred percent sure and you still want to make sure that you're doing tick checks and fully ... at the end of every day but that might be an alternative for such a small dog\nA at least for the rest of the season and then kind of reassess and see where things are at in the springtime\nI'm and as far as heart worm preventative that's one that you you probably want to continue I think if you gave the heart worm preventative and held off on the ... that would not be overwhelming for a small dog system\nI Believe it also has slippery am all those herbs are really great for the mucus membranes so for the trachea after your dog is coughing that can help decrease the inflammation in the respiratory tract and decrease the amount of slam [noise]\nAh my approach might be doing something like ... or ... and doing an over the counter and he has to mean so the combination of the two together and seeing how that would work for your dog for the rest of the season\nWhere you go back and caring for growing appreciate your call\nWhat was his name do you what was the ... the new read his column respite calm\nRuss park rest become R. E. S. P. I. dash ca I Am or a respite ... yes [laughter]\nThere you go ... or soon ...\nHi Larry Hi and I I have some information on some of the CBD Oil I rescued a from a puppy mill uh she was used for a five to seven years to pump out puppies and she was afraid of absolutely everything\nI've had her for four four and a half months no and and she was doing his job panting out of control just\nTotally amount anyway I've been I founded our health food store innovative I in in old V.

P. R. dot org and let's go to Michelle and Shawn Otto next Michele thanks for winning what's on your mind\nHi Larry and Dr Daniel thank you so much for taking my call um we have a five year old wire haired pointing grip on who was recently diagnosed with cardio my apathy\nAnd she's on a couple of different lands and two of the things she's on is a ... in a carnitine supplement amino acid mhm and I was just wondering if CBD Oil would be beneficial for her with this current condition\nIt's tough\nTo say if it was specifically help with that conditions certainly it will help with the immune system and inflammation and the body and could be a benefit that way but I'm not sure if there are any specific studies using CBD Oil\nFor cardiomyopathy itself\nUm but it remains to be seen it certainly could have a beneficial effect\nI'm I Will say there are a couple of ... that I use in addition to the terrain and our current attain a for animals they do have heart disease or heart issues and another one that I might think about adding in would be ...\nAre you doing anything like that at the moment\nNo I'm a recent like I've had it and we just found out about ten days ago oh okay okay we're trying to see if they let their working or not there\nYet but I knew said it is called co enzyme Q. ten co Q. ten\nA really common one that a lot of people take but it's very beneficial for dogs and cats that have any heart issues as well and the other or about that I Would think about adding in is called hawthorn\nAnd Hawthorne is specific for cardiac function so really helps to support the heart muscle that South\nUm there is a supplement that I really like and it's by the company store and it's called ... cardio and it has the co Q. ten and has a high orange and it has vitamin e\nVersus a food allergy is you know exactly what it might be that the trigger\nI I'm not sure exactly what the trigger is but I I'm leaning more towards environmental and\nUm there's you know that I I I live in in rental property and and you know I mean I we walk we walk towards in the morning I'm for him to go outside and the first thing he does when we get out\nIn the hallways he started sneezing so I'm I'm I have a hunch that said its environmental which there's not an awful lot that I can do about it this time\nRight Oh yes I Know that's difficult\nMy typical approach is because we know and any allergy issue\nThat the immune system is not responding appropriately to something in the environment or in the case of a food allergy her sensitivity now responding appropriately to something in the food so what can we do to really help support the immune system\nIf you think about it eighty percent of the cells that make up the immune system are in the G I tracked\nSo even if we're not dealing with a food allergy I always think it's important to take a look at the food\nI add in something like ... chest of enzymes which helped to really support the G I tracked and thereby supporting the immune system so that might be something to do if you're not doing that already I can I ask what kind of food you're feeding\nAny um you can and it'll take me about ten seconds\nTo and from from the vet and [noise] okay I normally can think of it right off hand but I've got to tell you I Can't think very straight right now\nYeah no and just came from yeah from did you say from yeah okay\nFoods are green free so I I think I mentioned before grain free is always important with any sort of allergy or information issue so that's good adding and the probe addicts I Would also add in a an herbal detoxify our\nAllies think this is important to to just kind of help to flush out their systems and when I say are both detox and there are a couple of specific or balls milk ... as one\nDandelion is another alfalfa rent clover and licorice any of those can be used to help sort of detoxify the system so\nThat may also be helpful um and then thinking about natural alternatives for the allergies specifically\nThere is a supplement called ... and that is kind of seen as a natural and he has to mean so that can be used in place or something like ...\nOr Claritin you can always try those or you can try to ... which is a natural alternative housing that's spelled do cursed attendance Q. U. E. R. C. E. T. I. N.\nAll writers and typically you find that at health food stores for humans okay um I don't know if pet specific product and just say you know go to whole foods or community pharmacy get ... and then I kind of take down the dosage for humans and give that to your pet\n[noise] something else to try Carole thank you so much for calling and we'll turn to build a little clearer next Hi Bill\nBurglary or recall sure river five year old labs\nAre having seizures and she's just too young to put him on on the other two\nAre the winners CBD ourselves and is there a stores or a dosage or no you'd mentioned something about so something five milligram per kilogram of charm would react\nIn the U.S doses or something or is is what we say we get it from a shop and black River Falls\nA you recommend the subset version or what do you recommend\nYeah do you know if they have a pet specific version that you would be able to get sick or to find out oh yeah\nThat might be what I Would recommend although with a yellow lab probably like maybe sixty or Seventy pounds Syria\nIs about Seventy ... Seventy don't want them to get through fat\n[laughter] I Know and that's important um you might be able to send seemed to have the CBD Oil at home for yourself you might be able to just cut the human dosage and half\nThe recommended human dosage and try that just to see how your dog might respond to it\nUm and then the next step would be looking for more pet specific version but all the companies that I use and no have dosages on the bottles themselves and you might find different concentrations like ten milligrams promotional leader twenty\nForty milligrams promoted later so they do come in different concentrations you'd be looking at probably getting a higher concentration so that you could give last and that the bottle at last longer\nTo below that helps\nThose thank you so much strict local\nYum version and oh let's go to Cheryl and lower ... Hi Cheryl\nHi thanks for taking my call I turned in late and so I'm not sure how much you address the CBD Oil with anxiety and pets um I have a twelve year old mix\nReally good physical health but we've seen an increase in her anxiety level I'm usually at nighttime and kind of stand and\nLook around she puts her ears back she gets like scared um she's she's always been very afraid of thunderstorms on loud noises um but\nWhen that's going on typically she was pretty good and now as she's gotten older um you know she doesn't she won't go outside at night ... you know as we used to be able to like take her for a walk when it was dark now she absolutely won't go\nI'm just kind of rolls around the house and and just kind of I don't know seems just very anxious she will go down the basement and sleep eventually\nBut sometimes you know if I have to get up in the night so I'll see her she'll just be kind of like standing at birth and how ... how old is she about twelve twelve she's getting up there mhm mhm\nYeah and that's something that I Do see where anxiety issues get more and more pronounced as animals get older and it could be tied into the fact that some of their senses are diminishing they can't see as well\nThey can't here as well so they tend to get a little bit more frightened especially in the evenings and nighttime\nAh so I absolutely think CBD Oil would be a perfect thing to add in and if you want to you could just start with one dose in the evening\nYou know maybe five or six o'clock after she had dinner at Cuba dose of the CBD Oil and see if that helps in the evening and overnight\nAnd do you have a brand that you recommend for pets\nYeah I Would probably go with that brand that I mentioned wave which has W.
