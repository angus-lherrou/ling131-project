[noise]\nWonderful news for sure well we have more colors or you can join and to have a question or comment the number to call one eight hundred six four to one two three four or you can email us at ideas at W. P. R. dot org\nAnd Larry may I I ... in in in ...\nI Want to mention the recipients name yes Donna Strickland Don us for Strickland is a professor of physics at the University of Waterloo in Canada\nAnd it it is is that just so exciting to see a a a a female being recognized for her contributions to science there are many other a word the recipients for the Nobel Prize and other outstanding prizes and I hope this is the beginning of a a trend that we will see in the rest of the Nobel\nA announcement this week and other uh a high quality high level prices as well\n[noise] well let's take another call again you can join us at eight hundred six four to one two three four Sullivan in Green Bay has been waiting a while so let's go their Solomon thanks for waiting what's on your mind\nHigh so I ended up a bit of a physics enthusiast myself not quite so much to the point where I Want to study it you know at the end of the however I was just curious as to\nWhat sort of experiments are being done to discover the gravity\nOr can you tell us what you have what what what do you mean what is the graphics on\nAh the gravity ... or ... or basically the principal for the graviton is kind of like Einstein discovery of the boats on in in the sense that it is a particle that a an axe to grab it\nIs it or something or a physical science fiction or is that science I'm not sure what they're really ask\nA it actually science I ... I ... I Believe that I Know that is being worked on I just don't know how\nYou know what but Sam when you get a question and you don't have time or the ... or the background to answer it usually put it up on siphoned out or gee\nI always do that and I shall do that with your question here are about the ... they want to make sure I understand what you're asking and what [noise] what the uh uh explanation is so within a thirty six hours was bought something on my website ... dot org are responding to your question about the graphics on fire\nRight there we go thanks so much for calling appreciate your call and again you can join in at eight hundred six four to one two three four give a call with your\nQuestions or comments you know before I forget about it um this is the is this the forty ninth year of your holiday program once upon a Christmas cheery and the land is shock is Sherrie\nThis is the forty ninth anniversary coming up\n\nIn November on November twenty fifth\nIt's a Sunday Sunday after Thanksgiving we are going to mark the forty ninth anniversary of once upon a Christmas cheery in the lab a shocker Sherrie I'm very happy with a wonderful reception that we continue to have to this ah program and and I invite people in the listening audience to go to ... dot org\nAnd order their free tickets um we are doing this program twice on Sunday November twenty fifth one PM and four pm at a hearing the Madison area the tickets are free I'm In the past Larry we've had people come from Minnesota from Illinois from Iowa\nFrom different corners different parts of Wisconsin\nThis was going to be an exciting program a marking that forty ninth time we do this special program which is in the great tradition of the great British scientist Michael Faraday who used to gather young people around Christmas Time and do science experiments\nFor the children and for their parents and I'm very very proud and grateful\nBecause I have now died at forty eight times in them and you're you've been to summit\nOh yes I have they're always packed with people that which is I think why you have the tickets\nWe have the thing that they're free tickets to control the size of the crowd\nAnd this year we're doing at a different location than the chemistry building because the chemistry building is a part of the chemistry building is being renovated\nAnd we have a new kind of street a teaching tower going up so we're doing this at the middle east and performing arts center it's all all the information is is on the Web just go to siphon dot org\nAnd the middle of the front page will see forty nine flashing a click on that and fill out the ticket or order form\nA follow the instructions and we will send you the free tickets a\nI'm a around a ... minute in about three to two two two to three weeks and\nIf you have a youngsters is certainly want to bring young says is there a lower end to the age range on it uh there's no high end I Know that for sure well\nWe aim for for ages five to eighty five for higher and that's what that's the range we've had before uh because of the program is about Ninety minutes long and because there may be I don't want to give away a Sam ah information here but let me say there may be some loud noises\nAnd we don't want a a gets under the age of five to ... to be uncomfortable so we invite everyone to come and those who are unable to come back and watch it on Wisconsin Public television later on I don't have the telecast signs yet but we will announce them\nWhat about building a ... ... have you contacted you're a local elected officials your state officials about this this is an example\nAs specifically what I'm Talking about the importance of us being active participants in in the process that affects the quality of our life and our in an ... an hour a local localities and finding out\nWhat the facts are is important acting and making decisions that something else\nOr it's just something else that I'm concerned about but you're right the first stop\nFirst step is to find out what is the effect of different uh south fights and other related chemicals uh on on on the environment all of\nA I Am for economic prosperity I Am for progress in the quality of life\nOr in our communities and that includes having open discussions open dialogue about matters that relate to the effect of chemicals the effect of a industry the effect of regulations\nI'm not saying all regulations are good I think all of this has to be part of the dialogue that we go through as a responsible community citizens\nAnd ... and some and wondering what's the role of the scientists and this and you talked about it a little bit but uh we we lost that\nCaller but what about the role that scientists have to step forward and explain\nUm the uh a great benefits from advances that we have in science and technology but also\nBe responsible and sharing\nAll the consequences the good consequences and not\nThe not so good consequences so that's a very important responsibility that scientists have some of my colleagues say uh well I'm doing my research and doing my teaching and I don't want I don't want to be engaged in in public discourse about such matters\nI Would urge my colleagues who feel that way to think about their own responsibilities to the immediate communities where they live and and I know Larry and and and and your department and life science departments you\nYou are at a you help encourage a colleagues of my I'm an ... an and others\nTo um participate and get trained them become more comfortable and sharing a important information with the public so I think the role of scientists\nIs of course to do good science and to do it ethically there's no question about that but scientists also have part of their awesome responsibility a ... that the responsibility to share their science and to try to explain\nA the benefits of the research the benefits of technology and all consequences the good ones and maybe not the ... not so good ones so all of us in society can make intelligent decisions\nIs what we do on November ... we vote for\nWell here's a on a different a wholly different tact here Kate\nArcher can is wondering she sent this mental a message to me about this question what is your favorite science experiment ever\nEver ...\nYeah well you know I I I every now and then I get this question a and a a it's a very difficult to answer that question I usually say Kate and I usually say and I mean it it's the one I did most recently\n[laughter] the one I just did here was it wasn't that fascinating I was fascinated and that's why I brought it here and and uh so so we we do experiments so we ... we make observations we make sense out of these observations\nAre we make decisions on what other questions to ask a\nA ... to satisfy our curiosity or all of these are uh uh uh important characteristics of every human being and I thank you for being so curious [laughter]\nWell what about just this week include here is about pretty much getting to be out of time here I Want to go back to the Wisconsin Science Festival just to remind people about it and what's what's going on and how they can get involved\nA whole variety of activities beginning October eleventh Thursday October eleventh running through Sunday the fourteenth of October\nIn Madison that discovery place and elsewhere around the state um different parts of the state activities that a showcase what's a science and and the arts also\nI'm a two to a audience is of a all ages and they are a ... there are events where you can participate so please visit\nThe Wisconsin Science Festival website and for some events we would like you do three registered has no registration fee just would like to get an idea\nHow many people are going to show up for each session I specifically have sessions on I'm addressing climate change ah they are for adults are and to find all that information when you go to the Wisconsin Science Festival website\nOr to my website siphoned dot org\nAnd siphoned out Oregon's just fun to go to any snow all the experiments and you're going to answer that question\nThat the caller asked about either grab a ton Oh yes yes we'll post that within thirty six hours [laughter] but Sam it's always a pleasure thank you so much we'll look forward to your next visit thank you very see you at the uh\nScience Festival at some point I'm pretty sure but Sam ... is a professor of chemistry at the University of Wisconsin the eyes great to have him come by [noise] usually brings along some bakers than we do a little experiment and that's always fun as well\nAnd you know what else is fun for me anyway is reading I really enjoy reading and we have some wonderful wonderful authors way either from Wisconsin or they write about Wisconsin or both and uh we have\nAn author coming up to talk about one of the books that ... and I are both red and it's being issued today and we love this

I wanted to measure just a couple of other characters in the book just to give people a kind of an idea there there was a bully Larry\nA bus skin I think his name Larry busking as the primary boy he has a he has an arc of growth in his life to their yes he does during this year yeah he he is absolutely the enemy of del at first and through a series of events\nIt reaches a point where Larry bus skin you can tell he respects they'll suddenly and he's he\nBecause they're a little bit of switch of power you remember that ... oh yeah and so there's a bully but he's not just some kind of a um\nRun of the ... he's a he's a bully who's no dummy either but he's in trouble but he's in real trouble at the end and at the end Dell is more helping the bully than running from him\nYeah and uh another one that I a character I wanted to mention was um [noise]\nI don't know how they um am\nMentos English teacher Mrs Borgia Borgia is that right oh it was yeah would pronounce your name was that your English teacher was her name is is\nLarger no [laughter] none of none of the characters are real people that um this is ... is a made up character but she's a she's got some ... as I mean the very beginning of the book\nDealt says something like I'm pretty sure she hates me I'm In one of the earlier chapters yeah but with time it's obvious that Mrs border does not have dealt with and\nShe becomes one of his allies that he has a ... he's kind of a mismatch set of allies then he needs him because he's going up against the killer of his father\nAnd Mrs ... one of those and the other thing Mrs border is is his his occasionally he occasionally he goes to church\nFour times in the book he goes to church and Mrs Borgia is always\nThere waiting for I'm kind of his ... becomes his church date his English teacher and church days [noise] and\nAnd ... and it's another important part of the of the the book for sure the other or the other thing that I wanted to mention\nWas I I was interested in the history\nThat you uh insert into the book uh I I may be talking with another\nCharacter the girl that he likes ... Parsons ripple persons yeah\nYeah and with her and then with her parents\nRight in del enjoys so awful person says is the first\nAfrican American student at ... high\nAnd so as such she's got her own set of challenges that come with that and then ... parents live not far from Dell's house on the island and so he figures out where they live just an awful and at one point gets invited over for supper\nAnd he kinda gets going on\nHe kinda gets going on a narrative of talking ... about the history of\nI'm Nina and the history of the island and for some reason or ... or for some reason del Fenwick\nKnows a lot about the Indians and a lot about the first territorial governor governor ... who had a cabinet still there if anybody wants to see it\nUm and yeah he he realizes that ... mom and ... father are very listening very intently and he goes on an explanation of some of the history of the region including Nick electric uh and the Fox Indians Winnebago Indians so and so on\nI like that and I I was sure that the ... the the story he was telling that you were you know ... Kelly and threw him was accurate\n[noise] yeah I Know it was accurate as of the time of uh the early seventies because these are things that I had learned back then um for example I talk in there are dealt talks about the facts and\nOn a little a little more and ah there's a ... called ... park and we had as a I don't know what grade I was in but we had an elderly man give us a pocket for the park where a battle at ... at the time you could call it a massacre of Fox Indians took place\nAnd now I noticed however Larry that the um historical marker has been taken down because there is some dispute about the accuracy of that but I told the way that I learned it back then\nAnd that makes sense to me you ah have some appearances I don't think ... I Hope you get out and get around a lot uh to promote your book but I Know you've got some coming up and a sober Chan is the one that I have a that's coming up sooner than that\nYou ought to get a good crowd for that 'cause that's at the public library\nYeah it's it's part of the Fox cities book festival I'll be talking at the library at on October tenth at one thirty anybody in the area who is interested in learning more about the book or more about\nHaving a discussion and more of a conversation on writing and\nUh and the book eleven miles to Oshkosh in particular please come um I I Do hope we get a good crowd there and I think we will because my mom has been [laughter] hell and beat Bush selling people all over and you know about it [laughter]\nWell you're going to be in a a mayors of Quinn bookstore in Minneapolis on October thirtieth at seven pm that's right and let's see you're also and I go with your down for November aid that River Falls public library and River Falls\nThat's right so those two are over near where I live I live in Hudson um and then I'm also working with the Hudson library on one that uh we're still working on the details but it'll be more in the wintertime it's one of those books that he can make your great uh could make a great little movie too\nWell that'd be interesting I I'm just getting my toe in the water here that I got the whole the whole business of uh doing a book talks and so on and this is new to me and I'm excited about it I'm I'm Glad to be invited on your radio show to talk about it and\nLooking forward to this coming year\nWell I Hope you it's not to sell a ton of these folks Jim thank you so much for taking time to be with us today I really appreciate I look forward to hopefully we'll have a chance to talk again thanks Jim ...
