I forget where the location was\nUm I don't know they're going to kill me [laughter] however um they went to a kind of like smaller island um\nAnd they pretty much surveyed basically all of the life I'm from mammals to insects and they were able to distinguish a I think\nBetween five hundred some odd different species of life including Seventy different types of species of bugs\nOh so they they really get down and dirty or when it comes to to surveying and that's just like one of the one of the many opportunities that the urban ecology center has but if you're into science if you're in a researcher for in a bugs\nAnd life and the buyer made you can come out there and enjoying that and even if you don't have an urban ecology center in your area you can still\nIn our survey the bugs that are under rocks in your yard or in your backyard or in some of your city or county parks you know it doesn't it doesn't have to be at an organization per se but it is that with me before I was there\n[laughter] Gail Goodyear and Roger Cohen argues to Gail you wanted to add\nTo that yes um [noise] you know and you can just go out and have fun too I mean some people don't care about but under Iraq other people realize that these all these animals are assigned than our environment is in vibrant and healthy and you know they are our canaries and the coal mine\nBut one thing that you ISI does have a free lending program so you can go\nViral some skis or skate or\nUh sleds or kayaks um and just that's really my whole purpose for this book was to encourage people to get outside it's just that you know nature full of mysteries and I think we find peacefulness and happiness when we get outside\nGayle Greene Aaron Rodgers Coleman or I guess from the urban ecology center in Milwaukee gills new book is titled young voices from wild Milwaukee the urban he taught urban ecology center\nAnd me they ... or engineer today Kate archer can't our producer I'm Larry meal or here on the ideas\nUP are comes from ... winery and distillery with a holiday event a vintage Christmas on Saturday November twenty fourth with tastings of wind spirits and Wisconsin cheeses complete details are at ... dot com support also comes from M.

to your show during bond cleaning tiny It's MORNING [laughter]\nThere you go to any way I I grew up in riverside park I was one of the original wild children [noise] um and I lived there in the early sixties with my family and many other families to um I just lived out there and it was wonderful our our neighborhood was um claims for the expansion of riverside high school\nSo I was on east riverside place there and um eventually moved away to Colorado to continue on with my wildlife that came back to Wisconsin in my whole family feels to filter back and take advantage of riverside park in the urban ecology center it's fantastic\nGray and you are a while you were a wild child or one of the wild children\nOf a riverside park Yup I sure was in the early in the early sixties my mother I left that my mother who has a stay at home mother who had been a biology teacher we spent a\nEndless hours out in the park and then the lucky curling club with on the other side of the bread and um yes it was a dead park as ... as was mentioned and I ended up being fortunate to live over towards lake park which was another study\nAnd finish off that wild adventure of life um there is that a\nA it was just wonderful and we did plenty of bug collecting age thing my mother used to catch I make them for a nickel and broad gang and ice skating out on the um you know rocky river in uh the older kids if you do the ... and that was on the other side of the park and\nI was a very little girl and I ... just to take me across to gather acorn easy for the squirrels through the winter we put them in ground papers that he could and then the closet\nFell just riverside park it yes it was a wonderful wonderful place to to grow up\nWell Mary thank you so much for growing wild children is is that I was very formal organizations sort of\nI'm Gayle do you remember\nNo I this is the first I heard but I Love the title of the titles in are the words in my title young voices from wild Milwaukee I think that's the whole point wildness is everywhere you just have to look a little bit I have a friend in New York she read the book and she said now when she walks in downtown Manhattan she looks\nTrees and one of the story tellers in the book talks about bird family she said their fathers mothers and baby birds and I think that's what my friend was entranced by\nOh thanks again Mary appreciate it very much I Will take another call from another marry this one in the rocky I marry\n[laughter] yes I just wanted to make a comment that we went on a\nBus tour with some other some friends of ours that are from um urban Milwaukee in previous had been urban Indianapolis and uh actually their fear of one of the people that were friends with actually had a fear of the open spaces once we got heating or they're in Wisconsin\nAnd get ... yup strange me\nSo I wanted to thank 'em well Larry for having the show and the guests for what you're doing because I don't believe any um any young person should be I'm not be exposed to nature and be able to enjoy all that it has to offer and so this is a wonderful thing\nYeah right right\nThey don't have the story tellers in the book said a children's sometimes will stay at her well walking on leaves hurt me\n[laughter] oh my God it's sad you know and and Roger mentioned how kids\nStay inside a lot nowadays and you know one of the big points in the book is that we're not putting down children who want to stay inside and for instance play video games but just to get out once in a while you get out there even alone hurt leaves are fun [laughter] one eight hundred\nSix four to one two three four the number to call for you to join in or email us at ideas at WPRI dot org guilty adults you interview had had a strong connection to nature as kids you interviewed the research and communities science coordinator Jennifer Callahan\nAnd I think she remembered being pushed in the stroller at a nature preserve in Florida [laughter] yes [noise] yeah and and\nThey saw big alligator and she and her brother had learned that a nursery school that when you see an alligator you're running a zigzag fashion so they jumped out of the stroller and ran in the exact fashion away I'd left their mother with the gator I Believe they all survived [laughter]\nDid you find that the there early exposure in nature influence where they are today in many cases\nYes I'm Mike ... says nature and a mentor those are key\nSo um you know might be just your grandpa who took you to chop wood or your data took you fishing might be something very small\nAnd those are good points there thanks for that a bit looks kinda Betty and brown deer or for primary thanks for calling what's on your mind\nI well I'm just so excited to hear your show and this is so good I grew up\nA few blocks from last Saturday riverside park in a in the forties and fifties\nAnd we were little we would go down and stay with my dad and\nLater a candy bar Logan appeared Richard Pryor logos appeared and then also appeared and get nature walk through the park and\nWe are literally would sneak in in ankle under the bridge where we weren't really allowed if we can walk down the river to\nGrow up [noise] um and that nature sander and to see the river now will be a healthy river when my dad was a kid they used to swim there and I knew from that\nFrom the uh swimming club across the river but I I just love going down there and see what's happened and that and and\nThere's all kinds of equipment available I think there are fed and all this great stuff it's just very exciting\nOh well thank you very much for calling you you get that excitement that do you feel that excitement a gallon Roger totally yes\nYou walk into any of the centers and people are excited and smiling everybody's happy\nAnd you know the each chapter of the book is the voice of the story teller it's not my writing it's theirs and they all talk about the magic and they said the magic was even in the double wide trailer so yes now there are nice pretty buildings but I think the magic is from people who care\nAnd those buildings are there I'm very environmentally sound in a sense for us to talk about them or just a minute maybe you Roger\nI'm so [noise] [noise]\nA specifically speak on the riverside park brand so the building is\nI mean [laughter]\nWhat is like where do you even start a whole rainwater flushing yeah as as I said we are a very sustainable organization and they they truly do practice that I'm from\nCollecting rainwater um to to save it for our gardens we have all of the garden based around the building Iran gardens um which means that they have a mayor inverted to collect rainwater and soak it up and it holds the reign water a lot longer than\nIt would if it was just flat because the rainwater ... run off\nUm the building has over a hundred solar panels on top of it um [noise] so we we generate our own\nUm we have these huge kind of um [noise] there and that we have in the garage that collect them that collect the water from the rain and we use that water to flush our toilets I'm the second floor of the buildings um was donated from an old school it's actually an old gymnasium floor [noise]\nUm I mean like there are so many hidden gyms or if you were to pop up I Would love to give anyone a tour as well as I read\nThat it's it's a it sounds wonderful you you know in your writing or in your chapter Roger he said uh we'll\nTalking about the whole your hope for a the you ISI was that ah [noise] well one of the things was don't get too big and focus on the main mission maybe expand on that little bit [noise]\nUm [noise] I think I think there comes a point in time where I'm not saying for every organization or every company but there comes a point in time where\nOrganizations or companies are started out as an idea from someone that idea then grows staffer hired and uh they become this inter weave in\nInterwoven a string and a basket called corporate America [noise] um and I've I've seen a lot of businesses a change for the fact that they are corporate or for the fact that they are getting bigger\nAnd for me I'm from when I was young to now like the the main thing that\nWas really the the cooking thing for me was the fact that the staff were so friendly and amazing and welcoming and inviting and um\nYou know they need high corporations yes sometimes corporations have businesses can get lost in that because they've hired so many people there's so many things to do and not enough time to sit down and talk for a few minutes or you know build those house the relationship so when I say that I was more so I mean I'm\nKeep that personal touch it got a personal touch that personal touches what keeps people from the community coming back that's what keeps kids like me coming back um you can say that you were this huge organization that you have this many employees and you're doing\nThis across the city but what are you doing for your communities what are the you can do you have any stories about little children like me I'm or\nPeople that are influenced like Gail to write a book you know so I think that's what matters a lot\nAnd speaking of that book young voices from oil Milwaukee the urban ecology center in me Gail you've got a book event coming up on November seventh I think you're a\nYes I'm a I'm guest speaker for the annual meeting of friends of lab on peak and it's opened up the public and there is refreshing and Senate free\n[laughter] and how do people read and people that certainly at that event can buy copies of your book but I Would get her sure but how else do they get copies\nUm it's for sale at woodland patterns and Boswell books and online through ... house publications and um Amazon dot com\nSo lots of places and I think for there's so many events and things going on at the center probably the best thing to do is to go to urban a college see it's urban ecology centered dot org\nAnd if I if I'm not mistaken that tell will tell you a whole bunch about the urban ecology center at about all the various activities there's tons of stuff going on all the time\nThere and

harvest it in the spring or do you harvest in the fall\n[noise] well um I don't notice the flavor of bird ... route changing very much throughout the year in terms of the bitterness\nIt ... it seems to be sweeter in the fall or early spring um\nBut you know Bernanke typically lives for two to four years before it blooms and and and then the plant dies um so you can collect those roots in the middle of summer there will be rose that they're just they're not bitter they're just not quite as sweet um\nAnd for for dandelion the route is always somewhat better um the key is you know dandelions can live for decades if you want to use the root as a vegetable or which is actually a pretty good vegetable um if you if you boil it both that the bitterness goes away and it's a very pleasant\nYou want to get young dandelions one or two years old after that they tend to get what he spots they get rotten spots in them that negative funky shaped them become hard to clean so I haven't noticed\nA
