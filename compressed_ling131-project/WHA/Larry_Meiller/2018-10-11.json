P. R. dot org\nGlad to be with you I have the late fall checklist in my hand is a mess [laughter] as we speak and uh I take it home with me because it'll be handy to use a this weekend or next as I work on a house but why is it important to have that checklist we see a lot of damage and\nIn houses Larry and some of that damage comes from things that could have easily been prevented a broken pipes slips in falls um I have a lady that ah we're we're trying to help right now who came out fell on the ice in the driveway\nHere of uh rehabilitation well these things can't these things can be prevented so we don't want to ensure our houses we don't want to injure ourselves we don't want to injure pets we want to be energy efficient so we are not enjoying our pocketbooks\nSo all of this is really much this is like practicing good defense right now you know we want to make sure that all the bad things that can happen to us in our home and our friends are on a isn't gonna happen\nSo you mentioned energy and let let's talk about energy for a minute what are some of the items you have on your list are relating to energy\nWell we need to get an idea of how our home is performing that day like today it's sort of a good day temperature really dropped the wind is blowing so\nIt's a good time to walk around those windows and if they're drafting do we we need to inspect the ah the weather stripping maybe they're not latching quite right maybe the ashes and the longer meet and we're going to forget those draft today we're going to have more winter when it's sixty degrees colder\nThe exterior doors you know sometimes a weather stripping gets old especially vinyl weather stripping and what a lot of people don't realize is that with a modern during the weather stripping the vinyl weather stripping and just push in there you can actually pull it out go to a store getting replaced and weather stripping put it in yourself at ... little little cost\nTo things ...\n... boxes are a big thing to inspect you learn a lot from a soapbox\n[laughter] you can you can learn a lot from ... a\nAll right let's take the uh let's take that the gutter question first um yes gutters will indeed filled with ice in fact sometimes ... ice they'll fall off the house but we have this wonderful thing that you can find it every hardware store in Wisconsin call he tape\nAnd ... have run through the gutters and down the down spouse does provide a channel now that we've he taped they'd even has thermostats in it so that it's not going to be operating was forty or fifty degrees is going to wait till it gets the freezing that's going to turn on\nThe electricians also can come and they they can put an extra year Jeff CI protected outlet right up underneath the gutters she can plug in up there\nYou can put a switch on the wall inside your garage that has a red light on it and when he tape is on the red light is on and the summer you can turn it off\nSo I Would advise putting on gutters but gutters with the tape because compared to stepping outside and falling down that's fairly small expense\nAnd ah it just turns to the windows yes as we said earlier\nAll windows will condensed water at some point\nThat point is determined by how cold things are outside which we can't control and the humidity inside our house which we can control and number three by the quality of the windows which is can we control that or not I don't know [laughter] but\nWe really do not want houses Wisconsin any wetter than forty percent during the winter so it's a good idea to buy humid a step stick it on your wall\nAnd make sure that you can you are not having like a fifty percent relative humidity inside your house\nThere's window quality and his window quality most of the windows in Wisconsin have um you know they're like you to point seven which I always translate into our factors of thermal resistance is about are too [noise] that's pretty typical\nThere are much much better quality windows out there nowadays but they are frightfully expensive so I think the first thing we do is we tried to control our a controller humidity and ah see if that if that helps\nAll right there you go thank you so much for calling appreciate your call and we will take some more calls you can join an eight hundred six four to one two three four I guess today John Frye burger\nWisconsin

factor\nCurious about what they said don't any up there for I guess\nThere are there are ... what particular area of northern Wisconsin are you thinking and they\nShould be some ... there are an a or my friend cherry just bought an old restaurant up there and uh I think it was this constant association home inspectors were able to find a commercial inspector up there and I know there's many fewer commercial than our home inspectors\nSo if you are having problems go to the Wisconsin I um you know why he Wisconsin association home inspectors email Julie Arnesen over there\nAnd say here's what I Need Julie will turn over every rock in northern Wisconsin till she finds you a good confident inspector how she's very helpful and then also check the American society home inspectors\nThey are of course of their national so you know Julie Julie Wisconsin and gives great service but try both of them but you certainly are going to find somebody with in fifty or sixty miles of the property that you need to have inspected\nProud of his house in that Wisconsin association of home inspectors as the and\nJulie ... walkie yup and I would expect that that Julie's I'm a email contact is probably right on there\nThat help out and they yeah thanks a lot for calling before we go back to the phones that wanted to turn to your fall\nChecklist again and uh take a look at some other things what about a I H back\n[noise] All right let's see what we've got less to hear Larry\nWell remember if we've got boilers they really need to be inspected and the ones with cash and chords really need to be clean Daniel it because the problem is we have rushed that comes down from the cast during corn falls on the burners and some of those burners are pretty simple\nAnd once we get rushed on the burner as we get incomplete combustion of the gas that you're already paying for\nSo generally I'd say ... if you own a boiler you need to have it inspected every year by somebody who knows boy was\nFurnaces you can inspect yourself\nCondensing furnaces basically look for places where it looks like we have leaks\nRegular furnaces if you can open the cover\nTurned them on if that flame has a lot of orange in it you've got a problem is running nice and blue if the fan is quiet well maybe it's OK\nFurnaces at least every second or third year need to be closely inspected but but boilers really annually\nIf you've got boilers you've got old fashioned radiators take the vacuum up clean 'em all black but [laughter] uh as as sort of funny that you know we paint our radiators and every time we paint them they're less efficient and they've got nice and dusty in for a cat here they're even less efficient [laughter] you know we're sort of\nA ah we're we're\nSort of a insulating them if you got a steam system\nDue to the air relief valve at the end of the radiator usually there silver you can screw in in your usually two or three inches high sometimes they're called very van sometimes are called this or that sometimes they don't open if they don't open the cold air stays in the radiator\nAnd the radio or doesn't heat up very well so he got a couple of radios that always seem to be the last ones to heat maybe get on the hardware store get a little bit of tests on tape to wrap around as you screw it in but replace a couple of those a couple of very events\nThe other thing that you'll find is I keep saying very event 'cause that's the one I use Larry but there are just plain ear relief Vance that's what they're called but the very event has a little dial on the top\nAnd you loose in the top of the nickel or a dime you turn out to fast or slow and you can actually make your radiators in your house with your steam systems heat up differently oh [laughter] put more heat where you want it or less heat when he won it so if\nThe kitchens all was hot you dial down to slow and as the bedrooms always cold you can dial it up the hot\nSo his instructions generally on the on the package and they also have a website where you can look at so we can balance the heat in the house and make sure that to make sure that it's a pretty pretty efficient [noise]\nSome were good tips that's great let's say similar calls and John and plaid fill up next\nJob and I came in just a little late and I was listening on mystery burger was talking about the heat Cape putting it did really interest me wondering could you elaborate a little more on the food you would call to a success and stole something like that\nWell you're probably you're you need an electrician you'd probably find the electrician who not only will put in a Jeff CIA weatherproof outlet for you outside 'cause remember\nSomething fails and the outlook is covered in water and ice you want to be safe so this is why I'm not saying you don't just run the extension cord outdoors and plug in some heat tape now that's a good way of getting hurt or dead\nSo called a ... you got a lot of electricians in Placerville area in a couple of really good ones called them and say look I Need heat tape they're going to they're going to put the outlet up probably right under the IEDs\nAnd then they can run the heat tape for you in the gutter and then down the down spoke as if it doesn't go down the dumps about well the water may be in the gutter but it's got to get out of their so called a couple of e electricians\nGiven the idea of the ... footage that you need they should be able to cold it over the phone and then have a license professional come and do it yeah does that help\nServe thinking now thanks very much for calling appreciate your call I've got that for on\nSome lines water lines where you know I just in the fall [laughter] ... turn the switch and it turns on or at least the you know once it gets really cold and it runs through\nIt's really difficult to know I've got a twenty year old wood roof on my house\nAnd I just ordered a bunch of products and I'm going to put a mosque spray\nRoof and see if that cleans it and then we're going to put up these extra up so next spring when I come on the program somebody asked this question I have some real life expertise because I I've seen these things for years I don't want to recommend them on the air unless I Try him in my house right now could use a little work [laughter]\nThere you go Gerald I Hope that helps thank you so much for your call let's go to John in Steven's point next site John\nHi what can we do for you\nUm well I have a a I have a a double envelope passive solar home that was built in the uh in about Nineteen eighty and it had a a had an asphalt shingle riff on it and I replaced it with a standing seem real because I'm anticipating getting some ah photovoltaic cells to put up there\nAnd it's easier to attach but when they installed the rough they put a rich vent in which it did not have to begin with and the the south of the house has a to Larry I'm which in the winter used together a lot of heat\nAnd since then it just has never been as warm um of course there isn't a snow load that stays up there and sledding rough but I think it might have something to do with this rich that\nWere there used to be only for small ah like ah Eighteen inch I'm a old old traditional route and\nAnd I wondered if you had any experience with these ah double envelope homes\nHave a little bit of experience with them if you have for pot vents on the roof they the normal ... has a net square opening of point eight feet so you had three point to\nA ... ... square feet of opening you can go online and it was a guy J snow guarded what you got up there for the for the rich but you can check to see what the net square opening per ... foot is of the ... and you can see if they really change the venting lot\nIf what you've got up there in the ridge advantages feeling three between three and four is probably not much different than you had with the pop band so then you may have to look elsewhere [noise]\nOne of the things to do is take a look for air leaks in your house and you've got to see you know double envelope house that's a really modern what is a double envelope house well basically what we have is we have the house has built inside the house\nAnd so we have really a double shell and usually these were I had a lot of passive solar going on so they had a concrete or block or some way of collecting holding the solar energy or some of the ones that we worked on way back\n... fans so the idea is you had very little thermal Los ... the thing is with modern with changes with the the modern materials that we have now for sealing houses they've become a thing of the past but there's a big investment there so you want to maintain it but it's now thirty eight years old\nSo I think that John I'd probably go to focus on energy I think I'd go ahead and have an energy inspection on the sauce\nAnd do it when it's cold because ... imaging made if we've got a couple of plumes of warm air coming out of that we're gonna pick up and sort of imaging and if they do a board or tests and depressurizes house to fifty pass scales you've got a bunch of leaks ah really defeating you\nIt could be that over the years this house has just aged a little bit of some of the ... or whatever but you know seals were you make things out of plastic and things out of ... and\nYou know everything ages not just us you know and so sometimes our houses are a lot ... than when they were built just due to\nJust due to changes so let's invest you know four or five hundred bucks in some science or before we do anything but my suspicion John is that the venting was not changed mine much and that probably is not the source of your issue\nThere you go thank you so much for

Larry thank you for accepting my call a I got in kind of late so I don't know that gentleman guess a name here but I just wanted to ask him a couple of years ago I read it Consumer Reports about solar shingles\nIt in the winter of twenty Thirteen twenty fourteen my house took a beating on the rough I had to get up there four times remove snow we had probably one winter year we had about twelve feet of snow here and I had to get up on the roof and clear it off a feather in western exposures of the rough\nDeveloped ice anywhere from a couple of interest to maybe half a foot thick ice out there because the goal\nAnd the shingles kind of curled up it turned out not my wife was afraid the roof would leak but I explained or there's some a car below that you know that's not going to leave right away but I Do want to ask you is there anywhere in Wisconsin where I could get solar shingles\nSolar shingles that'd be a good field as a no ah not in not in Managua and not with the snow that\nWe get up there that's that is really the problem\nUh we are I mean we are going to solar paint pretty shortly I mean when there is already experimental we're actually going to be able to paint photovoltaics surfaces on our our buildings is pretty amazing what ... what's happening as far as uh as followers solar collection and the efficiency we're coming up with a problem that we have is if it's covered with snow\nIt doesn't work very well and then if you're getting the snow off what kind of damage are you going to do\nI think what you've got to take a look at it you've got to have a very good quality a shingle on that roof something that is really built for those godson climate or the J. F. Timberline lifetime shingles are probably the one that I specify most frequently for areas that have really nasty\nNasty snowing and yeah the rain and they need to be well applied by somebody who really knows what they're doing and then we need to make sure that this addict is well ventilated the house well insulated and\nIdeally we want to just live with the snow or as long as the snow's not causing structural problem not causing ice damn raking our roofs causes damage of getting up on our root causes broken bones it's nice to get these houses retrofitted so they can simply live with the snow as it is\n[noise] there you are Dave thank you so much for calling I Want to get back to our late fall check was for just a minute a John and we we really don't have time to go through everything but you've got just looking at what you've got as had there's here you've got wet to stock up with we've got shut off\nA things to shut off we got the patio and outdoor items you list the bunch there you've got energy you've got H back there is a safety check ... and so forth there's a drainage issue to talk about there's trees and shrubs and then there's forward planning\nSo they're so now you've got to post this up on your site\nThis was going to go up on the site and I'm the one it's not going to go up right away Larry it's probably going to take a month or two as busy as we are but I really want to put this is an outline really ... and I want to give people some information and then I think at some point we want to add some illustrations some cross section of drives me is\nThat it's going to take this is probably something is going to be work in progress or a couple of years but I Want to have something for our listeners where they can go to the website and we can give them a lot of information basic\nUh I think that this is going to be something of value are certainly many of the questions we've had today we could have checked off something on the street from what from what people are asking so I'm I'm seeing this is sort of a a start to something that I can develop for our for our listeners and make available to people for free\nWe already have your website up with a a good start out and I I was on it today and I were looking at it it's a\nIt's called educated homeowner dot net educated homeowner all one word or dot net and you've got some ... you know things that we've talked about in the past on the program that I think would be really helpful for for people\nThat is the purpose is it the\nThe website is there for information purposes only it is not to find more work or anything like that and Larry frankly we've only put up half of what we have at this point yeah so this winter when things slow down a little bit of a level of\nA ... and I will get back together and we will put up more things so basically the ... go to the website click on masonry you want to find the lime order for fixing those old stone walls clicked on that\nIt's all downloadable ended his all free\nWilliam had a question here that I think we can answer that time we have left a can of it should have potential homebuyer use a home inspector to inspect the home for sale before making an offer does he or she has to do the inspection after making an offer and having had accepted\nIn this insane market Larry where there have been in wars on houses we've been hired quite a bit this last year to do ... offer inspections for buyers because basically they wanted to come in and say it's a cash offer and inspections already done\nSo that can work that the market is so crazy in some parts of the state for real estate right now that that seems to be something that some people are doing but I Know of no objections from real estate brokers but check with your broker you've hired a licensed professional help you\nAnd take a take her or his advice and I'm going to walk here Ashley an find a good\nWisconsin certified home inspector who was a member of a professional organization\n[noise] well I tell you what it all makes good sense to me and again your website is the new website as educated homeowner dot net John it's always a pleasure unity background just before Christmas December thirteenth he'll be out I Believe that's correct to\nLook forward to it thanks again for being with us today\nJohn ...
