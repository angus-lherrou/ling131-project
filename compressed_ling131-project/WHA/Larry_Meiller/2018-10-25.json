P. R. dot org and I mentioned services maybe we should talk about there's quite a range of services as they're not\nSitting there in Maine forms of services for children who are under the age of five we really look at a comprehensive or intensive level of services that somewhere between twenty five and forty hours a week of service\nAnd that would be working one to one with a child of working with them in a I'm In their daycare setting working with them at home I'm working with them in a center based program but really focused on intensive teaching with that child\nFor children who are school age and above we look at a focused or non intensive level of services which is usually find is anywhere between ... anywhere less than twenty hours a week of service\nKnowing the children are in school all day long and thinking about what are more specific um skills that they need to work on more specific strategies that the family might need to to be successful so\nUm any services that you would with access that are specific to autism treatment would either be at the higher level for younger children with that I'm less intensive level for children who are in school all day Saturday subjects struck\nMe as you were talking I was wondering is this something or autism is it something that\nKen's I don't know if strikes the right word but ... at at a later point in someone's life or is it something that they probably started with or maybe it just wasn't diagnosed until they were a little older a poll or you want to\nTalk about that well sure as I say if we definitely um thank children and youth are diagnosed later in life and often times you know there's been other diagnoses that they've had along the way health care um\nI Would say we hear a lot about where you know there's been diagnosed him ADHD or learning disabilities or other mental health diagnoses\nHis mother his mother keeps up a huge Norfolk and she has documented everything every person that he has worked with from the very beginning which is something that a person that has an autistic child needs to do you need to keep\nThe records and know who you're talking to and what you're talking about there's a huge amount of paperwork involved\nYeah I mean you're not going to disagree with that are Aaron\nKnown now live all it it it's almost like another fulltime job I think managing all of the resources of the paperwork and the services and making sure that everything's going the way\nThe way it's supposed to start you know I I have such enormous respect for parents of children with disabilities ... up because of all of the work they do above and beyond tend to be everyday challenges of parenting\nYeah thank you so much Cathy I Want to give a Janet in Milwaukee a chance to join us Hi Jenna thank you for calling\nOr you great I have a six year old relative with autism how can I fast interact with the parent and child support them\nAnd do you see them often Jonah or family gathering okay\nI think this question comes up a lot in the families I work within the treatment services program and it's really thinking about\nAre you creating a warm accepting environment for that child in that family or they do they feel welcome in your home do they feel like if their child has is having a hard time or the having a meltdown that that that they've got this space to manage and\nUm you talk with the parents before they come over are there things that you should put away or have available in their home or their their foods that you know that this child likes to eat that it's going to help make that\nThat visit be more positive and and really being as non judgmental as possible because they think you know I think for many of our the families that we work with there's that that feeling of like what's going to have\nSpam so if you can be a soft place to land for families and and and people that you love that you're going to you're you're going to make their life just so much easier just by by being being kind in support of that would\nYou do is I was thinking about this and you touch you I think touched guy came up and just something as simple well should I not give a child a hug or should I be friendly but\nQuestions like that I think the parents should be able to answer those kinds of questions though\nYeah no I Would say everything Aaron ... thing and you know and it's wonderful I think families and friends can definitely be curious and asking because I think like air and I think families are gonna really appreciate that your intent is to\nIt is to be able to support and helpful and and and make it a good environment up and some specific questions around I think a lot of family gatherings we hear a lot around food issues you know either that kids don't like foods are bells or suggest asking I think what you don't like favorite favorite foods favorite activities or\nOur mountains or you know how we're just all those preferences so\nI Would also I'm just throwing here that it's really hard for parents who are a child with autism to get out of the house by themselves to get a break so you're in a position where you can have that child over on and spend time with them one on one so mom and dad can\nGet a chance even to drink a cup of coffee while still warm I'm just really being up being somebody who can provide them with a little bit of a break or ref but it's going to go and then norm is way for that family to be successful long term\nYou know I I can see you know Jenna mentioned family gatherings and you can you can imagine that for ... for some children with autism are gathering worry you might have Fifteen suddenly your goal from three or four people in your household to\nFifteen people all talking loud and having a good time can be a problem\nYeah there we go begging Janet appreciate the call\nAnd Karen in St Francis it's your turn Hi Karen\n... yeah I have been listening off and on [laughter] but I haven't been hearing a sick um signs or symptoms or behaviors that I'm a child on the autism spectrum would exhibit okay\nArun you want to start some of the things that we we look for\nOur that's our child respond to their name um do they have um an interest in in social interaction you know um when kids are even very little if you smile babies do they smile back are you um\nYou want to look at how are they playing with toys and objects are they um using them in the way that you would expect it to be typically use so you know driving cars and along the track versus spending the wheels for example are really thinking about\nWhat how is this child interacting with the people in their life and the objects in their life you know\nI'm not I'm not a thing and we mentioned before you know but watching for that kind of thing as families for partying dog ... communication or children who maybe aren't and not showing interest in Pierre siblings so way other kids might or other things we often\nWith late or you're not speaking as soon as you might think is normal or\nAnd it's certainly something that you wanted to test that ... and they think Larry you will you alluded to this you also want to make sure that there's not a problem with hearing um you know so if you have you've got chronic ear infections they may have delayed speech but not necessarily autism but either way you want to go back to your pediatrician and say hey\nThis is what I've been reading this is what that experience with my other children this is what I Know about child development and I'm not seeing this with my child let's talk about next steps\nAnd I would add so when parents if you're ...\nBeing persistent even if it ... your doctor ... pediatricians not I'm\nMaking referrals who are um because the one thing we do now is that kids um our families are reporting a concerns noticing delays you know prior to you know before the first year yet kids than an average are getting diagnosed\nAround four years old so I think um we really want to make sure parents feel like you know trust your God you know your kid does really well you know the best um and keep talking to folks\nAnd Jenny or have you got a quick comment for us in Burlington\nHi yes I'm actually I think you pretty much just hit on what I wanted to tell parents I have a Twenty one year old son was diagnosed through the whites and center many years ago at age three um but I had a very very difficult time getting my pediatrician to\nAgree with that diagnosis and to help us get through the paperwork process in order to get treatment for him he did wind up with three years of ADA therapy through the Wisconsin early autism project and I'm\nNow a junior in college he's been to Spain for a semester on his own he but he had to have an aid with him all the way through sixth grade\nUm and it was you know someone that really needed a lot of support so um that early intervention what a difference it makes and parents if you have a child do you think is having issues um don't take no for an answer keep pushing because you know when your child is not\nMeeting those milestones and um when there's a reason for concern\nJune Jenny thank you
