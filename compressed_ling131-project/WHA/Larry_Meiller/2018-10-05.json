rate in September is the lowest since December of Nineteen sixty nine that was during the Vietnam War when many potential workers were out of the workforce fighting in Southeast Asia\nToday's labor

P. R. dot org and bend photo welcome back good to have you with us again thanks great to be here\nYou know what I'm going to be doing this weekend my daughter Emily is going to be carving pumpkins with her perfect across country friends but I Will be\nIn the back lawn in the vegetable garden area and I will be pulling out the a ... to ... plants and getting the straw bale stuff taken care of it is time yes but I'm leaving the front of the I\nI have no on on the front because it's all flowers and and so forth so I leave that alone\nPerfect so I ... yeah and um so you mentioned in the intro that uh you know something that I'm fond of saying is brown as a color to and\nI think the first thing you notice when you really start to look at sort of our landscapes for November and beyond is that brown is is much too ambiguous a term for us to use it it's sort of like if you talk to fashion designers or interior designers and they say no no it's not purple it's you know ... huge source of greater specificity that\nEmerges but it's the same when we think about uh the generic idea of brown so we have silver and gray and ... are sepia and tear caught a and a silver and blacks and suddenly there's this huge palette that opens up to us or for this time of year that\nMost of us are focusing on you know when do these flowers and plants bloom and how do they look when they're blooming but you know we have especially here in Wisconsin we have many more months to look at things they um and and I don't like to just look at a flat garden I like to see something\nThere had a I I'm with you on that and you know I I yeah I Wonder I thought about this as I looked at my own flowers or the last couple of days thinking about your trip over here [noise] ah they don't look as nice right now and I think that there's\nYou know people look at those and say you know at this doesn't look so good I'm just going to clean this up and if you just wait a little bit like Freddie Freddie good\nYes and and I will say there are probably some plans to do the job better than others um per hour but anything with strong seed heads are typically things will will look out for in terms of structure and texture especially ah so any of the ... hours a day ... work really really well\nBen food are our guests today from the Allen centennial gardeners as we talked\nWith him about getting the guard and ready for winter at appreciating the color brown over the winter as you uh take a look out the window and look through the snow and see those plants out there that are ... died a long time ago but still providing a whole lot of interest\nJoined in with your own questions comments or maybe experiences we've had some great experiences so far from listeners what about you question give us a call one eight hundred six four to one two three four email us at ideas that WPRI dot org\nAnd then you're a a landscape architect I'm a by my training at a designer\nWhile I I should say started and landscape architecture right in the ... and then ... well and I did three semesters and undergrad and then realized that didn't have quite as much to with plants as I Want and then on my way to public art and\nIt's like you did get into designed yeah ... yeah you you did get into designing I I just wonder do you do when you're designing dude and thinking about the plants that go in do you give consideration to the winter\nAs well as what those plants are going to like look like in the summer\nMost definitely um and so there's a famous plants been out there ... to ... who's noted for saying a plan should look good when it's dead\nAnd and again when we're thinking of perennials specifically are are puree to bloom interest is really so short compared to the whole life cycle of the plant so\nI'm thinking about you know the emerging foliage and spring it's fall color now how well do the seed heads hold up\nUm does it need staking or can stand up to the elements on its own um it's sort of a a really exciting project for us we just rented it at our new American garden in the Alan Simpson you'll garden this season so about Thirteen hundred new perennial play well with others ... of the four season interests another it's looking fabulous right now is another great time to visit\nHim that's ah that's wonderful well we have some more callers so let's take another call again I think there's one more open line at eight hundred six four to one two three four Scott in Madison it's your turn nice Scott\nGood morning or good afternoon good learning good morning other question about getting rid of creeping Charlie and when the best time to do it with the\nI Would probably say spring um only because being a perennial weed is starting to go dormant with other plants right about now any type of treatment likely is not going to be as effective now is it would be in spring when things are in a really active state of growth\n[noise] so wait until spraying and tell probably flowering or a little after ... hour\nYeah just about when you see the flowers start to emerge that should be um probably the optimal time how Henry over\nThere is there a chemical available for getting rid of Charlie it's difficult to get rid of\nYes there there are a you know I ... in this case of chemicals probably are the best way a hand pulling it you'll you'll hate yourself for it\nUm so are there are broadly herbicides other that won't kill the grass but will kill 'em any of those broadly weeds my recommendation though would be um dude don't just coat the lawn 'em do it yourself or or hire a skilled horticulture is um because we really like to try and work\nWhite clovers and other things that really encourage healthy grass ecosystem but um [noise] you know we don't want to nuke everything if we can help it would be really specific and targeted and also remember\nThat there are creeping Charlie's one of the first things that blooms in the spring and so the booms the flowers are out there for\nThe audience beneficial insects and they don't have a whole lot else to go to an oil\nAnd truthfully you know I mean creeping Charlie isn't necessarily harmful and to that point you know we in in the ... on your garden as well we live dandelions because they're they are still in the first food for pollinators and so we don't spray we don't kill anything we just we embrace that there are packed a part of our sort of Lon ecosystems\nHas got to be had any children uh I have\nI have gone out with my daughter I said this a couple of times on the show but I I go out on the lawn even with my daughter and we pulled creeping generally you'd be amazed at how much creeping Charlie you can pull in a Fifteen minutes to a half hour and it's sort of sets it back\nAnd you know it gives your lawn your grass is a a chance to to join in I guess I can get some pretty good piles and ... minutes so anyway thanks\nFor my mother's lawn that walk creeping Charlie a guy that hot so\nGotcha understood well get over to bombs on and do a little poll and [laughter] there you go thanks you can join into eight hundred six\nFour to one two three four let's turn to Roy in whitewater right what's on your mind [noise]\nAll right thank you for calling what can we do for you I just kind of a fellow what's ... I assumption\nFor marrying him is that that is a set a fire will now I'm looking at my front lawn and the country and I have a real infestation of crab grass this you're possibly do to the ... weather I'm not sure\nI've always been told that to prevent crab grass you need a free merchant it would be spread early spring and I'm calling to see if now that I can clearly identify these areas where the crab grass as apparently died in turn kind of a brownish red color\nCould I applied at riverside scares me that a free emergent now ah and use it selectively rather than a broadcast that over the entire law and\nI I Would agree with using it selectively adjust to minimize the impact of the chemicals um but I think a waiting till spring would be your sales because they won't be doing any terminating this fall there they'll they're going to wait until spring so definitely I'm good where are those areas\nYeah ... and either you know puts marking flags out there or something to sort of remind yourself where those spots are and that may be helpful yeah that's\nA that should work right thank you so much for calling pita and reads Berg emailed in ... says I have a fire and ice ... that's been in place three years\nDoing very well it's now about five feet high four to five feet wide so it is doing well he wants to move it now law should he do it this fall or wait until spring\nSo I Would say actually fall is not a bad time to be moving things again the plants are are going dormant they're not an active states have growth so the the shock that you'll um you know anytime we move a plant there is some shock value going on um but doing it in fall minimizes that a little bit\nUm but I Would still say makes 'em if things keep up you shouldn't have to water it any additionally but um if things ever do dry out after you move it definitely makes sure you're giving up some good water I also would proven that the\nPrint back fairly significantly just to reduce stress next spring so the ...\nPlant on reduced root system but after a year or so it should push through and recovered just fine [noise] that\nSounds good to me thanks for that email Pete appreciate you can email to add ideas that WPRI died or post an email and phone too if you want Kevin in Madison it's your turn\nGood morning I enjoy the show um I had a question about ... or and I got a lot of athletes and the Lakers right here in town and I'm Wondering ... treat them with us stumped killing product in the winter months\nI it should be I I haven't done I don't have a lot of personal experience with a box or in but I'm from what I Know of other sort of invasive treatments I\nI think it would be okay I I Would probably do more in the fall than deep winter I'm On the plane to fully dormant and not actively growing it's it may not absorb the herbicide quite as well so if you're if you do it maybe an October November that probably is going to be a better back then January or February\nYeah I'm pretty sure of that and usually on the labels you're going to uh get that information ah Eris ingestion says to win to\nTo make those applications so take a look at the label for whatever it is you buy and then as you ... ... as you do that you make those cuts and and I I Know for sure when you do make a caught a you should be applying that product\nRight that's right away right away if you don't wanna wait [noise] not waiting around because otherwise it's certainly than not as effective\nJoined in at eight hundred six four to one two three four winter some of your before I go back to the phones what are some of your favorite winter interest\nPlans or one in particular for right now and Sony as are just an amazing plant especially the ... which is one of our native I'm Sonia is a ... they are just about to go a really strong golden lemon yellow color they're just really spectacular this time of year\nThey also in spring have these big clusters of beautiful blue star ships flowers and are fairly disease resistance they sort of once they're in their their in I'd almost treat 'em like a shrub in the sense that they don't they don't like to move the a and they will just sort of stay put\nAnd you know this is the\nTime of the year when it's awfully tempting you know the garden centers are all I'm offering they'll season yes yeah it's sales season so should we be taking advantage of that\nYes absolutely that follows a tremendous time to be doing planting um again the typically the stresses on the plan to the getting establish or less we're not going through you know Ninety degree days and droughts um they can get their roots initially establish but again if you're going to be doing for planting I'd be doing it in the next couple of weeks I wouldn't wait much longer [noise]\nCertainly the roots do extend beyond that point and it's not ideal to disturb that area but anything under that root zone is the most precious and um if you're really looking to preserve that tree I Would I Would consider relocating the patio someplace else\nOr we're looking at ... off to flip the gravel I was going to add a standard grab a lot of it is that correct\nYeah it it's still still sort of the same condition so any um complexion 'cause the roots are actually breathing also at the same time they sort of found where they like to be\nUm relative to the soil surface in any compassion with equipment or sand or gravel or adding height can can do a you may not see the damage and the first year but in three to five years if you went through with this the tree would likely suffering decline\n[noise] yeah it's it's too bad those is maple roots are really shallow right yes maybe ... very shallow so they're even more susceptible than a perhaps some other trees um although many many trees species are pretty shallow rooted when you get right down to it\nSo there you go oh by the house and we are to be the bearer of bad I mean that's where we can tell you on that but I'd look for three to five years from now having some problems with your tree if you go ahead with it so something to think about up to you to decide what you want to do let's go to Mary and lucky shot next I marry\n[noise] Hi\nI'm Scott ... that were plant it's apathy Thirteen fourteen years ago and they had it at all and they've got these seed pods and do I need to pick them up show them out\nYou said ... they are really yes\nYeah well have you ever divided them no\nI Would say it's um if you said you've had them for over ten years and that's why\nIt yes and and they've never had that sense\nI Would say it's time um so I wouldn't you could do it this fall yet again if you if you do lifting divide them I can I Do it in the next week or so I Do it I wouldn't wait too much longer um but you can also do them in ... next spring just as easily but get dividing them will really rejuvenate the plants should help us flowering\nThe the the seed pods that it's hard for me to know without seeing what if it's an actual seed pod or ... it may be something else but uh in terms of encouraging more blooms definitely a sort of lifting and rejuvenate into plants would help tremendously\nOkay if we if we divided them in the next ... how do we store them for the winter\nI Would plant them right back in the ground I'm so dig them up divide them and put them right back in the they shouldn't um they won't they won't like being stored over winter so they are very hearty they can go back outside\nSo much alright thanks a lot for calling ... call\nTurn ... good morning how are you re appreciate your call\nWell I'm calling about a Trump that find that I planted earlier in the spring it took off it had some little it was green it'll it's going great and the south side of the house later in the season about a month and a half ago during August it started to turn yellow and looked like it was dying\nNow this is my first go around with it so I don't know is there something I should or shouldn't do in the fall to hope that comes back in the spring\nMost of my experience with trumpet vine as it takes a lot to kill them so I my guess is this may be sort of just\nFirst your troubles also um you could be related to all the water we had in some fashion um but I wouldn't I wouldn't stress out too much I'd I'd I'd wait until spring and see how it does but my gut is telling me you'll be okay\nHow bad it could\nBe yeah hopefully next year you're going to have a great trumpet vine I had I tried for four years to get a trumpet vine to go in a particular spot\nAnd then I finally realized that trumpet vine does not those trumpet vines I tried to plant do not like that [laughter] so I just gave up on it [noise] unfortunately I had to\nHave some sometimes a location such as yet if this was the first year I'd give it if I give them extra measure of how it all absolutely especially with the gang busters this year I I'd say you're you're on a good track\nLike Glenn thank you thanks a lot or let's go to a Joanne in Washington Island tied Joanne\nThanks for taking my call your two quick questions I later found geraniums in planters outside and I fight over which can I Know it's coming from and give money to water down well they survive\nYou can move them indoors um they will still I'm so these are actually plants if I'm ... I'm thinking correctly of what you have these are native to South Africa and so they actually are um like it a little hot and dry and so they're not\nUm I Would say in terms of watering let them get just a bit drier you don't want to bone dry but they don't need to be sopping wet all the time\nUm but definitely in a place with highlights um high heat there they will enjoy a bit\nUm the the downside is that they can get a bit ... over the course of the winter so by the time you're getting to march and April they may just kind of look like little wire ... trees um\nYou can sort of a nip those goes growing tips off and it will encourage doormen buds to leaf out and it'll get bushy and look really good again for the next growing season\nOr a very ... only real quick\nCan I'm a night candy Bush's at this time of year\nYes this is the time to do ... yes\nThere you go thanks a lot Joanne for calling appreciate it talking today with Ben food a director of the Alan centennial garden I'm Larry meal or for garden talk here on the ideas network\nHere's a look at what's coming up this afternoon here on the ideas network at twelve thirty on chapter day Jim Fleming reads from rules of civility by a more tolls\nThen joined us from one till three for science friday after one we'll get a roundup of all the latest news in science after to the story of what life was like before food ingredients were regulated and stay with us after three for central time\n[noise] [noise] Hi I'm dead Gordon this week on pain I started thinking I Wonder if he is in pain I Wonder how he\nFeels and it was funny because it started raining he seemed\nUs to talk about her new album world on\nSaturday at eleven on the ideas now [noise]\nSupport for WPRI comes from the worm farm Institute hosting fermentation fast October sixth through the fourteenth with a farm art detour where artists explore the connection between land in people fermentation fast dot com\nWisconsin Public radio stays connected with the whole state thanks to its network of Seventy arose with reporters on the ground across Wisconsin WPRI provides a news service that connect with the issues that matter to your life stay in touch with WNPR\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.
