I think on every show you've ever done Joe\nI think you're right we usually get at least one phone phone call about how to manage it because it's such a chronic condition and people have it for so long and it is it is very difficult to manage and what causes it\nWell it's usually a gradual insidious onset of overuse um where the structures on the bottom of our foot actually get somewhat stretched out and irritated or plan or fashion attaches into our ... our heel bone and without adequate support when we take a step\nEverytime we take a step it kind of tug or pulls on it irritates that connected totally is and that's I watch\nThat does hurt a lot and mechanically you know what happens is this fast show it at the end by your toes spreads out over the the bottom of your foot to the base of each of those toes\nBut then it comes back to a single point on your heel and so all that force is is directed at one spot and some people will say well I have a heel spurs so if I just get rid of that he'll spur won't my pain go away and it's important to understand that the bony spurs you see\nIs really a symptom of the problem it's a symptom of that constant hugging that's happening happening on the ... bone that Jill described so it is not the cause of the problem but it's a sign that you have chronic hugging or stretching there and that foot needs to be supported\nYeah your I over over time I've heard you talk about a variety\nOf treatments for a what treatments are out there and which ones work about\nThat's a great question so there was a really nice clinical practice guidelines which is somebody who summarizes all the information that we have out there on a specific thing um and the clinical practice guidelines for heel pain which came out a few years ago really found very good quality evidence\nLee Esther news fellowship providing early career journalists the opportunity to learn hands on reporting editing and broadcasting in a professional setting as part of the WPRI news department\nSupport also comes from Jay handy of walnut Capital Management focusing on financial planning in times of transition such as retirement inheritance or the sale of a business walnut Capital Management proud to support Wisconsin Public radio\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio joined the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

R. dot org and like us on Facebook at the ideas network\n\nWe're taking a look at all sorts of physical therapy issues we zeroed in a little on ... but the other issues have come up as well with our two gas Laurie ... bomb I'm Larry ...\nThanks for joining us today we're we're going to go right back to the phones and take another call Diane in Green Bay thanks for waiting\nFor your call I enter you there\nYes I Am a go ahead what's your question\nA static question it's just a statement I had an affair she had us twice in my ... told me that when I get out of bed\nI should stand by my bed and count to a hundred and twenty before I take that first step certainly not a cure but it did help as this is true or was this just my happy thinking\n[laughter] I Know I I think there's definitely some science to its so typically when we sleep at night especially if you're not in that night's blend your plan our fashion than a shortened position\nAnd those first few steps in the morning where we immediately stretch our plan or fashion I can be very painful so to stand and kind of slowly let that tissue kind of remodel and stretch back out very slowly before we take those first few steps\nMakes good sense we tell patients as they hit their news that that's when they should do some stretching of their plan or fashion while they're in bed so that idea of not going from and immediately shortened position to a sudden rapid quick load in your plan of fashion makes good sense yeah if you just\nUm bring your ankle up and down and pull your toes upper back a little bit just sort of up and down some ankle pump some toe wiggling to increase the circulation and warm up that tissue on the bottom of your foot will certainly help as well as just standing\nBut if you have to go to the back right really I don't know that I can count to a hundred and I don't know [laughter]\n... and we're going my garage a bully hide for ... as you're giving me the ... Diane for that good advice [laughter] freeze you that\nWell county in New Lisbon just at the point of this morning I think yeah for her ... her\nOutlaw thank you for taking my call it yeah it's very timely um I a doctor or the other guy so that I could barely walk and he is part is on China might feel which helped a little\nBut quite resolved a ball and it's quite a bit so he sent me that's that's a therapy at once for\nTherapists found a lot of ... ... kilometers that I probably have tonight is in my shirt edition of the planet that that is I'm Wondering that why cause the other and is it going to complicate recovered\n... those are that's an excellent question so the Achilles tendon attaches on the back side of the ... and your plan of fashion\nAspect of the ... and some people think that those two are very intimately connected and almost play tug of war on that he'll bone so indeed ... there there is a relationship there and which one came for its it's difficult to say although in your case it sounds like it's the plan or ...\nIf it altered the way you walked which it sounds like it did because you had mentioned that you had it was so painful for you to walk just changing your gait pattern may have been enough to eradicate irritate your Achilles tendon\nInterestingly Achilles tendon stretching stretching and they'd kill these is um in our list of ways to manage planner fashion as interestingly about eighty percent of people have plan of fashion ... will get better if you just give them Achilles stretching\nYeah and you'll have to work with your physical therapist on your Achilles tendon I'd us if you have a lot of swelling crop of tests if you have nachos you may need to be in a booth for a while\nUm and then if things calm down and you start to feel better than you really have to do the therapy so that these things don't come back it doesn't mean just because you feel better\nThan everything is cured and you can be on your way so you really should talk with your physical therapist and work closely with that person as well as your physician to see if you need to be in a booth\nFor awhile and interesting we talked about tonight isn't tend to notice is it really sounds like county truly has that Achilles tendon night is because she has that swelling that ... that makes us really think it's more in that acute face so mobilizing her for a little bit like we're sending it but it would be a good strategy\nTo know how you do county yeah thanks a lot for calling appreciate it on to fill in Kingston I though\nFor in a room for taking my call I just got a lot of the show and a\nLot of pain a complicated I also have peripheral neuropathy from diabetes\nMhm so it's like a double whammy there I mean so\nWhat am I good friendship and Archie she's on her fruit for twelve hours a day in a hospital\nSo she's getting shot and a friend a good friend her sister shared laser Thirty years ago and it was just disappeared after that the laser surgery surgery at the time\nSo I'm just told her new structures right now and my doctor said it could be weeks or even months before the relief so with the peripheral neuropathy in my foot\nAnd so forth what or should I be doing besides stretching since it seems like the complicated and it's kind of come in with the pain 'cause I'm getting paid from both\nMechanically it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever but it you know let it work but it works exactly so so the that's that's our advice we can give you all kinds of advice in terms of\n... counters in controlling excessive pro nation and he'll cops and on and on and on but really at the end of the day it's what you can wear that doesn't hurt your heal\nRight they'll let us go from the shoes to the socks off from ... called ask our our compression socks\nHelpful to lay health or are they so compression socks of recovery socks are what we call those and they're they have just a very low grade um compression and usually about Fifteen millimeters of ... you can get more\nAnd the theory behind them is if you wear them posed exercise they help kind of courage blood flow encourage return to the heart\nI don't think there's a tremendous amount of research I think they've looked at that and I don't have anything a paper off the top of my head but I remember just reading about this where\nIt's a subjectively people after races um there was no really no difference between those who wore compression socks and those who didn't but I think I Would put it in the same category as the shoes right if you feel like you recover better and your legs feel better the next day after you've worn nice for\nYou know racing or walking or running or whatever your activity as\nAgain it's an individual choice there may be people who have just dynamite circulation and their legs and everything moves through there and they clear away waste products beautifully like like the best you know trash men around\nAnd then you have other people were things are a little bit sluggish and maybe get a little bit of accumulation of fluid down there and your legs feel a little heavy the next day so a little bit of compression to help facilitate that circulation can can certainly help\nI Would I Will tell you a group anecdotally who I Know who I work with that feels they are the best thing since sliced bread\nAnd those are our surgeons who have to instill in or for a long period of time and have to ... stand\nAnd they would end up with a lot of swelling in their ankles at the end of the day just because they couldn't promote good circulation and on our days when they have to just static stand for a long period of time they find that wearing these compression socks some of them actually wear them up on to their thighs is very helpful\nYou could certainly extrapolate that to a number\nOf different professions out ... to ... I paid my er er I I have to grocery store right oh right exactly\nYeah that's a classic example the checkout people\nThat got post so there you go let's take a call from Sarah in Deerfield Hi Sarah\nHello thank you for taking my call sure\nUm I have a first I have a comment about Kelly said that I had I had it in both ankles not right away but they developed over the course of your hand and it failed physical therapy and and boots table they had actually play leverage clouds and actually I'm In each Achilles tendon\nAbout a month apart and had amazing results that I they were quite sick and Nabil shift and he'll caused quite a bit of pain but I never met plants are fast she ate is associated with it was all Achilles tendon pain [noise]\nUm I Am so it's really having further foot problem of course the low yells at fought led to the um but I'm Wondering if there's any any further research on a play the rich plasma Jackson's um for things other than to let it be like without that applies to officiate us [noise]\nUm if that is it all hopeful a correlation with that that's a\nThat's a great question so we have looked at research regarding platelet rich plasma for multiple tend to know since ... or ... rich plasma is is they take blood your own blood and they centrifuge that and they used the\nPlasma rich part of it and they inject that into the area of tend to notice pending officer tenant apathy and an almost kind of create select better terms low pac man said go in and they eat away that the bad materials and helps you kind of promote the healing process to lay down new structures\nSo I'm interestingly enough it has not been proven to be successful in the treatment of plan or ... it's been a critical\nUm and part of it probably has to do with the blood supply to the plan of flash a plan or fashion so we talk about Achilles tendon that's connected to a muscle that's got good blood supply same thing when we talk about treating tennis elbow um so the planet fashion ... seems to be a bit of an outlier in so far\nThere hasn't been any studies regarding ... rich plasma showing\n'em that to be highly effective and the treatment of planner flashlight us\nThere you go thank you Sarah for calling appreciate your call Laurie John Brody and Joe time missing bomb our against any\nLaurie a physical therapist athletic trainer at U.

T. or an OTC\nAnd yes in Madison there's there's lots of people who are here who could help you\nKnow we have a hand clinic right W\nSo good luck on that data and just stay with me here Mary and Madison had a trigger finger on her middle finger diagnose she's taking ibuprofen a splint on that finger she finds that holding a hot beverage him a cop helps the akin or hair and\nWould adding a heat cold regimen help she's wandering it it could um\nYou know usually you go to a heat called regimen weather's where there's noticeable swelling are we really want to kind of flushed the system so I'm with somebody at the trigger finger it's usually there's usually not that much swelling and Bob but it's usually just um that's ...\nYeah sometimes heat cold as nice in the summer vice fire out of the fact that it feels so much better um in terms of her ... with the warmth my guess is the coldest kind of increased Iraq for her I agree\nWith diet help the reduced the information Mary wanders sure\nI mean anytime you can take an inflammatory components out of your diet um you should fall it interestingly she said she's taking ibuprofen so my guess is the ibuprofen is helping or she wouldn't be taking it and it's an anti inflammatory\nSo that would suggest that inflammation is part of the the puzzle for her so switching to an anti inflammatory diet certainly could help it's not going to be immediate it will take time\nAnywhere act [noise] All right you're loyal do have a question for us [noise]\nI Do get afternoon ladies and Larry I'm I tore my collateral ligament in my left index finger about a month ago and I was a little hesitant to have surgery done on it for about the last six weeks I've just an strapping\nUm that finger to my middle finger but only at night while I was not possible for me to do that during the day time on my job I'm Wondering if I have any other options other than surgery or what I'm currently\nDoing so do you have a ... near to form a near a swan neck deformity as anybody use those words with you know\nOkay so I it it'd be worth seeing somebody because when you do damage does collateral ligaments then what happens is other tendons Ken over power it and you can basically end up with a long term deformity in a called a swan neck\nOr ... near depending on which tendons takeover\nSo it would be worth seeing somebody for that and you too could be\nI'm seeing an occupational therapist for this there's some really nice low profile splints that you can wear that will kind of minimize the deformity and still keep your hand quite functional I'm so maybe a couple of exercises from an oath tea and then a splint recommendation for you\nGood luck thank you so much for calling I'm back to ... for a minute a gym from wasps are called to say that biking was the only thing that helped his platter fast shyness\nMhm well it's it's nice it's non impact and so but it's still good blood flow in circulation to your to your lower extremities\nRight and it may be getting some a little bit of pressure on your on your plan or fashion and it may be getting a little bit of repetitive stretching as you go around in the cycle and particularly if he switched from a weight bearing activity so I don't know if he was doing nothing and then bicycle than it helped\nBut if he had been doing something like an elliptical or walking or running where he was weight bearing and switch to a non weight bearing activity that could have been as much as anything terms of help right\n[noise] and a boy here we are but out of time quickly here Roy and we're seeing is Seventy six has beyond several must be a successful cancer treatment has neuropathy in his toes anything there that might help\nWell I Would suggest seeing a physical therapist and I see many people\nIn the pool mom who taught\nNeed re conditioning particularly after cancer therapy and they have various op joint pains are neuropathy or whatever and we get them moving in a pool with some ... waiting but some resistance to the water [noise]\nAlways a pleasure you too thank you so much you're back in November nineteenth and we'll all over again Laurie ... missing bomb Laurie physical therapist athletic trainer at U.
