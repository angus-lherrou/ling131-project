anything it's a nice looking old just made one handle it\n[noise] I'm Glad to see the photo at is a forward or floor drawers chest with two hanky boxes are which are small drawers and on top\nWhat really gives it away for its style is the carving that kind of spoon carving we call it that you know it looks like it's been dug out with a spoon is indicative of the east lake period and east lake is the name of the man who discovered this kind of carving or is known for it\nAnd um it's probably in a period of Eighteen Ninety to Nineteen hundred right in that era is one of the east like\nUm and the hanky boxes would fit right in with that period as well it um is missing one of its original jar pulls there are um seven of the eight of them but it's missing one um but it looks very nice I Can't tell from the photo if it's been re finished or not\nBut since it's from the or grandfather I'm sure she plans to keep it in the family so for insurance value\nI think we'd be looking around maybe um three hundred and fifty four hundred or so and yeah they have gone down in value recently because of the popularity of this uh era or has gone down\n[noise] with figure call Elizabeth and plaid Bill thanks for waiting what's on your mind\n[noise] I have a chair that was a wedding present my parents they weren't married in Nineteen eleven [noise]\nIt is a wouldn't share it's very it's a

our cat it came down through my family [noise] mhm [noise]\nA furniture from that period as not real collectible right now I think you know they probably have value more as a a family heirloom rather than currently um\nBe depending on what it is when I sell though as I usually can't do better than maybe fifty or Seventy five dollars a chair at best and that's for a really good condition with uh all the upholstery in good condition and original condition as well so enjoy them\n[laughter] there you go oh just to go to some of our email questions Peter was wondering if you know\nHe has a cuss deli\nChair and I don't know if you\nCan see the uh it's sort of a grade share\nYeah like a great chair and it's molded plastic on a metal frame and this falls into the mid century modern\nA category and that category is\nHot right now people like uh especially young people who are furnishing their homes love this style\nUm as well as the Danish cheek Danish and that kind of thing uh goes with that I was well I don't know which model chair that says but I there is a face but a group if you get on Facebook\nFor mid century model I think it's called mid century modern collectors and pickers or something of that nature and they seem to know from a picture any model or maker\nOr that kind of thing so that would be a good place to look for that but it is a very popular category right now\nRon in Iowa ... emailed to ask of who he would take a rare Winnie the Pooh print to for appraisal so print\nYeah I'm One he says it's rare he must know something about it um\nBecause we don't
