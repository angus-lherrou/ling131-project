W. Madison insect diagnostic lab and he stops by to talk about insects every few months has always great to have him come by and have for you or are there some bugs that are bugging you right now we\nA more maybe you have a photo of an insect that's kind of a cool phone or maybe you just wonder what the insect is you can email to us at ideas at W. P. R. dot org or phone in with your questions at one eight hundred\nSix four to one two three four and silk dealt with Terry welcome back good to have you with us nice to be here well I've got a ... tree is still sitting out on the second storey deck\nAnd probably be bringing why me in in a couple of weeks or weaker it's starting to get to the boy where a live tree ought to be coming inside but you know you always worry a little bit about what might come in with ...\n... ... it was quite common for me to get calls in the lab in November and December of ... plants that were placed outside for the summer brought in and all of a sudden we get an explosion of spider minds\nTo be honest so spider bites were on the plants when they're outdoors but the environmental conditions are such that they don't thrive they do well in hot dry conditions so you bring them into a heated home and they explode\nNow the problem is when you got something big like that to treat indoors so it is probably a good practice to treat your plants before you bring in and you can use the insecticide all soap products\nAlready widespread you know the only problem is that usually it takes two applications because they don't kill the jury well so usually you treat them treat again a couple of weeks you'll find\nThe other headaches that we get our various critters in the soil um things like fungus knee outs and even once in a while I find ants moving millipedes\nThey don't pose the plant any problem it's just a nuisance of bringing things in in in so\nIn particular if you're adding organic matter to the soil some of the non organic potty mixes won't support those kinds of critters but uh\nSo I said we've got some organic matter fungus after more than happy to take advantage of that so I I should probably be treating lend me right away and then\nI think this is ... yeah because again the difficulty of spring ... will be the same suggestions but you know it doesn't usually gotta get tarps and things and so that you don't get soapy water on the floor is like and\nAccidental introduction although USDA used to release these things for other purposes but they were never quite successful\nUm the Asian stink bug them our brightest stink bug um problem started to rumble in in the early to thousands in the Pennsylvania area and then have migrated from there and our first records if I remember right we're about two thousand and ten\nBut the problem with both those critters is that just like the box elder bug they over winter as adults they seek shelter um and being non natives ten typical of invasive insects their populations are kind of out of whack they're they're really much higher than what our native more balanced species would have [noise]\nAnd so that that the\nMore seems in ... uh that are in a building the more places they can get into a but I've seen them at you know Thirteen floor of a building so it's you can't get too high to get away from them\nAnd um [noise] their activity will come and go depending on the outside air temperature um but again from this September October period of time every time you get a sunny day it's kinda like you get everybody charged up and they keep coming and\nThe question is is you know in a in a perfect world you could find out where the places are and seal them up\nI'm here's Mart and then of an apartment or you've had all kinds of places you know in Indian is especially if you get an older building it's just somebody seems and crafts you know that it may be very difficult\nNow again you can you can go to the hardware store and buy sprays to put around the outside of the window frame it and I would really argue spring outside is far more effective than spraying inside improv inside of they already got there and die you still gotta clean them up\nIn the sprays have some repellent sea isle also tell you that you're generally find the Asian lady beetles are easier to kill them to stink bugs the products we're using stink bugs are only marginally effective and that's what's been frustrating and\nIt's been ... and all the places in the state where it's been a problem the west side of Madison for the last couple three years have definitely been hot spot and if it's been interesting because I knew this problem was coming even before I retired it has been slow to develop is as severely as I suspected\nBut we haven't seen anything yet if you if you look at what happened in Maryland and New Jersey and Pennsylvania and I hope we don't get there\nBut instead of a dozen people start talking about hundreds\nComing in and and even though they're harmless I'm not a good feeling for having stink bugs crawling around in your house and when you're sleeping in the whole thing so they said for now I if you can see any kind of you know holes in the screen those kinds of things that are obvious sometimes clocking around window frames or other devices\nFor most structures you you've got to be sure that the vents up in the roof are screened properly with small enough mass screen that the insects can't get in because that's often an access point once they get in the addict they can come down through light fixtures and other other things\nThere you go Martin good luck thank you so much for calling ... just filled pellets Terry our aghast at age illness do our producer a day ... rats are engineer I'm Larry mailer

[noise] well thanks a lot Louisa for calling appreciate it so the early bird if he applied at the proper time perhaps it maybe a couple of applications\nWere my comments come from is is I'm aware of research that has been done with the product is in the early bird I'm Marilyn self through this toxic to the worms but used as a concentrate\nAnd so then you spray it like anything else and the problem is is that product has not been developed a registered for the use in so that the only way the early bird people got this product through is to make a very dilute form and call it a fertilizer\nAnd you know again if you've got to get rid of him in your garden going I understand it but you know I was six dollar investment is is they said it's it's it's significant I don't think you walk into the slightly seeing what the battle is they will be interesting if this persist now as far as the abrasive product\nYou know we have used similar types of of strategy sometimes for and control in golf courses of\nUsing products or a same thing they have used against Mike rollers or a problem and golf courses they some of these abrasive products ought to do some positive effect in in so I can see that too I mean I'm curious if they had to be ... how you worked at the end of the soil to get to\nThe distribution or to be effective but uh that's that's encouraging you know if this ever when I find curious about jumping worms is this has been something that's been established for quite a longer period of time down south and you don't hear them complain about the plant problems\nUm but um I I Know what you mean about the coffee grounds I experienced the same type of thing and and as I said I'm Will see in the next couple of years how the public to regard holds up to this I Hope it doesn't go downhill but I I've seen other cases in where things really get crazy is when you start talking about ones because I don't know how\nThe thing about bedbugs um ... you know people would look for a lot of a novel ways to control them including insect hormones which it sounds like this was one of those products\nUm people have been looking at pheromones in the like and you know there have been encouraging but but the bottom line is I have not seen the magic bullet other than heat\nI mean he is the one product that they they're not going to develop resistance to it's always going to have advocacy and the like I'm In in so you know I Am aware of it I although I remember one of the original experiments with one of these insect hormones um\nGet killed some of the bed bugs but if you looked at over time the ones that didn't kill cause them to have more off springs what really cause or the ... it's complicated when you start playing around with animals\nHormones in the like it it gets complicated so um I I'm just wondering without knowing exactly what their product is but I again I'm Sunni that's one of the insect juvenile hormones which are these insect hormones that have been looked at for quite some time and they had been somewhat promising but in other cases somewhat surprisingly disappointing and their advocacy\nLet's take another call Tom and iron would Michigan has something for as Hi Tom\nGood morning good\nMorning or good morning I'm calling from the south shore of Lake Superior near the border of Wisconsin in the UP and I spoke to you uh oh gosh year or so ago\nAnd they explained the situation I'm throwing your slate a curve ball from the subject but typically around uh July Fourth\nOr when the weather is hot and the breezes from the south\nWe get an inundation of what I Believe our foreign ... they're they're fighting twice that resemble house flies mhm uh but but they swarm in not by the hundreds\nNot by the thousands and I'm not exaggerating by the tens of thousands if ... if you stand outside on these old gosh typically maybe ten days during the summer on and off when the breezes from the south I temperature high humidity it seems\nA you stand outside for oh thirty seconds you'll have\nLet's see I Try not to exaggerate probably two hundred on your body trying\nTo bite you and I I I yes yes and if you talk to anybody in this area you'll you'll get the same story\nAh I don't expect that there's anything you could do or recommend I think it's way beyond that but I wanted to extend an invitation era bug guy\nOr you want to see something pretty fascinating I Would extend an invitation to visit ... hey I Would add to that that I guess I I watch it as the I'm not exaggerating\nHaving said that um is there anything we can do in our yard half acre yard anything where we have cash we after all them and send them tell him not to call me there's no doubt I'm Out there [noise]\nOkay so the interesting this is definitely what we call a stable fly\nIn stable flies breed and fresh or green ... organic matter in so there are a problem in livestock operations because of the writing hand the like\nBut it's also been an argued that they can breed on riding seaweed\nAnd you know it's maybe not to the degree but I have had complaints up and along the superior a lake shore and it has been documented the stable flies can travel\nTo three hundred miles you know they've they've done this by marking flies and releasing them catch him on hold distance away and so when I'm at a loss to to to come up with is exactly where the devil they're coming from\nNow what I think probably happens is is because of the temperature changes like when they go over the water it's I think that if they're getting blown up and you had mentioned about the kind of a sudden the air flow\nAnd I think that it's like running into a wall when they get the cooler conditions of the water and that's why they're accumulating along the shore\nYou know they they live for a couple of three weeks and so by can be quite miserable\nBut as I said what would be really interesting to know is where the devil is it is it a somewhat local source I Can't believe I can blame this and the people in Nebraska or what I you know we're now got big cattle operations but that's that's typically where we go look for 'em in and it's it's not dry heat gets wet hey it's that\nStuff that is right in the interface between the ground and in in the ... that are starting to rot in the like that's where they also could breeding grass clippings you know but it's your you know ... like they have gotten so they said it's a very curious thing of of where the devil I'm In\n... and I've never heard of good explanations I said speculate could be see we I don't think you've got the seaweed sitting on the lake shore up there I'm now but uh [noise]\nThere we go to them it's still a bit of a mystery as to where they're coming from but uh there's no doubt that there are there [laughter] I could tell you that they gave her calling Carol in Milwaukee your turn I care\nAbout it naturally than\nOkay I'm not familiar that cliff

mind\nWell I've been using a product or I won't name it but it's Ninety nine point two percent pure garlic Jewish\nAnd I mix it with water and use it as an area spray and I used to adult problem was stable flies and mosquitoes and chicks and triggers and it says it killed all of them and based on my experience it seems to be doing it without hurting the\nThe beat and macadam such I was just on during the show it at any opinion on that\nA lot of workers went in the last ten Fifteen Years of looking at natural products as insecticides in in in all of these products in nature that's the way the plants make them is to keep the insects away from\nThem and so what you find is when you get down to the nitty gritty many of these are oil based products if you spray them directly on most critters you will kill them\nBut where they they seem to fall off to me is that they degrade so quickly it's not like you know the difference between some of the synthetic chemicals that we've been using that when you spray on a wall anything that walks in a while for the next month is dead\nType of thing versus with many of these natural products if you spray the critter in in laboratory setting it dies the device spray it let it dry in the ant walks across that it's not affected\nSo as I said I I I don't doubt that this stuff works the question is how long and under what circumstances in\nYou know and the other thing that makes it difficult is with you know twenty five thousand different species of insects you can get twenty five thousand different reactions but in general the natural products that are oil based products do have a contact kill a built into them in many cases but what they failed to have is a residual killed down the road so\nInteresting thanks

control does this all actually about two weeks ago I noticed a quite a few grubs and I pulled back Assad um I tried treated him what one chemical by there and at a week later they were still there is there anything\nSo I'm just wondering I'm One of the best time to control those things\nThere are but until they get established you know that's typically what happens with invasive is the reason that they get out of whack as the things that naturally control them aren't here now what will happen with stink bugs is some of our native of predators and parasites will probably crossover\nBut if they continue to be out of whack what USDA will probably be doing it I'm sure they've been doing that already has go back to the country of origin try to understand what affects their population there\nBut if you do find something in trying to get it introduced in the United states is a ten to Fifteen year process because you've got to do all the research to make sure they don't have negative impacts\nIn some of our original problems from fifty sixty years ago when we didn't quite do as diligent of a of a a screening\nTurns out that we created problems with things we brought in here and so now that's why the screening takes so long as you have to find something that's very specific that will affect stink bugs without affecting other things um and so they said I I'm not aware of any research there might be some of that going on but even if it is it's not going to be a quick fix\n[noise] we had them by the way you can join an eight hundred six four to one two three four will get ... pretty quickly at open lines market or emailed in a photo\nTo say found this caterpillar pretty one in the capital of Bahrain area looks kind of like a wooly barrier caterpillar but as more than twice the size of its kind of a a ... almost so a light cream color with a a big black fuzzy\nYeah in fact I think in between the segments it almost\nThis is the caterpillar of something called the leopard moss I'm In a neat critter even in the adult stage um it's in that same family there's a number of fuzzy larvae that you will find a but as I said this one because I I have seen it before or is I think the larval stage of elaborate off it's really really\nKind of pretty actually yeah I I Need critters in as I said in this case\nIf somebody ... grow up to be kind of boring brown gray things leopard was it's worth taking a look at a pretty impressive credit [noise] well we have some more callers online\nYou can take your questions at one eight hundred six four to one two three four email us again at ideas that WPRI dot org always love to hear from you\nOr Linda saw this on her car a photo of a a\nA green or ... praying mantis which\nAre not native to Wisconsin in fact there's both a an Asian species in the European species in the U.S there are some native may have to ... in both the southeast and southwest\nBut this is one of my favorite line on the show as always been the governor moved to Missouri inhale us how well mantis could never survive the winter here there are cases would freeze out but now we have breeding populations in the southern third of the state and up in door county also and this was all because of the lack of cold weather in the winter\nUm and so things have changed Samantha's can be found here I'm naturally if we ever had a incredibly severe winter with thirty five below statewide for a period of time it probably would knock\nThem down but we have not seen that in so as I said it's a pleasant a new introduction some some introduction is not so pleasant methods are nice and in northern Wisconsin has a question I add\nI have a we have that and I just would like to know what is the life cycle out of them and all all we are cleaning and\nCheating and we did have a pet can kill her than calm and he said he felt like what we were doing was\nDoing the job that how long is it going to take us to change these\nSo you know although human bed bug has become a major issue in the last ten years throughout the world but specially for us here um the other thing that I I\nI always do when people say the bed bugs there is a species associated with bats there's a species associate with Barnes swallows in honestly they tend to be far less problematic in much easier to control\nThe major reason why we've had such a problem with um human bed bugs is the resistance so many of the treatments that we have\nAnd so I'm fearful that you cannot clean your way out of this um because they're so insidious um their populations can double and triple in three months time\nI'm In in you know 'cause they're basically laying in a number of eggs in as I said it's about a three month life cycle normally but the female will a clutch of eggs every day and so they can like any insect explode geometrical\nUm what did the pest control services do or did they spray or did they do it he treatment or\nNo he actually gets a examine the roll with the way our we had found them and I felt within like two bedrooms and basically it started in the living\nOkay do do do you have anybody in the house all the dust has quite a bit of travel history of are you brought on a used furniture in the house in the last six\nMonths you know not that we did not Cadillac thousands or any place\nBut then again I\nHonestly think it would be worth the effort of catching it\nSupport for WPRI comes from the University of Wisconsin stout offering online undergraduate and graduate degrees and professional education that certificate options for adult learners you

in front of me quite easily with a whole bunch of products but the problem is they get in the seams and ... hide away in places you can't get to and that's where you've got to be more aggressive and

right they have a a\nA site I Know they've got one on cicadas but I think they've got one on on a Katy did or you just do a search on Katie to calls and then go through it I think you'll find when
