Thirty years in the business\nAnd if you've heard him talk before on the show you know there's not much you can answer when it comes to cars\nAnd I hope you'll join in with your own questions or comments we'll talk about getting ready for winter driving I Will answer your vehicle questions\nAnd you can call us at one eight hundred six four to one two three four or\nYou can email us at ideas at WPRI dot org and ...\nSupport for WPRI comes from the terrible university offering educator programs for more than one hundred twenty five years with master's degree and licensure options on line and regionally throughout Wisconsin and Iowa the terrible dot edu\nYes I the ... say they should be thirty should cheat deflate them\nWell depending on where she is I'm guessing probably in Wisconsin and in that case the answer is probably not and the reason for that is that manufacturers have a set\nPressure and it can be a little confusing because the higher may have an umpire will have a number on it that's the maximum pressure\nTo manufacture doesn't know what that tires going on so it ... the real suspect you want to read is the placard on the drivers door jammed either on the end of the drivers door to door jammed that will say\nWhat the pressure should be however that's under ideal driving conditioned and that would be ideal temperatures\nManufacturers have a chart that we use in the shop you're supposed to anticipate what the temperature is going to be for the next three to six months of the customers driving and in fact in colder anticipated temperatures there is an inflation of about three to five pounds depending on the size of the higher what this back as\nThat you do increase them so um that that you know it's a tire pressure is too high under different conditions you aware of the the very center part of the tire more but that that is likely to correct specter Wisconsin for the season that we're going into [noise] and here's another\nEmail that relates to this as well just a Julie emailed to say that car she's giving to our son should have the tires replaced for driving in snow butter son lives in Nashville, Tennessee catchy hold off on replacing\nYou know that that uh yeah I don't know Nashville get some winter weather that's probably not ah the predominant whether that he's going to be driving and um the the where the the couple of things about front tires if if the tires are getting down to four or five thirty seconds of an inch\nThat still usable tried the legal limit most states has to thirty seconds of an inch but stopping distances even on what road without any winter conditions just in the summertime driving on wet roads\nTo stopping distances increased greatly when you have reduced tried like that when you're on when they're in that range of four or five thirty seconds of an inch\nA software change and and then there may be a revised that comes out so that's something you know if you took it in there probably isn't one available now but if your complaints filed enough people complain\nThey decided that characteristics a little bit you know a little bit too rough for most people they they may come up with an enhanced meant for that or re flash on the other thing is that yeah it's true that there is not a mostly transmissions don't have a district where you can check it yourself but\nThere is a message that they can check it with another couple of times I've seen that level often they're really sensitive they are very sensitive to that food lover being where it should be um you know it sounds like this doesn't happen most of the time happens when it's really hot but that's really wouldn't have fluid levels critical so if if\nAmong other things when they looked at it they didn't check the flu or something you may want to have them do and ... it's it's it's it's fairly complicated you may need to leave a vehicle overnight because you have to check it when it's partly warmed up not hot um so it's it's just as not as straightforward as it used to be the ... outlook but that's certainly something we're checking out having checked out\nAll right good luck thanks ... for calling appreciate

one two three four email us your question at ideas at W. P. R. dot org I still go back to the phones and turned to Jay into rivers Wisconsin\nHi Jay felt good morning a thank you I Am I'm just picked up a ... a third in\nGot a a sport way of it and I'm an eight new tires or the ... it's only about forty thousand miles\nBut it's had a a tire Chad and apparently according according to the orange Matty Alou record for was original\nWell ballots or works in a ritual and the tires or I'm a I'm\nA ... uh let's see a tool five are if they need to be very very strict with that size or is there any advantage of going to say a tool for ... should I go to court\nIt really VW specific [noise]\nAh well psychological and burst it it doesn't necessarily have to be the manufacturers brand them coolant um as long as it's the right type of coolant and it is likely is that ... comes from the manufacturers and make it colorless their Claire and so you know for example at our shop we have different different a\nCooling for different budget so the economy cooling actually delivered to us in a boat truck and it doesn't have a color and we put a powder die in it so that it looks like what you expect to see [laughter] and that's that's I mean that's just a store everywhere so color is meaningless but I could make your calling green purple or orange or whatever color\nYou know we wanted to put in there but the the type of cooling is is what's important I'm calling on the Thirteen Jetta around forty thousand miles I'm surprised that was teams already that that would be a little quicker than\nThan um than to manufacture and both so I can recommend but you know a lot of shops he just used to be every two years you know let's get that stuff out of their health prevent girls insults\nIt you know it it's not necessarily a bad thing but yeah I Would have it tested the biggest concern is that is the right ratio that it's mixed to thirty five below I'm One of the biggest differences including throughout the world is that in North America we have really hard water has a lot of minerals and things and it's which is why manufacturers or even cars that come from across the world\nGo with super long life and if he's which really just means they've already mixed purify water in it so that if they don't take the chance that you're putting those minerals that are in our tap water\nBecause you can buy for your enemies here in the day to mix it fifty fifty but our water is not a good\nA good mix for that ... so not knowing what's in it is probably the biggest concern if I was going to have a chain to simply because we don't know if they put regular water and air which isn't going to cause anything to to blow up at over the long term is not the best for preventing corrosion and other issues including system\nOn when it comes to your tires the tires did you want to go with it or that you really are best to go with our again that placard we talked about earlier that is on the divers door on the end of the drivers door the door jam will tell the tire factor but it also tells the tire size that should be on that vehicle I mean someone might have changed and sometimes\nThe the numbers on a tire that's over that so you mentioned your or two or five fifty five you didn't mention there is also a third number\nThat their numbers how many inches in diameter room is um and you can only that third number you can't play with the put the same time in the same way alter Fifteen inch wheels you have to put a Fifteen inch higher onto can't put a sixteen or fourteen but\nThe first two numbers really two oh five tells you how many millimeters wide that tire is in the winter the narrow entire obviously to better it's going to cut through the snow but you need to have handling for all conditions not just going to snow the second number is a ratio the first number so it's two oh five is the first number that means of tired of two hundred and five millimeters wide\nAnd the second number means that the hype the sidewalk hype is fifty five percent of that tool five but again so that was a little lesson in what the numbers on your tire me the most important I Would go by that placard on the door and make sure that you got the right size on their ... thank you so much Jay for calling appreciate\nIt and let's go to John in town to Wisconsin Hi John I don't I today good for you can't take oh what's on your mind\nWell I'm just curious yeah we're going we're staying out right now what it is ... ... a\nNitrogen gas light your average it just shows keep it tires core I think but what it meant nor her fallacy\nWell I Would you know the way that the nitrogen for tires is marketed\nOften strikes me as they ever were you know what to say but there is some truth there is some truth to it and and you know that they'll say that it it you know there's less moisture in the entire this and that here's the trick nitrogen molecules are larger than just what's on a typical or\nAnd yet the the the difference is the difference between when the weather gets cold weather you're going to see that tire like come on or actually have you're tired of pressures dropped quite a bit so we get overnight temperatures this time of year that dropped\nTen Fifteen twenty twenty five degree sometimes\nMost shops are going to see a parade we see a parade of people coming out next morning with their lights on because of that different people who put nitrogen into tires don't tend to have that because of that nitrogen has just enough advantage that the ... always going to be almost ... between the room and attire itself and some air will be lost over time\nYou know some tires and some wheels and some costs more than others but that that is the primary thing that nitrogen\nChanges that they get less of that era lost it changes if you start really talking about high speed high performance high heat they they used to do a lot and racing they use nitrogen Laden aircraft industry hopefully you're not dealing with those kind of lost most of us are not\nBy it but it is true that the people that have the nature of the higher or not that people that are in the parade [laughter] to get air anymore and a half of those cold overnight temperature drops\n[laughter] there you go Josh thank you so much for calling information their neck in Appleton years ...\nFortunately I got a marsh kill me\nAll its way ... [laughter] I said\nYes um I've asked people yeah answers last year I started it all it can like ticket storage back or don't want to get\nYou know stable is a good product and it does work and and unfortunately it doesn't work for me because I was on my shelf that never gets into the machines that have to set for the winter just doesn't work that way I I Would drain the gas out or would drain it out on machines that are not going to be used for a few months over the winter months like that it just you know\nI'm ... disabled first of all the reporting in the tank it's in the tank so the so um\nIf you just pour it in the tank it's not going to protect the entire feels as he got a part of the tank and then you've got to run the engine so that you get it into the carburetor in ... places were deposits are going to start to form where though she was going to start to break down and you get jealous and grew and stuff after a few months\nThat are there so it it is a product that works but simply putting them in the think isn't enough\nBut I still find that that I I don't know if it's just my own laziness either stable it says on the shelf I don't get around to it I Dream if you will that way I just know I've done the right thing and and ... and it's all out and I'm not going to have that\nHad your dream that feel you know running out of gas well you you can you can running it out of gas actually has the preferred way to do it but it is depending on the machine because you do that again where the fuel is in either at right up to the doctors right up to the\nIt's a little tougher to do test yourself with a\nWith the air conditioning and heater drain although you know and human enough day if you run the air conditioner you should see water draining on underneath the car that drains usually in the fire walls a little bit off center to the passenger side is where that would drive from\n[noise] let's take another call on to Joe in Wausau next Hi Joe\nI have a two thousand and eight or Toyota Tundra okay and and ever since I bought it when I make a sharp\nTurn either forward or in reverse uh it jerks instead of making a float turn the jerky mhm is\nThat normal or it it is pretty normal depending on circumstances you normally are you\nYou're going to have their trucking in uh in into a drive if you are on a surface where it can slip if you're on snow ice mud something where we can spin then you put it in for high\nAnd and for a high um basically is not appropriate for guy pavement and not even lately wet pavement and it's got to be really slippery\nUm to be in for high if you get stuck in you can no longer move at all that's the time that you put it in for low\nSo if you're trying to drive and for low in any kind of conditions that that's not appropriate you know and you know if you're trying to drive in for high it needs to be gravel mud snow really what he's going to\nConsider as normally as you go around the corner that outside tired has got to turn at a faster speeds inside tire when you put in for will drive that's no longer possible they're going to turn at the same speed and if they can't slip on some surface and spend you're going to get just what you're describing\nHow there we go thanks a lot of jokes for calling and I am in east Troy hello Han\nHi how are you good appreciate your call what can we do for you\nIt sounds like you know they can't read at a high getting thirty four thousand miles very happy with that right like a chance but they are trying to get hired failed a couple of feeling like that or something about trading\nSort an editor and measure it and that it is a high going I just wonder what your guest\nWell of course your your car has two batteries that has a twelve volt battery just like every other car does in its replacement should be really when when the testing that's done every six months starts telling predictably that that batteries not long for this world but I think your friends on what you're talking about the the high voltage batter the hybrid battery that's in the car\nUm you know by and large we see those batteries last\nAn engineer transmissions big part of the power train typically two or three hundred thousand miles is not at all uncommon for those things and they they are getting more and more reasonable um in in cost to replace it as an expensive item it is comparable to having to do a big engine repair transmission unfair when you have to replace that battery [noise]\nBut um you know I I I Would really not look at it different than a transmission or\nOr or an engine kind of repair if you get two hundred\nThree hundred thousand miles out of the car really probably doesn't do much and if if it's in really good shape and everything else is in good shape you know most people would find it worthwhile to put a transmission or an engine in a car that age if they thought they were going to keep it again some people trade their cars every two or three and four years and some people try to keep them ten years\nUm and if you're a part of that latter group you know I've seen many many people in place those batteries and get you know another you know several years of of good life out of them so it you know that it it really on a on a vehicle that new I don't think it's it's a big concern at this point it's kind of early to be worried about that\nAnd I have a question for you how many miles do you have on that vehicle right now yeah\nSo you know I Would really expected to be able to double that I mean it's again you know do you have any components got a bell shaped curve some fail early some last unusually longer than we expected but most of those are are going to get your well into the two to three hundred thousand mile range\nThere you go and thank you so much for calling and Steven mineral points are I'm Sorry mental point your current high\nAll ... up a whole will all of\nYou know ... different manufacturers have a different recommendations some manufacturers will say every two years or thirty thousand miles so manufacturers won't have an interval but the British food is one of the fluids again that's jacked the vehicle should\nShould have an inspection every six months and\nBreak fluids ... oil it's a high dollar oil antibiotic which means that absorbs moisture you don't want moisture to be able to collect into a a a water bubble somewhere and to a break system in cause interference can prevent the pressure from being able to go are supposed to go to ... fluids break that moisture up\nAnd as a result they start to change color and break food starts out looking\nLike honey or beer perhaps in over time it gets darker and darker there are also\nTest sediment tests that can be done with breaks lord but um you know that you put some out a little a\nLittle specialized it's kind of paper that will make the sediment spread to the outside and take a look and see if those are my sat around and\nYou know I don't know that I'm a big fan of those chemical tests you know unless the brake fluids really really starts to look rough um you know I I if if the manufacturer has a recommendation I Would probably fall that recommendation but most manufacturers don't and it's basically done on a on a visual um you know peer infection now based off yep\nThere you go to Steve thank you so much for calling visiting

that I just want to clarify when we talk about the front end vibration we're talking about vibration if you're on the steering wheel\nI mean that that's his front tires on your front direct saying the front is going to give you a vibrations during world if you're feeling it in the floorboards the gas or somewhere else than it is less likely to be that that from\nYou know perjuring clip and ... and during the suspension tires\nAnd probably something either through out somewhere else reel to drive you joined it was one of those things that comes to mind that can cause that kind of thing and and it sounds like it's a fairly subtle\nVibration interviewing um you know that that is is one of the more difficult things to find if you have annoys were rattled that you hear you can use what are called ... and put 'em on different components and and uh there's multiple and you can put on and you got a little boxes you can go from circuits a circuit and try to narrow down but when it's just a subtle vibration like that\nEspecially the you know throw the vehicle it's that that becomes very very difficult to to narrow down um\n[noise] you know I I Wish I could give it some some great advice on what you might do I suspect you probably have had a checked out the the thing that really all I can recommend is that your monitor it if it starts to change I Would have looked at again if it seems like it's getting more severe does it under different circumstances um but\nYeah and it kind of limited what you can do with that in terms of the starting um yeah I guess I'm I'm not quite perfectly\nClear if you turn the key to start it if you don't hold the key to start or doesn't engage\nStarted engages but it's a like starving for fuel it doesn't up up like shut\nAnd yet if you hold the key and just keep holding it in that started position than it does start better\nTakes longer that delayed start\nYeah I you know it it's it's a it's kind of electronic\nSystem to help it started is not like it's got a a standard choke like old vehicle would have and I say I think there are places electronic censor that that\nIs a potential component but um\nYou know basically it needs to be tested while it's cold during that started cycle to find out really what what is going on there and it may be that we have any missions which was not sending the right signal or not sending a quick enough um that you know that that's something that really is going to have to be pen Tessa between ignition switch\nThe computer that gets signals from the centers and the sensors themselves to kind of narrow down what we're just not getting the cigarette the right place at the right time there you go\nThey stand ... and Steve in Trump will do your turn I Steve\nGood afternoon I have a question about five elements we turn the frost or on a life and then I come back I was wondering if that something to do with the press or or what what might be causing [noise]\nWell when you when you add by the foster you mean the windshield and foster not the real window dressing right right so um well that's that's turning the air conditioner on\nThe engine the alternate or in the air conditioner both\nI'm driven by the by the shaft and um you know this this could be that you've got a brown promise electrical system but you know it may also be that that uh\nThat you ... you may have a a week alternate or or you may have dirty connections on your battery do there's just a there's a host of things that can cause and it may not be that I'm not sure how much they die down um but any time you put a load on the engine ... does it and this is just a momentary thing they'd them and then come back\nWell it it will be going down the road they come back I was just wondering if the electrical like from like an ethical cloud Sean compressor causing that if that was getting bad or\nWell that's usually just is on or off that's that's not a real likely cause of that I I think it's more like the kind of background somewhere and it's it's just not able to to supply voltage and we're supposed to go because it's looking for ground\nHow can you go thank you Steve clay in rocky shah will turn to you next Hi clay\nI I just wanted to make a comment for one of your other callers that called in with a ... Chevy ... white ration feels on ... yeah it had when\nI had the same problem and I thought it was huge orange I put a huge audience and maybe my drive Chevys band I bought a new dry shout out of town along I don't get into a transmission garage a really good transmission garage\nAnd they served by transmission and they told me\nThey draw that afterwards and felt the same vibration and they said that salad Ninety eight and early Ninety nine Chevy Truck murders that problem was one of them I mean we're not all came out properly after they got a hundred thousand miles on\nA charm is probably why now it's got a hundred and twenty ... as a problem I almost two hundred on it now the vibration is still there\nIt's just one of those things are changing in Rhoda if you want or just ... well that that was the last but that's what they set a washer forgot murderers locking ...\nHer interest me to her and I've seen that on various models and it's true it's not typically a breakdown emergency issue if that's what it is usually them described as a little bit stronger vibration but you know one person's that's a pretty seductive thing is yeah sounded pretty subtle and the and the former case but you know that's that is certainly a possibility thanks\nFor that call clay appreciate it very much\nParker emailed to say he has a twenty ten key ally with a hundred and Seventy thousand miles on it casually a couple of times a month when he's exhilarating the engine we'll wrap up between geared changes the cars started doing is few months ago transmission does not slip when it's in gear\nAnd he's running what could be cars or what could this be a symptom of shitty expect transmission problems in the near future he drives about three thousand miles a month\nYeah well it is a function of the transmission and the easiest to the first ... seconds of food level to level I'm being could cause that kind of a problem um if that doesn't do it then the next diagnosis deficit during the fluid\nProbably pull up and down and find out the the drain plug in a transmission pan is ... is magnetic so you know someone that's trying to do a little diagnostic investigated we are looking for mental an absolute and looking for fire in the flu and if there's fiber and fluid that would suggest that the banks are starting to go which would give you\nKind of a slip like that as well hopefully it's a ...\nYeah ... yeah that that's for sure so what what is what should we be keeping our cars in case of emergency I've got a few things in my car but what what do you think well you know hum\nGoing into winter Wisconsin is thinking of yourself first um you know you want to have the ability to communicate so there are some pretty neat charge ... that um [noise]\nUse a a battery um that that you can both jumpstart your car with in charge your cell phone with 'em so you might have a cell phone is good law in charge of the ability to be able to continue to communicate\nWhen you're out there is a very important thing um secondly you want to be able to keep warm so having\nUm some you know boots gloves things to to put on I mean you know most emergency kids will have like one of those solar blankets I Would weigh rather have a great big snow suit in the truck and I love and somebody will boots and then a solar blanket that I'm going to wrap roaming\nIn ... so you know again you really want to you want to put yourself some some water and some snacks although in Wisconsin in the wintertime water's probably gonna Harry's um\nYou know but but uh you know having under you might have a way of a falling out even if it does freeze so those are some of the most important things um second we been able to be seen emergency flares up those reflective triangles\nOr something pretty important to have in their um you know just just disown just a little odd from that list of things keeping the car with a full tank of fuel is something that down in the car and that's really important too because car might be stuck but at least you could run it\nKeep yourself warm seeing and kitty litter if you get stuck or good a shovel to be able to solve yourself out to scrape earnest no brush her pretty important things and\nYou know to do is go out I could make a kit that that had all kinds of things but those are the essentials in my opinion\nYeah and have all that in the car and you're going to\nBe a lot better if you run off the road or if you ... the guard\nQuits in the middle of 'em that happens when we all pass somebody on our commute sometime in those winter days it's sitting\nThere when do you need here's one more um do we need and you'd probably get this question a lot do you need to warm up your car before you leave\nMost violent culture not engineered to be warm up their their ... may and June to warm up while driving now for talking extreme cold I mean if it's forty below even the car engine you to be warmed up that way it's not going to her to run a little bit in some another game changer has been ethanol um people who run ee ee eighty five vehicles\nUm it may start but it may not be real happy to run it real cold temperatures if you're running eighty five so that may be another situation we're warming up a little bit of his running Russia's\nIs a good idea but but the vast majority of time the rule rather exception is that that you warming up while you're driving it started and and go well\nJim it's always a pleasure to have you on the program for sure pleasure to be here and and your back
