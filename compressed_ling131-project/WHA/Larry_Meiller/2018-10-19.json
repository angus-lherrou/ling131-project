broad range of activities and things that are going on maybe your own your home\nAnd so it's great to have Scott voice back with us from ah he's actually in our Green Bay studios today ... W extension crops soils and horticulture agents for Mary Annette adult colonel colonies\nAnd with us to talk about all kinds of things what's going on in your garden you have any questions about perhaps harvesting are storing produce what questions do you have about your trees or above fall clean up or maybe amending you're a garden soil watch to talk about and I hope you'll join in and you can call us at ...\nThere uh my husband and I said why did it at our butternut squash I say we'll leave it on the side and sell it for around ... you know I I didn't get any great at my first question\nI have a question that's what I struggle and then I how how often ... water\nI does get cold at night but I Want to I don't want to mess up\nOkay well I'm I'm not a marriage counselor nor do I play one on the radio but uh\nThe butternut squash issue is that one's a little bit more clear cut quite honestly than the second question even though it may sound harder um we need to we need those winter squash is to be mature to be able to well to have full flavor from one thing but then also especially if we want to be able to store them\nSo maturity is very important um quite honestly it sounds like maturity might be about halfway between what your two perspectives are because we don't need everything to go down you know down as far as those vines going dead and dormant before we harvest them\nBut we do need to make sure that those fruit are fully mature and with butter not in particular usually I'm the fruits will have some green changes or green stripes on them\nAnd with some cult of ours butter or not they can actually unfortunately hold those green tinge is too long and then it makes it harder to judge when they're mature but\nWhen the stem of the that connects the fruit to the vine starts turning color that's usually a good sign of fruit maturity\nUm the other side of this though is that butter not cannot handle getting frozen out in the garden or they will not store nearly as well as they should have so like again up in my area up here\nIf you still have butternut squash out in the garden there they're not worthless but they're not going to the store or they're going to need to be taken in and used as soon as you can because those the lines have are not going to be able to hard enough correctly because the material just simply got too cold [noise]\nUm the shrubs I'm certainly want to let them go dormant naturally uh and that should be happening in response to daily links 'em even you know who ... so you know the temperatures are going to be better for growth there but the daily is going to dictate ... processes\nSo if you just water them lately relatively normally until you start seeing doormen see\nThen if you're going to over winter them into who pose they need to have a little bit of moisture available but if you over water them of course that can lead to more chance ... and stuff like that so make sure you have well drained containers and all the the normal things that we would probably talk about\nBut then try to keep that soil just barely moist over the course of the winter without overdoing it\nAnd thank you very much for calling appreciate your call a Carlene Scott Royce our guest today you W extension crops soils horticulture agent for mayor Annette and all ... counties\nKate archer can't our producer to de de portraits are engineer I'm Larry mailer forgotten talk you're on the ideas network\nPublic radio is the surface of the Wisconsin educational communications\nWith additional financial support from the corporation for public broadcasting and from listeners through the Wisconsin Public radio association\nSupport also comes from that city Mitsubishi offering a selection of new and used Mitsubishi cars trucks and SUVs at their new facility at nine twenty and street and on line that mad city Mitsubishi dot com\nYou are listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W. P. R. dot org and like us on Facebook at the ideas network\n\nYou're listening to guard and talk here on the ideas network Larry me there with my guest Scott Rice you W extension crops soils horticulture agent for ... and all ... counties\nAnd you can join you they actually have to open minds at one eight hundred six four to one two three four or go ahead and email us at ideas that WPRI dot org\nSurely in the ... has a question let's go there\n[noise] yes I have a question for you sure you're on your garden hard it or not for what am I\nOkay I'm potatoes are one of those ... uh vegetables that are a little bit picky on their temperatures for for a long term storage at least they they prefer a cool temperatures but not quite as cold as some of the other things\nSo they want to be stored you know in those upper thirties really low forties so that's you know rich sellers are usually pretty good for them sometimes depending on the the setting they may get a little bit too cool but and we we certainly can't let a potatoes freeze because they're actually stem\nMaterial that's living so we can't let them freeze or they won't um hold their quality at all\nUm but a key thing with putting something like potatoes or any other long term storage um type of produce in a prior to storage is actually ... proper harvesting and proper selection of the the ones that you can put into storage so\nI'm harvest things at the proper time or conditions you know as we were kind of talking about with a butternut squash just a few moments ago\nBut then also sort of hard to make sure that you're not trying to put anything into storage that isn't mature that isn't a proper size or that has any bruises or cuts are scratches or insect holds or anything like that or ground squirrel bites or ... or something like that into it\nUm because those are ... not going to stores well they're much more likely to have a secondary ride or organisms get in and then it can spread throughout the entire storage that way\nAnd um there is nothing almost nothing worse than the smell of a rotting potato\nYeah in rotting potatoes riding tomatoes they're All right up there with [laughter]\nWhat what you know if you don't have a root cellar a you know that's a question I'm Randy had as well just in general storing root vegetables if you don't have a root cellar a kind of I think all the things you talked about applied to probably any a route vegetable yup\nYup and the the true root vegetables actually like it a little bit cooler than potatoes they prefer really write down close to freezing but without men being under freezing consistently so you know that thirty ... thirty four thirty five degree range is best for the the root crops [noise]\nUm if you don't have a root cellar you know you can either you can do a couple of different things if you don't have the outside space to actually you can actually tried digging a pet 'em and put rock or something that will drain in the bottom of it and then put your ...\nOver and then the problem with something like that is that when you open it up you have to use everything within their so don't overdo the amounts of storage that you put into it so that's one option it does work fairly well\nUm but um we can get pretty good storage out of just paying attention to light in temperature consistency so if you have a basement or across space\nOr even just a cooler spots in your house or apartment or condo or whatever it is that you live in\nThe the key for ... for storage is consistency it's even more important than perfection a lot of times I'm just have things that are the coolest inconsistent ah most consistent sorry temperature that you can have in most consistent humidity and they will store at least reasonably well\nYou know if it's a little too warm for them they want a store as long but they will still store for several weeks or maybe even month\nI'm In for the root crops make sure they're also in the dark\nUm squash is pumpkins things like that they can handle light and still store well but the root crops cannot and they need to be in the dark as well\n[noise] so my purple potatoes could I stick to them and the second refrigerator\nIf they if it's warm enough yeah I'm very fringes or not and fantastic storage things for some things but uh that it would work as long as you stay up you know like I say in those upper thirties\nOkay All right ... yeah surely thank you so much for calling appreciate your call let's turn to Harold in burn a more next Hi Harold\n\n... good morning to you what's on your mind\nOr just general sense of ... storage which are like that for you just got one writer for quite some years but\nHow close are we not get fired up together I just got my yesterday that's for two or three weeks later I'm like are strict ... first of all it's really crazy\n[laughter] yeah of course it was so\nWell I'm mad as you already mentioned I mean planting were on the late side of planting for garlic um we're not completely out of the window we can still get away with it but now we're\nWe're probably at the point where we're going to be sacrificing a little bit on size for what they're going to be able to get to next year because they're not going to be able to form the root system that we want them to so\nNormally in the state of Wisconsin and you know you're going to find some different answers to this question but\nI'm the iron northern Wisconsin where usually looking at the last\n[laughter] is it possible that you're nuts I don't know I don't know if there's no question about that oh okay okay yeah you're a gardener in Wisconsin yeah we're we all have to be a little bit nuts um anyway ah okay is it I don't\nDiscount any possibility I guess is as one blonde thing\nIs it likely that they're on the same plants no on odds are good that either you've got a a secondary plant that came up right next to it because tomato plants should not be able to produce two different types of fruit on the same plant okay\nNow the only way that they theoretically can do that is if they were grafted and they had a centrally ended up having to different plans grafted on the one\nThat doesn't usually work very well either but I'm not because of the maternal fruit dominance tomatoes have they should only be able to to have one type of fruit per plant um so that's about the only thing I can say to that without seeing the situation\nThere you go to obey Joe and hazel hers then as an email he has some Norway spruce seedlings and pots they're two inch seedlings are shitty keep them over winter in northern Wisconsin hazel hers is pretty far north\n... I'm well if you know where they're going to go planting them yet is probably the simplest route quite honestly because we you know we still have a a month or so for them to establish the rest of their root system that they would need\nUm otherwise you're going to need to just have them in a fairly consistent environment um you know they can over winter in a house if you have enough space for um er and but you can't ... or put them into dark conditions because they are a evergreen conifer so they need to be\nA growing all year long so I'm ... and they need to have sunlight or some ... artificially\nUm they don't need to have exceptionally high quality like but they need to have light all year long and then moisture for growing so\nI say it's are you going to just need to pick which is the best situation for you if you don't want to put them inside and but really don't have a space for them outside either\nOne thing that you could do is just literally plant the pots when you know a day got a trench essentially put the pots in the ground and then covered them back up with soil it makes transplanting a little bit less fun next spring but it's a great way to over winter plants with a lot less work than trying to hold them over in the house\nAnd let's now turn to carry in Michigan Hi Carrie\nWell we have a tree planting a yard and a lot of flowers ... um well what we're doing that different than other have\nWell I got a couple of gases but I'll be blunt and say that that's probably about all I can give you um I mean I Know enough about those that species to be dangerous might be the best way to say it\nUm it's possible that it just simply hasn't gotten mature enough um there are some of those ah in some cult of ours may have different ages as far as when they're able to start blooming\nUm sunlight could be part of it or conditions you know if it's experiencing stress or not getting enough sunlight maybe it just doesn't have enough energy to form buds\nUm that might be one of those where a need to have either a little bit of patience or get a little bit more detailed information you know depending on which county you're in in in Michigan\nOr that there are a few home horticulture educators available through the MSU extension system otherwise you know we don't check ID's at the border so human contact any you W extension people too and\nWith a little bit more detail and we can hopefully get that help or help you get that figure it out\nYeah there we go thank you very much for calling and let's see we'll turn to a gym in camp Douglas Hi Jim\nLarry Israel then I'll just get your response\nI'm I've been trying to grocery cucumbers tomatoes and treat Buckeye each district to get your foot gardening soil that's fertilized angles bucket I can get them to get started ... once they come out and the vice show up as\nA the fruits and vegetables just seem to be what they would be if I Would plant and then they go out\nMhm okay uh well with with any type of containerize grow situation there's always a few different possibilities and it it takes a little bit of detective work a lot of times to figure out for sure which one is is the most likely culprit\nI'm obviously it can be water consistency because we've containerize plants can dry out really fast you know so if we don't have a\nAn actual watering system in a new ... system um that can be part of it um other parts can be as far as you know what do we really have available for nutrients um cucumbers and tomatoes are both ones that need a fair amount of calcium\nAnd consistent water availability for the fruit to not get blossom end right or to have other issues with a fruit maturity so [noise]\nUm calcium content is a is such as always a chance for a problem to occur within containerize vegetables and fruits so um that would be something to think about and maybe you need to add um you know a quarter cup to half a cup of lime in your mix before you add that in\nUm if you have already done that and then again you know look at the rest of the plant or are we seeing any other symptoms that could be related to nutrient deficiencies\nBecause you know a lot of our containerize situations even though we may start with really good stuff to start with it can just run out at home faster than in a in a garden setting because you're it doesn't have the uh insurance essentially of the neighboring soil and the the the sub soil so\nI'd I'd think about those things is my first possibilities and then kind of go from there with you know maybe cult of our selection because there are some that are better served in those restricted ... growth situations than others\nSo there are some other things like that to think about to\nThank you Jim pre she ate the

term storage you actually want my number one you want to do the ... and the state of Wisconsin generally because of their yield potential\nBut you want to harvest them when they are they still have some green left uh the the the rubric the most serious garlic growers use is that when\nThe the upper or the leaves have died back about fifty percent plus or minus everybody uses a slightly different you know percentage or\nTiming but I'm that way the skins are still going to be tight uh onto the clothes so that you get best long term storage potential but there are there at full size and full maturity [noise]\nUm the soft neck types will work to you know if people want to breed them and such but they don't do as well in the state of Wisconsin they don't store nearly as long\n[noise] you know how I open up I I got a little tip from somebody I don't remember who about getting the skins off garlic when you've got especially when you have a lot of garlic\nThat person to just put them in the microwave for a few seconds and the skins come right off yup yeah I've heard that you know oh man and it works great\n... so and they say with the the the trick is with that you know that half to three quarters dead range for those garlic leads to just make sure that they're at that\nOptimum maturity but yet not a because if you leave them in the ground too long after they'd been dead that they'll do loose than uh the scans will loosen too much on the those clothes because they're getting ready to start growing again and then you can't really do much with them as far as storage\nOnto Patty in east Troy Hi Pat\nI guess that thank you for taking my call sure I've been curious ever since I gave up on like a couple of weeks or several weeks ago [noise] um last year I planted to\nAs ... squash plants and they came up and did very well in a garden that was a failed straw garden ... it was just fine for those kidneys and I got a million or a fruit out of it [noise]\nBut this year I add more seats and I wanted I hated to throw them away so I played it for decades and got for plants in a different location\nRich of the things duty a richer and want to give your turn I rich\nGood afternoon of every ...\nAnd got my BA adjusted to where I tried blueberries for the first so it was ...\nAnd I'm sure that I'm going to have to adjust that ph again next year makes them similar soil and then this but it seems to be doing okay um I don't know that they're driving necessarily yet but I was curious about what to do over the winter was blueberries places\nOr additional winter protection that I Need is to do to try and ensure they hang on through the winter and I absolutely love your program is W. extension is awesome\n[laughter] it takes rich guy well riches and want to see which isn't far from Madison uh-huh a sky\nA ph amendment is going to be something you have to keep your eye on there and keeping that ph is low as possible you know blueberry to get enough ironed out in the soil blueberries need a ph usually in that four or five to five and a quarter so range [noise]\nUm so that's it's going to be a struggle for you down there probably because of the soil a base that you have but it's doable um\nAs far as over winter protection the plants themselves should be fine I mean it's never a bad idea to mulch knew you knew planting so you know men with blueberries you going to probably stick with the Barker would type mulch more so [noise]\nUm because they're young plants you know you're you're probably not too concerned about getting fruit tossing them right away next year but some blueberry called tomorrow's arm or marginal on their flower hurting us so we actually need to sometimes devise ways to help have better ... know sat over them\nType mechanisms to get a little bit more snow over them so that we get better flower bud I'm a protection over the winter but other than that teen hurting it shouldn't be an issue as long as you paid a little bit of attention to called the Marshall election\n[noise] and let's go on to Dick in Richland center high deck\nA couple of questions here um first of all we got to be trimmed fall or ... or ... I had that problem\nLast fall will turn up in the last thing but sticks to spreading a lot of criminals\nBut I don't watch it spring I think in the spring I guess do you believe that also I just heard the lady above the ground\nA year ago so let me ground troops that put them in so many ground Jerry I couldn't even get them all away\nAnd just put them in the ground so that\nAh All right Dave thanks a lot for calling what we got bridal raised ...\nOkay um well since we worked with lilacs earlier let's finish that one off are usually the the best absolute best time to prune back lilacs if you need to do anything with them is right after they are done flowering\nBecause then you do you do less than ... next year's flowers but you're still able to let them have a full season of growth ahead of time or you know now as we get going [noise]\nUm that ... question quite honestly how old the prime roses that I Know are are for basis type so I mean they're missing out on some that because they just don't work with them on enough\nOn that and they should be a fine I'm with the ... area does if memory serves they are formed flower buds on a new would if I'm remembering correctly so you've got some flexibility on them um [noise]\nSo you should be able to do that are in the spring or you know after they go dormant in the fall and be perfectly fine\nSo it's kind of dependent on when you have them the most time and patience to get things done properly um and you might want to double check the ... um\nBut they they do you know they they like good and soil they like good a nutrient availability to get\nA full I'm a full\nGrowth in I'm In pretty positive now are getting confirmation or from my wife was actually a master gardener too [laughter] me on that one that it did is they knew would bloomer so there you know should be better served in that doormen season\nWell here's one from Rick in Brookfield I how shitty stories beautiful crop of home grown apples she thought of burying a small chest freezer and the ground leaving the lid above ground in using a thermostat ugly controlled light bulb\nTo supply heat during the very cold days also covering the lid wear the veil of hey so the snow and ice don't freeze the lid died what do you think of that idea\nIt could work you know the the apples want most apples now there are some cult of our variance on that so like Honeycrisp actually like it a little bit warmer than most of the rest of the ... you know so double check the cult of ours that you were starring in a situation like that but\nIt theoretically can work because Apple's lakes that thirty two to thirty eight degree range again ... with a little bit of variation on some ...\nIs going to be when you open up a storage like that you might need to use most of the stuff that's in there um ... that's that's the worry I have with an elder alternative storage method like that because\nI'm just afraid that once you open that up you're going to change the dynamics in it enough that you are going to need to basically do it once and then figure out okay now what do I do with the two bushels or whatever of apple that ahead in here\n[laughter] yeah then then it's apple sauce timers [laughter] definitely [laughter] here's it otherwise\nMary from Stevens Point as a butternut squash devil tea and she emailed she leaves them on the vine for the longest time possible while avoiding frost\nIncluding frequent covering uncovering once harvest itchy cures them she chooses a place with optimum exposure to sunlight\nAnd sunny day she sets them for the longest possible exposure to the sun\nThen puts them in boxes at the end of the day and protect them from nighttime frost once she stops doing that she can store them in any cool rumored closet for many months and they keep well enough to cook and eat\nShe rose have sections of squash in the oven using only olive oil she uses the quiz and art to finish off the squash adding all eat butter salt and pepper\nShe freezes the access and the flavor is delicious\nI concur not have the\nBest way I I Love winter squash is all grow as many as Fifteen to twenty different type some years\nUm and yeah the the the key to long term storage as a well the the proper harvest timing but then also proper caring and I didn't really go into that was before\nThe trick with butter and that is that they are actually a completely different species of squash compared to all of the rest of the winter squash is in because of that they have a very different Rhein they actually have skin instead of a rind\nSo it is a little bit harder to store them for long periods because they they can desiccated a little bit more readily um where whereas the sticker rind ones can use it as long as you cure them off right they can use the handle at pretty nicely for\nThe longest I remember storing squash myself and that's not even in pristine conditions is eleven Martin's\nThat's pretty darn good yeah Scott
