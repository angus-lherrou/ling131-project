P. R. dot org and of course you can also opposed to question had ideas\nAt W. P. R. dot org well let's go back to the phones Steve in Boston your tour Steve\nHi um I I tuned in just a couple of minutes ago and I'm really glad I did I I just had a struggle last night actually trying to get a venison roast it come out tender and\nAh to actually to actually seem like a moist roast as I as I've been into it and I I kind of struggled to describe it because I'm a meat was dripping wet I had it\nIn a crock pot it came out appearing moist but as I chew it it seems like dry like a dry roast and I'm Wondering if there's a technique to improve that\nWould you ... excuse me what you call it like ... would that'd be a good way to describe how it how it tested or felt\nUm I guess jockey yeah that would that would probably describe it it was um it kind of saps the moisture from your mouth as you're showing that it's almost like a steak that was over cooked right and this time I cooked it with a thermometer which I hadn't done in the past and I thought that was going to be the trick and that didn't help\nSo do you cook there isn't a crook by with with some liquid with them it was a ... method of cooking and it was cooked in like a like a stock ... water or some kind of liquid as well steamed\nYeah I used that can be fraud and then had some vegetables in there it was covered about half way\nI like um what I like to do is to cook it with a ...\nPieces of Venice and um so basically uh cigarettes just to give it some good criminalization on the outside just make it nice and colorful and and give it some flavor and then cook it\nIn the oven and and or basically cooking dry dry heat is not with liquid you have a much better chance of having less moisture I'm being pulled out of it by cooking with the dry heat it tends to have that looks like you said it was sucking it looks good\nBut it's still going to have a um it tends to be that gets that ... kind of over ... taste even though it doesn't seem like it's over ...\nAnd it seems like you'd think it was just sort of just the opposite yeah cooking the liquid you think would keep it from getting drive but I find that it tends to make it seem the pose a lot of ... there's no fat in it for sure we know that anyone with an right\nBut I I tend to dry heat and then I ... with the sauce after I've cooked at that\nAnd then is there an internal temperature that I'm targeting you know when I'm done\nYeah ideally you want to get it at least well for the food safety you'd want to go to one sixty one sixty five I tend to go one forty five one fifty I'm going left one hour from medium rare you know a one forty five yes absolutely saw I don't want to get all sorts of emails and calls but people what food safety because\nBut I I go I go lower I Want to paint I Want to look like a wonderful piece of of beef and and I find that it just\nIsn't so much better in yeah absolutely and do a mushroom sauce and pored over and have the sauce on the side or with it as opposed to cooking it in the in the south I think you'll be happier and and high temperature to when you ... you know cook it in a cast iron pan or ... you can not a tough one fan or a non stick pan but I\nCan't get that Syria wonderful color and then put it in the oven at a high temperature\nMinimum four hundred for twenty five four fifty and all you can tell you get it and then I think you're going to find it to be like wow this is really good yeah in the farming really kind of help sold the moisture and doesn't it especially with the dry heat cooking if it moist cooking it if you if you use during a roast pot roast to go in the oven doesn't really do anything for holding the moisture in but it does give it more flavor\nYeah very great thank you so much to give it a try thank you Steve ... wow that was great let's go to Kathleen in Portage Hi Kathleen\nHi I was wondering I Know and have them in the in the family watch now and I used to buy wild game\nThere are there are plenty of places but you pay for it it's really expensive and it tends to be farm raised a class of wild game in quote unquote\nUm it's delicious it's fine Wisconsin is a a ... from I was looking I'm doing a dinner party on friday night for some folks who was looking for some elk and there's a a farm over by um between Santa ... smells that has all can\nJust some Wisconsin raised but there's plenty of uh Internet availability what I Would suggest this is talk to some people are church church community center and I bet you somebody would give you something because people are always trying to unloaded six to ... sometimes\nI get why it was like oh we got this medicine in the freezer so ah you know sometimes you could just talk to people and maybe just acquire some by a by just chatting\nI tell ya I open my mouth uh yesterday and just said the tour department chair and said uh well I I'm going deer hunting this uh this year and right at the first question out of her mouth was that where you're going or anything is what can I have [laughter] I'm sure you got to have that is\nSo you can buy it and it's available but it's it's very expensive very very I mean we're talking twenty five thirty dollars were ... you can also get pheasants yes absolutely and that's not that expensive but knocking thinking ... you know the you know the the man's large mammals and you can buy a rabbit says well no not that bad but it's yeah it's available insist on line\nNow from kill All right thanks a lot for calling Kathleen ... or your turn I bell\n\nI think they got a couple of world\nFriend Brad still do the fire world without getting um regarding the cold air without bird charter horribly\nBut they don't like dogs and he said it was very good\nOh\nThat would work that would work if that was your only option [laughter]\nI mean there's there's nothing wrong with that I mean there's you know I but I don't know I I guess I'd ... I'd be tempted to at least got them if I were to do that but you're charging them with an audience burning off side I Would tend to not really the best I can see that working I really could\nIt would not be a my first joined us wouldn't be my parents are trying to think about [laughter] but I Love squirrel I just you know that's the ... actually that's all I've gotten this year so far as a couple of squirrels and was how would you describe squirrel the taste oh a like chicken no [laughter]\nNo I Know [laughter] it's sort of a mild it's really mild yeah it's more like um you can almost be like pulled pork in a sense of the texture and some of the flavor it's not to give me remember when I Lived in Colorado eating pine squirrels that tasted like pine nuts\nNext pine flavor so it depends what kind of what they eat too so yeah there you go ...\nJohn in La Crosse we'll go to you next Hi John\nWhat's on your mind today\nYou know I acquired an instant pot for Christmas last year and\nWe've perfected beings many ways and I try one medicine roast actually turned out very well have you ever used an empty pot or any other type [noise]\nI have to admit that is one new thing that I have not explored um as far as ... I heard I've heard a lot of good things about them but I've never I've never use them ... have you used a pressure cooker I haven't either I got I got scared of pressure cookers when I had my mom is still just fear pressure cookers you know but I Know that they're down and safe anymore but\nI don't have the pressure sensors and that's what it is a pot and indeed it is\nAnd actually I small vantage then rose to pounds maybe with vegetables eight minutes oh my goodness it was it turned out better than I ever bought\nHe admitted ... eight minute that's why they call it is to find I guess it brown it\nAnd if you just put it in a pan with some olive oil and equal parts of butter and sweet onion chopped up and some mushrooms\nAnd just brought it on all sides it cooks up quick 'cause it's only a quarter inch thick and it's delicious everybody loves that even people that don't like that so\nI Would recommend cooking it that way\nOh thank you know that sounds that sounds really good it does it's the other extreme when you have a really tough cutting meat either cook it incredibly versus credibly short period of time you have to cook it for a long period of time anything in the middle and mix it just to in tough yeah that's a great recipes\nAnd in you know at the deer camp that many a deer camp La Crosse Wisconsin on you know the opening day night sure or the next day um\nHeart and liver are pretty well off unprepared using some of what she was talking about and then often times\nOf the of the hunters will have some bacon that they'll have saved the the bacon Jew the bacon fat sugar and throw a little bacon fat in the pan and that\nThey can mix everything better right again I'm going to be Autor at is a really really good I can I can expect a speaker they experience\nLet's go to Jim in Steven's point I Jim\nHi Larry I was in Sitka, Alaska a couple of years ago brought home a lot of hell of it in salmon and have been using up the last of it from my freezer or eat with a leak soup and um it includes\nThree large lakes and onions potatoes fish stock and then the third cup of heavy cream and it's really one of the best soups I have ever made in my life and when you add the hell a bit and salmon from Alaska who am I\nOh that sounds good [laughter] you're making me hungry [laughter] well yeah in my head and be eating that goes there [laughter] that I was prepared for me I I well I'm salivating anyway right Jim thank\nYou so much um [noise] let's see if there was a question and let me check here\nGo up the line here a little bit Joel are Jeff I'm Sorry in education emails to ask for recommendations for game cookbooks to give as gifts\nI saw I did some of it's because I'm thinking about him working I'm doing a cookbook myself so look to see what was out there there's a a somebody's rated some cookbooks as a I forget what it is but this is the top ten that they liked and I was really impressed with with those ten cookbooks so just a do a search and Internet search\nFor cookbooks and or you should find something that and this will recommend again it's like the top ten or Fifteen and it gives you something some really good ideas and they're from all over the country and they have different styles and [noise]\nI'd recommend my book and I haven't quite yet\nSo well I yeah and you know for so many but I have probably I don't know maybe thirty cookbooks for awhile again or ... and they you're right there from all over the country\nAnd what I find is that in each one there's probably one or two recipes that I guess actually it's like a church cookbook you'll find those that one or two you really like and and so that's why you have to have so many different right a cookbooks for sure\nWell oh my gosh what's your favorite ... a wild game to eat\nUm my favorite has been snapping turtle his last few years I really love snapping drive a friend in ... in some praise Steve on who's gotten a\nA bring pressure snapping turtle from Dane County that's been my favorite but I Do like venison and of course I Love pan fish I Love when I fish died when I fish fish or anything that bite so I catch a lot of pan fish even the little ones 'cause I figure if it's hard if you can catch those little ones you can catch a big one any day Lappin pan fish and so I like a like a lot\nAnd you do all these classes talk some more about the the class I Know you've got a wild game class about becoming a\nPresentation come load and unload I Am so lake Wisconsin alliance association I think it's the fourteenth of November yeah coming up up there and it's not a ... it's freebie but it's a just got to register for it so I don't know what to talk to see how many people have signed up for it but that should do well and I'm available to come to any kind of clubs or anything to talk to talks and stuff anywhere in the state and\nFrom Marshfield site and I love Wisconsin when I used to teach all around the country I was ...

I mean I I'm just not familiar with the details but I Know those opportunities are out there\nYou know they they definitely are sometimes you know it depends on the land because if a conservancy group takes it over then they're also meant you know they have cost associated with that even if the land is a\nIs a purchased or not even purchase if it's given to them they still have to manage and then there's the expense involved in so sometimes it depends on where the land is located has a contiguous to other properties that they might have or nearby so there's a there's a lot going on there\nBut it and anyway great good luck with that right appreciate it very much\nYou know that I think you mentioned a um they eat local movement and how hunting how is hunting working in with that eat local movement and do you cover that in your uh your move your ah show\nWell we do have a key key foreign key who is the de on our ah our three teams supervisor\nOn the show and he talks about that um we we do talk ... as I mentioned with one hunter ... who are shot a a a deer with across ... during the season and a and actually learned to hunt during the\nThe program we don't really go out there and and they tend to learn to hot program um but Keith does address it and\nI Know it it is having an impact but I I I don't believe it's having a huge impact yet because uh you know there are classes of twenty or thirty people and you know your your they do four or five or six or maybe ten a year but that's\nNot a lot of people button right it's growing and again if you're going to be on our website and and search I'm learning to hunt you'll find all the information on those programs\nYeah yeah for sure well what is the um the twenty Eighteen deer forecast a looked like let's talk about some of the areas of the state and just sort of you I Know you'll be in more detail in your film but talking about that a little bit\nWell beyond everybody remembers last winter and just as we thought it was ending we got of where I live a foot of snow and the you know a first or second week of April and all that didn't help but apparently that melted in most areas so quickly that\nIt was not a factor\nI'm ... I'm a the counties in the northern tier some of them reduce their number of um aunt loyalists harvest authorizations formerly known as tags um because of that\nIron county is the only ... only county this year last year there were several this year it's only iron county so if you're a hunting in any of those northern counties Ashland bay\nField Douglas going west and uh you know for us than a vial is there are public land do tags available I I bought one and I'm going to buy and other ones for my son and I can at least bring home some venison if we see a deer\nWhen we go up there um it generally speaking the forecast is positive\nI'm certain areas of the state of course have more deer than others and in some places I ... the deer are really concentrated on private land and and that's always been a problem because I'm only those who have access to that private land\nCan she can hunt those there\nUm but you know to kind of a put it in a nutshell the biologists who gave us the information that we condense for this forecast\nBasically said um there are opportunities and good opportunities on public land\nReally throughout the state even in southeast Wisconsin you have the northern and southern unit so the cattle marine state forest you got big areas like a a virgin marsh and uh\nUh and other other public lands that are open to hunting and and some of them are not hundred that heavily maybe because people think oh everybody else goes there um you just have to you know pick your spots and do a little scouting\nUh you you mentioned gay managers are game biologist in anything on the latest research on deer management and and maybe how citizen participation may be involved in this research\nWe didn't spend a lot of time on that we did um have we have a very brief clip from dams storm who is heading up the southwest Wisconsin deer research program which is looking at a deer in two areas of a sea WD prevalent\nAnd they've got I forget how many deer collared now adult deer and forms\nAnd they've cholera do thirty or forty bobcats and coyotes and they're following them for the next several years and they've got some interesting preliminary results but I think we're going to focus on that in a in more depth next\nThis but I I Will say that there are\nSeveral um surveys that you can participate in if you go to again to the website and just type in wildlife survey there are a observation surveys that you can\nUm that you can do you just you know keep track of the animals you see whether to gear or a ... or fissures or whatever\nAnd then to report them and they want that information\nThere's also a snapshot Wisconsin which we don't focus on this year we did last year\nUm that's a\nThat's a\nIt's a great program there there are a trio cameras everywhere no problem with it is it's hard to uh you know do your private business in the woods\n[laughter] any more [laughter] there's a trio camera and it really quickly and there are ... private lenders you know the anyway [laughter] minor minor issue that we sometimes have to deal with\nA man you know what I was glad to hear you how do you have ...
