H. W. dot org slash T. F. C. I'm happy to be here\nRelative stark about um for about ... some boundaries on what a memorial is and maybe what it is it because it seems like memoirs can get confused with autobiographies so what's the difference whatsoever more\nYeah they do get confused and and really an autobiography is the chronology of an entire life\nWhile a memoir can zoom in on a specific aspect or a time period in a writer's life so it could be a year or a month or a few months and that time period whatever it is provides a frame you know to hold the story and then the author can we even relevant reflection back story\nBut this confusion between memoir autobiography is why you sometimes hear people say\nOh she seems too young to have written a memoir um because there is no age at which you know you know you don't need to reach a certain age to write a successful and compelling memoir so usually when people say that they're thinking about it in terms of writing a whole life somebody looking back at Seventy five and writing their their entire life down\nYou are seem to concentrate a bit on women and their mothers and their memoirs is there a difference between the approach or a woman might take or a man my versus a man and writing a memoir or are are there is a process pretty similar to ... no matter what the sex\nI think the process of similar I mean it it somebody coming to this work with with the story that they feel like they want to get out into the world and also maybe I'm needing to understand more of what happened in their life at a certain time and so\nI think that's pretty much the same for men and women and I focus on women just because I feel like sometimes it's harder for women to get their voices out there and some of their stories are not taking this seriously if there are women writers so that sort of where I put a lot of my energy but I work with both men and women on their memoirs okay\nWell just sit down and say uh well I'm going to write a memoir of that's hard work and there are plenty of excuses why you can't get started on it today versus\nMorning thank you well a couple of things I'm Wondering if I'm\nKate has a website that she could share with the listeners as well as does it do any kind a newsletter I'm I'm On a couple of different writers\nNewsletters and they give good ideas and they kind of hooked me up to keep me going with my writing so I don't know if that's something that she offers um so those are two questions I have the other one is I took a memoir class um [noise] this past summer or in the right by the lake um\nAnd uh with the W. Madison and it was it was all done but\nWhat I my when I went away with was the question of\nWhen the is a person doing the writing for their own personal therapy about let's say a very traumatic life situation and when is that\nHow a memoir I guess my experience was that there was so much\n... in in in this uh among the people who attended this class that I went away traumatized [laughter] analyze that pat ... memoir and so I just kind of wrote a memoir of that and not going to do that so you kind of blame them a little bit um yeah\n... those are great questions Alice I'm\nAnd I think that this is something that's really interesting as a teacher I have to think a lot about this because you don't want people to feel traumatized in a class um and so I one thing that I always say is you know\nThis is going to be therapeutic the process of writing and really reckoning and diving deep into your past I mean it can re traumatized people who've experienced trauma so\nI you know creating ways to have breathing room I'm as a writer you know I say you know take ten minutes at a timer and then take a break for a walk if if you're writing about something that's really intense also there there are different ways to do that by ... you know writing in the third person writing in the past\nTense rather than the president which can really kind of bring you back to that moment in a way um but so the process of writing a memoir can be very therapeutic and transformative but at the end you don't want it to feel like therapy and so that's where the craft comes in and so sometimes I feel like\nThat sort of very therapeutic riding sometimes happens at the beginning maybe you're really angry about something and you just have to vent on the page\nAnd that's not what people want to read but they're not going to be able to relate to it and so that's where we are vision comes in and it's really important so that you can make sure that you've actually crafted this\nAnd you have characters that are fully flashed in that it isn't a narrator who's just kind of you know vomiting and this anger or or whatever onto the page because that's just not going to allow other readers into it and so\nThat sort of distance that you get in there were vision process is really critical but I also think that because I'm a teacher one thing I have to remind my students you know remember that this is a writing class so we have this range of things that we're going to be talking about and always try to bring it back to craft and class because\nWe we don't want it to spin off into a therapy group because that that's not fair to the other people who were in the class\nSite um it's just W.

P. R. dot org again love to hear from you\nA listener called to say she this kind of goes along a little bit with what Alice was saying oh this listeners said she had P. T. S. D. because of traumatic childhood events and was told to write about it and it helped her heal a she wanted to hear a discussion about how writing\nCan help with trauma ... and have you seen that in the people you work with Kate\nAbsolutely um and there's been a actually a lot of research on that um there's a a academic James Baker who is done work I think out of Texas and his his kind of work is writing to heal and it would be something finance listening to check to check out\nBut that you have to write both what happened and how long you've been feeling about it in order to kind of get those benefits so it's not just Tom\nThat this happened and this happened then this happened then this happened kind of writing but you really have to examine how did I feel about this how did it change me um and that's where the healing benefits I think especially come out but\nBut I have seen that with my students that I'm I'm going to have an tense laughing\nClasses and among my students there were lots of children there were was domestic violence there was rape but there was illness\nAnd it was a heavy fall for me um so I thought I was feeling that first ... um but\nBut I could see how writing about it was allowing them to let go of some of these experiences and forgive themselves when when especially when they're shame involved and it's a shame that's misplaced they ... it you know there's so much shame I think that especially women can carry around about some past events especially things like rape and\nSexual assault and that sort of thing\nAnd to be able to write your way through that and and kind of let it go a little bit has been really amazing to see 'em so I think it's it's very valuable and I think it can be really intense I mean as Alex said it can re traumatized people so\nI mean to have the support that you need a round it um is really important and maybe it's a writing trauma class or maybe you're doing some you know other reading that can work books that can I help you move through it I think is important that you have to\nHave the support you need when when it becomes um really intense for you is important\nKind of what you're talking about their cause me to think about names ... what about putting real people's names in your memoir after all you're telling a story that's close to you how you handle names\n[noise] well I think it's tricky and again it probably depends on the story but for me if if it's a close friend or family member um I put their real names and the story um and then if it's doctors like in in my memoir change all the doctors and nurses names just to protect them um\nAnd um so if it's not somebody that's close to me I always changed their name and if it's something where it's maybe more of their stories so this is a challenge that comes up for a lot of my students that they have something that they want to write but\nPart of the story maybe isn't their story to tell and\nUm I always say you know whatever's happen to us whether it's um something happened to someone in that affected us we still own our experience of that and we deserve to be able to write that but then you have to be able to be a little careful at the end before you decide to publish and\nNot to think about this at the beginning of the writing process because it can really make people self censor if they're if they're worried oh I Can't put this out there um they actually won't get to the heart of the writing because they're so nervous about that so I think nobody is going to see it at the beginning and then if you get to a place where you are ready to send it out in the world think about okay\nWhat do I really need to have an here is there's stuff that I have to take out to protect people I Love\nAs long as it doesn't compromise the truth of my story um or can I change names of people to protect them so I think that is just really an ethical thing that you have to think about when you're when you're writing about other people's experiences in addition to your own\nLook at what really happened and kind of take responsibility for their actions and so that's where I just continue to ask questions like you know\nIt seems like you might go a little lever here what was going to a nice way it kind of not just them into that I'm kind of revolution place and and it works you know I I'm working with women now who was kind of\nLike Oh thank you so much for push asking these questions because I'm gone deeper and I've had to think more seriously about this topic and and so that feels really satisfying but and I think that's the place where all memoirs really want to be they want to go to that deep place but sometimes it's scary to go there\nNow and I'm sure there have been um probably many times when you've said boy this you can get this ... when when does your memoir attract the attention of an agent or an editor or how does that path to being published\nWork yeah it's it's a hard path for most people actually um I mean oh casually you have um you know writers who've publish something you know a short essay somewhere or especially if it's in a big you know like New York times or or modern love column or something\nThat agents will often like pick you know send them email and say hey do you have a book and you know so that's a great way to get attention of agents is put ... excerpts of the story out there and get them published\nBut for most people you have to have at least part of the memoir written and then ... book proposal so\nI just bought a book proposal class at the loft on Saturday and it's a lot of work to kind of pulled together um you know an overview and all these different components and really chapter summaries and market and then some sample chapters of your book so some people can sell a book a memoir on\nA proposal which is you know these overview different components and then also sample chapters\nBut lots of people need to have the full book um before and they can start queen agents and sending it out and then and then you just have to be prepared for rejection because you're going to get a lot of rejection and\nAnd this is where you just have to keep believing in your story and so I was joking with one of my students in that process and and I said here here's the list of all these places that rejected my books and\nAgain this is just one of the books that I was only one time it was that out so I mean the biggest thing to remember is that if you believe in your story and you feel like it has\nA place in the world that might help somebody just don't give up on it and keep writing keep revising so it's the strongest rainy and you can make it and then also just keep sending it out there and there's tons of small presses as well um university presses and so there's lots of different ways to get a book out into the world and and just don't get up and give up because you only need one\nJohn wondered if people should write for themselves or or write for the reader\n[noise] yeah that's a good question I um I think it depends on what it is so if it's an article for specific you know journal or paper you kind of have the audience in mind already but I really think that when you start out\nYou want to be writing this for yourself and so that you can get to that so you're not thinking about the audience and that way and you're not censoring based on who you think it's going to be for so first think about it as yourself and then as you begin to revise and draft more\nThen you start thinking about the audience I Know with my memoir I did think about the audience because my daughter was only eight weeks early [laughter] you know it sounds like now you know a lot but it not compared to some of the babies and\nUm some of those maybe since survivor they had you know severe disability coming out of the um the neonatal intensive care unit and so\nAs I was writing and revising I wanted to make sure I was being respectful of those parents who had lost so much and I'm kind of balancing that with ... the truth of my experience so I think it it it it interests in but not to not to worry too much about audience as he began to write [noise]\nGet you have a conversation with Bonnie rough coming up bunny author of beyond birds and bees if I'm not mistaken November\nYes yes so that's a major thing Quinn booksellers in Minneapolis and funny has a new book about kind of raising kids who are um have positive feelings about sex ed and and and all of that so it's going to be an interesting conversation coming up on and

I mean so\nIt it definitely has to do with the high water and then the winds that have been occurring yeah as you said the uh the last couple of years we've had a higher water on all the great lakes ah whereas between the\nThe late nineties up until probably twenty tenor is how long it was below normal way and now it's up high by a half a meter and so those winds get picked up and you know there's been some great photos of the waves on Lake superior in particular which a beautiful to watch but yeah they do a lot of erosion on the line\nI Know there's a lot of things that go on to do influenced the lake levels but boy the one that stands out to me and it surprises me is the ice content in the wintertime yeah commend operations those couple of years where we had really cold winters in huge ice extent\nKeeps the water in the lake and then you know you get a normal season of precipitation suddenly you're back to normal well above normal and then the wind and waves do the erosion yeah it's amazing old as\nI Am I can remember times when the the Lake Michigan for example fluctuated they would it would be very low and then it would be high and then of below again and there was some ... and probably as a result of the ways you're talking about yeah our eyes\nI think the worst the worst threat is going to be an increasing lack of ice in the lakes for like for like levels I think they're going to go down systematic\nYeah right I mean everything's warming up yeah fake lakes a woman up superior in particular is faster than any of the other one that's going to be\nIt's not going to get ahead or thinking that it's going to get worse I think the other the levels are going to be going yeah we'll be in a terminal deficit is what I'm thinking yeah with a few interruptions once in a while yeah surrounding area goes that help\nOh I got together out even putting ... or late sharp settled in the marsh dark retained or I'm quite banks fun but it's going to get off I got to get more ...\nThinking about it a Ron especially if you're home as close to the right or even if it isn't even if it is yeah thanks a lot for the call appreciate\nIt you can join into number to call one eight hundred six four to one two three four let's go to a dog and cheaper\nOr is it Trevor Trevor Trevor that's what I thought\nYeah that that's what's your uh the ads for the lady said we call a tree right here but anyway I'm your guest there I was curious fate I Know they talk they have an accent from the accent there\nI notice the same thing about you [laughter]\nHow do you guys like weather here for you guys came from I mean as far as your elite ... a shovel the snow was the you know it's similar to you guys flipped out you'll like Wisconsin you know what our whether whether the same where you came from\nSo I grew up on Long Island um and I like ... Wisconsin a lot better uh it's it's the variability of between the summer in the winter I don't like humid weather anymore in August gets a little bit too humid for me for Wisconsin\nBut other than that I like Wisconsin throughout the bet\nI Love it here I grew up in eastern north eastern Massachusetts so the only thing I miss is really heavy snows and this parts of the state of course Wisconsin where you do get heavy snow we don't get heavy snow in Madison that much we get a lot more days on which it snows\nThan um than we did in New England and the worst thing that I'm Glad as in the rearview mirror for me because I like the winter you can probably tell\nWe almost never have snow changing terrain and Madison almost never happens a few times but it used to happen routinely in Peabody massachussetts and I'm telling you\nMy legacy as being a hot broken Red Sox fan from I ... and then having the winter spoil my dreams to of having a day off from school countless times it really changed me into\nA [laughter] I don't have a hard boiled personality than I Am now so\nThat would always Wisconsin weather and the red Sox learning I'm\nJust on and have an I Love this state I Love everything about the state but I especially love the weather in the state in much of it's very similar to New England but the one thing that's different is this no change in the rain it never happens here\nSo I Love that at all like one more thing is that yeah I Love this tape but I really love it when somebody recognizes I'm not from\n\nThere you go out and just you know as long as you know just a week ago as a week ago Saturday oh I was at the badger football game and a lot of people in southern Wisconsin were suddenly\nIn a blizzard or ... I guess is is that that was the term that was used and what what is it fair term I Would use that yeah I Will say well where you couldn't see across the from uh from my side of the field\nTo the other side of the field and the the the uh yard is Margaret everything was discovered white blanket for a while that was spectacular and think about my situation if I can be personal for just a second I was on the precipice of the greatest weekend of all time we've just seen the Bruins when game six\nThere was a prospect of them going in the world series the red Sox were already in it and it was just knowing what I mean it couldn't have been better for me except for one one missing but they paid the price does more for just a snake [laughter]\nSo yeah the snow is ah that that was that was that was pretty pretty cool I said well is is that actually a definition by the way it is and it's a convicted storm in and out by\nWas ... it was almost all grow up and when it came through that's kind of conduct of little soft palate yeah I'm so that kind of ... not snowflake in shape and you pick 'em up and they crumble yeah are they bounce around I mean it was just phenomenal to watch\nWhat an amazing day and it was\nPerfectly predictable we're talking about it on friday at our Web the discussion we had our alumni and for the first time ever and then we had a big weather discussion on friday and I was saying you know it's going to snow in ... during the football game and and it was really obvious on the weather maps that that was a prospect in\nAnd then everybody looked at their phone and saw the weather forecasts are for the next day was rain at eleven o'clock twelve o'clock forty two degrees I said no no it's can be colder than that and everybody in the room agreed [laughter]\nIt happened just right now you talk to them Betty and one key thanks for calling\nOh hi yes my aunt\nGave her and she lived away in southern Missouri way down south ... and we have this tape and advertise she would say I think it's going to start with Tim Morrow got room at my knees [laughter]\nOh well I what about that yeah I you know a number of people have said that and I've heard and and friends and sure enough there's a storm that comes in it so so the weather can affect your body right yup yeah especially joins apparently yeah\nEspecially joined so there and it affects John's body when it's going to you know he's ... Mr Right yeah yeah is it the atmosphere the er at I think it's very spare pressure I think I have done studies in the Alps to what the real down slope wins must be pressure difference is it can't be the humidity that doesn't get through your skin and joins just got to be the pressure on you\nShared have you got a quick question for us\nI Do rent on either side of the early morning boundary waters and storm after that what did what did that mean those\nUp to the side of the sun they're probably um [noise]\nUh some dogs um and they're usually associated with high level serious clouds which could be coming from the anvil cloud of his storm headed underway and his son dog is um it's a reflection of light as they are like from the sun hits big ice crystals so much like the Christmas you\nYou put in your windows and they reflect the light and generate rainbows except you really only see the yellows and the reds oh\nSo there you go Sharon thank you very much for that call and\nYou guys are are going to be back on November twenty six\nWhat's the weather going to be like perfect perfect perfect partly cloudy and so with this chance of possible ray or maybe help them water to bet that we're all going to be a little bit of you [laughter] yeah it would be right after they exhibited\nOh John Steve thanks so much John Martin professor and former chair of the department of Atmospheric Sciences\nStill obviously a member there and a professor there ... also in that department and in addition he directs the cooperative Institute for media logical satellite studies there'll be back on November twenty six [noise]\nTomorrow appraiser an auctioneer surely bombing back to talk about holiday collectibles an antique ornaments among other things [noise]\nIn the meantime stay with us lots more in store here on the ideas network\nOn central time you hear about what's making news in Wisconsin whether it's in the halls of the state capital or on the shores of Lake Superior reexamine national stories through the lens of life in the badger state and we talk about how the biggest events of the day will affect us right here in Wisconsin we ask what you think about politics the economy and much more\nJoined us weekdays on central time from three until seven or online anytime at WPRI dot org\n\nOur comes from the Wisconsin alliance of artists and crafts people presenting winter art fair off the square at my known terrorists in Madison November ten ten eleven details are at arts craft W.
