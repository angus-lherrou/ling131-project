P. R. dot org\nAnd Sharon in Willard will go to you next Hi Sharon\nOh good morning my experience that dictate that ...\nThrough his former employer um there was quite a few that closed up our local branch that there were all there are some say so we have fire state and federal charges\nAnd we thought everything was clear it out well this year we were still fade a little pay property taxes from property on twenty so luckily I kept our paperwork\nFile identity theft again but I'm encouraged people if you don't have any problem don't ever get rid of any of your paperwork that you have filed for anything because it helps a lot and and um settling any affair\nSo that's really good tip Sharon and here's sharing with seven years later this Pop's back up again in the show\nYeah this is the problem with identity theft in that\nIt can go on and on and on and it can look like it's just dormant or or quiet and all been corrected and cured and then all of a sudden it will pop back up again so\nRegular monitoring of your credit report that's not going to show this lawsuit that no show that property issue\nAlways being conscious and aware of your digital footprint in and Googling yourself and your name and information um is always a good thing to see what's going on out there as well\nUm but doing all of those regular practices that we've talked about to monitor your identity to be sure no one is out there misusing at 'em but once you are a victim\nIt is something that can continue forever you you just don't know when it will happen again\n[noise] so you keep that all the the digital information maybe you'd put it on a jump drive or something and save it off to the side and you keep all the paperwork you do put that in a file cabinet\nMhm just like you do your tax records you just you need to hold onto it over time so you always have that map you always have that information to share along the way\nThat police report that shows that you filed you were a victim that statement from the data breach ah that that occurred that you received always be keeping those records\nThanks for the ... a great job sharing appreciated very much I Want to give a caffeine Mitt Romney a chance to join in Kathy hello to you\nHi Larry I'm thanks for taking my call your um I just found out this week that my father in law has been\nScammed out of upwards of thirty five thousand dollars out of ah various accounts that he has a bank accounts and other accounts um his son um\nHas been treated taking over writing his checks because he's not capable of that and but he did have um control of some accounts um believe he was contacted on his cell phone\nMost of the contacts came on his cell phone\nAnd they promised that\nHe had sweepstakes money coming from the publishers clearinghouse and other uh contests but he had to pay the taxes on it so he\nAt various times um when he was asked sent money and it was in cash and it was sent through FedEx\nAnd I'm only recently I think I Believe it started in August only recently did his son who's been kind of paying his bills find out by looking at\nThe accounts that large sums of money has been taken 'em so law enforcement was involved um contacted their involved or local law enforcement\nUm account numbers have been changed his ... his cell phone number's been changed she has a land line which he wants to keep so I understand that will have to be changed\nJust to go out um and be reported to the consumer protection bureau of the state so that other people are aware that this was happening um\nYou know and I don't know if I'm I Need to call the bureau to record this should I talk to them and give more specific information um who are just by\nJust by announcing this I just want people to be aware that they're after elderly he's eighty five or six and he's lost his wife years ago he's very vulnerable\nIs you know lonely and um he\nI'm sure that they promised him cash and priceless and all kinds of things there was a car mentioned that he could win and he fell for it and so um and I believe we are going to have to watch them a lot more closely and probably not allow him to have control of\nOf um his money you know and just\nYou know you have an effect as yeah thank you so much for calling I [noise] really a sad unfortunate thing that and your family isn't the only one I don't think it goes it must show\nNo by no means is that the only one which is very sad and unfortunate and I don't really want to thank Kathy for sharing that story you can certainly file a complaint with consumer protection go to our website and report it that way da TCP that W. I. dot Gov\nUm if if you're looking for us to provide an action or contact your father in law in any way but otherwise sharing this information the way that she has is really what we are seeking and making sure that people exchange this information so they don't feel like that\nThey need to be ashamed or that it's only happening to them and to keep it confidential because\nThe attorney general asserted a task force on elder abuse and not just the physical form but the financial aspect and so there's many agencies that have come together over the last year to look at ways to help and keep this conversation going\nAnd and and how to make sure that law enforcement and protective services and all the social services are engaged in in this aspect of it to really combat and\nSo now it's gonna be the the part with the father in law of how to allow him to maintain his control over things without it you know because otherwise you want to report and talk about him anymore he'll keep them confidential 'cause he'll fear of losing more power and control of the lifestyle so\nI'm the adult or the local county eighty RCs I'm aging and disability research centers are great resource to go to for how to\nAnd and uh the or Glenn or the handyman ask for a certain amount of money and then simply adds comes with the money without any work being done at all\nAnd I obviously I don't want to run into that so I'm Wondering what is that if a logical percentage\nOf money that a a handyman would expect to get before work ever start a ... and I like all the advice you could give me about even undertaking this procedure yeah\nWell I've used a handyman at time or to it I I this was a local person number one and it was somebody that was recommended to me by a friend a neighbor and moved in that case the person was doing some work and\nI asked for the money that was required to purchase the lumber or the paint I forget what what all was involved and so I provided that money you know he had written out statements that we signed [noise]\nUm and and that and then I paid the balance once it was too so that's that's what I did and I I think that's the proper procedure Michelle\nBut you haven't done pretty well they're Larry I come work for us we're already so busy um yeah the one piece I'd add 'cause if you don't have a friend or a neighbor to talk to or and that reference check pieces be sure you do that research call consumer protection and the better Business Bureau to see if there's any complaints\nUm if you have your your contract which will list everything that's going to be done and then the supplies materials that are needed when you make that payment be sure that you get a lean waver as well um put a search your right to get that lean waiver an alternative to lean waivers\nEli labor is similar to a receipt but it's different this um is it a statement from the company that says that they've received the money and it could be from all sub contractors and suppliers as well\nThat this money has been received in it protects you from state law where a contractor can file a lean on your property if you fail to make payments for a job but it's it's Wisconsin's lean law and so if a contractor ends up being unpaid\nThey can basically have a stake in your property when it comes time to sell it you know there's this lean out in the home\nSo um get your lien waiver but you know if it's just if it's a handy man it's not a big remodel its not a a real um\n... another alternative is okay let's go to marriage together and I'm going to buy the supplies and in we drop them off in type situation if you're concerned about putting money down with the contractor 'cause if that money is all just for materials and there isn't any\nCosts for the contractor to be getting them their time aspect\nSometimes you can just arrange that\nThey'll order gets placed and you pay it directly with the supplier situation so\nNever give your information your credit card to make that happen to the contractor you would work directly with the supplier to be doing that piece of it but\nMake sure you have it all in writing and um I we can't really say percentages because everything is going to vary so maybe a majority of the job is materials um so that that's a really hard thing to sake but maybe most of the job it's labor has its just painting so you see that a lot of paintings\nAnd we've got a fantastic home improvement consumer tips fact sheet available attack how so she wanted to call one eight hundred for two to seven to eight and speak

trade and consumer protection\nSo questions about a possible scam or a consumer issue I Hope you'll join him the number to call one eight hundred six four to one two three four email was at ideas that WPRI dot org\nAnd let's take another call Carl ah up next Carl thanks for calling what's on your mind\nUm we had a situation where we had a late mortgage payment and a mortgage company called uh my wife's sister my mother and somehow they got a hold of my daughter's cell phone number at all of them is that legal and it's their way to stop that\nSo they called them to find out\nTo send a message to call them to contact them about the leak mortgage payment okay I don't know how they got a whole their numbers\nProbably through some search that they do to the collection so depending upon what was stated the collection practice could be okay but if you have concerns the department of financial institution actually\nUm regulates collection agencies and those collection practices they can contact using means that they know to do so it's when they can do that and what type of of communication happens during that contact so\nI'm certainly worthy of a ... of a communication with the Wisconsin department of financial institutions\nYeah for sure thank you Carl for calling appreciated and again you can join us eight hundred six four to one two three four times shot into Mm I'm\nA emailed to say she recently I had a new water well put her on our property the contractor was paid in full on time\nPer cashed check clearing her bank however he sent her a letter stating a late fee and was going to play so lean on our home and charge for ... plus percent interest\nAllowed by some state law can he plays a lean for a late fee that didn't ... doesn't really exist because she paid on time what's the process for contractors placing leans\nSo there is a a lean statute in the state of Wisconsin we don't have a ... over it I think it's in seven Ninety nine chapter seven Ninety nine but\nUm that dictates that first there needs to be written notification of an intent to file Alina the ability and then the lean comes and it captures when those liens can happen um\nI you know the the things that bring to mind here is if that\nThat there was no disclosure about late fees and percentages as part of our original contract consumer protection has some concerns with those issues so I Would encourage her to file a complaint with us so we can look at the first stage of this the contract\nBut then they also share it with the Federal Communications commission Communications Commission and other law enforcement entities that are doing these investigations so lots of information sharing\nIf we can identify who owns the number we look to see if they're registered telemarketers or not and start our actions and investigations and go from there\nWe don't have any authority to fine companies but we do have civil forfeiture authority um and that means that it's more of a court proceeding where there has to be\nSettlements or guilt as opposed to just issuing a ticket like a fine like you receive for a parking ticket situation [noise] Kate\nEmailed to say uh well she had a an experienced this year she was a gun incoming phone call on her cellphone identifying itself as ATT\nA customer care listed in er so directory so she answered it because it looked legit if there was a recording stating that her account was suspended and the let her through several steps requesting or password the last four numbers of her Social Security account which she entered\nWhen she got a message dating she would get a call back in twenty or thirty minutes she got suspicious\nCalled AT and T. right away and was told it was a scam calling people and making it look like eighty of these phone number she couldn't believe she was fooled by this one\n[noise] yeah it's another example of a an elaborate spoofing situation where they um gave a number and then they were there to answer the phone and they had the caller i._d.\nIt legitimate enough that she filled out the information 'cause no one wants their their phone in you know ... that's a lifeline today\nUm and in in the steps that to change is instead of using the number that was in the directory that she size to stop\nGet your phone bill log into your account if you have it didn't look at the phone number that's listed there in called that number rather than the number that was left as part of this scam I mean that's the only\nMissing piece I can see in all of this down if there is a problem with your account as well you shouldn't need to verify back to them information they should have that already\nA listener emailed to say she has fraudulent charges on her credit card from her trip to Italy her credit card company says she has to pay because the paperwork she was providing\nA that it was fraudulent are in Italian and he is still the the the verbiage is in Italian not English so they say well we we can't pay what can she do about\nThis well if it's a you us issued um credit card then she has a sixty days from the time that the charges appear on her credit card bill to file a formal dispute\nAnd I'm thinking that that's what she did and you have to provide all data under I usually signed notary type situation a form of affidavit so\nUm if she can file a police report and the men that otherwise she should file a complaint with the the CSP beat the consumer financial Protection Bureau at the at the federal level\nUm and if she needs help getting their certainly contact us a consumer protection and will help to direct her that way but that's a federal law that's in place\nThe uh the end of the year and we're getting there it always seems to be the time when you get a
