P. R. dot org\nSheila how does how does somebody\nUm gain inspiration or how do you may be how do you gain inspiration for the things that you do in the gardens\nLane and when you work in a public garden as a couple of challenges one would be the weather which you can travel and the other one is to try to invent yourself every year and try to create something that people haven't seen before and I kinda like oh I never thought about that\nSo we're always and I searched searching for inspiration and I developed some techniques along the way and how I kind of a ... about um the science and my gardens okay what do you do well you know I think color is it's inspiring\nCenter they see something they like his parts of the color and they needed they do not quite sure where they're going to put it\nBut they needed so color is very inspirational and so I work off color to like so we we have these large banners that hang from the front of the mansion in the show our exhibition for the summer and I really get inspired by the colors of those banners and try to incorporate some of those colors into our gardens\nAnd another thing I Do is ... you know if you've ever look at your closet and look at the colors and your closet\nOh those are the color is that your your favorite right and so you're kind of some fabric could bear rolling the big inspiration and sometimes I one time I took a slash slash of of fabric and I actually designed a garden bed I'm based on the colors of that of that bad so\nColored stick color is is is a big motivator really\nAnd I know I also try to incorporate um some vegetables into my garden because you know they're small spaces and Peter I want to incorporate these spaces and ... and get production from ... yields and\nSo I use a lot of vegetables and not only because of the form of the vegetables but also the color so like a plant for instance memorable yeah ... ... against that green and so that's a really good drawer but leaks for vegetables that blue collar\nMakes a nice a statement a nice bike and phone she added though and it's really easy grower and so you just plan in God and you have that blue contrast with the crane\nNow partially is another color I use that green it's hard to find that mounting shape of parsley so I use that a lot of agitation\nThan like inspired by vegetables and their colors and their forms\nSort of Iowa I'm thinking about my own closet who it's there's a lot of African\nAmerican and I mean you have a black somewhere\n[laughter] so black well well well well what I Do with black\nWell let's see there's a lot of black grasses are coming out right now the seed pods of a lot of plants are black right yeah so yeah you know in our parking lot I kinda wanted to have a little\nSurprise I planted rhubarb you ever thought about planting rhubarb as an ornamental no reds dams large leaves all that had it all the time so then it creates a big mound yeah it's really fun you're really good ideas aren't ya well we're just starting Larry [laughter]\nWell let's take some more\nCalls your enough about me dead in Merced a McFarland what about you what have you gotten mine for us\nSo I like to thank for the show a great show I have a soil questions for that I just wanted to ask your inspiration\nA discussion my inspiration for gardening comes from childhood memories in my grandparents' farm and then my mom's a yard and that's how I get inspiration that I just wanted\nHer name yeah but you have a question about soil\nSure I hit my soil from the moon vegetable garden and it's low on potassium and I have plenty of phosphorus and maybe just a hint of nitrogen lose needed to know if I add some chicken Lee or some other kind of you or I could be adding more nitrogen and phosphorus as it can you have too much of those things\nWhere are you going to have too much phosphorus for sure yeah you know if there's one thing that's the most important and gardening it's soil\nSo yeah so and the soil makeup is that kind of interesting because we have um gardens I've been around for a long time that really have lots of good nutrients and lots of good micro nutrients\nAnd then we have a new gardens that we just put in and they have chemically us suggested soil but it doesn't they don't grow plants as well as as as the ...\nSo um [noise] you know I think I'm\nDan Dan's probably looking at the long term may be some long term used here I mean there is pretty easy to find a ... this day and age in fact it's your illegal in some communities to self\nSlots for fertilizer as part of a [noise] a a you know in in the city situations because of the runoff so there's a lot of fertilizers you can actually buy now that are nitrogen\nAnd potassium so there's there's that but you can build a soil organically as well and maybe that's a way to go what\nAre you well I absolutely believe an organic soil built up [noise] um we actually eating trap all of our leaves them put them back into the garden and we also use calm posted a sheet manure about I mean that's a growing really well for us one thing I worry about them and knew or is it there salts are too high\nI'm much I'm white compost achievement oh yeah that's what we kind of you just because it's available and and it's complicated for three years\nSo it's pretty it's kinda like gold ... yeah yeah\nSo maybe think about that a Dan I'm compost the treatment or perhaps if you have available ah again something that's been couples that for a couple of years you can purchase often purchased though that at the um garden centers\nYeah that's right that's right\nI go a long term on that I Would too I I think it's important you know most important part of your gardening damn thank you appreciate the call very much and let's go to Britain and spring grove Wisconsin Hi Brittany\nHi how are ya grade pre she had to call\n[laughter] I have an awful lot of old tree that my daughter from that said back and forth so it's been over ten years um we bring it in every winter and put it back out in the summer except it's getting quite large um\nLast year I got a new show coming up and I like uh almost two trees growing in the same pot\nAnd I've read hot it this time of year how much like how to act on that ever grow out of us here in Wisconsin Illinois\nFor any of those are all very good question I don't think I've ever grown avocado I have\nI've done it did it as a kid or tried it a couple of times as an adult but I\nYeah maybe there are there are a native cactus in Wisconsin\nYou had to put it perfectly pair prickly pears or something of that actually would survive the winter I mean I they ... they lived through the winter so that would be one plants I think I definitely think about those yeah you know letters kinda crucial so it's kind of a tough spot to be in\nThe other or you might of just off the top of my head or are there some uh I don't know if you do prairie plants very much but there are some prairie plants Sheila that\nUh do fine with out a lot of water\nNo that's true they're they're rich go down so cheap and so they find water sources other places other than the shadow shallow elements so I Would look into prairie plants his plans tell us also look into the grasses and um if it's a shady area you know houses are are pretty terrible\nToo yeah they'll live I live just can't anti and kill them yeah I can hardly kill 'em so are there and there are some really protracted hostages are out there as well\nThat some of them do well in a direct sun but yeah I saw them like a little shade yeah and then the the dams would would be okay\nYou know something that's more of a psyche land you know the whole ... usually do better and dry conditions but I think no matter what it is you're still going to have to water it\nProbably a little bit of water there I mean they're certainly to get things going mark a and then let those roots get down but\nPrickly pears are going to live on [noise] yeah they're growing up there and they're uh they're pretty darn hearty so you've got a combination of ah four or five things out that ah she um and I guess they threw went into a mansion\nAnd you could probably designing a nice little look I think well yeah yeah I just repeat the patterns you know or or yeah bring some callers back from your house back into the garden\nSo you said maybe along the house you might set a I'm a setting that might be what five feet to six eight feet and then you could repeat\nThat yeah you know the I think that your mind says is that it needs to see something similar are repeating and so even though if you don't know what it is your mind sister repeating patterns any like okay I'm okay with that and sub repeating his something I use a lot of elements in an alley formed by caller\nHuh that help you mark yeah we're good thank you yeah thanks a lot for calling appreciate your call and all let's go to Ruth and ship all falls I Ruth\nHello thank you for taking\nI I I live in an area where we have a little prairie down below our our big building and we're all out to plant there and I'd like to plant wildflowers and their grass has taken over part of it and it's not pretty guy grass it's ugly\nOh if only it doesn't have a lot of feeds on it I don't see any value in it but I don't know how to get rid of it [noise]\nDo you have is that what is the area what it's clay OK okay\nCould be anything and who might not be a a native ...\nUm play I that's a hard one have you could um [noise] you could\nGet a photo or a picture say a a long shot\nAnd then a close up shot of it and um send it in probably I'm trying to think probably the I even the ... disease diagnostic clinic would be able to take a look at it identify it and\nOr even your your county horticulture agent your county agar horticulture agent could probably take a look at it and tell you\nWhat you would need to do to a limited my guess is that it grows by under ground ... eyes on rise zone yeah and there's always going to be difficult to to get rid of to be in a way out and I think\nYou need to get rid of it before you start putting your Perry planted and there's a little more competition and if it's if it's that massive ... planting there it's kind of a girl or I have and so I think in order to be that's the wildfires I think you have to take care of that crash and figure out what it is and how it gross\nYeah you need to you need to find out what it is and how it grows and I think probably you're like I said your county agar horticulture region or maybe even sending went into our plant disease diagnostic clinic at U. W. photos at least they can probably tell you a little bit more about it\nEven though it's obviously not diseased at the moment they could identify the plants but the county agent would certainly almost for sure no so\nGood luck with that I appreciate your call Sheila glass ski is the curator of horticulture at pain art center and gardens in Osh Kosh our guest on guard and talk I'm Larry Miller you're on the ideas network\nHere's a look at what's coming up this afternoon here on the ideas network at twelve thirty on chapter day Jim plumbing concludes reading from rules of civility by a more tolls then joined us from one till three for science friday\nAfter one will get a roundup of all the latest news in science\nAfter to look at how the new movie first man puts Neil Armstrong back on the moon\nAnd dizzying detail\nAnd stay with us after three for central time\nWhether it's the economy education politics or sports there's a lot going on in Wisconsin and it can be hard to keep track of all the latest developments so every Friday we talk of the Wisconsin journalist about some of the biggest stories of the week and how they might affect you and your community joined us friday afternoons for the Wisconsin news round on\nCentral time weekdays for three until seven here on the idea of network [noise]\nFor WPRI comes from the children's hospital of Wisconsin foster care program dedicated to helping thousands of Wisconsin foster kids connect with caring families\nMore about being a foster parent is that C.

I don't think we talked about this she's a thirty by fifty foot area\nPartly shaded she was the landscape uh it's between her driveway and her organic vegetable garden she's wondering where to find good ideas for landscaping using native shrubs flowers and grasses especially in the rural area where she lives\n[noise] ... yeah I think I Would start by looking at a ... organization called the wild lands and they're they deal it's mostly ... and they would be a strong candidate for a slight team plants\nAnd it's a big area fifty three by fifty that's pretty ... pretty big\nYeah so the shrubs are important in that landscape design just for the winter interest um but what I I think I just um to do Google searches talk to people who are native enthusiasts and try to figure out what will work best make sure you have all season garden\nYou know the wild ones oftentimes I you know I Know that group well there there are a great bunch and\nUh if you're a member\nOr a you know you might even be able to get some help from somebody you you might have a wild ones um member living or a mile from your house and not even a no it Peggy\nAnd be able to get somebody to come over and take a look that way or the other some of the prairie some of the nurseries that deal with native plants\nAre prairie nursery just pops into my head very nursery Neal the ball they have a lot of information right on their website\nAnd ... others as well as their catalogs are really good resources to\nNow the catalogs are are wonderful resources so those are those are a couple of ideas of for you there and I'm certainly uh she Wisconsin comment about the wild ones is a is a spot on a for sure\nSo there you go and you can join into a a little time left in time for you and your question or comment or maybe your experience to share the number to call one eight hundred six four to one two three four wet eight hundred six four to one two three four or go ahead and email\nUs at ideas at W. P. R. dot org we would\nLove to hear from you factor roses for a minute as I Do have a lot of roses in in your\nGarden you know we have a Rose Garden and we grow only ... in our garden which are the easiest to maintain right so over wintering is a pretty pretty easy we we do on the bottom up a little bit with some soil and we let them be their natural south through the winter\nAnd spring is the year before the spring hits we actually do a little pruning\nSometimes we actually wait until they start leaf an out and then we start\nClipping right above the Greenleaf right above that Greenland yeah it seems to work really well\nUm but that's only for the hearty roses you get some smell from them\nYou're probably not as much as the floor bundles\nOf the tea high but the only way I'm yeah but uh you know my theory in my garden as if it if it takes too much effort into much work we just have so many gardens that it doesn't belong in my garden you know I tried to grow some disease resistant varieties and\nThings that um you know people would easily grow in their own garden\nWhy I I like that idea as well and I want to go back before we may might take another call here\nAre the the um paying art center and gardens there's a there are things have you gone to the website there are things going on all the time at the pain art center and gardens right through the winter isn't it\nAll the way to enter it's kind of hard for me to keep track even though I work there [laughter]\nSo I'll give it give me give me an idea about things that might be coming up\nWell so what what our biggest item is a is not cracker and the cats on it so we do over Seventy trees decorate treats for the Christmas season and it's in form of the nutcracker ballet so we have the character actors candlelight tours\nDoes that start so November sixteenth is when it starts and it goes until the first of January\nSo there's lots to go just for that alone yeah\nYeah and then he had chocolate or anything like that right yeah well you know we actually have a cupcake cafe or we have large pink trees hanging from the ceiling and so we have ... ... very that dances with children and hands up cupcakes and hot chocolate [laughter]\nSo I was like a good time to me I uh they are ... are engineers ... broken up his eyes to rub it out as they get a little bit about that that sounds great well I tell you what I'm\nDiana in and why so we'll go to you guys have a minute or so or what what's on your mind\nUm I I Know a failed hung in and we used to throw out here and it gets over when he's fine which I Love in all different kinds of come in\nAnd then a couple of years ago there has to got rats votes or something and they just ate all all the pumpkins and now they don't grow day and I don't know what to do to introduce them to the hell\nMy guess is that it probably wasn't the road and and it could have been squirrels because I had a squirrel just eat a pumpkin off my front porch here are not long ago it may have been made been something else that was causing the problems with the pumpkins because if you were having them grow\nThey were in coming just coming up from seed from the sound of a\nA there may be a nutritional that issue there there could be a herbicide drift issues there there could be a lot of things going on\nYeah too much nitrogen yeah too much nitrogen\nWould ah would definitely or create a problem too in terms of at least in terms of getting pumpkins because if if you're putting a lot of\nA manure on every year you may well be\nIncreasing the nitrogen all levels to levels that um are probably get a soil test and assaults assault or high high too so get a ... test tell them what you um have been applying and tell them what you're growing there\nAnd ask for some advice in terms of the soil lay you have again the soil and black knows his laboratory\nCan handle that she loves done a great pleasure we are out of time thank you so much for being with us Glen
