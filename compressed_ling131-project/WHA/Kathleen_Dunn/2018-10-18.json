A. M. U. dot org through an echo I Wonder if we could pick up with that last question I asked Casey Kendra tweeted what I Would like to see is all of the Democrats and Republicans voted out of Congress they are so polarized we need to start over\nHow much do you get a sense that the pure polarization of today's politics is just changing the way voters approached this year's midterms I mean you know Nancy Pelosi's named still comes up quite a bit on the campaign trail she's a of an obvious kind of a hot button for many Republican voters but\nIt is that working in terms of making people show up or is it just turning people off\nYou know a lot of people might be an are frustrated with politics and the country but we're seeing the opposite effect\nOf it not keeping people home or or voting for some third party coalition in fact it's people strapping on the T shirts and going as hard as they can I Do in their political corners I mean the fact is Mitt turns are usually about activist they're usually about\nThe hardest core a people within the party but in fact we're seeing the potential for a surge this year in turnout I spoke to Michael McDonald who's a professor at the University of Florida who's really\nOne of the preeminent turnout experts in the country maintains a turnout database he expects there to be a turnout of about forty five fifty percent of eligible voters this year that doesn't sound like a lot but it would be the highest level for mid term since the mid Nineteen sixties\nAnd that is really spurred on by all of this high interest or seeing high turnout in primaries in in special elections\nAnd you know frankly you've seen Democrats really fired up to vote against this president and we've seen that according to a Pew sixty percent of people say the president is a factor in their vote and that's higher than it's ever been\nA wonder wanna summers what your take is on that in terms of the the potential playbook for Democrats first of all let's just said a little context is focused on the house for example how many seats the Democrats need to flip\nHouse church that Democrats would need twenty three seats in order to take control of the house of representatives and right now most public pull in when we look across the landscape suggests that\nThey're doing they're making good efforts and things are looking good for them right now one thing that I've noticed as I've been talking to folks who work on the Democratic side of the aisle who are professional political folks is they're spending a lot of money to make sure that their voter turnout and are particularly looking at the types of voters infrequent voters here say\nMay show up in a presidential election year but are more likely to stay home and I'm I'm off here or mid term\nLook at the electorate that shows up for mid term elections it's typically older whiter and more Republicans ... Democrats spending a lot of money and a lot of time on the ground trying to turn out younger voters those millennial voters of color or Latinos African Americans and Asians who are more likely to vote for Democrats are also more likely to stay home and ...\nIs there are certain benchmark Warner for what Democrats would consider for lack of a better word of blowouts like you use the goal just to get a fifty percent plus one or is there a larger like a stretch goal but the Democratic party is aiming for\nWhat I'm hearing from most people including Ben ray Lujan congressmen who chairs the demographic democratic congressional campaign committee is they don't think this is going to be a blowout year they feel confident and their chances of taking back the house\nOf turning the house ... but I don't think most people most members of Congress were involved in this would say that there's going to be a huge blue wave crashing over a pick up some ten seats or something like that\nThey're focused on delivering that twenty three as turning the the hospital and the message I keep hearing from them as they want to do that as a a balance of power right now Republicans\nControl every branch of government and they want to restore balance of power to this administration\nYou know this idea of a blue wave was the focus of an email from Marty who wrote I'm all about the blue wave but I'm afraid that between voter disenfranchisement lingering gerrymandering and possible foreign interference we're about to be pumped again\nDominican let me ask you about some of the polling what are some of the main trends in national polls right now in terms of how the Democrats and Republicans might do\nWell when we look at our NPR PBS NewsHour Marist polling Democrats have had an advantage on what's known as the congressional ballot who would you prefer to be a to run Congress ... the Democrat in your district or the Republican the ... in your district\nYou know we've had an advantage for Democrats anywhere from seven to twelve points over from the summer until now\nOr other polling other public polling showing it to be double digits that's about the range that Democrats feel like they would be able to take the at least those twenty three seats in the house and I look at some other factors to just look at the landscape and the playing field and when I gamed out\nOr how many seats would be up for grabs this year\nI found that there are ... seats that were a competitive to potentially competitive despite all the talk of cabinet or you know that confirmation battle in ... Republicans and it certainly did\nOnly six of those seats are democratic held seats Seventy four seats are of the potentially competitive to competitive landscape are held by Republicans no matter what you look at that and you know if the Democrats wouldn't half of those that's the house\n[noise] glad to hear from some of you with regards to your concerns about the midterms including about the nature of polling in general are doing the go I Love you to respond to this comment from a listener who left a note in our inbox\nI'm Alan from Ashville North Carolina and I'm frustrated with the elections with not having enough holes in down ballot races even even U.S House state house and stuff because if it's a close election I Want to vote Democrat\nAt least at the federal and state level but if it's a Julian that I Want to vote a third party greener libertarian\nOr write my own it so I Need to know it raises a host or not if it's a it's an issue it if my vote might be the deciding vote and I need a all I Need some polls to divide and it it actually changes my boat all change my vote\nEllen thanks for your comment medical that cracks me up or if he wants to run for office he should run for office if he wants to a vote third party because that's his conscience than he should do so I get a pragmatic approach though and I think a lot of\nThey wish there were a lot more voters like him who voted in Wisconsin Michigan and Pennsylvania for the Democrat instead of voting for the third party candidate now when it comes to polls look\nThere is a huge problem in this country when it comes to a polling generally and then when you go and drill down into the state level or district level or state house level my goodness\nThe response rate that people are getting from polling is lower and lower and lower every year in other words you make a phone call does somebody wish to participate in that that just continues to decrease\nIt takes a lot of money to conduct a good pole and to get a sizable enough sample that the results are representative and it's really tough and I would just say go based on the issues and vote your conscience\nYeah quite a lot of you express real concern with the very nature of polling Peter wrote on our Facebook page please discuss the obsession the media NPR included has with a horse race method of election coverage is an irresponsible journalism to report on polls one such reporting could affect turnout or elections are not sporting events\nAnd Michael wrote on our Facebook page unit which still trust polls remember how that turned out in twenty sixteen\n[noise] yeah I mean I you know look I mean this is a this is a tried and true a criticism\nUm ... you know we can get into the science of polling and whatnot and I would disagree that were obsessed quote unquote with polling we do use it to pepper our coverage and to give us a sense of what the snap shots are within districts in fact\nI'm far more interested in trends in polls rather than poll to poll horse race I think that's a not a good way to look at the polling ah I think that uh again overall trends and you know issues and questions\nOf giving you a sense of a kind of a temperature read of people is way more useful\nI should note earlier this year back in February we did a whole hour on the nature of political polling Dominican was part of the panel you can listen to that program which we called can we trust polls\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

P. R. dot org let's get to some of your comments about the midterms Laurie emailed I Am a lifelong Democrat and I can tell you what frustrates me and has for years\nThe complete inability of the gyms to get a message and stick to it I've gone to my local Democratic Party website in the front page does not see what they are for does not told me what they care about one summers you've been following the Democrats in the run up\nTo the midterms how common is Laurie complaint and how well are Democrats doing an answering it\nWell I think the largest pointing to is actually really comment and I think Democrats are trying to figure out how it affects that and number of the conversations I had\nI have recently wrote an article that looks at how Democrats are trying to make sure they have record midterm turnout and they said that when they're talking to voters are sending out mailers are going and knocking people's doors in these battleground states and districts are trying to make sure\nThat they're telling their voters that they have a message that they are running on rather than just having these conversations that are about just running against President Trump's\nBase that um I was talking to some groups that dead centerfield testing recently among Latino voters and they said ... and when they get this field testing they were saying people were turned off they said if they got a ... a mailer from their local democratic candidate had President Trump space on it\nThey be super turned off right they throw that away they wouldn't even engage or see who the candidate was so I think they're really trying to tweak that match and you talk about what they can do for them what's at stake that that's\nThat's why you hear are Democrats nationally talking about how this is the most important election of our lifetimes why you hear about health care message I think has Dominican noted being such a huge share of the advertising that you're seeing from pro democratic groups it's because they do realize that they need a message for their voters to coalesce around otherwise they're not going to turn out\nTo medical I Wonder if we can follow up on the scene with one more voice mail from a listener on the east coast here's what judge John left in our inbox\nShould John ... sure to New York show off and on the show you've people for the Republicans Democrats or Republicans the Democrats or Republicans would instead of doing that they should be focusing on\nOh she's family the Democrats that stand for searching for the Republicans stand for sharp turn sharp it helped educate listeners because you don't gain anything by just growing Democrats Republicans Democrats Republicans\nJohn thanks very much for calling and sharing your thoughts with us now do medical for me I don't know how you hear this but for me as a journalist I feel uncomfortable saying the Democrats who stand for X. I feel more comfortable saying the Democrats who say they stand for\n... or the Democrats who have done ... to me journalistically that's more reliable but I Do take John's\nPoint that it just feels a little bit too broad brush\nYeah I mean we have to always be aware of trying to get into some of the issues and where are the party stand on these things and what they've been pushing I think that that's been part of\nThe pushback and why you've seen so much interest from Democrats obviously in this election because they've seen so much of what\nPresident Obama did or regulations that were put in place that have been rolled back for example a by the environmental protection agency a and a whole host of other things including an immigration policy that Democrats are firmly against\nAnd it's also what you saw a as a rise of the Tea Party and twenty ten where they didn't trust a lot of their government officials including a lot of Republicans and how they essentially took over the Republican Party with that message of uh taxed enough already and being really in opposition to\nA President Obama's health care act so the party stand for a very very different things and we're seeing that play out and going to come to a head and in this in this midterm\nKatie I Wonder if you can respond to a listener who left a note on our website the one eight dot org listener writes with the upcoming midterm elections and Michelle Obama's advised to go high when opponents go low what is the effectiveness of negative campaigns are the negative campaign ads coming from a particular party or group Cady\nOh I think everyone's guilty and I don't think any party as a\nAs an Israeli going going high all the time right and I think that's because it's effective and that really sticks with people as much as people like to say that they dislike negative advertising and I think actually do it is a memorable\nAnd it's certainly a bill that impression that people are going to remember and that's why we see so much of that and that's why we have jobs ... [laughter] it's funny to do\nYou you will never be unemployed not ever\nTheir medical research on some of the diversity of the candidates this time around quite a few record numbers of women running a record numbers of el ... out L Judy Chu candidates running some of whom spoke to Ari Shapiro on all things considered earlier\nGive us a sense of what that means for the midterms and whether many of these candidates are considered to stay on those strong chance of winning\nLook you're correct that there are a lot of people um who are\nA ... of diverse backgrounds I mean women are the biggest bloc of this that are really driving the midterms you think a lot of Native American candidates or you know just a New Hampshire there Chris Pappas who is\nA an openly gay man or he would be the first gay representative from the state of New Hampshire if he wins in a new in the first congressional district there in New Hampshire as Democrats now\nBut when again we look at the power of the midterms women they has been fired up since the day President Trump\nWas elected and when we talk about when and where I Am a democratic women there have been two hundred and thirty five women\nWho have been nominated for a for Congress for their party's nomination a hundred and eighty three of those a hundred and eighty three has been democratic women just if you were to take the number of democratic women who are running a hot that would be bigger than the record previously of ...\nSixty seven so because I'm Sorry you just just to clarify the numbers are basically saying that three out of four women in this in this go round or democratic women who've been nominated\nAbsolutely that's absolutely right and the the wave of democratic women the year of the woman quote unquote round to ah after Nineteen Ninety two after the Clarence Thomas Anita Hill hearings had been driven by democratic women and we've seen them\nBe very fired up in poll after poll and you know they're going to lead the march to the polls for Democrats and if they win the house it's going to be largely because of women\nWant to there are some races where you know women are making a very historic a historic showing I mean the Arizona Senate races going on right now between here and send them at the Democrat and more with Sally the Republican you know Arizona is going to have a female senator in that seat\nI Wonder how much you see this as a bipartisan trend we heard the numbers from Dominican oh but do we get the sense\nThat both parties both major parties are trying to be part of this trend trying to embrace this trend\nSure so I think that the energy and when we talk about female candidates are certainly more on the side of Democrats than Republicans and I think that's frustrated and number of Republican women I spoke to she women who founded the group Republican women for progress recently and they told me that they were really concerned that their party doesn't have an apparatus to cultivate\nYoung promising Republican conservative went in\nFrom the local those local level seats all the way up so nothing that really reflects say what you see on the left on the Democratic side from emily's list the group that cultivate and backs\nA pro abortion rights when in female candidates so there there is some concern certainly among Republicans and my colleagues that he actually asked Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell about that the question came and this back and forth about the Senate Judiciary committee\nAnd the lack of Republican women on that panel during the hearings around Dr ... Ford and justice Brett now justice Brett Kavanaugh and he's on them early and why there were no women there Mitch McConnell said you know that's something he doesn't like it's something he wants to see more of but I still haven't heard Republicans\nForthrightly at least to me answer if this is such a problem if you want to see more women in the Senate on your side if you want to see more women moving up in the house and we should note that there is a woman and Republican leadership and Cathy McMorris Rodgers but where did as women come from because\nAs we know running for office is very expensive it's very tough it's very tactical if you don't have helping you don't have an apparatus those people are never going to show up\nSpeaking of women Republican leadership to medical I I'm not sure if you've seen anybody\n\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio joined the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

one of many states has been hit hard by the opioid epidemic how does\nThe job market is it just an aging job market or does it manifest in other ways and that well I think the main thing that is that what she right now is sort of the lagging wage growth in the state that is kind of a deterrent to\nBringing more people into the labor force attracting more people to the state our wage growth has been around two two and a half percent a year as sort of lagging this prosperous economy that we hear so much about\nI think one of the quips that I recall a woman said yeah we have a great job market in New Hampshire I should know I have three jobs and I need three jobs Joe yet by\nSo I think that that's a that's sort of the main a stumbling block right now we're beginning to see a little bit of labor force growth as I said we've added sixty five thousand jobs in this state since the down turn\nKind of reversed course and started becoming an improvement but we've only added Seventeen thousand workers\nSo that they're in lies to crunch glad to get to some more of your comments about what you're experiencing where you live with work especially in skilled trades\nSean emailed I work in the steel mill and union and management have been complaining about the lack of quality candidates were even taking mc Donald's employees if they will come in a big issue is drug testing half our potential potential candidates don't come in for an interview after hearing that we randomly drug test\nJulian tweeted billion jobs are no consequences if they don't pay a living wage all the jobs I see what ... my education and pay a third of what is manageable\nBut try to zoom out a little bit more and talk about what's happening not only here in New Hampshire but also nationwide joining us from our home base in Washington is Ryan none policy director of the Hamilton Project and a fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution Ryan welcome to want to thank you for having me on\nAlso here with this is Christine car the executive director for the New Hampshire career and technical educators association Christine welcome\nThank you Ryan\nCan you give us the big national snapshot of what's happening across the country right now in terms of the labor market we know what the national picture is we've talked about New Hampshire are most states doing OK really struggling what does it look like on a more granular level\nSure what I think that it's important to start from a long term perspective does understand where we are now ah and I think it can be summarized with the idea that the labor market is not always linking workers with economic opportunity I start by saying that productivity growth overall has been unusually low since the mid to thousands\nWage growth has also been quite weak\nOr and then there's also tremendous variation in wage levels across the country it's not always easy for workers to access jobs in those high wage places are at the Hamilton Project we've released a paper recently that describes\nHow over the last forty years geographic mobility has plummeted in those geographic imbalances those wage differences I just mentioned have tended to persist over time and the struggling areas in this country are not generally catching up with the prosperous places\nWe asked members of our one a text club for their input one person wrote it wrote us at age Seventy one I was shocked to be hired I Am a retired attorney working as a state employee Ryan do we officially qualify now as being in a a labor shortage capital L capital as labor shortage\nI actually have a different perspective on this or that and there's an example I liked that kind of illustrates my thinking about labor shortages or if you go into a store and you offered to pay less than the posted price for something and the store refuses to do that or we don't say there's a shortage\nAnd I think the same logic applies to the labor market in recent years we just aren't seeing broad signs of extreme labor scarcity and the national data a that scarcity should produce rapidly rising wages has employers compete for workers and we just haven't observe that you know overall ... wage growth after we adjust for inflation remains very weak\nOf earnings and brought industry groups out pacing other industries by big margins are for example ... wage growth in construction and manufacturing is not so different than for the overall economy and a and also say the wages are growing at roughly similar rates across regions throwing a bit faster in New England and the Pacific states but\nAh but not tremendous gaps and and then I'll just end by saying that that's all to say that\nThey were not seeing this at the broad national level but there could certainly be particular occupations in particular places that are characterized by labor scarcity and that have seen some pretty rapid wage growth I just don't think that's probably true of us labor market\nWe heard from quite a lot of you about just the nature of wages as an impediment to filling these jobs Ronald posted on our Facebook page as someone who works for many years in construction mostly trim carpentry I can say wages in the field aren't enough to attract and keep people willing to do the work\nWas show emailed it's wages not supply\nAnd Christine car I Wonder if you might respond to this tweet from Fran who wrote New Hampshire eliminated the state minimum wage a few years ago so even though all surrounding states have raised there's we're at the national minimum wage thousands traveled to Massachusetts daily where the pay is much better\nChristine in terms of what you're dealing with trying to get jobs matched up with workers how much does the state's minimum wage factor in just structurally\nOr [noise] well I I don't have any empirical data why so many uh employees are working in national traveling there that I Know and I lived there that it played over at a caters everyday into the city and out and many of those that coming from New Hampshire\nSo you know wages is one aspect of it but there for sure is an actual shortage of people and my feeling is we've got to really just focus on how they can get the people that we as into the jobs that are out there\nWhat do you see is the Roosevelt shortage Christine was there a point at which you begin to notice more viscerally that the job market and the labor pool were significantly mismatched\nThat you know I feel like you know my point of view is\nSort of a wider industry perspective in in a sense that I work in technology for the last ten years and\nComing to New Hampshire and looking at each other a hike and and um occupation such as automotive construction manufacturing there just seems to be shortages across every single single sector whether it's in India factoring or in high tech\nLet's get to a few more of your comments particularly about\nThe nature of what we've described as an aging workforce Christian in Wisconsin emailed to all the companies out there whining that they can't hire enough people stop discriminating against older workers and older is in quotes we're not old and we have so much experience plus we don't always want a huge salary\nJan in Manchester New Hampshire emailed I Know several educated and qualified older women who lost their jobs here in Manchester they've been out of work for at least six months I've overheard conversations in my local local supermarket from older employees losing hours to sixteen year olds ages them is a big problem\n... how do you see this to the impact of\nOf older workers especially in in high tech careers especially in like Silicon Valley\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio joined the conversation by emailing ideas at W. P. R. dot org and like us on Facebook at the ideas network\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from capital one committed to reimagining banking offering savings and checking accounts that can be open from anywhere capital one what's in your wallet capital one an a\nFrom the three I O T powering enterprise digital transformation with artificial intelligence predictive analytics ... solutions learn more it the three I O T dot AI\nAnd from the William T grant foundation at WTC grant foundation dot org\n\nBack now to our conversation was ... and Ryan ... let me get to a few more of your comments before we bring in our next guest particularly with regards to training skilled workers\nChris writes as a current plant manager of a manufacturing facility and for manufacturing HR director slash production manager for over Fifteen Years in both metal and plastics\nI Am calling BS\nManufacturing in the U. S. has completely abdicated any responsibility for training new employees since the eighties\nThey want to experience people at relatively low wages right off the street if you want lower wages to remain competitive you must develop an inhouse training program that brings lower wage entry level employees up to speed over time\nWe also heard from some of you in some pockets where employers are increasing wages here's one listener who left a voicemail in our inbox\nThis is bill I live in North Carolina and I work in the logistics in or out and supply chain industry and we've had a a pretty good expansion of our business over the last six months and we were really struggling with two items one is employed turnover wherever they're a trace\nNew employers and secondly trying to hire the right people are as a result of that we've had to probably increase our incoming salaries the hourly salary is probably anywhere between ten and Fifteen or twenty percent\nFrom what we did last year so we're struggling with both turnover and securing the right employees so having unemployment down as low as two to two and a half percent is definitely impacting logistics and warehousing\nIt's easy to see how Bill thanks very much for sharing your story with is\nAnother one of our listeners tweeted I hold a four year degree strangely enough in journalism but transitioned into a trade job shortly following college because the pay was three times what a starting job in my field would be I Know makes six figures yearly and work in the rural community I grew up in\nI Will withhold my thoughts on your abandoning your journalism degree good for you glad you found something that works for you but\nThis listener has an interesting point because to stem their brain drain some cities and counties and states are offering to pay workers to move there there's a city in Nebraska that'll match signing bonuses for newcomers\nTo the tune of five thousand dollars Vermont passed a law to pay people ten thousand dollars to move to Vermont and work remotely\nAnd accounting northeast of Detroit is offering to take a chunk out of your student debt that plan was the idea of Randy ... the president and CEO of the community foundation of St Clair county and he joins us now to discuss it Randy welcome to want to say\nThanks Joshua so this is called the come home award tell us what to come home award is how does that work\nAnd come home to award program that we launched in ... and early twenties sixteen is really turning traditional scholarship ... miles on their head um there are too many flaws and traditional scholarships to talk about and doing that but at its core what we're doing is changing the scholarship business model\nInstead of investing heavily in Seventeen or Eighteen year old who may or may not complete college or maybe not be right for college we flip it around and we said we will pay you significantly upon completion of some kind of degree but only if you return to our region to live and work and it's really ... ... reward paying off of that\nSo this is for people who are who are from saint Clair counting to come back home to St Clair counting\nYeah we have a very strong preference for those with family ties I mean to to help protect our investments we allow people to know what it's like to live in a small town America or we want to keep them here and so we feel that they have some family connection here there's probably a better bet they'll stay\nTell me about St Clair county pay me a picture of what's it like\nSo small town America or its waterfront community along the shores of lake here on on the St Clair river um our largest town of course here on as a population of about thirty thousand people we do not have a four year University in our region we did I have a fortune five hundred company in our region\nA thirty percent of our workforce leaves are counting heads down to match Detroit to to be employed\nBut they love the small town life or the family friendly environment and amenities a small town America Josh\nI was just going to ask you about Detroit you're about an hour outside Detroit is that right\n[noise] yeah and you were talking about something earlier Josh I Want to mention you know Detroit has become a talent magnet which is great for Detroit um but the health of American out the Michigan I think is better judged\nOn the economic health of regions like park here at er Marquette or Muskegon, Michigan right it gives you a better barometer of what is our our true how\nHow did the recession do to do in St Clair county where people keep their pretty hard\nYeah I Would say it hit here earlier than than hit the country and much more severely um the ironic part that we tell people and that's really one of the things that led to this come on program was once we really hit rock bottom\nBe government business\nAny other sector we realize that we all had to get together and play a piece in economic growth and prosperity we all had something to bring to the table but more importantly we we reached a point where we stopped waiting for someone from Washington or someone from Lansing to come in and save us with a plan\nIt had to be an organic planned that drove our prosperity\nWe're speaking to Randy Myers the president and CEO of the community foundation of St Clair talented in St Clair accounting Michigan\nAlso still speaking to Russ T. Bo the presidents of applied economic research and Ryan non policy director of the Hamilton Project and a fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution still time to get into more of your questions and thoughts\nAbout the labor shortage won a a W. A. M. U. dot org tweet us ... when a or comments on our Facebook page where you can watch our video streams so Randy telling me how the come home award work suppose I'm from saint Clair townie and I moved to Chicago\nFor work and now I'm considering coming back and how does that work\nYeah Chicago's a great example Chicago Austin's south um as long as you do not have primary residence here so let let's say your parents still live in this region maybe completed college six years ago\nAnd you're still living in Chicago but you met someone you met a partly the medicine every other you're you're weighing the option of staying in Chicago which is a great place to live or you want to come back home settled down start a family spend more time doing what you want to do as long as you don't already live back in our region\nOr you're eligible for a Fifteen thousand dollar award if you're selected we give the recipients a hundred and twenty days to establish permanent residency or they have to find a job that they don't already have won several already have jobs lined up\nAnd then we stretch those payments out over two or three years as the carrot to keep you here\nAnd it's really a simple back a scholarship would pay the loans holder directly which in every case for us has been the federal government\nSo how do so you you pay it out a little bit overtime so by over time by the time to two years or up Sinclair county voted this program to come home award will have put in\nFifteen thousand dollars towards one's dead I'm guessing it's like where there'd be three thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars like every six months or so and it adds up to Fifteen thousand overtime\nAs exactly a Joshua and the goal you know I'm is to really give young people as a young they could be in their twenties or thirties or forties\nI'm the chance to go two or three years without making debt nationally I Know you see data that says the average college student has thirty thousand dollars in debt I don't know where they're getting that data Josh because out of the fifty plus applications we've received our average at an eighty thousand dollars\n[laughter] that that's a crippling amount of debt that's preventing people from living the American dream\nI can relate to that I'd finally paid off my private student loans I had to settle them it was\nCaught it was it was the most awful form of financial slavery I can possibly imagine and yeah definitely like that's a whole other our where I Will I Will rebel you with my tearful story of dealing with Sally Mae before I I Know ... wants to jumping but before he does Randy I just want to\nAsk you about some of the perception issues that we discussed with regards to New Hampshire\nThere's this there there is evidence that young people are moving to a bigger cities in in large numbers you've talked a lot about this feels kind of small town America New Hampshire specifically conquered for sure definitely feels like small town America\nDo you think there's this misperception about smaller communities that young people are getting I haven't seen the TV show that kind of glorified young people in the small town since dawson's creek I mean you don't see it much any more to do you think people are just getting the wrong idea\nSmaller parts of the country that we're all just kind of dazzled by the big city\nYou know that that's a great point I was when I speak around the country about this program in this effort of attraction there is a complete misperception that young people don't want to move to a small town America I'm One of the biggest impacts of this program in dispelling that", "show_name": "Kathleen Dunn", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "18"}
