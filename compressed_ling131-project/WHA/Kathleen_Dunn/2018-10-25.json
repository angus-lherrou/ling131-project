Trump story has been pretty consistent over the years\nAnd it's not that easy for me and you know I I started off in Brooklyn my father gave me a small amount of a million dollars I came into Manhattan and I had to pay them back and I had to pay him back with interest\nAccording to a recent investigation by the New York times Mr Trump was a millionaire by the age of eight thanks to his father's money over the years Donald Trump received the equivalent of what would be more than four hundred million dollars today\nWhat are we now know about how the president got his wealth how does

A. M. U. dot org\nBack to that comment with regards to avoidance versus evasion of taxes\nReporting turned out in terms of how much money it appears that Trump's should have paid in taxes but didn't do we have a sense of what the difference was between those two\nI mean it it it comes into the hundreds of millions of dollars range I mean they did pay some tax on um the schemes that that we found 'em in the IRS push push back\nOn some of the um some of the things that they submitted that didn't add up to them but ultimately we we felt that there was hundreds of millions of dollars that should have been paid to various tax authorities that weren't\nSusanna one of the aspects that comes up in the investigation has to do with valuations I mean when French Trump's children took over his empire they valued at at a little over forty one million dollars all the buildings and all the businesses that they had and the various kind of larger Trump family organization\nWhen they sold the business ... business is all over the next decade they sold for sixteen times more than devaluation can you give us a sense Suzanne of how valuations kind of what you say something is worth factors into all of this\nValuations became a a a theme quit quickly in the in our reporting once we got into the documents\nAnd we saw um sort of writ large when it when it benefited the trumps to put a low valuation on buildings when they didn't want to pay taxes on it they would do that and go to great lengths to to put values that just seems\nRidiculous to us I'm low buildings worth you know a hundred million plus would get a\nValuation says you know five ten million\nBut on the same amount when they had a charitable donation um where they were a high valuation um would benefit them they went high so when it benefited them to go high they went high when it benefited them to go low we saw them go very low\nAnd of course if you inaccurately state the value of something to the IRS and that compromise is the amount of taxes the IRS may or may not be able to assess on that but Russ I Wonder if you could respond\nTo a tweet from Matthew who asked how common are the various tax Dodgers committed by the Trump family that also goes with another comment from Bryce several if you've been asking whether this is kind of unique to the trumps Bryce run on our Facebook page I Would like to know how common to sort of tax dodging inheritance scheme is among the very rich\nAfter the Panama and paradise papers I just assume everyone riches engaged in a lifelong struggle to subvert the law in order to get richer rough [laughter]\nThose are those are very good questions I there are some of these\nSome of the things that we are talking about here that we uncovered are um trust arrangements that the IRS endorsed sometimes after being pushed\nBy a trust in a state attorney I'm a ... and that that that are widely used one of them this grants or retained annuity trust which is the formal name for the mechanisms through which Donald Trump and his siblings took ownership of their fathers empire in the nineties\nThere's actually a commercial video the consulting firm runs a commercial where my daughter is trying to persuade her father to pass on the family winery through one of these trust 'em so there there are quite common\nThan there are other aspects of of things that we uncovered that are not common at all and are not endorsed they set up a corporation that serves no purpose of and pat invoices so Donald Trump and his siblings could start taking some of their fathers profits that's not that's not anything that some doors by the IRS that's\nPatently fraudulent on on its face um and so those kinds of things are\nA gray area and they're not widely used so it's a it's a mix of things that we are talking about here and even in the cases where they used a mechanisms like the trust that are well established and widely used by\nPush the limits the boundaries of those things in ways that a trust in the state attorneys that we consulted with an exam and these things said we're beyond the pale of of anything they'd seen in their careers\nBefore we get into more of the details I'd like to get one more comment that was sent in a through voice mail from one of our listeners who is struggling with the idea that the Trump actually did anything wrong here's what Jeff left in our inbox\nIs he Jeff St Clair falls Wisconsin many many successful people every she'd benefits and her father I see this is a story the second part is taxes avoided\nThat is illegal method of reducing your tax bill through existing a statute to actually ... that would be interesting but so far all areas that he use certain ... to avoid paying taxes as we all do we all take a Dutch standard or otherwise\nJeff thanks for sharing your thoughts with us Susanna what would you say to dress\nUp\nAt the top I mean these aren't standard deductions that one at one of the um one of the things that we wrote a book that Russ mentioned\nUm was a company that was set up it's it's interesting because it's true that the rich due to a lot of things to avoid taxes the trumps cross the line into illegality and one of the companies that we wrote about um this company called all county building supply\nIt was set up in Nineteen Ninety to its sole purpose was to to fraud the ... the IRS to avoid taxes what it was it was a fairly simple mechanism and explain it and and I think reader or your listeners can kind of come to their ... to a conclusion on it\nFor a Trump in in the early Nineteen nineties was getting old he had a ton of buildings he had a lot of cash 'em and the Trump siblings were looking at a situation if Trump died where they would have to pay at the time it would have been a fifty five percent at state tax on all the cash that his buildings were sitting on and we're talking\nYou are listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio joined the conversation by emailing ideas at

A. M. U. dot org before we get some more questions from our listeners Suzanne what about the IRS his role in all of this is\nTheir job to catch the Fred trumps of the world doing what Fred Trump did how do they reflect on this it it is their\nJob and it's an interesting um you know a theme throughout the story when we started to look at the different um schemes and I think one thing to remember about the IRS is um you know ... large um they're understaffed and and often a lot of stuff\nDoes get through 'em and uh I think that that sort of became a parent's house as we were sort of looking at the totality of the er the toxin out against that we saw we do see I'm In some of the things that we found that the IRS did push back\nAnd you know from talking to the tax experts that we did um you understand when when the IRS does see something um there's back and forth I'm with you know and it would have been in this case the trumps but with the people were where were problems are found and eventually they come to a settlement\nAnd we we saw that additional tax and certain things was paid when they saw valuations that they too agreed\nSupport for WPRI comes from the University of Wisconsin stout offering online undergraduate and graduate degrees and professional education that certificate options for adult learners you W stout dot edu slashed WNPR\nThey were aware of what the trumps we're doing there so it's sort of a mix of they caught some stuff and and they push back an extra tax was paid here and there and then other cases where we're not convinced they even knew what was going on\nNow that you report has come out Ross have we heard anything more from the IRS they plan to look into any of these allegations or is it is it too late are are there statute of limitations that are involved\nThere are statute of limitations on any potential criminal charges those up since told there is if there's fraud involved there's not a statute of limitations on civil penalties and and collection of back taxes we haven't heard anything from the IRS we wouldn't necessarily expect to they generally run\nVery silent and most people who work at the IRS are forbidden by law from talking about any individual taxpayer we have heard from New York City in New York state taxation authorities\nWho say based on ah the reporting that we did they have opened investigations and and are looking for ways or if there's a reason to collect a back taxes with penalties\nBenjamin has a clarifying question about all county building supplying maintenance Benjamin tweeted did all county building have to pay taxes on the income it made how much of a difference is the percentage from the estate tax Sudan which said her husband\nUm and it's a good question the estate tax that they were looking at what have been fifty five percent and all county the partners in our county Donald Trump and his siblings I'm would've had to pay some toxic would have been a business tax\nUm and it would have been substantially less than it's interesting at least in the case of the president we know because of the law says that he had incurred\nThroughout his um his life that he may be potentially would have been able to shelter the income and not pay tax on it because in America when you have\nYou know law says you're allowed to use those losses to offset future income so we just don't know exactly what each of them paid but it would have been substantially less than fifty five percent state tax that they were facing\nPart of the story also one of the other aspects of is the kinds of stands out is is how\nFred Trump went to some pretty great lengths to bail out Donald Trump repeatedly if he ran into financial trouble rush there was one story that involves millions of dollars of poker chips and one of Donald Trump's failed casinos ... can you explain that to us\nSo that was uh in in Nineteen Ninety Donald Trump was really in his darkest moment he was facing a a payment on a bond basically a money he owns owed to lenders um and he couldn't make it from the revenue to the casinos\nHis father is a lawyer showed up with checks totaling three and a half million dollars\nBought some gambling ships took the chips back out to the limousine and went back to queens with them and uh and never cast them so that was a venture determined to be an illegal loan that Fred Trump or had given his son to help them make a payment get over that hump\nI Wonder if we all should be clear here I mean even if\nEven if officials in New York or the IRS had known all of these things about the Trump family Suzanne and had decided you know what let's go after them let's ran down to full force of the law on the trumps and make an example of them\nHow much could they have really done I mean what what's the worst case scenario that Fred Trump and the trumps might have faced at the time if they had been caught and fully prosecuted\nOr a big one is they would have had to pay taxes on all the uh on all the money but there could have been civil\nActually could have been criminality I mean we talked about one area with all county where you know they use these padded receipts that they are\nThat they came up with to drain the empire they didn't pass those costs onto the tenants and I'm In doing so you know they inflated they ... they did it on and you know they did it with inflated receipts and they shouldn't have done it\nThat potentially could go into areas of wire fraud among other areas and not so there's a range of things um and now you could be looking at not only having to um\nThey're they're facing potential not only back taxes the penalties in interest on the money that tote so there's there's a lot of things that that I think various taxing authorities um another authorities could be looking at um what does this\nCould they have ended up in in federal prison for this\n[noise] ...\nFederal or state prison it depends on who would choose to prosecute it the the clearest a legal violation that could go into a crime was what she was describing all county they were filing false documents or with a state agency um and there would be slower level charges that would flow to that\nAnd yes those could be we've talked to several former prosecutors who said that looks like\nSomething that could have clearly been prosecuted as a state crime\nClearly some of our listeners so if you feel that this is not as big a story as some of our listeners feel it is Charlie wrote on our Facebook page sounds like President Trump is more brilliant than we ever thought and freedom and Jay tweeted so you're prove that Donald Trump success did start with a loan from his father\nAs he stated where exactly is the discrepancy none Suzanne ...\nInteresting comments I had one one thing that when when we started out Donald Trump has\nHas stated that he started with a million dollar loan and he built into a billion dollar empire he's now in the White House and he ran a campaign based on being sort of a self made\nBillionaire um there is no evidence necessarily that he has a billionaire but what we showed is that he inherited hundreds of millions of dollars over his lifetime from his father um and some of that was done through tax fraud\nPeople may or may not care about that but I think it's an important\nUm narrative of of somebody now in the White House about how he got his fortune in where the money came from it doesn't necessarily um say he didn't get revenue or money from other areas you know there's been stories that some of it has come from Russia but what we showed is that much more of that came from his father\n\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio joined the conversation by

A. M. U. dot org mark before we get into the details of Sergei Skripal life I Wonder what you make of this story overall this kind of\nCaptured the world's attention why do you think that this got such international attention\n[noise] well it's an outrageous fact isn't it or to use that kind of substance on on the streets of a foreign city in order to settle the school I think he is something that a lot of people find extraordinary and you know\nIn in both senses of that would that it's an extraordinary provocative thing but some people\nI think to have trouble believing the British Government marriage had been ... I have to say though you know as time has gone on and particularly things we've seen in the last month now off\nWith the identification of two suspects and then Russian Janice and experts working to find out real identities of those people who came to the u._k. on season and and then to link them to this ministry intelligence service to jail you you know it'll do seem to be pointing pretty clearly in that direction\nLet's talk more about the G are you what exactly is it and what does it do\nWell at the Russian initials stand for main intelligence directorate and it's the it's a direct threats all\nThe Russian general stuff the ...\nOr the ... that I think some plans for the Russian ministry and this is the same in quite a lot of countries that historically the general stuff will have its own intelligence department and that's been the case you know changing one or two that bureaucratic details but more or less since the Russian civil war and the twentieth century\nThat the a Soviet and Russian general stuff has had this organization\nAnd ate embraces a whole a sway the capabilities and the idea of a ... kid reconnaissance so intelligence as practiced by the geo use a very broad concept\nAnd that can be two guys creeping forward on their bodies in eastern Ukraine trying to see if they can ... the Ukrainian full says and basically ... as soldiers on the battlefield and it can be a guy in a ... tell policy in Madrid\nIn Nineteen Ninety six I a total ... who was serving that Under Cover of being a scientific and technical ... tree at the embassy and it can also embrace things like cyber warfare\nAnd spy satellites so it's an organization that has many thousands of people working for it it also has special operations forces are ...\nAnd a very broad capabilities\nAudits Sergei Skripal joined the G argue with\nCan the Soviet period when he got involved or he was invited in Nineteen Seventy nine\nIt was a pretty mysterious thing you weren't supposed to really know about it you couldn't supply it was them who approached cue and he'd been in ... he was in the ... and he was a in a reconnaissance unit that did some pretty daring things like they went into China or on the cover and\nYou know and there are other missions as well but uh described in my book\nAnd I think they ... him to the attention of the G all you as being the kind of staying the guy who who had the right stuff and they invite you to have ... an exam and he goes through that said later that year he started at the what's called the ministry diplomatic academy which is effectively that spy school to Moscow\nWay you've spent four years uh doing everything from you know the real um spine noble trade crossed off of agent meats and count as the violence\nOr ... means of communications for me to my thoughts to secret writing said\nYou know encrypted email all that stuff\nAs through to intelligence analysis and the rest of it so it's a very sorry grounding that they get and having done all that he got ... uh in not sneaky full to move to\nA on his first job working on the diplomatic cover and that's what a generally speaking a lot of these gee all you people who are deployed on strategic intelligence gathering that's what they do they assume a civilian personnel let's say\nA maybe working Farid felt maybe in the embassy maybe in a trade mission Iran they carry on with that tree intelligence and they said oh these people are you mentioned in your introduction expelled from the U.S\nA following the soles free incidents where ah gee all you people working in in Russian organizations in Washington and New York\nDescribed Sergei Skripal and his day what did he look like how did he come across\nWell he's pretty he's a well built guy I mean he's he's a man who uh was a Russian Army a boxing championship level a boat so\nHe he was in the apple fool sees where they they put quite a premium on you know physical strength or rural coverage you know throwing yourself out airplane up nights into an ... kind of stuff\nA ... and so you know he's a tough guy he's he's broad um of course now in his mid sixties or he doesn't have quite the same physical condition you did back when he was working with the jail you but he's still a fairly um striking physical presence he's got a very dry sense of humor\nI'm a dead pan and it tends to make light of the sort of negative things in life so when we were talking about his experiences under interrogation into the full to the prison in Moscow well then in the\nLabor camp he was sent to you know he would struggle to get off and say well I got the stakes than on Iran for that to happen and you know this made me more comfortable and you know he was thinking I think he would have said was\nYou know I had a terrible time already suffered you know because he and his in his military career and doing the things we've done in the jail you read over she'd been in very demonic situations\nAnd I think and much with that kind of mindset ready to sort of make light of obstacles in life and trauma prevail\nHow did you come to meet him [noise]\nYou're listening to the ideas
