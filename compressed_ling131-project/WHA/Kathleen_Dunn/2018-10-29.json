comments on Facebook Tommy rights\nWhen speeches free and in the open people get pushed back when it is driven underground it is giving legitimacy\nAnd leads to action one of the sites that has made news lately is this social network called gab dot com which I don't think a lot of people had heard of before this incident what what can you tell us about gab\nAnd the kind of online footprint that Robert powers had there\nUh ... dot com is a ... it's basically a Twitter clone um and it is was created under the premise of a maximalist free speech beliefs so the idea was a lot of you know racists bigots [laughter] we're getting kicked off of Twitter\nFor for violating Twitter's community standards are\nAnd gab was sort of a a another refuge for them a place where you could say anything because we believe in the you know ... the absolute power of a free speech but when it ended up happening with gab is at it it became a cesspool it became a place where only the sort of worst people would go to express ideas that\nAre that we're really not tolerated elsewhere because they were hateful because they were angry I became it it has become a a place where white nationalism\nA and an extreme or bigotry homophobia whatever a has a has been embraced and and\nUh and this was a place where the the Pittsburgh shooter I'm not going to say his name was maybe not radicalized necessarily but but certainly able to express and have an audience for a lot of his\nI truly hateful views it was the last place where he\nHad posted before at the shooting 'em and it seems that it was it was sort of a a A N unproductive vent for a lot of that hatred I'm an after\nAfter um after it was clear that the shooter had been an active a participant on gab there was a lot of push back a lot of people who are coming in realizing this for the first time\nUh that that this place is a dark\nPlace to incubate a lot of awful ideas gab responded saying our words are not bullets in social media posts I have a body count as zero sort of saying that you know this free speech is different from from action and I are worse than they did they actually say words are not bullets\nAnyone who says that should go read the declaration of independence\nWhen it you know what's interesting about this and this is something that happens a lot of free speech communities online that that don't really believe necessarily for speech but just in being able to say anything outrageous I is that it actually shows that that that the owners of gab\nDevalue speech to a degree if they believe that it has no consequences and then there's sort of this you know this odd warped understanding of why protected so hard if it means nothing um and and I think that that is something that that a lot of people\nDon't quite grapple with especially on the Internet\nRobotic cars I Wonder how you view kind of the phenomenon of of sites like down and get us off the only place where this kind of speech to lift weights on line it is worth noting since our program one a as named after the first amendment the first amendment lesson\nHate speech is protected by the first amendment you were allowed to make hateful nasty vitriolic comments\nIncitement to violence tends to be the line whereby speech becomes\nCurtailed so there is a case for protecting this kind of hateful rhetoric but rabbi Jacobs the Internet has given a new kind of speed and virulence that I can only imagine makes makes encounters like what happened in Pittsburgh all the more worrisome folks like you\nSure it will first of all it's not news that hate speech can lead to violent actions the book of proverbs teaches us that death and life or in the hands of the tongue and that unfortunately\nHas become more and more true it said how true that ancient wisdom is particularly over the last two years but certainly over thousands of years of history\nAnd it's true that hate speech is protected speech that said that doesn't mean that every privately owned platform has to give everybody the right to spew such hate speech\nSo it's different when we're talking about the government controlling speech then when we're talking about whether everybody has the right to say whatever they want wherever they want on whatever platform they want [noise]\nI also just wanted to say something about the ... that one of the to respond to one of the Facebook comments that you read\nThere has been particularly over the last couple of days certainly over the last couple of years a lot of ... and it's true of course that their corners of the left where there is anti Semitism it's true that there's anger but we've seen nothing like\nThe white nationalism that we've seen from the right and what's crucial is not the question of where there's more hate I think it's clear that there's more hate on the right against Jews against people of color against algae ... people against immigrants refugees et cetera\nAnd what's crucial is that that is being\nThat that hatred is being supported and embolden from the very top when the president of the United states that the white nationalist see him as an ally they see him as somebody who will come out after Charlottesville and talk about the very fine people on both sides\nAnd that's what's crucial we don't have a situation in which we have somebody\nOn the left who is in charge we have somebody on the right who is the president of the United states and who is at the very least winking at the white nationalist the racist anti Semite sometimes retreating them sometimes putting out content like the very last campaign ad before the election in which he\nHighlighted George Soros Janet Yellen\nWere a part of some large conspiracy pulling the levers of power and the United states of course trap taps into very old anti Semitic tropes ... yet but it was\nA ... I'm Sorry where am I going to do you want to get a little deeper into that a lot of thought a lot of our listeners have been trying to get on that and endure I'd love to to get your thoughts with that on that I mean the president did address this during a speech at the future farmers of America convention in Indianapolis on Saturday she began his speech by talking about the shooting\nToday with one unified voice we condemn the historic evil of anti Semitism and every other form of\nEvil and unfortunately the vote comes in many forms and we come together as one\nAmerican people\nPart of the president's opening of his speech to the future farmers of America in Indianapolis over the weekend but contrast that with what the president tweeted this morning she wrote quote\nThere is great anger in our country caused in part by inaccurate and even fraudulent reporting of the news the fake news media the true enemy of the people must stop the open an obvious hostility and report the news accurately and fairly\nThat will do much to put out the flame of anger and outrage and we will then be able to bring all sides together in peace and harmony\nFake news must end unquote\nGotten a number of comments from some of you about the president's potential role in all of this Susan lives in Silver Spring Maryland right outside of DC Susan writes I look forward to the day when we once again have a president who understands and always considers but his or her statements have far reaching consequences Indira I'd well\nYou are listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio joined the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

I don't speak for the school uh but I've certainly advised to do that and not an idle everything will do for the book can be can be very hard\nDo but let me put that to you for sharing that let me put that to ... Jacobs rubber what do you make of Dave it's common\nThank you David I wanted to respond both to you and to Stephanie who are speaking about one of the the same phenomenon really I wanted to say Seventy first of all I'm really sorry that your son is going through that unfortunately it's not unusual these days but of course a high school students shouldn't have to experience that kind of hatred\nAnd for both of you I Want to be very clear that there certainly is anti Semitism and the left and very often it expresses itself\nAs as attacks on Israel on Israel's right to exist now that's different from saying that criticism of Israel's policy is is anti Semitic which is not even criticize any countries policies but often that criticism of Israel crosses a line into anti Semitism\nAnd as an organization that is pro Israel and also critical of many of Israel's governmental policies we are all the time speaking out against the places on the left where\nWhere that criticism crosses the line and we have to be really clear about where those places are I have an article actually in the Washington Post that tries to lay out some of the places in which criticism of Israel is not criticism of a country and its policy it's but rather crosses over into\nStraight up anti Semitism and unfortunately we have seen incidents around the world in which there are people who carry out\nWho carry a violent acts and say that they are motivated by hatred of Israel but the targets are actually choose who are shopping in a grocery store and the Jewish store in a synagogue\nAnd at the same time in the United states right now again saying that we have to call out that anti Semitism the left what's different about the anti Semitism and other hatred a race racism and homophobia and seeing a phobia and the right is that it's being supported by the government\nIt would be different if we had a situation in which there was hatred on the left hatred on the right and somebody at the top who is trying to restore who's ... who was criticizing\nAny kind of hatred and who is trying to restore civil discourse to the U.

A. M. U. dot for Emily Martin before we get into the state laws let's talk about the federal sexual harassment laws who do they cover and who don't\nRecover so when you look at workplace sexual harassment laws um title seven as the federal law that says that you can't discriminate based on sex and that includes harassing people on the basis of sex\nBut title seven only covers you if your employer has at least Fifteen employees that if you work for a very small employer federal law doesn't protect you against sexual harassment\nAnd title sudden also only covers employees so that means if you're an independent contractor if you're a freelancer maybe if you're a volunteer or an unpaid intern that you aren't protected by our federal sexual harassment law\nShe was in ... the number of states including Vermont and New York in Delaware have expanded sexual harassment protections to apply to more workers tell us a little bit about more tell us a little bit more about which states are expanding protections and who they're covering\nYeah definitely so we've seen at least twenty states introduce legislation in twenty Eighteen on workplace sexual harassment and the majority of the states I had introduced legislation as it relates to lending or prohibiting nondisclosure agreements or ending forced arbitration agreement so\nWe've seen states are so far enact legislation on that area including Arizona Maryland New York times the California and he mentioned Vermont and Washington\nAnd other states are also looking addict standing training requirements and so how many hours messed a employees are employers and require training and so we've seen legislation on that path in California is just one example of that\nTipping I'd love to hear from you about some workers like freelancers and contractors who may or may not be protected by these laws we heard from the inner ear is already who told NPR she was sexually harassed on two separate occasions when she was a contract worker once while singing in a band and once while working as a tutor\nShe says she could not report the incidents to HR and as a contract worker she had no employee\nAnd I was like I don't want to post that on my social media it it can change your reputation I really wish I could protect myself in both situation there just I feel like I Would have had a sense of agency and and what it felt in control of my life\nFor us to tip it how common is this for freelancers and Nina situation\n[noise] I Do think it's really important to extend protections for independent contractors and that's because employers have no incentive to provide a remedy an internal fix for contractors if they're not even covered by the laws at all\nSo even basic protections ah like your caller referenced like being able to use the employers hotline being able to use the employers complaints system the employer is not going to be interested in extending those the contractors unless they're covered by the laws\nWere speaking to Elizabeth typically associate professor at the University of Oregon school of law Susan whole team program director for employment labor and retirement at the national conference of state legislatures and Emily Martin the vice president for education and workplace justice at the national Women's Law center Emily I Love you to react to a comment that came in from Charlotte\nCharlotte emailed I Am a Florida based graduate student at Boston University\nThis year BU required all students all staff and all faculty to complete a sexual assault training course\nI had no idea how many legal terms are associated with such a difficult subject it's complicated without this require training I Would never have known about my rights as a Floridian much less where to look\nAnd we'll leave this is rather complicated although some states including Delaware Illinois California have passed laws expending sexual harassment training and education requirements for for some employers\nThat is true we have seen this chair and generally seen a lot of policymaker energy in the states around the issue of our place harassment which is exciting that there's been new creative\nUm will to bear thinking about how do we really solve this problem and one of the things that lawmakers have focused on is\nRequiring training or expanding training requirements again under federal law there's no requirement per se that employers train employees on sexual harassment a lot of employers do but it's not because I'm federal law makes them do it\nNow we don't know as much as we wish we did about what sorts of training are really affected\nWhat sorts of training really make a difference in changing behavior so one of the things that I Hope comes from this long overdue attention to workplace harassment is some attention to learning more about what kinds of training can really make change in a workplace\nYeah I I Do want to put that to you professor to but also in terms of what you think makes the biggest difference I mean there's a certain kinds of training or the other new kinds of state laws that you think would be the most effective in reducing harassment\nWell when you think about me to as a sign of a broken system you want to attack all of the aspects of the system so\nPart of it might be that our laws in general do not really hold them accountable when there is harassment in the workplace that it's relatively easy especially under federal law for employers to get out of them\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public

A. M. U. dot org Emily Martin I Love to get your reactions to what we heard from California state senator ... sounds like count California is trying to do quite a bit to improve the way that we prevent and prosecute sexual harassment what do you think\nThat California's ban a real leader in this case those with the laws that um we just heard about that were passed last last session\nAs well as if you love that unfortunately we're vetoed by the governor that would have expanded the statute of limitations for bringing a workplace sexual harassment claim\nYou know in under federal law it's often as short as a hundred and eighty days\nKnow claim and given that we're talking about I'm Talking about activity that really leaves people traumatized that\nIs not enough time often for people to figure out what they need to do how they want to do it to find their attorney to find out how they can take action\nSo you know we joined the national Law Center joined with more than two hundred and fifty other organizations this week\nCalling for twenty states by twenty twenty to pass comprehensive sexual harassment protections and California I think it's really a beacon for other states and thinking about how can they strengthen their laws in meaningful ways many states Emily that you're targeting in particular\nWell I think that one of the things that we've seen this past year is that it's not just progressive states for example Tennessee a past new prohibitions on employers requiring employees to sign non disclosure agreement that the condition of coming to work that would ah\nKeep employees from talking about sexual harassment when it happened and so we're really thinking broadly that this is a nationwide problem that requires a nationwide solution\nSuzanne ... your thoughts on what we heard from state senator Jackson\nYeah I think that's a great example of a legislators I'm really trying to grapple with how to deal with sexual harassment in the workplace and and\nI'm introduced a lot of different types of legislation to get out that I think we've seen a lot of creative um pieces of legislation in other states one thing that I did want to mention is Illinois has a really interesting piece of legislation where they created a sexual harassment hotline which is the first time that we've seen that across the states and that\nProvides legal assistance as well as as a way to report sexual harassment of workplace in private and public sector\nBefore we keep going I Would note that quite a few of you have commented to us today about state laws that are aimed at statute of limitation laws we did an entire hour not too long ago discussing just that very topic\nYou can find the conversation on statute of limitations on line at the one a dot org sets the words are the number one the letter a dot org Susan let me stick with you we mentioned nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements you mentioned the state of Tennessee\nCalifornia, Maryland and other states have also banned certain kinds of those agreements and in a number of states those laws passed unanimously I Wonder if she's in if we can begin to the line of where nondisclosure agreements come into play I mean they're not\nInherently illegal they can have a purpose\nIn contracts I work in news a lot of people who work in journalism have certain kinds of contracts about disclosing privileged information Dennis wrote on our Facebook page\nThere was a place for legitimate nondisclosure agreements however it is a disservice to our communities one beer used to hide illegal behavior I Would be comfortable with laws that allow anyone to speak with law enforcement in such cases regardless of the existence of this agreement Suzanne\n[noise] yes well that's interesting and I will say that states are not all states in their legislation specify these contracts as nondisclosure agreements and sometimes they just call them contracts um or other types of agreements\nMost of the legislation that we've seen us specifically says nondisclosure as it relates to sexual harassment in the workplace so it wouldn't necessarily ban nondisclosure in great agreements and hold but just as it relates this specifically to sexual harassment in the workplace\nPressure typical before we move on to too much for there can you just define that ... what exactly is a non disclosure agreement what exactly do they do well\nThere's actually two types there's a type that you mentioned that people find at the start of there\nAnd that was another types of people find usually after they're already involved in a lawsuit or they've hired a lawyer and those are to settle the person's legal claims\nAnd those are the ones I think that had become most problematic because in those cases it's clear that some sort of bad conduct of the current or is disputed and in those cases both parties might agree that they're not going to talk about the facts underline the case\nFor someone who stick with you for a minute I I Wonder what your thoughts are in terms of the line for confidentiality agreements or helpful or hurtful in terms of dealing with sexual harassment I understand that you have said that they may not be enforceable because they may be some there maybe some contradictions\nWith federal law but I Would gather that sometimes they can be in the best interest of the person who's been sexually harassed where do you see the line\nWell\nFor the contracts that you sign at the start of your job I think it's helpful to have a law that makes clear that those can't cover a sexual harassment or other forms of harassment or discrimination because essentially forces the employer to disclose in the contract\nThat keep our business information confidential but if you experience unlawful conduct you're allowed to talk about that so the contracts in a way educate the employees about their rights\nIt's a lot more complicated though if you're talking about settling a lawsuit because in that case many times the person who's represented by a lawyer and I've heard plaintiff lawyers say that they like these provisions 'cause it's move the path toward the settlement\nAnd I think that's kind of hard about this is the people who maybe had the most interests and learning this information aren't at a table future backed and potential victims of harassment they don't have a say and whether the victim and the employer decided to keep the information secret\nWas because of some of your comments and questions Alex tweeted earlier this year in the army I got sexually harassed by another soldier luckily we have to go through sharp training every year we all like to make fun of it we make fun of it to the point where when I actually had to use it I knew exactly what to do\nStuff on email to my girlfriend works for a college in upstate New York while in Chicago for work conference a resident of Illinois sexually assaulted her despite my encouragement she is terrified of coming forward for fear of retribution do laws across state lines especially in Illinois and New York\nComplicate the legalities that would otherwise helped bring perpetrators to justice Emily Martin what would you say ...\nWell that's a great question if you're talking about state law protections that go above and beyond cetera light yes there can be complicated questions that arise if the person is usually employed and Wednesday but the harassing or assaults and behavior was in another\nBut it's important to remember that we're talking about state law stay in the ways in which states are going above and beyond federal protection and there are core federal protection they should be strengthened in various ways that their core federal protections against workplace sexual harassment against sexual harassment in schools and so that is a baseline that covers\nEverybody with the important exemptions that we've talked about that no matter you know what is it because they live in\nA suicide I'd love to get your take on one of the states that did not pass at least one of its proposed\nBills on sexual harassment and that was in Louisiana it had to do with settlements of sexual harassment cases Louisiana State House bill five seven eight would have stopped employers\nFrom forcing workers to settle sexual harassment disputes through arbitration state representative Raymond cruise voted against the bill among other things the rep said it would open up litigation for everything\nNow we're considered one of the most ... states and the nation's one source I just looked up said we're number six six out of fifty on worst states for litigation matter of fact if you divide of the country into five four regions the south has one", "show_name": "Kathleen Dunn",
