A. M. U.\nDot org we know that for quite a few if you're discussing climate change can be difficult so have you been giving us your suggestions\nFor what has worked for you or what might work\nMelissa writes for my Bible friends I remind them that we are called to be good stewards of the earth nothing the environmentalist or suggesting would cause harm\nFrom my fiscally conservative friends I talk about the economics green power is more profitable and this is the future autonomy more jobs better jobs saving the earth for their grandchildren is way down on the list\nWe also heard from some of you who are dealing with the difficulties of discussing climate change Caitlin left this note in our inbox\nReferral ... at the environmental science and I'm very interested in protecting the environment teaching about\nClimate change\nWant to know ways in which I can better explain myself to others are\nJust regular people who might not have the education that I have about climate change because from where I'm standing at plainly all the ... what's going on and it just seems like we really need to come together and actually make a change or there's going to be a really bad and\nCaitlin thanks very much for sharing your thoughts with his poll I Wonder how you would respond to Caitlyn particularly because I think sometimes if I may just add or a comment the terminology often gets us in trouble I mean some people use the phrase climate change some people say extreme weather as some people say global warming and\nJust beginning to get on the same page can be one of the core problems of talking about all this it's\nA great point we need to recognize that the good news is we have the solutions to address this problem the technical solutions the energy\nSolutions the policy solutions what we lack our political will and consensus around action\nWe know that we have to ... global emissions by twenty twenty and go to zero net carbon by twenty fifty turns out we have the technologies renewable carbon capture\nA electric vehicles and many others to make that happen if we make a real push but it is going to take a huge push likely made during the Cold War I Wish the country would come together over this expression of American leadership\nLeading the world again to safety I think that's possible but when one party in the United states it's a nice factual information over twenty year period then elected president who almost campaigned on it it becomes very difficult to engage\nClick that in this midterm election George tweeted as an environmental health scientist I focus on telling people about the immediate and local clean air health benefits that will go to people in locations taking action to address climate change pollution and reducing fossil fuel burning irrespective of opinions on climate\nKatie emailed my family has vacation to Mexico beach in Florida for twenty plus years and we have many friends and loved ones from Panama City who have lost everything meaning in hurricane Michael\nMy father is it this believer of climate change and it's been very upset about losing a place we love so much he won't consider that just maybe there is a greater sing at play here what is it going to take for this to change how do we those who are convinced that is happening change the way we talk about it and rather than shutting down the conversation\nNurture it Sarah how would you respond to Katie\nGosh that's a really really great question and I can feel that the pain that she is and and the laws that her family is\nStruggling with to describe and you know\nThis is this is the peace around recognizing how difficult this information as like I got exposed to the science of climate change when I started graduate school and it took me\nLike six years to integrate the scale of difficulty of that information and it it people can get exposed to the science of climate change and it ... they can be in such a vulnerable place that it's actually potentially dangerous for for students and people who are struggling with mental health issues\nSo the the way that we unpack this I think\nIs through and through relationship and trust and empathy on because as we interact as individuals and we come to terms with the scale of the change and the crisis you can have a lot of really based on emotion and fear anger um [noise]\nI anxiety all of these pieces that are we all sent away from those very challenging emotions and often when we feel those emotions we shouldn't into our partisan corners\nWhere we think we know the way the world is and we we become ever more entrenched in our existing world view and that's why being honest that yeah this is a really difficult conversation and that's exactly why we're having this conversation is one of the ways to start\nSarah if I could just doing it a little deeper on that I Wonder if this idea of being empathetic and being a little compassionate might also speak\nTo the conversations with folks who feel very fatalistic I mean\nIt's hard not to read the latest report from the un climate change which we discuss last week on this program and not feel like well we're all going to die anyway why bother run up your credit 'cause they're not going to be around to collect you know what I'm saying like it just feels like\nAn intractable problem and I wonder if maybe a little empathy for folks who feel that way would go a long way\nWell I Want to so yeah I got it and I I Want to remind remind us that as we sit\nWith the privilege of western lifestyles and we look at the science that we've invested public money into you know remembering that we're living a science fiction fantasy right now and we can look to human history and see that there are many other cultures around us\nAnd specifically in the U.S Native American and indigenous Native American people\nWho have already experienced the kind of cultural eradication that we are looking at down the line and ... the the consequences from climate change we can look at the stories of human tenacity\nAnd how people struggle and survive through massive massive shift we know these stories and we can\nThe stories of for example the water protectors and the people who are standing at the front lines right now saying the earth is precious we only have one planet and we're all going to show up and on informed that you know the public's eye of the necessity of staying in this place and and staying vigilant I Would\nJust go go ahead go ahead ... but oh I Would just add that\nThe St Louis is a reasonable reaction if you don't know the full range of solutions\nThat there's a lot of good news here\nTwo years ago we eliminated one of them six main greenhouse gases it will no longer exist on earth Twenty years from now with the golly agreement to phase out HFCs\nTurns out there three or four other super pollutants like methane and black carbon if we can reduce these quickly about three times the current rate\nWe can limit near term warming and prevent run away climate change\nWe need education about the fact that we can take hold of the climate crisis and actually solve it exactly to combat that fake lives in which is a serious problem and I I really do feel empathy for people who are overwhelmed by a ... a little further what our HFCs\nAgencies are hydra floor carbon Sarah manmade gas that ironically are used in refrigeration huh in air conditioners\nAnd they're growing incredibly quickly because we phased out an earlier set\nOf CFCs chlorofluorocarbons\nTo fix the ozone hole by the way it's worth noting that that happened under Ronald Reagan a Republican it's also noting that the acid rain problem was solved under George W Bush\nYou are listening to the ideas network of

would love your help with tomorrow's program about being Native American Massachusetts democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren recently announced that a DNA test has confirmed what she said all along that she is indeed of tribal heritage\nThe test was the clock back to President Trump who mocked her for claiming that heritage and refer to her as Pocahontas\nCritics including some tribal leaders say direct ancestry matters more than DNA testing in this regard\nIt's just one of many issues that may have Native American voters talking head of the midterms\nIf you are Native American what has claiming your heritage meant to you what tribe or are you part of and how does that factor into your life\nLeave us a voice mail eight five five to three six one a one a now if you're not Native American then share what your heritage means to you especially if it's something you learned about a little later in life what did you discover and how did it change you\nTell us your story eight five five\nTo three six one a one a or you can leave us a radio quality audio file through our app won a vox pop will share some of your stories tomorrow on one day\nBack now to our conversation with Sarah ... and Paul blood so let's get in a few more of your questions and comments before we move on Noel tweeted I teach clients to think of anxiety kind of like sugar a little gives you energy to get going and too much shuts you down and drains you\nNeed to keep it at that middle area I guess\nLet's get back to Arlene's question on our website and and Paul I wonder if you could respond to her a lean rights\nSo if you change people's minds what then I see a lot of people who believe in climate change to do nothing to try to mitigate it in their own personal lives\nThere still driving around and gas guzzling SUVs owning their ... mentioned houses with the thermostat turned up not recycling not cutting back on meat and dairy basically waiting for someone else to do something it's like someone else's tomorrow not ours\nNo doubt personal action is important not least so that you're not hypocritical when you advocate policy and political action but let's be clear that it will take\nLarge policy action to reduce emissions in the United states and globally\nTo make the United states once again a global leader and cutting emissions to solve this problem we have the biggest thing you can do personally\nFor climate change action is to vote out people who won't take it and vote in people who will and I don't mean trust Democrat and Republican because within those parties there are a few Republicans who acknowledge like ah the congressman from some South Florida\nSupport for WPRI comes from the ... chamber of commerce announcing ... past September seven through October twenty seventh fall colors with pumpkin races food concerts and more while they're shot MSN dot org\nAll the recent hurricanes wildfires have shown we need to vote I think one of the kind of saving grace is there at this point in the conversation is that we we do need to deal with those policy issues but\nJust being able to have the conversation and the useful successful way I think that's a form of progress as well you just get people kind of pointed in direction of being willing to do something so by the by way of kind of wrapping up I Want to go through a few comment objections to the basic argument around climate change and sort of role play how one might respond to those\nFor example be tweeted I often run into these excuses if warming is happening why do we still have winter and we've been told for decades that bad things would have happened ... years ago but they haven't Sarah how would you respond to that well\nI mean bad things are happening right now so [laughter] there's evidence that um that that those projections are coming true I mean all of the pieces of projections that we have seen around temperature and carbon concentration I mean we are able to do a very good job at projecting\nA the impacts of climate change on the ground and and that's the state of the science right now it's it's phenomenal\nI guess the issue is not just that we're having winter but we're having like day after tomorrow winter like we're having super winter\nRight and and so like [noise]\nYes and there is cut and so there's complexity and how the regional climate and the season out of different places are influenced\nBy the day that the on the Arctic weather system basically a collapsing and how and how that changes North American climate and so we do see these complexities and why\nOn people get confused right because they're like well wait a second this is a massive storm but this is the fundamental distinction between weather and climate\nClimate ... we can measure climate for the last you know ... million years right and the the the climate for earth planet has been awful lesions between glacial in inter glacial states\nAbrupt warming into into glacial followed by slow cooling into glacial states so that pacing of glacial enter glacial warming that cold too warm structure that was fundamentally paste by the changing geometric relationship between the earth and the sun Sarah backup\nLogging under changing geometric relationship between glacial into glacial stayed last me\nIt's so cool it's amazing like oh what it's confusing like like bring it down to earth from me okay so in the last nine years the planet's climate has been moving between glacial states\nWhere there's an ice on top of North American\nAnd erasing continent sea level is lower on it's a colder climate on and then in ... states so we are in an inter glacial right now okay and that changed that cold too warm shift\nThis on this piecing this um oscillation its ... it's like a heartbeat of earth's climate and that heartbeat from cold to warm cold too warm that heartbeat was paste by the ... and ... of the geometric in earth orbit and earth tilt as it moves around the sun\nSo I only make sure following you just yeah heartbeat this earth heartbeat but we hold too warm\nCold War it's almost like the earth is having cardiac arrest the heartbeat as off and the pattern is not what it's been for a million years and we can trace it to us is that what you're saying that's exactly right like perfect okay that makes a little full\nPattern that's been ... that's been happening for the last million years we uh we have fundamentally disturbed that pattern\nI was out there on a super high cholesterol\nFuel diet has gotten or a blood pressure through the roof and um the climate system can't take that forever that will go out of control\nThat's a perfect that's a perfect image that makes perfect sense one more thing I wanted to get to pull out and then we got to let you go shortly but\nFor folks who questioned the provenance of the science who the scientists are that came up during the sixty minutes interview who say I just don't trust the people where this data's coming from how do I know that they don't have a political agenda what would you say to someone with that concern to try to work through that\nI I I understand that you can distress individual scientists but there's not a conspiracy of\nTens and hundreds of thousands of scientists around the world to create a problem actually I find it quite the opposite in many cases they're under stating the nature of the problem because they don't want to seem alarmist the truth is that the problem is here now an imminent\nAnd that that's just the factual information on the ground we have already warmed\nUp a degree and a half Fahrenheit were on her way to well past three or even four Fahrenheit and it could spin out of control and that that's just the factual information I I I think we went with very few people actually denied about ten percent Fifteen Percent of the u._s. public actually\nDenied climate science would I think we have to do is galvanized the Seventy five eighty percent who broadly accepted into action\nPublished so former climate advisor for the Clinton White house promissory Electra at American University Center for environmental policy\nAnd a strategic advisor at the progressive Policy Institute Paul thanks very much for talking to us thank you judge them and Sarah ... a research associate at the University of Washington and founder of the ... Institute Sarah thank you you're so welcome\nThere are good reasons to be concerned about our politics the division the tribal ties that seem to get in the way of us finding agreement and compromises we just discussed\nBut we're not alone no matter how fraud things maybe come here between now and the midterms at least we're not trying to work out a divorce that's lasted more than forty years and that will probably cost about fifty billion dollars\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

U. dot org John we're looking at all of the tax\nThat we know about the one from the office of Personnel Management Facebook that big hack at the credit reporting from Equifax we're talking about many many many millions of accounts should we just assume that we've been picked off at some point I mean sometimes\nI feel so personally foolish for having lived my life online without worry before I became a host of this program I just did not even vulnerable but just foolish like to not be more thoughtful about the fact that sooner or later my personal information is going to get picked off is that a reasonable feeling\nYou know you hope that people don't feel foolish but it is true and and one of your ah your earlier guest commented on it which is we don't do enough to educate on it you know like my ah girls in school now\nAnd they don't have the standard course in the public school system on basic cyber cyber security and unfortunately you need it right now or it's not a safe space and part of learning how to make it safe is educating people both at the consumer level in one of the things I talk about it in the book\nMIT learning cyber security unlike how to code was not part of the basic curriculum so even at the highest levels people weren't thinking about this day to day I Hope that there's time for change and that it doesn't depend on just your behavior or Joshua which is\nYou know when I grew up in New York in the eighties\nThe ah it used to be if you made eye contact with someone or you know if you didn't cross the street when you saw someone then it was your fault if you've got that there's a famous Saturday Night live skit it's like when they make eye contact to expect you to get out of that that's kinda today on the Internet right like if you don't change your\nAlpha new Merrick ah thirty character password every thirty days for the twenty five different accounts you have that as your father's a consumer I don't think we're ever going to get out of it if that's our mindset will we need to do is focus ON Technology\nThat makes it easier for consumers to use and also recognize there's maybe some stuff we just shouldn't be doing using a protocol that's fundamentally not secure\nI Do think that we are having a slightly more sophisticated conversation these days I mean even that meaning the county west had with President Trump in the oval office there was that shot of him sitting at the resolute desk opening his phone and his password was zero zero zero zero zero which for those replaying the home game and\nIt's a really bad password to we pick apart what you're referring to as the code war you see that it bears some resemblance to the Cold War in what ways\nI think we're in for a generational struggle and that that struggle is going to include not just the use of force but this setting a whose values prevail who's norms prevail about the world that we want to live and\nAnd then you need to execute on those values with your tactics so ... do deterrent bring criminal cases make public behavior that you think is unacceptable like\nThe Russian uh now where not pat ya that indiscriminately hit companies around the world like Maersk shipping FedEx\nHospitals and took them off line I think we can partner with countries that share our values around the world\nWork together to collectively impose it costs on a rogue actor like Russia when they do that type of activity to say this is unacceptable it's not going to change overnight though just like the Cold War\nIt's going to take years and years and years of day in day out fighting and this war has already begun and part of what I was telling their stories that\nWe didn't used to tell that we kept secret inside government but now we're trying to make public I think importantly so that consumers so that companies can ... a ... that were already in this conflict and start taking steps to be a part of it\nYou quote your old boss early in the book here's part of what Bob Miller said in a speech he worked on back in two thousand seven it's a fairly long quote but I Want to read it in its entirety here's part of what Bob Mueller set at the time quote\nThere is an old saying that all roads lead to roam in the days of the Roman empire roads radiate it out from the capital city spending more than fifty two thousand miles\nThe Romans built these roads to access the vast areas they had conquered but in the end the same roads lead to Rome's downfall for they allow the invaders to march right up to the city's gates he goes on to say quote\nThe Internet has opened up thousands of new roads for each of us new ideas and information new sights and sounds new people and places but the invaders\nThose whose intent is not enlightenment but exploitation and extremism are marching right down those same roads to attack us in multiple ways unquote\nIs this another Roman moment we kind of becoming a victim of our openness\n... I think it could be if we\nWhen that we're in I remember vividly when a when director Mahler gave that speech where out in uh in in the Pennsylvania area it was the first major speech on cyber as national security threat think about that it is now considered\nBy the director of national intelligence all the major officials to be the top threat it was only around ten years ago that we even talked about it seriously from the director the FBI for the first\nTime I know you have like a a guest on later I'm a number of former Justice Department person Monica bicker from Facebook\nAnd it reminds me of the terrorist threat that we're facing you know our openness began to be exploited by terrorists the same way that terrorists al ... to use the aviation which has done so much good and connected us around the world\nAnd they turned it into a weapon that caused thousands of deaths we started to watch terrorist groups my last two years ... tree division exploit social media\nIn order to get their adherence to kill and it was working inside the United states there's one chilling case um that I talk about that still I think people haven't heard about\nA ... of the case that looks from the perspective of a company like someone's stealing customer information names addresses the type a day in day out thing that you were talking about earlier\nHowever in this case he wasn't doing it to make five hundred bucks although he did ask for five hundred bucks he also through bitcoin I also on the back and had become friends with one of the most notorious terrorist in the world a British born citizen named ... Hussein he became friends with them only through Twitter only on line\nAnd what he did with that stolen customer information that was provided to them was turn it into a kill list\nThat said using this customer information\nAre located from his safe hole and Rocca a Syria he bombarded back to the United states through social media a list of the stolen customer information and said kill these people by name by address where they live\nThat's the new era of national security that that we're in we're criminal threats merge or blend with terrorists and national security threats and companies the private sector is on the front lines for the first time\nMichelle emailed as a person of a certain age I recall a world that function before the digital age are total reliance on digital information is making us less safe were trading safety for convenience\nI Wonder John Hoffman show has a point there used to be a time when you had to actually go to the bank to Rob it and now you don't\nShell definitely in fact one of the cases we talked about is an Internet a bank heist a where hackers managed to send human operatives to ATM machines all across the world in different countries and they used a hack\nTo simultaneously allow them to withdraw money from me at ... I think Michelle does have a point that you know for twenty five years\nWe moved almost everything we value from analog space from books in papers to digital space and connect it using a protocol\nThe Internet's protocol that was fundamentally never designed was security in mind huge advantages to that economic convenience however we did so systematically and this was true in government along with the private sector without taking into account\nYou are listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

know that some hackers are hell bent on stealing our secrets so\nNow might be a good time to go check your Facebook account the most recent hack of the social media\n... million users names phone numbers emails and other personal details\nFacebook says last month attackers found a vulnerability in the code and use Facebook's view as feature to steal access tokens these tokens or bits of code that let you love right in without having type your password every time it gave them whoever they are access\nTo nearly everything your user name which devices you access Facebook with\nThe last ten places you checked into or were tagged at and personal details that you posted like your religion your hometown your birth date where you work yeah a good reason to go check your Facebook account\nNow the company and the FBI or try to catch these hackers and this year Facebook's chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified to Congress but his company needs to raise its game\nFacebook is an idealistic and optimistic company for most of our existence we focused on all the good the connector and people can do and if Facebook is grown people everywhere have gotten a powerful new tool for staying connected to the people they love\nFor making their voices heard and for building communities in businesses\nBut it's clear now that we didn't do enough to prevent these tools are being used for harm as well and that goes for fake news foreign interference in elections and hate speech as well as developers and data privacy\nFacebook talks endlessly about its community and that the fringes there are some in that community who regard the platform as one of the best ways to spread terrorist propaganda over the summer we spoke to Monica bigger she's Facebook's head of global policy management about how the company is taking on terrorists\nThere are two ways that we become aware of content that might violate our policies and keep in mind we have billions of new post every day or so the first day we become aware is if somebody reports content to as you can report any piece of content through the fight if you do it comes through and it's reviewed by Facebook\nOr the second thing is we actually have technology tools that are out looking\nFor content that might find that our policy so for instance terror propaganda\nNow we remove the terror propaganda that we've removed from face that's more than Ninety nine percent of that our technical tools find before anybody in our community flags that for us\nNow once content has been flat as potentially violating our policies\nIt comes into one of our content reviewers and there's more than Seventy five hundred people sitting on those content review teams around the world reviewing content in dozens of languages are and making a decision if it violates the policy and ... if it doesn't violate the policy elite that\nThat's got to be a hard job being a content reviewer at Facebook what kind of person does it take to do that kind of work\nIt really depends on the a specific area that person is working in all content reviewers who come to Facebook are hired with a certain degree of language expertise\nWe have a really global population using this service in fact more than ... eighty five percent of people using Facebook on a regular basis are from outside the United states\nSo if you think about the different languages that we see we have to hire hunting reviewers who speak a different kinds of languages and it's important to us that we have\nNative language speakers because they really understand the way that language is used so that's a big focus and are hiring once you're hired as a content review or you're trained in all of our policies but then you were assigned to become a specialist in one\nSo for instance you'll learn all about um our terrorism and harassment and bullying policies but you might ultimately be assigned to work on um identifying self harm effect of self harm when you catch content\nThat doesn't belong on Facebook that violates its terms what's the difference between say reactive flagging and proactive flying how much of it is the kind of thing that say a reviewer\nSupport for WPRI comes from legacy private trust company and Nina dedicated to providing exceptional personalized investment wealth management and trust services to successful individuals

P. trust dot com\nYou there's a couple of areas where this is working really well and a couple of areas where it's harder areas where it's working really well with terror propaganda I'm with child sexual exploitation with spam with fake accounts we now have technical tools that can fly the vast majority of that content before anybody in the community\nSend it to us or sees it at all um in fact when it comes to child sexual abuse imagery or terror propaganda were able to stop the majority of that at the time of upload meaning nobody ends up seeing now when you think about a policy like bullying or hate speech or harassment a lot of that is very contextual\nFor instance um you know there could be if I if I wanted to bully you on social media and you and I are our friends at work or at our university and and now we've fallen out then there's a backstory there and the words that I might use to believe on Facebook would not necessarily be the things that we can train our technology to catch\nSo it's really important for us to give tools to people so that if I ... on Facebook you can report it and our reviewer will actually look at what's happening and make that decision what about topics as opposed to contact patterns I was a pattern recognition work\nWell we do some most of our policies are about content that people are posting but we do have some policies that are focused on actors themselves\nFor instance if he misrepresented yourself on Facebook we'll remove your account even if you're not otherwise pilot in our content policies we also have policies against terror organizations and our members hate organizations um and so forth so if you for instance want it to create a page to support al ...\nAnd on that page you were just going to share photos of puppies and kittens and rain does we would still remove it because we don't allow those groups or anybody representing those groups to have a presence on the site\nUm if you see a page that is violating our policies in its entirety meaning it's a page that's represent an al ... page that has been created for the purpose of ... somebody then it's appropriate to report the page to us the reason I mentioned that is because whatever you report that the piece of content that's going to come through to our review teams first\nAnd so if somebody has an otherwise okay profile and then they are attacking you based on your religion and you report that specific attacking comment that's what's going to come through our reviewers and they'll be able to take immediate action\nAlso worth noting if you're a mobile use or like if if you're an iPhone use or if you just hop on a comment directly\nSometimes it'll bring you up a menu that will say reply or lighter copy and then there's other options and in those other options there is an option to report somebody I Wonder how much Facebook is facing the learning curve of a world does learning to use Facebook know decides designed to be intuitive\nI think it is increasingly intuitive the more you use it and because you're global you've got people in some parts of the world who are just beginning for the first time\nTo have broadband devices or to be connected to a world where there are more devices in our people house Facebook teaching people to use Facebook\nWe definitely do outreach but you're right at different in different parts of the world people will have different levels as experience and finding these reporting options and even just understanding how this works\nSo we actually do the options that we offer people to report content actually do vary by location and we're always testing ways to get more report to us to make it easier now there's a tension here if you just have one big red button\nAnd people can present whenever they want than two things happen one is that people might report things when what they really mean it just to hide it and get that constantly from them because they don't like that person", "show_name": "Kathleen Dunn", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "16"}
