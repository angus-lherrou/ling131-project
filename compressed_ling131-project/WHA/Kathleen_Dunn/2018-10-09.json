I Wonder if we do pick up with sets comment and finding officer Van Dyke guilty it seems rare that officers are convicted after shooting someone under questionable circumstances what's the legal reason behind that\nWell there is a decision from the United States Supreme court that really is the\nKey to all of this and that is the decision that the court made many years ago Graham case that basically said that when you are determining whether or not an officers engaged in the use of excessive force it much basically\nTake the in the ... the steps of the state of the officer so it's a very subjective standard what would a reasonable officer have\nDone in that situation so it is not an object that is what is the officer feeling what is the officer seeing what is the officer experiencing so that's what the jurors are required to do and as a result you find very few judgments first of all you know in in civil and suing\nPolice departments are jurors have to again how old the standard and prosecutors before they decide to to charge the officer have to look at the standard and say what would an officer reasonable officer in that situation has done so it is the Supreme Court that has set this world for\nAll law enforcement agencies in the country\nAnd they were over Eighteen thousand separate police departments throughout the United states they all have different rules but they are all under the umbrella of whatever the Supreme Court set of that is the rule that is out there now\nYou were by the way referring to the cues is Graham versus Connor it's a case from Nineteen eighty nine and some of you actually commented with regards to what's going on in officers mines like Peter Peter emailed it\nSupport for WPRI comes from the turbo university with the db Reinhardt Institute for ethics and leadership working to build communities of servant leaders who are dedicated to the common good more is that the turbo dot edu\nBlowing through everything that I had to go through and even though officers didn't want to they thought they had to I had officers come up to me and say you know I Believe in what you're doing but I Can't be seen talking to you because I'll be next\nWe'll let me let me play a clip from the president of Chicago's fraternal order of police Kevin ground this what do you have to say after the conviction of officer Jason Van Dyke this clip comes from WB easiest podcast on the McDonald's case called sixteen shots here is Kevin ...\nLooks are arguably quitting some politicians over the last several years of use this thing's won food and I want to remind everybody ran for millions of dollars every every every year in this case\nReally took ... which is unfortunate because I'm going to tell you this and um\nThe men and women are the farming or some of the finest police officers in this country\nTo seriously\nWhat they do and they try and provide for self protection against the people\nPutting there was a very every single day and night\nIs Kevin ... the president of Chicago's fraternal order of police\nShould I'd love to get your thoughts on what Kevin Graham said I mean it doesn't minimize the one with Donald case at least for me but I Do kind of see what he's getting out in terms of getting a bad rap I mean if you want to see a positive portrayal of Chicago police you gotta watch NBC and prime time I mean it just you don't hear much of it do you think that Mr Graham has a point\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

P.\nIn the store and we'll share some of your questions and stories tomorrow on one day\nBack now to our conversation with new Franklin Shannon Spalding Patrick Smith and judge will Doris Cordell let's get to some more of your comments before we start kind of looking forward to where the effort to improve policing in America might be going\nHey sailor tweeted the reasonable officer standard is a very easy standard to apply it's not that hard\nWe do need to eliminate the criminal justice college major and higher police with degrees in psychology or sociology too many cops have no business carrying a badge and the gun however Galvin had these questions Galvin writes\nThe question is what is reasonable\nDoes disobeying a police officer shouting orders constitute the right to use deadly force\nThere's a drug dealer running away from the police deserve to be shot\nWhile they may be criminals or the actions from the police equivalent to the criminals actions to Cornell maybe you should respond to golf and how do we suss out in a fine or sense what reasonable mess is\nOn us is in the eye of the beholder it really has no one definition and what jurors are required to do is put themselves in the shoes\nOf the officer and what was the officers thing and oftentimes incidents happen and you know just a matter of a few seconds so it's there really is not one definition of it but I Do want us to\nGet to something you said Joshua about looking ahead I Believe it's time to we imagine policing in America policing in America today is is quasi militaristic and police departments officers are seen as an occupying force especially in communities\nIs that's not how police started in this country\nPolicing started with individuals who lived in a community who knew everyone and they were people who were not seen as an occupying force there were people there to basically provide a service and help the individuals in the community and it has dramatically changed we have police departments\nArmed to the teeth with tanks and all kinds of of the equipment that uh are commonly used in the military and I think it's time to change this whole thing we need to start thinking outside the box why do we need police officers to basically a\nPatrol and and take care of traffic issues\nFor why can't that come from within the humidity like Kent individuals' community members somehow the deputy ties to that deal with with those kinds of things that the minor kinds of things that are happening in the community\nWants somebody who's judge colonel and I'm I'm not disagreeing with your just by way of topics there are some places where a lower level of sworn law enforce off or worse when officer does deal with things like parking enforcement and traffic enforcement things that are less likely to require deadly force\nShort but but but my point is that that our our whole attitude and this is even within police departments they see themselves as this you know kind of a militaristic force and and they\nThey do have a command structure and ... and and so what I'm saying is that maybe it's time now to say let's pull back from this whole image we have\nOf police being occupiers and look at a different model entirely I'm not opposed to criminal to criminal justice reform but look what happened we we get body cameras\nAnd what what happens well we have officers some oh don't turn the Amazon or we have places like Chicago where it takes more than a year and a court order ticket footage out on for example in liquid shooting so that that the whole lack of transparency\nPolicing for example has very little sunshine\nThere's very little sunshine and police say we don't get to know who these officers are their track record their history they're disciplined history it's very very difficult to get that information and state\nI think the dovetails with the comment that one of our listeners left for us Reggie who lives in Maryland with this in our inbox\nI talked to please both black and white and ah they seem to have this militaristic approach to the community I have had experiences where you know we just that we\nWould rather have conflict where are we mean rather than actually serve it I really think that they should you know take away the gums or the first couple of months that leads to buy the\nInside of the community without guns make them stand community before she might have a dialogue with community I think it'd be a ... a lot better uh which serving their communities\nWhere did you thanks for calling in and sharing your thoughts with us Neal Franklin I Love you to respond to that but if I could first\nIf we could contrast would read you said with another set of comments that we've gone from some of our listeners like would scholar Rhodes Scholar rides\nPolice put their lives on the line every day protecting our society Ninety percent nine zero percent of the cases put forward by activists as examples of police brutality in whole people not complying why is the outrage not centered around these individuals' behavior that got them shot\nIf a cop breaks the law I'll convict him but if there's any doubt I'm siding with the police one hundred percent of the time\nNew ... would you say to folks who say that police word is inherently difficult inherently dangerous potentially deadly and then we use the public also have a role to play in easing the tension that officers feel about just\nSo I Believe it was Reggie that left a message yes um you know that was such a brilliant comment because\nForcing the dialogue see when you develop a relationship with those people you are serving the citizens who are serving and you get their support your job doesn't isn't as dangerous as it is today it you know going back to what the judge Cornell said um\nHow it used to be having relationships walking up and down the street talking with citizens talking with the neighbors\nWhen something happens they support you when you had those relationships but when you have this occupying force were you know none of the people are very few of the people the ones that you do know there's conflict when the under ... on the other end of that relationship\nThat's a problem this goes to community control policing that I mentioned before\nWhere the community sets the philosophy where the community sets the budget for those in uniform where the community\nDecides who the the leader is going to be whether you call them achieve for commissioner or whatever we have a community decides what's important with the community decides you know what we can handle these issues that the ground level we just want you to pay attention to people hurting other people and this is how we want you to do that\nBut policing is very political it's political through the unions it's political through the mayors and governors and we'll never get to that place into the community decides they come together and say we want control over our police departments and this is how we want to do it\nHaving that oversight at the beginning means that you don't need police review boards at the end when something goes horribly wrong\nIs speaking of which we got some ideas from some of you about what could be done with regards to policing and review boards were part of it including on a larger scale Jamie asked shouldn't there be a national group or board who could provide oversight over individual police departments\nThey could be an objective trusted advisory board who's judgments both sides would trust and accept and to whom aggrieved local citizens group could appeal\nPaolo tweeted police forces with their training transformed them from people's defenders into communities photos with this dance to police forces not your friend even if you are a regular law abiding citizen so maybe trainings part of it\n\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio joined the

ambassador to the United nations announced her resignation this morning\nHaley has formerly the governor of South Carolina has somewhat international reputation for being willing to take on her boss from time to time she told the New York times she doesn't agree with the president on anything but it's on everything but says there was a right and wrong way to address that will pick up the phone call them or meet with him in person\nShe will also be remembered in part for striking back at White House adviser Larry Kudlow who suggested she might have been confused regarding Russian sanctions she told Fox News with all due respect I don't get rid of you don't get to fused\nShe and the president met today at the White House she lavish praise on him and his family he was part of what ambassador Haley said\nCan't say enough good things about Jared ... guy staring at that age\nThat no one understands I mean to redo the NAFTA deal to weigh in on what I've done working with him on the middle east peace of mind it is so unbelievably well done and if they just a great friend and they do a lot of things the high the things\nThat I Wish more people knew about because we're about our country because they're in the ministry and I'll just have to say I'm certainly thank you to my family my ... at the same\nI Am door than entertain us ... you know they sacrificed a lot they put a lot of time and energy into it um but they have a lot of heart and really wanted to make America proud and so with that\nI'm not leaving until the end of the year my goal is that we make sure that everything is in good flakes and on for the next ambassador to command but now I don't have anything that I'm where I'm going to go I think that um the main thing was\nI was governor for six years and we've dealt with a hurricane a thousand year ... shooting a school shooting there was a lot and then to come in\nAnd getting years have Russia and Iran and North Korea it's been eight years of intense time and I'm a believer in term limits I think you have to be selfless enough to know when you step aside and allow someone else to do the job so thank you for quite a\nLifetime and I will say this\nUm if are all in here that are going to ask about twenty twenty no I'm not running for twenty twenty\nI can promise you what I'll be doing is paying for this one so I'll look forward to supporting the president\nBut his Nikki Haley the U.S ambassador to the United nations speaking just a few minutes ago at the White House announcing that she will be resigning from that post back now with our conversation with Renee brown and maybe by way of a transition\nWe should get to an email from Hillary who says I've noticed more attention since the twenty sixteen election of President Trump how has that changed the work environment have you noticed a difference\nAnd absolutely ... absolutely I don't think work I think this is the whole point work is not immune from the larger culture and I think we have seen just like we've seen\nIncreased polarization in our families and our neighborhoods among our friends is at work to edit feels dice here at work um I think that\nPeople have to be careful and especially when there's power differential Z and it it's I I actually believe it's become a pretty significant source of anxiety at work and home\nJust being able to talk politics or culture or any of these other dividing line\nYeah 'cause everything feels like it's one step away from getting into a cultural debate where we find other people's opinions and comprehensible\nWell see I Wonder if that kind of for people who are not inclined to kind of open up\nIf that ... toward keeping the professional and personal separate that at work I just need to be the one person I Do to keep my head down and get to not make waves I Need to be obedient I Need to be efficient I Need to do the job and get the hell out of there\nAnd the minute that we started talking about emphasizing and being vulnerable and being open and compassionate and ... that opens the door for me to say something about how I voted\nOr you know whether I own a firearm or who I pray to or who I Love\nThat is going to turn into a gigantic wildfire at work like it almost feels like\nIt's an easy way to give yourself ammunition to put on more armor instead of less\nI think you're absolutely right and here's the hard answer I'd never seen anything meaningful or significant come from mouth shut had down\nIn my career\nThat's just not how we make contributions\nAnd so what we have to do is learn how to listen talk here each other and\nRumble and we use the term rumble because it really feels like a rumble rumble with the vulnerability of seeing other people as people and being seen as a person and it's a muscle it's a foundational skills that\nI don't think spending what ... what do we spend about ... about a half of our adult lives at work I don't think spending half of our adult lives in armor\nIs something\nI think the psychological emotional spiritual and physical costs are too high and we're not solving problems I Need you to bring all of you to work I Need the combination of all of your experiences all of who you are to address the problems\nFrom reading your book and based on the research that fuel to book a lot of what you describe points to that kind of armor as an indicator of where something is wrong it's almost like a scar yeah no scars tough because the wound is tender right and so if there wasn't something ... there'd be nothing to protect\nNo that's exactly it and I think one of the big ideas that came from the book that really it was actually voided my hypothesis going in so where did you arrive\nPop yeah yeah it just it completely ... just shot out of the water and I and I'm usually pretty good at guessing what I'm going to find but not in this case\nSo we asked a hundred and fifty sea level leaders that the it's a lot of data that we use so interviews with a hundred fifty sea level global leaders three years building a daring leader assessments that people can see where they are and these were MBA and NBA students\nAt Wharton catalog Rice University and then tons of data evaluation data so I thought\nWhen when when it was clear that the future of leadership is about courage we need greater leaders and more courageous cultures I thought the barrier was going to be fear but then we went and talked to several daring leaders and said so you're not afraid very often and they were like\nWhat I'm afraid every day I'm afraid all day long I was like so that blew my hypothesis have fear being the greatest barrier to dairy leadership the greatest barrier to dairy leadership\nIs armor it's not the fear it's how we self protect when we're in the fear is the perfectionism the pleasing the defensiveness the anger\nThat having to be the nowhere and get everything right instead of being the learner\nUm so really you know and it's interesting what you said about scars intend to places\nNot only does armor keep other people from seen us and sharing ourselves with other people armor protects the fear and less it faster and grow\nAnd metastasize so we need to create were cultures where armor is not rewarded or needed\n[noise] we are some of you to call in and tell us about your workplaces here's what two of our listeners left in our inbox first let's hear from Adam\nMy name is Adam and I'm calling from Nashville, Tennessee I'm a paramedic firefighter and I was such a definitely feel like I

emailed can you address the differences between armor and establishing and maintaining healthy boundaries\nYeah I mean boundaries are actually a big part of this book because batteries are incredibly important um we defined it very simply as what's OK and what's not OK and so armor is not about\nProfessional management of south it's not about four going boundaries armor is about defense in it is I Am going to put the protection of my ego\nBefore doing right by this business and the work that we're doing together I'm going to protect feeling good about myself\nOver movie and I work for it\nTo the difference between so there's a difference between say armor and image such as kind of self that you portrayed other people to kind of keep bad things and it's it's ...\nIt's on a deeper level now it's on a day but I mean the one of the greatest examples of armor armored leadership versus airing leadership as one form of armor we see a lot and folks\nIs they need to be right that it's that I've got to be the ... and I need to be right and that's more important to me than being the learner and getting that right\nWe've got a number of comments from those of you about the way that race plays into workplaces and hope emailed can you speak about the ways in which racial power structures and broader society that manifest themselves in the workplace\nDisproportionately impact the contributions of people of color in their work and the extent to which they progress in their careers before you answer here's one example professor ... tweeted\nAs a woman of color an immigrant in an academic I've learned that showing vulnerabilities and even my own resilience can and will be used against me by those in power would love to hear professor brown talk about overcoming that distrust well here's what are the\nBiggest findings I think is that one of the greatest casualties of trauma\nIs the is the loss of vulnerability and when I talk about trauma I don't just mean a traumatic and said that I mean racism homophobia poverty white supremacy I mean privilege\nThose are those are everyday Thomas and it is real that that that that you know the armor that you need to survive those things Israel which is why it's leaders don't work to create a culture where when you're here you can take that off and be seen\nThan we can't I mean gender is another you know I I think the kind of\nAnita Hill criticisms that happened after the Ford testimony where you know Ford was more compelling because she was more vulnerable\nAs opposed to Brett Kavanaugh who is just kind of fun during a way that it was all got you\nKnow who was you know but absolutely vulnerability can be used against us um and I think that is a that is in itself a form of systemic racism\nBefore we keep going I Would like to talk a little bit about something else you mentioned in your book you talk about\nCore values and I don't think any of us has worked at a company that doesn't have some kind\nOf mission statement or vision clarification or posters everywhere saying this is Jeff and we're supposed to be and then it's really worth nothing more than a paper on which is printed I work at some companies wind been to some companies where their value statement was like Fifteen bullet points la I'm like well why don't we\nStart you suggest\nThat we should limit our core values to to just to and there's a long list in the book I'm trying to find a because there's a lot on the list and I really struggled marrow down to my to why only two\nWell here's the thing\nInto observable measurable behaviors that people can be held accountable for demonstrating then you just really do have a cat poster I mean it\nReally is just really a poster so I'm a recording of my head that little tone yeah [laughter]\nYeah yeah yeah I've got a Thirteen year old son I Know it [laughter] you know and so what\nSo you know operation allies values into behaviors\nFewer than ten percent of the organizations we've worked with had actually done that had taken the time to say you know what I some assumption of generosity is our value and hear the behaviors that we will hold each other accountable for endangered in and so\nThe two is really kind of backing into the data the men and women who had the capacity to be the most courageous could identify their values and they had two to three values and you know I have you know\nThere's a long list in the book like we talked about and there's only Fifteen things on there that are important to me\nAltruism collaboration curiosity dignity diversity independent self discipline patriotism vulnerability wealth wisdom future generations harmony health recognition there's it's a long long list\nYes so I there's probably Fifteen or twenty things on that list that are super important to me but when it comes down to at my ... my two core values for me are facing courage and I know they're the core values because it's the place where every other things on that list is tested\nAnd so we really we had an we had a companion work buckets free downloadable it's on my website where you can do your own values exercise to figure out what your to our and an operational lies and into behaviors\nUm it has changed completely the way we all work together we all know each other's values we understand them we hold each other accountable for them\nAnd then we have our company values and that's actually how we assess you every quarter\nRiff on the values that you were to do it\nLike for example one of our values is take the care taking care of each other ourselves into community we serve and so one of the things that we measure is I don't talk about people I talk to people\nI mean you either do it are you out and so I think it goes back\nTo something we haven't talked about yet that as a real core finding which has courage is one hundred percent teachable\nIt's for skill sets each of the skill sets are behavioral and can be taught it's learning how to rumble with on her ability living into your values which we're talking about right now\nIt's braving trust understanding how to talk about trust and breaking it down so we can talk about the anatomy of trust and learning how to rise how to get back up on your feet after a fall or a setback\nDo you need to clear it's used values I mean I I Would be fascinated to know what you lift me right now for my two core values are because I Know what they are I went through the list and I finally figured out my too but I don't know that anyone would guess what my two were based on who I Am the work I Do like\nI guess one sure catcher I sure OK face no\nThere's not one of my records but its encompassed in one of my two calls but no I Can't tell us what you are I don't know maybe I should maybe I shouldn't and we're talking about vulnerability Joshua no but I'm the host I don't have to do any I'm just I'm In charge here here we go people the ... known Ogletree okay fine I'll tell you what the\nFreedom and growth those are my two values\nAnd give me an example of a behavior that supports freedom\nUm bull", "show_name": "Kathleen Dunn", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison",
