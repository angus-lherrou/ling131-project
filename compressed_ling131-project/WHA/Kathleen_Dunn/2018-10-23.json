X. dot com or from an agent Hitchcock's insurance encouraged courage\nThis is one a I'm Joshua Johnson we're speaking to Ken ate all and former U.S ambassador to the un and the author of Reagan at Reykjavik let's get to a few more of your questions about this treaty before we move on to speaking with General Stanley McChrystal quite a few people ask questions\nLike what Catherine asked on our website the one eight dot org Catherine rights is this an actual treaty if it is wouldn't that be Congress's territory not Trump's\nAnd Andrew tweeted is two thirds of the Senate required to withdraw from the treaty\nThose are good questions uh and uh it's unclear and the constitution would Congress's role\nWould be in getting out of a treaty yes this is a treaty yes it was ratified or by the Senate uh and uh in Nineteen eighty seven actually in Nineteen eighty eight who signed by Gorbachev and Reagan and the White House with Trump president in Nineteen eighty seven or ... but\nIt has been established over the years that to get out of the treaty or is the president's discretion in Congress has no role and that\nCan you put this into a little bit more context for us I mean I I think it's hard at least for me as someone who only sees nuclear proliferation from the outside\nTo know where in my mind to hold all these different potential threats there's the threat from Russia there is a threat from North Korea there is a potential of a threat from China who knows what all terror organizations might be trying to ... closer to a nuclear weapon\nIn the scheme of things where should we put this treaty in in our minds like in the hierarchy of the various nuclear threats that the world faces where is where does is it\nIt's it's pretty high I'll tell you why because it's restrained by the United states and Russia against a whole class of nuclear weapons okay to me the highest in your uh pantheon of nuclear arms treaties and nuclear threats are\nThat are bound by treaties is the nonproliferation treaty\nWhich really discourages countries from the spread of nuclear weapons okay we don't want the nuclear weapons is bread and a by and large that's been pretty successful Joshua are the factors in Nineteen sixty three President Kennedy gave a speech in which he said by Nineteen Seventy\nThere would be twenty five nuclear weapon states\nBy Nineteen Seventy okay today they're about six\nSeven and so we've done a lot better than people expected and that gets back to Parkinson's a to me the best law that the success of a policy is measured Best Buy those disasters that do not ensue\nAnd the ... of the political ration of nuclear weapons was a disaster that did not and so and so that was pretty successful\nIt also seems like just the fact that a treaty could be reached between parties was was a victory I mean you know Internet lotions or a little tense right now right\nIt was and certainly the weekend in record back in October eleventh and twelfth Nineteen eighty six that document in my book and thank you for mentioning it or that will be turned into a movie fairly soon a\nIs an exciting roller\nWas ... up and down views are in what's thought to be a haunted house in Iceland that produce the treaty that we're talking about today it was a real taffy tug\nOf for the whole weekend we spent from eight o'clock at night 'til six thirty the next morning going over the details of this and I could report to the president\nThe next morning on that type of job or twelfth Nineteen eighty six we have accomplished more last night in one night than we have in seven years of constant negotiations with the Russians it was just a way a liberal weekend\nBefore we move on and we'll be speaking to stay in General Stanley McChrystal at a moment about his new book on leadership and I wonder if by way of wrapping up our conversation I could ask you about the leaders who signed this treaty Ronald Reagan and Rick how Gorbachev here is President Reagan at that meeting in Nineteen eighty seven\nThe importance of this treaty transcends numbers we have listened to the wisdom of in an old Russian maxim and I'm sure you're familiar with\nMice minister general secretary though my pronunciation may give you difficulty the maximum is do vi no pro vi trust but verify [noise]\nI can answer this issue with\nThe pattern every meeting [noise] from the meaning\nOf Nineteen eighty seven between Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev give us a sense of the leadership styles of Reagan and Gorbachev that allow this treaty to come to fruition\nWell when you think of Ronald Reagan or you think of a man who is extremely decent and a conservative Republican incompetent he was just a very competent person or when you think of ... a\nGorbachev he was a communist uh but overall a decent person who wanted to do something at that time they were both very different from the president we have now Joshua or in the sense that um\nYou know when I was in government uh mothers and fathers wanted their kids to grow up like Ronald Reagan maybe not the policies maybe they didn't get rid of the policies\nBut the decency of the man the humble and this of the man the genuine niceness of him and today even if you're agreeing with Trump's policies which I don't but even if you do I don't think any mother father wants their kid to grow up to be like a Donald Trump or this is\nProbably sorry are probably some who city and openly quality and the president or they're hard to say\nThough their world disguised Joshua\nAnd uh the decency the kindness of Reagan who really loved immigrants and his office was decorated with pictures of immigrants his farewell address to the country talked about the wonders of wonderful immigrants coming to our country and his whole address was about immigration how wonderful it was\nHe was a fanatic about a free trade or not having tariffs at any time and he was very intense it's drying reduce government spending and reduce especially the deficit all those things were\nClassic conservative classic\nRepublican and um none of them are being followed by this so called Republican\nI'm Donald Trump's but anyway the style of Reagan was a style that made somebody like me very proud to serve him and very proud to be there with him on that weekend in Reykjavik in Nineteen eighty six\n... author of Reagan had Reykjavik forty eight hours that ended the Cold War also the arms control director for President Reagan and former U.S ambassador to the UN ambassador ... thanks for talking to us okay now learn how to spell Reykjavik an extra wide I'll work on it\nWhat do Confederate General Robert e and the Reverend Dr Martin Luther king junior have in common\nAccording to retired General Stanley McChrystal they are both leaders worth studying granted we study them for very different reasons but they did some of the same things\nThey made bold decisions that won them loyal following the controversial within the very leadership structures that brought them into power and they are revered today for what they represent it not just what they accomplished\nStill these men with several things in common which seemed to have almost nothing in common\nPerhaps that's the paradox of leadership there is no one formula no one checklist that defines all leaders\n... McChrystal retired as a four star general he served as the top us commander in Afghanistan from two thousand nine twenty ten and he's the co author of the new book leaders missed and reality alongside Jeff Eggers and Jason men go and he joins us to discuss it General McChrystal welcome to one a\nIt's an honor to be here Joshua we'd also like to take your questions and thoughts\nFor the general about the nature of leadership and we'd love to know to some of the leaders are that you look to that you try to emulate or is that you follow whose leadership attributes you think are worth highlighting comments on our Facebook page tweet us at one essay or email one a at W. A. M. U. dot org\nI mentioned Robert de leite in part because his story kind of opens the book it frames the story in some ways you mentioned early on that you looked up to Robert ... as a leader you went to West Point lead went to West Point and he's one of those kind of alumni that had a major impact on the country for better or worse\nWell using the word leader and some using the word hero and I wonder if we need to distinguish between that dock at a tweeted if a quote unquote leader fails to leave but makes people do what they have to do by using threats intimidation or fear are they still called leaders shouldn't they be called anything else but leaders\nI get the sense General McChrystal from reading your book that those people could still be leaders we just might not think of them as being very heroic in their leadership\nI think that's right I mean we broaden the term leader to be people in roles and people who get people to do things even though that may be bad things so we don't say leaders are good or bad we said are effective or not because\nYou can have some pretty negative people ugly objectives who effectively lead people in that direction think Adolf Hitler\nIf we really step back and say because some of the names and the ideas and the montage there were tremendous\nWe think back when we want from our leaders what should we want from our leaders the dad retired from the military I had never met President Bush forty one and yet he called me on the phone just to tell me he thought it would be a difficult day and then a short conversation he just reached out to somebody in an incredibly thoughtful way\nHe made me feel better I think we want our leaders to make us feel better but more importantly I think we want our leaders to make us better\nSometimes that's not the leader who rubbed your belly and tells you you know it's everybody else's fault and you can get you deserve more sometimes it's a leader who is a little tough on you that coach that teacher that parent\nWho pushes you to be better than you would otherwise be that military commander who works you physically really harder makes you go in harm's way\nBut at the end of it you sit back and you go you know\nI'm Better or for that yeah I'm a bit better than I Would otherwise be they ask much sometimes they demand a lot but typically they give alongside to us and and if we\nWe frame leaders in that way and look in the mirror and say our wheat demanding as followers are we asking and demanding from that from our leaders then I think we ask we answer many questions about our society today\nIn the book there are three minutes that you're trying to tear down in terms of the way that we think about leaders let's go through them one at a time one is called the formulaic mess which is basically this idea that leadership can be boiled down to a formula you argue that it's much more contextual right\nAbsolutely you can have this list of traits or behaviors\nAnd the leader can use them on Monday they can work and on Tuesday go to the same organization but the context to change the followers are in a different place and it doesn't work at all so in reality a leaders got to be constantly adapting themselves to meet the needs of the team and the situation\nThe second one is the attribution myth you write that we attribute too much to leaders and we give them we use the kind of tunnel vision as you describe it what do you mean by that\nWell I wrote my memoirs and twenty ten and\nI thought I was writing the play of my life and that would be easy because I was there and how would therefore be to star\nBut when we did all the interviews the background to get the other parts of the stories in many cases I had made a decision and there'd been an outcome and therefore thought I should get credit or blame for that but I found out all the other people who had done things I didn't even know about and the other factors that are played upon that\nWhen I concluded was the leader still part of it I mean I was still like a key part of it but I wasn't the dominant part and so we find today\nWe treated a little bit like a Broadway show we put the spotlight on the leader and we keep that spotlight following the leader no matter where they are the all the other things in the situation or put in the shadows\nThat the leader of caused the great thing to happen whereas Timothy responsible for the failure there just a part of it\nAlthough I Would say that based on one of the leaders you profile in the book Walt Disney there are some leaders who want it that way Disney did not credit his other animators initially in the silly symphonies and the short films that led up to Snow White and the seven door so he kind of you kind of wanted it that way\nIt's very common I mean if you think about it everybody a little bit like the the spotlight likes to be on the pedestal so it's a natural thing and Walt Disney after the success of Snow White for what she did an extraordinary job of pushing his team to create at a masterpiece\nHe wanted to Baskin that and it was a natural problem but it cost him huge problems just four years later in a bitter strike in Nineteen forty one\nWas speaking to General Stanley McChrystal from NPR in New York the co author of leaders miss and reality that third miss you call the results myth which says that leadership is the process of driving people toward an outcome why is that a myth don't results matter\nWill results matter and we claim that that's how we select or choose to follow leaders whether they get a good bottom line or whether they win battles or win elections but in reality\nThe data doesn't support that we tend to follow leaders even though many er serial failures or their outcomes are often much less than they want them to be or have said that they are [noise]\nIt's really on the followers to understand this because leaders tend to feel some place in us and emotional requirement for us they give a vision for the future we're much less analytical and demanding of actual results than we think we are\nMarjorie emailed good leaders know how to train the next leaders and went to release the training wheels and step down I'm interested in March ... comments she's reflects something that a John Maxwell describes and the five levels of leadership basically the fifth level to the top two levels are about replicating yourself\nIn other people but I Wonder where you see that a lot of the leaders that you profile weren't necessarily looking to replicate themselves and others\nIt it it is something you don't see often it up Martin Luther king Junior's puppies success story there when he was murdered in Nineteen sixty eight the movement went on headed suddenly stopped in his loss than I think it would have said something\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

W. A. M. U. dot org\nAnthony you said that you were kind of incredulous at first when Donald Trump said he was going to run for president what were you skeptical about and then what kind of turned you around from the\nOcean I've at a acquaintance ship with them for you know two decades and uh I uh he is threatened to run and now in times past than I always thought it was like a great publicity edge you see what a threatened to run you threatened to run yeah LA's I on the run for president are are going to support Romney 'cause you know I decided it's not the right time for me to run for president\nSo there's something a little short of about the word ... threatened not he floated the idea or he hinted at a\nThreatens yeah that's a go go back and look at some of the tapes when he was running in two thousand for the reform party it was a threatening to run that's how I described it on my and I'm not describing a pejorative way but it just always he was like okay you know if you guys don't straighten out I'm going to run for ...\nUh you know your your listeners that don't like your guest choice I'd I'd I admire them but I'm also going to caution them on something\nWhen you shut down because like I'm a pro Trump person as a shutdown intellectually and then you start to demonizing caricature of the other side\nWhat ends up happening is you you lose an important element of the story and then it makes it harder for your bottle you know so for me um I Love coming on NPR all go on left leaning shows all the time and I'll do left leaning journalists interviews\nBecause I really do want to hear their side Jack Kennedy once said that he spent a lot of time understanding the other side's ideas that he felt that we are very smart people on the other side and that always understanding the other side's ideas made a person sharper and and by the way\nIf I got to the other side and weaken my argument that I'm a strong enough of an intellect if you will to change my argument and to say you know what I'm not looking at that appropriately and so so I encourage people to keep that open dialogue going\nA lot of people out there that I disagree with but I like hearing from\nWell and there's something to the the work that as you describe it in the book when when you were getting more involved with the press is a communications director where you tried\nTo convince the president said to dial down some of the rhetoric against the media you said and and this is not a secret that you said that\nIt pushed back is normal but this kind of an ongoing war against the press just isn't helpful it's it's not productive I hear you on that but the president\nDidn't seem to be happening he seems to have never met a news outlet he didn't love to bash at some point or other except for except for a handful that that must have been on some level frustrating especially since you see the potential in his in his policy agenda\nYeah no no no question I mean listen I'm a very big believer in the first amendment or if you really read the founding documents and you know like if you if you if you've read the federalist papers the main reason why they put the first amendment in the air\nWas to protect us from tyranny and they always felt that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely to quote lord act in and so\nHaving the free press there to observe leadership is a check on their power you know that's why they've always been called the fourth estate now\nThe press has gotten fragmented and it's gotten a little bit ideological but they still have that right and I always thought that the communications department and my ... plan is a online somewhere somebody lead did so it it's out there was a ... page plan\nThat basically illustrated that we were going to be in the customer service business servicing the press and servicing all parts of the press so it didn't necessarily have to be right leaning press if anything\nI only did one press conference a but it was very important for me to call and CNN had been called on for several weeks\nAnd I want to send a message to those people that have we're now open for business the lights and cameras are back on in the press room we're open for business and you know I'm obviously not a shrinking violet I build my own business and you know came from scratch so I went in the square on it though I mean you give the president good advice why wouldn't they stick to it\nWell I think what ended up happening is there was a lot of commotion he clearly wanted to previous and Bannon out of there I made a very big gaffe when he put Kelly in the job\nHe was going to be impossible for Kelly to keep me because I was reporting directly to the president and even if I accepted a subordinate role which I have would have been happy to do that I'm a team player\nI don't think Kelly would have been able to sustain that I mean look let's face it I'm a New Yorker I have a New Yorkers attitude at a New Yorkers personality\nOr does that strike you as somebody that General Kelly with like you don't have to answer the question I'm saying ... having your General Kelly like I I I I think those might be somewhat of friction points for him to even be on the on that list but as far as going to like me anymore and then he likes the president and all your advice\nDeal with the press she could have kept that advice even after you left the White House I mean I get the sense that the president just didn't agree with it [noise] um no actually\n... you know ... there's a funny story you know because you know it was a short period of time but you almost have like a black box recorder in your brain when it's going on I'm sitting in the oval office with um the penny and meeting where I've been announces ... over him and I alone in the office\nI'm going to go on the air to three o'clock to do the press corps he looks at me and says hey it's a great relationship with the press I mean why do you think it's gone so poorly in the first six months\nI live in a while you declared war on the media I mean you can't declare war on the media for ... going to lose that war secondarily any a president that's made a war declaration on the media how is that going to end up well because everybody gets their guard up everybody gets in a defensive posture I said well we'll wait better served if we dial that down\nOr any other thing is the president is a TV star a people may not like me saying that about him but for me I like seeing them on sixty minutes I like seeing him in areas where he's outside of that style box of conservatism\nLet him parity with Leslie stall let him have a real conversation with the crust Cuomo or somebody like that I mean he doesn't like these people\nLet's say at least a half of them have that voice and so I was arguing for that I think we had them in position to do that\nThen the blow up happened and then people get very very defensive and then there are there also a lot of people don't like the presidents are prone to exaggeration he's a little bit like my grandfather that one said why let the truth get in the way of a really good story all we know that about the president's or there's a lot of people inside of the ... was like okay\nWe got to protect the president from him telling these like Mao props and him telling these\nStories that while ... may be a generous word for some of the things I mean Trump is that oh\nOkay that's right 'cause I'm On saying inaccurately and and clearly in consistently over ... listen I just left a morning show where these guys like they they really want them all day and night and so and they're calling him a rank liar and I get it I mean he does say things\nThat are inaccurate he is doing that in a way to fluff up the crowd and get everybody energized and I understand that\nAnd I understand if you're a military leader like somebody like John Kelly\nThat would probably refer your feathers because you would want accuracy and you would want all that stuff to be dial down and obviously fifty sixty percent of the public probably wants that to\nSo so but but we had to do that as you got to tell them straight is a man this is not working you gotta you gotta you gotta said straight but what he'll say back to you as well it's energizing my base it's bringing people out to the to the to vote\nAnd and this is always going to be as ... as long as Donald J Trump is the president United States it's going to be a battle between\nPolicy and personality and the people that like his policy are going to take his personality and if you don't like his policies are going to really focus on his personality and by the way there are some people were the personality is actually outweighing the policy where they're like okay look I Can't take the personality even though the policies are good and\nThrough a few more comments I Know we've only got you for a few more minutes but let me get to

I'd check off every vice I've ever dreamed about\nMentally wrote on our Facebook page on member wind because I don't gamble no lottery for me and Jim wrote on our Facebook page I'll take my chances with finding out if I can handle the wealth or not\nSo we are told you to respond to Jim's comments in terms of finding out if you can handle the wealth once the money going into your parents' hands how did they handle it\n[noise] and that's a great question and I'm I'm going to agree with him I'm not gonna lie everything that you know even if I say something negative about the wind today I Am not going to lie on such a hypocrite yes we have a ticket for tonight's drawing\nHuh one way though you know wait a minute wait a minute you already one way wind blowing up of knowing if you win the lottery ... when was\nIt was it may it it it's interesting because you know what people here eighty million you know I I never realized how much it decreases like if you take the cash option that Uncle Sam had hands out like\nI Need Fifteen times in that first year it just it really dwindle piano please don't get me wrong I down and she was or not to tie and all that but [laughter] you know but I Will say that\nHe I ate it I'm not going to lie and say that it was a complete cars for my family and when I say my family I'm going to talk about my husband and my\nTwo daughters so in so many ways it was a blessing because our parents didn't share small portion with my brother and I you know what that means that my kids can literally choose any primary and secondary education gold I won't go to any school for any amount of time they can do\nAnything they want if you want to travel to Italy to study architecture because that sure drain do it you know ... and that's an absolute blast that my husband and I both being and solve for sales we would have been able to afford that any way but it's nice to have that cushion right um\n[noise] so there are blessings but I Will say that women has shown me personally the absolute\nDark side of human nature and you know it wasn't my women but I have absolutely experienced it I'm sure my parents would have many many more stories um and\nIn speaking about my parents it it's strained relationship you know I've chosen to become extremely private about this when my husband and I moved to a different town to just kind of get away\nBecause my parents want in a state where you cannot remain anonymous and for them that with habits because they love to brag about it they love to spend lavishly\nLike it's like look at me\nWhere I'm more of the exact opposite and some of that is just out of fear either I'm I'm\nKind of fear based anyway heat I worry about the people that are going to kidnap your kids for ransom I worry about my parents someone hitting them over the head making sure everyone stays home and I'm going\nTo know I I Know we got to move on in in just a moment but I Wonder how you reflect back on that if you could go back to whatever the store was where your parents bought that winning ticket and say something to them before they bought it what would you say\nIt would be the same thing that I Would tell anyone who won tonight or if you won two million dollars if one two billion dollars that doesn't matter\nThey absolutely need to have the typical advice that you hear it you know surround yourself with a great taint a CPA financial adviser and attorney but not get vice would be to be careful\nThese are not necessarily the people that you went to high school with offices in a strip mall are handled your last or whatever you know you've had yeah the scale of your new state has to match their ability to start and you know if\nYou can't or a man on an ass consider options that allows you to remain as ...\nAs possible and then you control the message out you know I I Know that there are ways to do it and I think the last one is to just be aware of people's actions no matter how subtle you've gotta create your own litmus test who becomes your tried right right not your close family and it's not your ...\nI really do appreciate you sharing your story with us despite your decision to remain anonymous Sally we'll call you but certainly we appreciate your sharing that with his thanks very much for talking to us\nThank you good luck to everyone with a ticket including
