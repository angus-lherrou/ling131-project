Michael but um\n[noise] we can't say that the higher can\nDirectly related to global warming but we can\nSay is that ... these ... increasing at the results of global warming because we're all my atmosphere you know and that she can hold more water [laughter] so\n... says that they still the extreme it that sweaters harkens or extreme rainfall all heat waves are increasing with three little bits of warming\nLet me get through a few more of your comments Sarah emailed I feel overwhelmed by the talk about climate change\nAnd don't feel like there is a unified voice out they're letting families knew what concrete steps they can take to make a difference for our family this has led to ever present feelings of helplessness anxiety and guilt about the choices we make every day Sarah we will be talking about some concrete options in just a moment but let me get to a few more\nThoughts that have come in the U.S far Joel emailed\nYou should stop framing this as what will politicians do politicians reflect the people that voted for them half the voters in the U.S ... Donald Trump's tweet that global warming was a Chinese hoax and voted for him anyway that just goes to show how important the issue as to the people in\nThis country call Devon port I Wonder if you can respond to Joel's email I mean the president has committed to taking us out of the Paris Agreement he kind of questions the provenance of the agreement by saying well who wrote it up let me see who wrote a now believe it does Joel have a point\nI well in in terms as um ... policies\nAddress climate change on the U.S really isn't a\nA distinctive place right now I think I'm Around the rest of the world we do see an expression of will by leaders\nTo um enact policies to limit greenhouse gas emissions I think that there's a lot of questions on how strong this policy is actually are um you know the analysis shows that they're they're not strong enough to limit or I mean even to that that initial two degrees but the in the U. S.\nUm what we see is President Trump not only you know essentially questioning that the basic established of of\nClimate change but but also moving to undo existing\nClimate policies I'm President Trump has already moved forward with policies to undo regulations on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants on undo or weekend um regulations on greenhouse gas emissions from cars\nUm and he had said that it is his objective to promote the use of coal\nI'm burning coal is one of the leading contributors to greenhouse gas emissions\nA President Trump wants to promote the use of coal in the U.S and abroad um one of the findings\nOf this report is that in order to um limit greenhouse limit climate change to um\nYou know to to to the sort of least destructive um level of warming um the use of coal will have to uh basically go down to zero I'm by by twenty fifty she'll ... basically\nNo more on just about a numerical um and and and it is you know that that it that is an extremely disruptive policy recommendation um there's no question that there are industries and people who will be harmed\nWho who will have their livelihoods disrupted by policies um that go in that direction in that\nLet me just once I started to shore call but I Wonder in terms of the politics behind it so I hear you on our I totally hear you on how disruptive officers like coal is so interwoven in the network of America's energy grits kind of hard to just yank it all out\nI Wonder though in terms of the voices on the world stage who we we know that there was as you were saying well poll it'd be really hard to pull out\nTo get the sense that there's any one of the world stage saying tough our planet is only home you light pole tough we got to get rid of it deal with on ya author so Jerry Brown the governor of California for sure\nYeah and many of the ... on on the president of France has sought to kind of a step in and um\nHe he's trying to carve out a place for himself as a as a leader on climate change it's it's not difficult for France to take that position because France um doesn't really use coal um so but but but we I mean we absolutely see world leaders saying you know this is what what needs to happen um\n[noise] in China it's very interesting because um China is the world's largest\nUm greenhouse gas polluter and is a massive user of coal at the same time we're also that the Chinese government has moved forward with I'm actually in acting um prices on carbon ah they're they're they're an acting a cap and trade system that would force\nUm carbon polluters called polluters to essentially pay attacks or the um in in order to pollute which is designed to drive the market away from from greenhouse gases an idea that was invented in the United states but is\nI'm considered sort of politically toxic here in China they can implement it by ... they don't have to deal with Congress votes\nYou want to ... I Want to talk more about that idea of carbon taxes we continue in just a moment but let me get to a few more comments or Brian emailed we have no leaders anymore with the skills or courage to do what's right regardless of the political cost we will keep polluting as long as the price of fossil fuels is low\nWould be interested to hear from some of you listening who you trust who you think some of the leaders are politically in this country around the world\nWho you believe are sincere in their pushed to do something significant about climate change is there anybody that you think is for real and saying that we're going to make this happen or maybe if you were active with\nA politician or a government leader or a government agency that you're doing something tangible that you feel people should know more about we love to hear from you what gives you hope\nThat climate change is something that is actively being worked on where you are email is one a at W.

University of Arizona professor dying of liver man we got a number of messages from you in terms of how you are trying to make an impact with the fight against climate change here is a little mash up of two of the messages we got this is Amy from Chesapeake and Jeff in Michigan listen\nI'm getting a thought to slash astray thought slash feeling of power and that I Can't do it enough to stop the path of destruction that Iran\nI pessimism comes because I Believe that what's happening to the world is happening at a corporate level and I'm Still\nMore companies get on board and care about the environment it feels like we're kind of inevitable I have um two thousand for it or you will be here before we know it and we will rip the consequences\nThanks Geoff an Emmy for sharing your thoughts with us ah speaking of the corporate path there are some corporations who are taking a position in the fight against climate change including with regards to the carbon tax Melissa tweeted\nChina uses more than twice as much coal as the U.S hard to believe some carbon tax is going to make much of a difference considering their population let's talk more about carbon taxes with one more of our guests joining us from London\nTed holstead is the chairman and CEO of the climate leadership council Ted welcome to want to a\n[noise] good to be with you ... what is the climate leadership council [noise]\nIt is a group or that is co founded by a white actually the brought us climate coalition in us history to back a national solution is pushing for a carbon tax where all the money is related to the American people in the form of ... of ... of a dividend\nWho were some of the backers of the council where does the funding come from\nSo um the council is a does not accept corporate contributions but our founding members include four of the\nAh oil majors the largest car manufacturer in the United states the largest utility but also the largest a solar company in the United states a very broad coalition it also includes two leading environmental groups and opinion leaders from across the political spectrum ranging from\nBen Bernanke you to Janet Yellen to Larry Summers and of course our plan is named after former secretaries of state James Baker and George Schultz the\nBaker shields carbon difference plan but Joshua let me clarify we have there is a separate spin off organization that is a lobbying organization and that now has corporate funding including from Exxon\nAnd they just connected the organization or use it as a spin off but is there still a connection in any way or\nA separate organization that is the advocacy arm of the climate leadership council so the council develops this ground breaking plan were all sides wind and Americans for carbon dividends which was co chaired by former Republican Senate majority leader trend lot and uh\nUh sooner brew that group lobbies for this plan and it now has money from oil natural gas solar wind and nuclear power interests\nColder in Fort let's take a step back before we get into the plan that the climate leadership council is advocating more specifically defined this term carbon tax for us what exactly is a carbon tax\nShore so um [noise]\nThe idea of a carbon tax is um\n... each ton of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere um you can put a price on how much economic harm it causes\nUm and uh and and and I ... and important note on that as the the economist who came up with with that idea his name is William North house he's a professor at Yale I'm was just awarded the Nobel Prize for this idea on Monday\nI'm the same day that the IPC came out with this report which heavily sites I'm professor north houses work\nUm so he came up with the idea of every ton of carbon\nUm traps heat in the atmosphere and you can put a price on how much each kind of carbon hurts\nA the global economy um and and there's a range for how much that costs that it it can range from um fifty dollars a time to a hundred dollars a time when I'm you know there there's there's debate about about how much\nUm actual harm it can cost but once you sort of place that price on carbon um than you are can essentially um create attacks I'm at a price on carbon or attacks on carbon that you would impose upon polluters of carbon dioxide no no\nNo water carbon records want to be really clear in terms of who the taxes paid on I mean if I Am a car Baker do I pay\nThe home of pollution from automobiles does the carmaker pay a carbon tax for producing the vehicle that ... carbon dioxide or does the oil company pay the carbon tax for\nFinding the gas alone the term I actually\nMost likely you pay at a as a car driver I'm older\nAnd and and and you you would so um we don't have carbon taxes in the U. S. um so in some ways this this is sort of um\nYou know and intellectual debate although other countries are are working are sort of further along on this but the idea is\nUm if this would affect how you drive it would probably um be taxed based on how much carbon monoxide would be a produced by burning 'em by burning gasoline show it would most likely be added to the cost of the gasoline that you put in your car so if you're going to put in\nAnd it mounted gasoline in your car that would produce a certain\nAmount of carbon dioxide when you burn it that would raise that tax would raise the price of gasoline and the idea is then you would be motivated\nTo buy a car that use less gasoline essentially that that's how it would drive the market so consumers would want to buy electric cars would want to buy efficient cars not because not out of some sort of\nA moral sensibility but because actually a ... a price on carbon would make it cheaper and to to use an electric car it's a it's a powerful market signal\nTo hosted the yesterday Exxon Mobil committed money to lobbying Congress for price on carbon give us a sense of what the plan involves and why it is getting support now\nDefense plant is based on four pillars of the first is a robust carbon tax starting at forty dollars per ton which would actually be the highest carbon tax of any a leading emitting country all of the money would go directly back to the American people in the form of a carbon dividend\nWhich means that the vast majority of American families including the most vulnerable would win economically from this plan and a third pillar is that we would\nTrade a high price on carbon in a growing price on carbon for some of the carbon regulation simply because a carbon tax is a more cost effective way to solve climate change\nThe law just wanna make sure I understand so the plan if the plan went into effect there would be a tax on the carbon that I Am it with my car or my motorcycle or whatever and then that the revenues from that tax would come back to me as a taxpayer in the form of a of a dividend is that what you called\n[noise] yes so a family of four would get approximately two thousand dollars per year\nIn dividends and here's how the system would work the more you pollute the more you pay the less you pollute the more you win so Seventy percent of American families would come out economically ahead and that's what's so transformative about the dividend concept which is that we can have\nThe most effective climate lever which is a carbon tax in a manner that is popular populist and equitable for the American people\nHow much of that money would be spent on environmental programs or planting forests or doing research on cleaner energy with all of it just come back to us as taxpayers\nA hundred percent would go back to the American people and that is what makes the plan a popular\nAnd politically viable because in ... on Capitol Hill you'll never get the two sides to agree on how to spend the revenue Republicans will say well let's spend on deficit reduction are lowering the corporate income tax Democrats will say well\nLet's spend it on a renewable energy innovation or a low income support\nIt opens up Pandora's box by contrast when you returned all the money directly to the American people it closes that box and what polling shows is that it's overwhelmingly popular most interesting\nThere's three to one support among Republican voters and Trump supporters for this plan for to one support among millennials which of course or soon to be the largest voting cohort\nScientific exploration more information as at Wisconsin science classes dot org [noise]\n\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

whole storyline was her nose like for me that kind of set up that moment on stage very well but things with her no\nYes yes I mean I'm just like a little bit sick as a person and for me her nose is like my weight so she owned it she's like this is my name is with me to take me as I Am and she worked at it\nYou know got to accept that this is me and it's not going to change and I thought it it kind of the ill\nYeah yeah how do I really appreciate your calling and thanks very much for talking to us and I love Ann Powers I Love that kind of commentary on the music industry that was kind of baked into the film particularly the thing about her nose when they're standing on the roof top in LA and there's that Ali billboard and he says we should have just made old billboard your nose\nI think the thing about the comments about her nose is also a guy guys\nHonoring Barbra Streisand one of the greatest performers and greatest noses to ever a exist in and thrive in Hollywood as far as it coming on the music industry it absolutely is a powerful comment on the music industry\nAs the music industry existed I don't know maybe ten years ago I think that where this thing has placed in time where this movie a space and time it's interesting to think about that because almost everything that happens still happens today and the music industry but there's\nReally no knowledge of how things are rapidly changing with the advent of streaming playlists and um the major record labels having less\nPower than they used to so it's almost like old fashioned and its view of the music industry but only that view would would work for this film you couldn't really tackle a the collapse of the music industry in this in this movie\nLinda Holmes could you also chime in but by the way for those who have not seen star is born will not be seeing stars form of just kind of want to be in on the conversation she tells Bradley Cooper character fairly early on that she's dealt with music industry people who were like yeah your songs are you saying well but your nose you know just isn't quite right for\nMusic and that was kind of one of those petty impediments that had prevented her from getting where she wanted to go into homes I Wonder how you view that commentary on the music industry when I was watching the movie\nI felt like I was thinking about Lady Gaga because Lady Gaga herself has this kind of over the top persona that she created to kind of be the vehicle for her art\nI also thought about pink\nWho was very much and invention of pop music but who also have this kind of rye cynical file style but almost commented on it as she was doing it and that was what made people love her\nYeah I mean I think that um I agree with and that\nThe view of the music industry in this film in order to be aligned with the view of Hollywood and the previous films in some ways\nIs very linear it's a very linear idea of there is the one I'm rose to fame there is one path you just simply offend or D than as opposed to there's no suggestion that either one of them that he or she\nMight have success in a a different kind of version of what it means to be famous like that he would score movies or you know that she would develop her own you know following through streaming with out kind of going through that trust\nThink that um I'm not sure that you could do it any other way I think the purpose is to have them pass each other on this fame ladder and I think you kind of have to construct it that way and what you're saying about Lady Gaga you know I'm the caller was talking about kind of seeing\nA alley the character talking about well I have to and I'm really afraid and I don't have confidence in my nose or whatever it is funny to see an artist's like Lady Gaga who has been so able\nTo make such an indelible mark on the industry and on popular culture I mean the funny thing about this movie is she is way more important to share than he is um if you're talking about the real people so it's kind of funny to see\nHer big personality taking advice from Bradley Cooper just had a much more traditional Hollywood leading man type of career right um it's odd in that way\nYeah except for the voice in rocketing guardians of the galaxy that's a little bit more of a diverse but you're right I mean he is much more of like typical leading man actor I Wonder also John in terms of\nThe story line you know one of the big\nParts of the storyline is the love story and Bradley sent a lot of time sitting up that first time meeting here's a piece of that moment from a star is born when they're falling in love in a grocery store parking lot and Lady Gaga is character Eli is just improvising a love saw him they found\nTime to time can do\n[noise]\nOr even though [noise]\nBradley Cooper Lady Gaga in a star is born Cooper spoke to NPR's MORNING EDITION with the host Rachel Martin about his work and said this about working with Lady Gaga\nAnd then we went to the piano and saying and it was just kind of wonderful thing I couldn't believe it\nSo that was the beginning of the journey and the first time we sang together I mean everything's ... we say we sing everything live in the movie wow you know there's nothing that's lips thinking\nAnd I turned to Lady Gaga who's seen next to me and she was looking at me like I was Jackson, Maine when any when you're in a scene is actors fully believing that you're the character you cannot believe it yourself so she really gave me the confidence\nBradley Cooper speaking to Rachel Martin on NPR's MORNING EDITION John horn what did you make of the collaboration between Bradley Cooper Lady Gaga particularly how it came out in the way the love story played out\nThis is my big problem with the film and I think for a lot of people it's not an issue it was for me when her character an alley first meets jak he was a stumbling blackout drunk and I think it looks as if he's just spend a weekend at a bar do cabin or oh Kavanaugh KCUR\nAnd I don't find that interesting or attractive if she had met him sober and he fell into alcoholism\nAnd stayed with him it would be more interesting he's\nYou're

born\nEnergy and can you hear me yes I gave it five stars which why five stars\n[noise] um actually I just loved everything about this I've actually seen the other versions and this one seemed articulate well updated to today um I thought it was the irony of being discovered\nBecause she was a drunk and looking for a drink and their life being torn apart at the end because of drink I mean that was that continually said and one one thing I don't think other people have mentioned is the part that her agent\nI guess he was her age ah the guy who made her over the manager Dale agent played\nYeah what what is your main character\nI didn't like him and I I guess I wasn't supposed to\nHe had that conversation with jacks and um and and basically getting ready to accuse ... are accusing him\nOf being a problem and that whole relationship I just I just knew that that was going to be the start of of something really bad happening\nYeah yeah I I I hear using a hundred percent of ... and I I think I heard your charming and as well\nNo that was mailed to go yeah I think I think one of the tricks and this goes a little bit back to what you were all talking about about the mental health and recovery portions of this story one of the tricks with the manager is I think\nThey do such a beautiful job of explaining where he is in his recovery process and where he is I'm thinking about mental health and they made her seem like someone who is aware of what his problems are she's been wary of them from the beginning\nUm but then they are ultimately headed toward this pre determined tragic ending in which um he dies of suicide and so\nI think the manager I think the conversation with the manager unfortunately seems like a forced element that\nIt doesn't feel organic to the story it feels like it comes into just drive that last you know to drive that ending and it doesn't seem organic necessarily to to the story as they've developed debt because when he's been through these um recovery process is\nDoes it seem like without speaking to her he would hear that from the manager I mean obviously depression and an addiction can operate in a lot of different ways for sure but you know did the movie really do a good job of explaining why that conversation at that moment would be enough\nTo drive this enormous decision that that he makes and I'm not sure it did I think that's where I found the ending to be not as satisfying as I thought the rest of the film was\nAgree with you on that and on top of that I think that the movie had a way you know I was always taught you know in in writer school show don't tell\nThere was this moment in the film where Ali says I Want jak on my tour make it happen or or we're done and I feel like there could have been a moment where for example she goes on to say to her with her and he can't keep up or he keeps we're getting the lyrics or he falls down draw like something could have happened\nTo someone coming to him and saying you know your bad for her right so that would have like plead that whole narrative in a different way from like\n... ... exactly someone he doesn't really know someone he hasn't necessarily trust ed come in and is able to kind of up in his entire sense of his relationship with her I think that's part of the the narrative issue with the ending let's all go ahead and go as\nWell of course of course the the ways in which a Hollywood and the fame machine at the same monster as Lady Gaga once called it and one of her albums a destroys people is a major theme\nThroughout all of the versions of stars born in there and in fact all the bridges of the stars have that manager character in a different embodiment\nUm that character in this film I absolutely agree was more personally slimy felt like you know a villain whereas in in some of the previous versions he almost was a sympathetic enabler\nUm of of the male lead and who then was like hey you know\nWe're trying to keep them afloat but he's going to mess you up\nEsther Esther was the first name a valley and the stars foreign versions so the story of Hollywood destroying people um requires that a a stand in for the machine be part of being part of the cast you know has to be there um\nI also just want to say before we end got to get this out there that um\nOf how a woman's arise leads to a man's fall [laughter] and that's an internal problem with the stars bar and you know it's a melodrama it's it's a melodrama is traditionally aimed at women we feel very sympathetic\nA toward the lead female character but there is this underlying sense have to say it that\nEven as Jackson, Maine is saved temporarily by the energy he he gets almost empirically from his young protege ultimately he has destroyed because she has moved into the center and he has been pushed the periphery\nFeminist raining problematic found well but\nYou're not the only one who's brought that up I mean Julian wrote on our Facebook page I fear the story of a rising female star nursing a failing male ego is the wrong story in this meat to era\nWe get to a few more of your views of the film Harvey in Ann Arbor emailed I saw this film hoping to be moved crying deeply engaged that didn't happen for stars\nI deeply appreciative guys nuanced shyness in her early portrayal which made Maine's characters advising her work well\nI'd like to have the same Eliot brother character better developed possibly a moment perhaps a moment could have been written in the car rides the bar possibly dropping him off from the performance is scenes seemed a little too detached from me overall I Love the big venue concert treatments\nThat kind of gets to a comment from Argo in ... North Carolina who tweeted three stars a star is born was a story the performance is especially the musical ones were fantastic and the cinematography was incredible\nI expect a lot of nominations to come for deep ie the director of photography cinematographer Matthew ... production designer Karen Murphy costumer Aaron been act score original song and editing John horns spoke with the cinematographer Matthew ... about shooting live performances\nWhich are not really straightforward spaces to navigate\nHere is a part of that conversation from Cape he sees the frame in\nThis film was very difficult to sort of navigate the stage performances because we had three different modes basically we had the Coachella mode which is I'm borrowing stages or that were already set up with the lady that was already existing\nAnd putting in our own crowds and then there was the I'm running guns sort of we have ten minutes to shoot him between two sets with a real audience apologizing in thanking the audience for I'm sort of I'm shooting a movie in between\nTwo bands and then we had the third which is the Greek theater which in which shallow was performed where we um we actually in more of a movie fashion was able to create the Greek theater as a set\nAnd put a certain amount of crowded and so that was my most controlled scenario but the lighting of it had to have a consistency my my goal was that um you know in creating a character from cinema cinematography standpoint\nJackson, Maine might as well be um [noise] oh I don't know Jack White and I had to make sure that the [noise]\nThe audience maybe subconsciously feel that this is his lady this is his road show and it's also in the film in the sort of visual movement of it a representation of rock and roll\nThat was Mathew but seek the cinematographer on a star is born speaking to John horn on Cape he sees the frame John can you talk a little bit more about the making of this film particularly back to Kathleen question who wrote on Facebook how you can tell if a film is well directed this kind of a film\nThe way that Matthew described it presents all kinds of additional challenges to make it a well directed film shooting in so many different kinds of locations yeah I think the ultimate question about it\nIt do you believe you're watching Bradley Cooper or do you believe you're watching Jackson made if you think you're watching the actor you're not in a well directed movie if you are with the character", "show_name": "Kathleen Dunn", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "10"}
