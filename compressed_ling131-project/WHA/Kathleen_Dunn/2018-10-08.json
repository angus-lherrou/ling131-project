C.\nW. am used Patrick Madden was there on Saturday as hundreds of people protested on the Capitol Steps about a hundred sixty four people got arrested [noise]\nKind of reflects what we heard from Paula in North Florida who tweeted we'd better vote\nLike our lives depended on it in November and not let anything go to the Supreme Court if we can possibly help it\nSharon emailed I was behind judge Kavanaugh from the beginning of his confirmation for his stellar record and I am overjoyed but he's now an associate justice I Am one of the many many pro life women that the mainstream media seeks to always minimize both our numbers and our positions as women\nJohn brought on our Facebook page you catch soft sell this anymore was unwavering support for Duncan Hunter junior Kavanaugh and Trump Republicans are OK with philandering and sexual assault\nThe only reason was Ford was not believed was because she was testifying against the Republican nominee the rights didn't even listen to her and the FBI quote unquote investigation was a total sham and John wrote investigation in quotation marks on a chair and I did want to ask you about that in terms of\nWho was believed in this whole process set aside for a moment the evidence she or a question of whether the Senate should be thinking beyond a reasonable doubt in court or you know ... like ... set that aside for for just a moment but just\nThe visceral way in which some people seem to be more believed\nOthers what did you make of that [noise] so this episode like so much and are highly highly polarized society um\nIf two completely different world views so when Democrats um both partisan Democrats any way I look at what happened with Kavanaugh they see a Republican Party that is ... that doesn't believe women that diminishes charges\nA sexual assault doesn't take them seriously\nAnd um they have some things in their in their quiver they can point to the Roy Moore episode end to end to the president himself and so forth so that's their view on the the Republican view is\nThat the allegation of Christine Blasey Ford was even though it was held until the very last moment and they're they're very angry about the the process as um I was saying\nBut they also point to the fact\nThat this accusation the blazing forward one was taken seriously was listen to but then it was roped in by many Democrats on the committee with\nThat they should not have even pass the\nLaugh test um the the one by Julie sweat neck which she immediately walked back you know that that there was some sort of raped gang going on in a in in ... says to Maryland and the Nineteen eighties and to\nThe students and that she is a college student was attending a lot of high school parties and saw Kavanaugh spiking the drinks and girls with clay lose and then attacking them well of course she she walked all of that back but\nUh and of course the Ramirez story too was quite thin so thin that the New York times looked into it and we refuse to publish it\nSo um so so the the problem was that when Michael ... sort of\nColored sweat neck and dragged her forward and included her absurd allegations in with\nBlasey Ford's more um believable accusation it had the paradoxical effect of ... of um making sleazy Ford's case all the um weaker because it was seen to be part of this political hit\nAnd um and I think of an ... a may have a lot to answer for from his Democratic colleagues\nWill the president did also make some political have with Christine Blasey Ford's case or her story as well let me here's part of what you said at a rally on Wednesday in Mississippi in an act of what he said was to help defend Brett Kavanaugh and his unfair treatment here's a bit of the president\nKind of characterizing washing cars a generous word what professor Ford said to say\nI did he get home I don't remember how you get there I don't remember where was I don't remember how many years ago when I don't\nKnow [noise]\nWhat\nWas it and I don't know\n[noise] I don't know what I that's the only thing are in [noise]\n\nMan a man who lives just shattered\nPart of what the president said his rally last Wednesday in Mississippi it's worth noting that the president is incorrect in his assertion that all the professor Ford remember was having one beer indeed she said that seared into her hippocampus clearly a psychology professor was the fact\nThat she was laughed at during the assault\nYes she also remembered that it was upstairs I mean she remembered many things the president did not cover himself with glory in that moment where he was mocking current diminishing her of course a that was that was disgusting on the other hand\nUm there has been a tremendous amount of behavior on the left during this process that was also I'm really ... um stopping people in restaurants and and driving a people uh from the public square um\nUh you know accusing someone of um absurd\nCharges and not taking into account his whole life you know ... if judge Kavanaugh where the monster that ah that some of the Democrats had been portraying you would think that somebody would have picked up on it at some point in his adult life\nWell and that's kind of what I'm Wondering in a way I hear you on that Mona El Yon also kind of noticed that\nOne aspect of the debate or brown Brett Kavanaugh that seemed to not get a whole lot of mentioned the final analysis didn't get a lotta mentioned from Susan Collins of Maine when she gave that like fifty minutes exploitation on the floor of the Senate which was actually rather fast moving toward hearing if you haven't heard it\nIs just how Brett Kavanaugh handled the accusation I mean if someone accused me of something awful but I Know I did not do\nI think I Would hope that I'd be able to say listen this is an awful thing that happened it sounds like a tragedy I Wish I could give you\nI'm not the person who did it like something about temperament in this whole discussion kind of ...\nYeah I Do think that once the additional allegations came out and cabin up in his testimony had to answer not just for a lousy Ford's allegation but also for the other two allegations and and he was upset\nAngry in tears enraged are outraged Democrats sort of their their arguments a became\nOne not about necessarily guilt or innocence but one about temperament and did you have the appropriate temperament sit on the bench\nAnd it ah their argument necessarily uh it it became one not about do we believe her but then he doesn't have a judicial temperament and Republicans answered intern that a Democrat said he was to blog day and the Fox interview and to detach and then when he got angry they thought that wasn't good enough\nI'm from a from a report ... perspective on the the temperament question was an interesting one to me it's sort of seemed to me from afar that looking at the justice says on the bench we know all of their politics are based on the president to appoint them and based on the way they ruled\nSo the temperament question was\nInteresting I'm not sure how relevant is because we know all the politics of all of the justices\nNot really sure how cabinets temperament plays into\nIt with regards to temperament and civility Sam wrote on our Facebook page there's a difference between the Thomas and Kavanaugh hearings referring to Clarence Thomas back in Ninety One\nThomas required sixty votes to confirm Kavanaugh only fifty fifty plus one there's no need for civility for the majority anymore because there's no need to have some support\nYou're

keep going\nOn I mentioned that that Republicans I suffer in the midterms and that was a political sacrifice worth making I I actually think that the opposite I mean I'm not in that political prognostications business I think after twenty sixteen and that's a dangerous business are you\nAre but I don't think they'll suffer at all in fact I'm especially among Republican women there's been a big jumping enthusiast and there's a twelve point\nUpward swing among Republican women and that's because the left doesn't actually owned the voices of women\nOn for a lot of women out there this this hearing as about fairness\nIt was about fairness for their husbands their fathers their sons on that a lot of blame moms who are are really scared about the standard that Mona mentioned right the idea that a single accusation\nWithout any kind of corroborating evidence is enough to destroy a man's life I think there are a lot of women who see a problem with that standard as well and they are also energized come out to the\nThis is no doubt very very visceral for quite a lot of you including gene\nGene email urging contacted us in road we're more concerned with the men who were falsely accused two to five percent of the time than the women who are raped Ninety five Ninety eight percent of the time\nWhen one in four women in America deal with rape and tens of thousands of rape kits remain untested there are bigger issues than your panel was talking about our justice system is broken the women on your panel are making my blood boil ... are we losing sight of something larger here [noise]\nUh well the um the problem of rape has always been with us as long as\nSupport for WPRI comes from Lawrence University in Appleton dedicated to offering a comprehensive academic program with a nine to one student or professor ratio and a commitment to personalized education Lawrence dot edu\nYet or not race that's that's way overstated sexual violence from central so and that's a very very broad description drunk foods even just being funneled over your clothes against your will so it'd be careful with a number yeah okay so yeah the number is is is a is not not right\nBut look at the problem of of male sexual aggression or has been a problem throughout human civilization\nAll civilized society seek to cope with it\nUh and it's also one of the most difficult crimes to prosecute because in most cases there are only two people it happens in privacy there are no witnesses um it's very hard to show proof if there was no actual if there were no wounds on the woman's body et cetera et cetera\nSo it is you know when people say well we're not being believed it's because it's it's very hard to prove and also we have to recognize that the consequences of finding of guilt a finding someone guilty of rape mean\n... years and years and years in prison and so of course we do need to be careful about how we evaluate rape accusations it's it's it's an awful thing it's but I don't see any way around you know keeping in mind our standards of justice and fair play and see any way around\nThe difficulties inherent in these kinds of accusations\nFeel like well this is one of those moments early on as there were a lot of women including several who commented on this program not that I think that the show is a perfectly representative sample of the country but a preponderance of the woman who commented on this program have essentially said I don't want to hear it\nWe've been waiting for all of human history for our society to deal with the fact that men can treat women like pieces of meat and get away with it with impunity that day is over yesterday so fix this or we will shut you down until you do\nI hear you Mona but it's that emotional visceral part of politics on uh I I don't think that the political will is there especially among women who have been assaulted to say okay I'll take a breath and wait another term for this to get better\n[noise] well I think there are two challenges the first is that we have a justice system based on a presumption of innocence and the cabin are confirmation presented another challenge which is that he was not being tried in a court of law and the question raised and it was should he at\nBenefit from the presumption of innocence and we had a lot of senators saying no key should I had the presumption of guilt and he should have to clear his name and not seem not to go over a well there was a political backlash on the right to that\nAnd so I think that there certainly is energy on the left but it is met with equal force from energy on the right with people who feel that that's\nGreatly unfair but the cabinet confirmation and saying that\nA ... a presumption of guilt when an accusation is leveled was sort of met with an equal and opposite energy from the right and emailers and callers can say that that makes their blood boil but covering this as a reporter that is simply a sort of what we saw\nI Do want to move on and talk about the impact on the Supreme Court but I should note that this has left some of you just regardless of your politics feeling very cynical about the process over all I mean this was very high political theater in some ways when you get down to it and that was kind of the reflection of one listener who just left a note in our inbox\nMy name is George I'm calling from Cleveland, Ohio I'm very disappointed check and our\nIs appointed with the United states at this time and an African American woman I really do feel that it was all up the joke that they

calling and sharing your thoughts with us we get to a few\nMore comments as we continue Tina in Grand Rapids Michigan emailed\nI'm so sick and tired of people talking about Kavanaugh's reputation in life being ruined but it's absolutely ridiculous usually wealthy privileged white man whose life is nowhere near ruined obviously now he's been confirmed and will be on the Supreme Court her life is the one that has been ruined if anyone's life has been ruined\nThe me too movement has not been weaponized for political gain and I'm Upset that your guest just said that on the air so angry right now this is real for women\nIrwin in Arkansas emailed so we'll Kevin uh really take the court to the far right I've been hearing conflicting views from the right where some ... if you will do so and others say Kavanaugh will actually be moderate ... just gets to something that senator Collins of Maine Susan Collins of Maine\nTalked about her long exploitation explaining why she was going to vote\nFor Brett Kavanaugh and some of his background particularly as it relates to dealing with\nPresidents on the Supreme Court she mentioned roe versus Wade very specifically what what's your read on whether or not Brett Kavanaugh will track record kind of as Irwin suggested to the far right\nLook I'm because he's replacing Anthony Kennedy I think there will be a shift the right on the court um I think it will be much more measured than some art cleaning\nUm I think it's really unlikely that you see roe versus Wade something like overturned precedent overturn I think it's much more likely that we see some narrowing of the precedent on abortion allowing states I'm a little bit more leeway to regulate abortion and the second and third trimester is I think that's more likely outcome on those issues um\nI Do think that she's in Collins overstated a Kavanaugh's moderate credentials a little bit and her her speech um because he was as a judge and the ... he was following Supreme Court precedent his job as a judge was try to guess how the Supreme Court would rule on a particular issue given the process that now\n\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join

issue and ... and let me start with you if you just explain what you mean\nAnd and what point redistricting becomes gerrymandering right so this is a process that the United states goes through every ten years after the descending all senses\nOf the census really starts the whole process\nThe U.S Census Bureau eventually gives the states the official number of uh their population and then the number of seats in the U.S house of representatives they'll get\nThat are really complicated math formula called the Huntington he'll method which I still haven't quite figured out even though I've been staring at it for a couple of years but that that's how so every state's all fifty states get one member of the house of representatives at least you know there are four hundred and thirty five\nSo that eliminate those those first fifty seats that everybody gets and then the fifty first seat is awarded to the largest state using the Huntington he'll method so California gets the fifty first date\nAnd if I'm not mistaken I think they get the fifty seconds a seat as well uh but then that does the seats are allocated by population all the way down to the four hundred and thirty fifth\nAh and that's how we figure out that um say you know Washington state has ten districts this time or California has fifty three and whether or not they're going to gain or lose a seat on the margins depending on uh the population shift and the relative populations of each state so this happens every ten years and then\nEvery ... the U.S constitution gives the state legislatures the power to draw those district lines now that clause has been interpreted in different ways or some legislatures have challenged\nUh the the various independent commissions around the country so that they can maintain that power other states other legislators have more willingly given up that power to an independent commission but basically every state does it in its own way in some with with some you know various quirks here and there\nAre and the legislatures will then draw those maps and the district lines are meant to go in place by the twenty twenty two congressional elections so the U.S census happens in twenty twenty or the the official numbers are given to the states about a year later and then the states have about a year to draw district lines\nEverybody knows pretty much where the districts are going to be right there in minor tweaks that happened here and there\nAnd when we get to gerrymander young that's when a that that sort of the pejorative term for when\nA party draws district lines that are meant to favor their candidate in crazy ways in ways that where the the communities are divided to diminish one side's political power or bolster another sides political power um and and you know throughout the years or every state has gone through its own\nHiccups with political gerrymandering a it's become a dirty word now and it's something that we're going to see\nThrown around a lot of in this next redistricting\nYeah North Carolina is one of those states has got quite a few stories to tell about redistricting and gerrymandering and David your in Charlotte following the national democratic redistricting committee which Eric Holder is leading we had him on this program to talk about it a while back give us a sense David of what's at stake\nPolitically with redrawing these district lines particularly with North Carolina being this kind of interesting example of redistricting and the efforts to reform it\nI think there's an awful lot at stake um if you think about it this way if you look at the five competitive swing states of Pennsylvania North Carolina Michigan Ohio Wisconsin you might imagine that those five competitive swing states Sunday similar number of members of Congress both parties\nTo Washington except the reality is dramatically different those five states than forty eight Republicans and Twenty one Democrats Washington Democrats have only been successful and flipping one seat\nRed to blue in any of those competitive states in this entire decade and that's the Conor Lamb the in the special election in two thousand Seventeen so when the two thousand twelve two thousand fourteen and two thousand sixteen elections\nIn any of these competitive swing states you also see this as as well as the state legislative level so you have all of these states that are closely divided like say North Carolina I'm you know states in which that\nDemocrats may often when more votes statewide for it chamber and yet here for example Republicans have a super majority in in both the state assembly and also in the state Senate so they're able to completely override\nThe actions of a democratic governor here at mix politics more extreme it insulate members\nFrom voters it allows them to do things like the transgender bathroom build it wildly unpopular and yet the politicians um you know feel completely empowered to go ahead and\nEnact that kind of legislation I'm ... and it also discourages competition in a lot of the seats in North Carolina in two thousand sixteen forty nine percent of all statewide seats went\nWithout a major party competitor so voters had no choice and almost half of their districts here because folks took a look at those races and said I Can't win or raise enough money to actually make it worth the investment of time\nTo get to some of your comments as well clearly gerrymandering is is as some of your fans of the show no one of our audience has hottest hottest topics including with Michael wrote on our Facebook page any party that requires gerrymandering to stay in power doesn't deserve power there shouldn't be partisan\nMichael writes Ohio is heavily gerrymandered however in an election earlier this year voters heavily approved with support from both parties and the issue on the ballots are fairly redrawn districts after twenty twenty\nAnd Laura writes Pennsylvania was gerrymandered they rewrote the map but I Do not believe they were making an active for this twenty Eighteen election ain't that a load of crap\nThat's also the same in North Carolina Laura by the way we did a program a while back in February ... actually about gerrymandering where we put a quiz online we have some gerrymandered districts and we wanted to see if you could tell the difference between the map of gerrymandered district\nAnd an ink blot on a ... test you can find that quiz if you search the words gerrymandering G. E. R. R. Y. M. A. N. D. E. R. I. N. G. it was a program that aired this February you'll find that on our website the one a dot org\nKatie let me come to you talk about voters not politicians I understand that this was a redistricting initiative that got started after you were trying to find some way to be politically active but not overtly hyper partisan and this is something that galvanized people around you right\n[noise] yeah I'm I accidentally started a political movement with a Facebook post it was after that too many sixteen election uh before\nI'm headed to a Thanksgiving dinner and I had heard my friends and family really are being drawn to both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders on what these messages about draining the swamp and the political revolution and\nI realized that you know there's a lot of frustration against the current system in place which makes a lot of sense I remember learning about gerrymandering and it does make it to that our voices aren't heard or that popular a proposals aren't being passed at the local level\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

rising and read Wilson national correspondent\nFor the hill a couple of you wrote us to respond to lower his message about Pennsylvania's redrawn maps not being in place for this year's election\nMark writes that the new Pennsylvania congressional maps are effective this election cycle Steve writes the state Supreme Court had to intervene to get us fair districts somewhere so badly gerrymandered districts formed pictures look at the old seventh congressional district\nThankfully the new districts are enforced for twenty Eighteen in some of them say that the seventh congressional district in Pennsylvania looks like a goofy and Donald Duck facing one another's seriously just Google it speaking of which Maurice tweeted gerrymandering has transcended the political realm and infiltrated the fashion world\nHe sent us a link to a website called gerrymander jewelry dot com\nMrs they say gerrymandered jewelry has all these pictures six in fact of voting districts than North Carolina sixth district Texas is thirty fifth district's Louisiana six Florida force Michigan fourteenth\nAnd Ohio's first district and they're selling them as jewelry a hundred and Ninety five dollars each but the proceeds benefit of political action group is trying to get more Democratic governors secretaries of state and attorneys general elected in six key Republican controlled states we got a lot of comments read about\nThe role of Republicans in gerrymandering Scott wrote on our Facebook page I live in Virginia the GOP is dragging its feet on this because they barely held onto a majority with the current maps it's gerrymandered in their favor they're simply trying to push this past the ... election to stem their losses\nIsn't fair I don't think that the Republicans have cornered the market on gerrymandering neither party wants to be disadvantaged but what what what do we know well the Virginia example he's talking about the house of delegates and\nHow they were Democrats came within one seat of winning back the house of delegates back in twenty Seventeen the way of Virginia elections work the delegates are elected in a odd numbered years so it has and that doesn't actually have anything to do with the twenty teen election uh there are some there have been some federal challenges to the congressional district lines in Virginia\nBut but that there's a difference between the state legislative districts which\nIs sort of part of a larger story of how Republicans locked in a lot of their gains in the U.S house of representatives\nUh but that's those are two different things you're you're exactly right there the there's no party is blameless in this\nUh gerrymandering started we get the word from a guy named Eldridge Gary who was the governor of Massachusetts\nUh back in Eighteen twelve he drew a district line that effectively packed all of the federal and members of the federalist party into one district and that allowed his party the Democratic Republicans imagine if those still existed today\nA isn't to win all the districts around it uh the a newspaper ... in in Boston took a look at the map they said it looked like a salamander was Jerry's salamander he was a gerrymander ... that's how we actually get the word and so yeah this has been happening since like the beginning of the republic\nHum you could argue that some of this happened back in in a feeding and democracy back in you know with\nFive hundred BC uh but when we talk about today\nYeah both parties do this look Democrats controlled the house of representatives from Nineteen fifty four to Nineteen Ninety four and they did it in a large part by a drawing favorable districts in the south that were meant to lock in their members and in in large degree to discriminate against African American voters are and now even ...\nSupport for WPRI comes from Fort imprint providers of promotional products for businesses including embroidered apparel trade show giveaways and local business gifts more about the four imprint dedication to customer satisfaction is that for imprint dot com\nOr publicly lately and so therefore they are getting the heat but yeah when we started hearing about a fair district lines\nThat generally comes from the people who think that aren't aren't fair and therefore are probably the ones who are losing elections that's not to diminish the fact that the these lines may not be fair but the people who who ... tend to be the ones who are not ... not holding the pencils if\nYou will we do get comments from folks on both sides we all complaining about how both sides we all tend to gerrymander Harry wrote on our Facebook page the geo peas going nuts in Colorado over ballot initiatives to read just require a nonpartisan commission\nSlow deep tweeted I Wish this was such a hot topic back when Democrats in my state had districts in the shape of a pencil\nJoanne wrote on our Facebook page redistricting reform has been an issue for several years in Indiana as we have a super majority Republican general assembly a Republican governor and the state Supreme Court was a majority appointed by Republican governors at approved by the Republican legislators\nNothing will change as long as the gerrymandered legislative branch is controlled by one party\nSeveral bills have been put forward with lip service for leadership been killed by Republican chairman who do not believe that Indiana is gerrymandered and see so publicly\n... he I Wonder if this gets back to something that you said earlier about trying to find something political but not partisan can you give me a sense of some of the conversations you've had\nWith folks that you've been witness to folks kind of talking across the aisle about this does this feel practically to you on the ground like a unifying issue\nYeah my experience really has been that um I mean in Michigan though we have had Democrats and Republicans control the line drawn process so maybe that helps but\nWe have volunteers who are Democrats or Republicans independents and I think that what we've seen is that no matter which party is in charge in Michigan they're really common sense things\nThat we all looked to government at at least help provide basic things like clean water or roads that aren't falling apart um those things aren't happening no matter who's in charge and um\nYou know we there's also a Detroit is pretty gerrymandered they try and pack a lot of Democrats into one district but there there are still Republicans who live in those districts and so their voices aren't heard\nOr because a lot of these races are happening in the primaries and we don't really have competitive elections at the statewide level of Michigan we're a lot of people talking about even if they're\nThe of fish all that is there um representative as the party they leg they're much more extreme than what they would like to see\nAnd so I think that in Michigan in particular people have just had enough we feel like our government's doing a lot of overreach and on a help restore some transparency in the system especially for consistently ranked one of the least transparent states when it comes to transparency in government\nUm and that's the biggest thing we heard while you're doing this town halls is a lot of people saying you know I don't know why these lines are being drawn than eight years later some emails coming coming out a talking directly about how these lines were drawn to guarantee one party an advantage or another\nAnd people are tired of it they want to be looked at as having our politicians accountable to us and not special interests um what's been really cool to is that you see a lot of families who have joined voters not politicians to volunteer together even for my family it did work\nI'm happy that Thanksgiving Day via your family yeah yeah I've got five hundred signatures and is ...\nStill the election so it's really exciting I mean you see a lot of people who are like you know there's nothing that we agree on but I really like working on this issue because", "show_name": "Kathleen Dunn", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "08"}
