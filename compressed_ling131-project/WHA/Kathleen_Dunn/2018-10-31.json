A. M. U. dot org and they get to a few more of your comments Laura is in Goshen, Indiana\nLaura emailed Trump as the vanguard of our worst angels is effectively sounding the horn to release previously restrained prejudices latent in some Americans\nHate is now fair game at high volume what they call the end of political correctness is the end of civility and democracy missing McCain and Obama now you don't know what you've got till it's gone and it's going\nHow do you buy Rick I Wonder if you could respond to that comment I Wonder if what Laurie is saying in a way takes a little of the pressure off of President Trump in so far as he didn't create these views he happened to have tapped into them but you can tap into something that wasn't already there\nWell I think that's a completely fair position I mean you know the United states has had a long problem with white supremacy and racism and legally oppressed you know parts of its own population for centuries\nSo that that it's legitimate to say that this kind of hate has been there\nI Will say that the work we do at the Southern Poverty Law Center found a great escalation and the number of hate groups for example on line hate rhetoric particular lean during the years that Obama was in office as an African American he very much a\nSet off white supremacist who were unhappy with him being elected to the highest office\nAnd the Internet itself has allowed this kind of material to proliferate\nRadicalized people you know it's allowed to be shared in a way that wasn't the case in prior errors so we have a lot more of it around and that's certainly something Trump has tapped into\nNick how do you see it ah there's no question that there is a hyper polarization in American politics and I think it's important to also recognize that something is going on internationally when you look at Europe a there is a larger\nKind of breakdown of a post World war two consensus um you know in general throughout through the developed world and certainly in Western Europe and North America\nA Trump did not create that he isn't happening it and he's exploiting it to his political ah aims\nWe need a a tremendous reset I think in American political discourse and this is not a I'm not even talking about the rhetoric of hate per se um of polarization of opposition at this point according to Gallup about twenty six percent of people\nIn America identify as Republican about twenty seven or twenty percent identified as Democrats these are historic lows as was noted before there is a historically low level of trust and confidence in the government and other ...\nCome up with a a political rhetoric of public rhetoric actually that is\nI'm not a you know that is not based on demonization polarization and again you know Trump Trump bears a certain core responsibility as president of the United states because he is not simply a politician he is also on some level uh he should be leading the discussion in a way that has more productive than he is\nBut he's also not the only one are you doing this um [noise]\nAnd um the other thing to think about though is\nWhat is the distinction between rhetoric and action um and get them when we we live in a vine the society that is filled with a lot of a fantasy violence whether we're talking about games whether we're talking about rhetoric et cetera but in general crimes are going down and violence is going down so again\nRecognizing that rhetoric is one thing in reality is another I think is you know it was the starting point of any conversation about this but I Do think we need to reset and that it needs to ah it needs to move away from polarization but this is much much bigger than Donald Trump I Wonder though Nick\nHow much power we give the words that are set especially in the political sphere I mean anyone who thinks that and I I Know you're not saying that words have zero power but ... who who minimize the power of words needs to go back and read the declaration of independence those words your weapons for sure and they led to a war\nAh you know yeah I I you know I I agree completely with that and and I realized that I you know or maybe it's a slippery position where I'm saying you know simultaneously that words matter in rhetoric matters but also that we need you know what what are we going to do about that so I guess is it is another way of coming to this question of\nTrump's rhetoric is ridiculous or it as hate filled it is garbage I mean it is and it you know it's been now uh we we can go on and on that doesn't get us any closer to figuring out how do how do we have a better conversation about politics about places where we need to\nReach a consensus and and then it knocked policies that actually work for the benefit of of\nPeople I Do want to talk a little bit more going forward a little later in the conversation about what next steps might look like next so we'll we'll circle back to that Jennifer mochi a number of people\nHave commented on the role of the press of various media outlets that I Will try hard not to use the term as a media\nBecause there are so many different kinds of media out there will try to be a specific as we can and and thanks to those of you who've commented who have been specific who've mentioned specific networks or specific people that is extremely helpful so keep that up\nLet me get to a few of your comments about various media outlets in various press outlets\nCheryl tweeted the largest responsibility belongs to the twenty four seven media and those who absorb commentary an opinion as if it were factual news that President much like Andrew Jackson stands up to the press should he just let the Ninety percent negative coverage go we all need to be personally responsible\nMod asks why does he get so much airtime\nAnd Jim Wright's why hasn't anyone address the years of conditioning the public has received from talking heads such as Rush Limbaugh Glenn Beck Alex Jones et cetera\nThey have permeated our society and uh finally elected their leader which only embolden them\nJennifer before you react to that sweet of comments I should note that Glenn Beck in recent years has tried to walk back some of his rhetoric and has as publicly apologized in his words for for taking some of the rhetoric too far but I Do wonder Jennifer what your senses of how much of a of a role various media outlets plan\nThis ... question and I think that and there's a little bit of a historical they take care of that and ... my answer here and in part of that is a reciprocal role that used to exist between the president and the press and\nA there was a mutually beneficial relationship between the presidency and the press a largely because they needed each other the press needed the president for information and the president needed depressed because the president needed to disseminate that information and get their message out and that relationship has fractured and\nThat's largely due to um cable news and social media and the fact that we all now have this platform to disseminate and circulate information including the president\nAnd and so information circulates in a very different way than it did twenty thirty fifty years ago um which is really fractured this relationship between the press and the president and Trump has been able to take advantage of that\nAre in a way that that previous presidents had tried to do but Trump has really done much better for worse job depending on your perspective and and so a Trump is completely mastered the news cycle and the way that\nIs especially cable news has been complicit I think in\nIn amplifying his message\nAt you know on Twitter he has followers and many of them are bought a but most of Americans aren't on Twitter but we see his tweets everywhere right\nAnd because those messages are amplified and that is Trump using the bully pulpit the good pope that of the presidency and also taking advantage of all of these other social media opportunities\nUm and and so in this case a lot of times the press is been guilty of amplifying this message is when they shouldn't have\n... I Wonder how much you put the blame on various media outlets versus the president I feel like at this point we're kind of used to the drum beat of opinionated commentators on television and radio it's almost a trope in our culture I mean\nYou are listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio joined the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

I Wonder how you view this in terms of\nThe the way that the president denounces violence at least at a statement and then makes comments that are vitriolic thereafter how do you see this\nYeah it's a great question and and I'd also like to address the question of responsibility and if we have a moment that after answer and so Trump will say the thing that somebody has written for him to say he will read from the teleprompter when he's forced to do that\nAnd that that isn't his natural inclination and so I have tracked in fact the way that Trump uses denial and in these situations when people do try to hold him accountable and suggest that he has some responsibility for something\nSo for example during the campaign and a group of white nationalist at the Daily Stormer decided that they would avenge and what they thought was a bad a article that was written by Julie ...\nHate messages and death threats and you know did all kinds of terrible things to her\nUm and when they asked Trump about it he said he didn't know anything about it so his first strategy was to deny any knowledge and then they said well and you know this is on CNN they said well but you know do you have a message about this now you you clearly know about it I'm telling you about it\nAnd then he denies association with the people right or he says I don't know I don't know those people and he says what fans of mine you know are these are these fans who've done this\nUm and then he does a third thing which is to wonder what um the journalist Julie ... had done to deserve this hatred you know did she write this terrible article that is full of you know lives about me\nUm and then to accuse other people have doing the same kinds of things right to an appeal to hypocrisy um and if you look at when Trump is responding to these situations where people are trying to hold him accountable for his violent rhetoric\nAnd he follows that same pattern he denies knowledge of it he denies association of it and maybe praises the people who've done it he wonders what the person did to deserve it and then he finally uses to quote ... which is an appeal to ... to say oh everybody else does this it's not just me\nUm and that is classic for Trump he cannot be held accountable [noise]\nThis is why I call him a demagogue a demagogue is an an accountable leader and that's a historic definition deriving from ancient Athens\nUm and and we're talking about you know whether Trump is responsible and we can say that he's responsible but I'm telling you Trump does not accept responsibility he won't take that responsibility um and admit that he in fact has been\nWrong I Wonder how effective do Jennifer's in a situation like this to refer blaming you for this or just kind of wondering what your take is ordered to refer to President Trump\nAs a demagogue I mean she is the do we elected president of the United states of America she won the electoral college and when you call him a demagogue\nYou call all the people who looked at him supporters enablers of a demagogue at a time when something like this happens that's got to make it harder to have to cut it to be we need to have about\n... above refining the civil discourse\nSure it's an accurate term so um if you look it up in the Oxford English dictionary and the lady you'll see that the first step in addition of a demagogue is positive for neutral it says that it's a leader of the people which is a the etymology of the word\nWho defends the rights of the people against the other parts of the state the second definition of demagogue is a leader who uses polarizing propaganda for their own personal gain\nDonald Trump is a demagogue in both senses of the word\nFor his fans for his followers and his voters the ones who won't leave him who will defend him at all costs they defend him because they see him as a heroic demagogue they see him as defending their rights against the other parts of the state that they believe are corrupt\nEveryone else who sees him as a demagogue in the bad sense of the word sees him as using polarizing propaganda for his own game\nFor the use of the word to use a word accurate though it may be is it helpful\nThink so [laughter] it's an analytic point we can't understand what Donald Trump is doing if we can't understand what he's doing an unaccountable leader is a danger in any political community but is that actually in a democracy\nPolitical scientists and historians who are concerned about the health of American democracy people who are charging democratic erosion and how democracies die they point to the kind of language that he uses they point to the authoritarian tendencies of\nYou know kill people or change the constitution to all of these things all of these authoritarian tendencies and which are grounded in his language frankly I'm as as evidence of democratic erosion\nHeidi a wonder if you could respond to one of the concerns that I think are a number of people on the political right have raised which is this idea that the rhetoric is too hot all the way around that the political discourse\nAs just heat it up the in both directions many on the right has pointed to the left\nSaying that they use similar rhetoric to the rhetoric that President Trump has been using but they don't get cold out for quite as much here is a sample of some of what they're referring to\nGet his time for us as Democrats to be as tough as they are going to be dedicated as they are to be committed to say on the show always do when you don't when they go low [noise]\nBagel ... became [noise]\nThat you cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough\nTo win back the house and or the Senate that twin civility can start again but until then the only thing that the Republicans seemed to\nRecognize and respect is strength\nThat of course was former secretary of state and democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton preceded by democratic California congresswoman Maxine Waters and first was former attorney general Eric Holder Heidi what about the ... across the political spectrum how does that factor into into our current climate\nWell there's no question that there was courses as well on the left\nBut I think it's a little ridiculous to try to say sort of like Donald Trump did after Charlottesville but there's some sort of equivalent here the real nastiness is coming from the right and it's coming on the basis of attacks on

done by the south [noise]\nJohn Carpenter is a master of horror movies end of the soundtracks that bring them to life his latest project as a return to the film that launched his career\nHalloween John Carpenter directed and scored the original back in Nineteen Seventy eight and he is the composer on the twenty Eighteen sequel which is in theaters now John Carpenter welcome to want to thank you for having me you've been away from the Halloween movie franchise for some time now what made you decide to come back\nOn his producer Hollywood producer Jason Blum a convinced me to come back\nI knew that one was a a a sequel was going to be made\nAs I Know a Malik the cod he's the\nThe son of the man who put up the money for the original Halloween so I knew there was a sequel coming but Jason bomb a talk to me and they said you know where it's going to be made with or without us so why don't we meaning he he and I\nI'm getting bored and try to help it be good so nobody had put it to me that way before so I thought that's a great great thing\nJason Blum spend doing some pretty interesting things with horror movies lately what what do you make of where the genre stance today\nAs in good shape\nBut it's always in good shape horror has been was cinema since the very beginning and I have a feeling\nA it will be with us until doomsday just because everybody's scared of something that were all born afraid we all understand fear and so it's really fun to go to a horror movie with your girlfriend or your significant other and cuddle and scream and so forth\nBut was it like for you not being in the directors chair for the twenty Eighteen version of Halloween you were involved in the film but what about watching someone else direct this movie it was a relief\nBecause I don't have to suffer the stress and anxiety that directors suffer and that's a worst profession in the world other than being a coal miner\nThe worst other than a cold I'll come on\nNow well it could be worse I guess you could be a slaughterhouse type measures that you're right ah it's not the worst now\nUh when when things were a it's great to be a director when they don't work it's it's really garbage\nWhat do you think movie fans least understand about what it takes to direct a movie especially a horror movie\nWell what are they at least understand let me think a a\nDirectors are responsible for all the central elements of a movie if it's supposed to be funny they're responsible for the humor of it if it's an adventure and so forth and so on so director of a horror movies think of it this way horror and comedy or a lot\nLike 'cause it's turning it's all about timing and it's all about when\nThings happen and how they unfold and it's more complex than than people assume but um people just think that horror as a lot of Gore in obvious violence and it's not\n[noise] yeah see I I I hear you on that it's an interesting analogy between horror and comedy I'm not big on Gore I Do not personally do well Ron blood and Gore at all but a good suspenseful movie like I can I can hang with that 'cause that's that's a satisfying experience what what do you think\nIt takes to make that kind of timing in a horror movie work\nOr a movie work these are secrets that only the Brotherhood no so I Can't\nOh come on you can tell me something\nWell look to make it really simple\nUh there are no rules for any horror film\nThe horror horror movies come out of the story and horror is every\nAction think of it that way not a genre necessarily so that's a reaction to things and that if the story is is unfolding than you used the story tell it to a a a set up your scares set up things they're\nFrightening for the audience he said the word earlier suspense that's what you if you get the audience in suspense than you could scare them\nSo maybe the key is having a story it's got enough of the right elements to make me feel that suspense so that they're there can be that pay off so that there can be the scare is that it that\nIs correct you got it what about the music you contributed music to this film and and the music to the original in Nineteen Seventy eight what does it take to make that kind of music work for a scary movie\nWhat does it take it takes a certain amount of talent and ability to play musical instruments and feeling for ...\nThat's what it takes now were you always musically inclined when you put the original movie Halloween together Nineteen Nineteen Seventy eight or wasn't something that kind of came together unexpectedly\nNo I I grew up in a musical household my father was a music professor he was a [noise]\nA virtuoso violin player and he had taught a college level music courses at a university where I grew up I grew up with music in the house all the time classical music listening to it\nHe decided when I was about eight years old that I should learn to play the violin there was only one problem with that and I had no talent other than that it was a great idea but I moved on from the violent to the piano and tar and other things I picked a lotta stuff up\nWere there any particular influences that you draw on when you made the music for the original Halloween or that you've drawn on over the years\nYes I'm all classical a\nMovie composers and classical ... ah musicians and rock and roll I'd get influenced everywhere\nWhat about the timing I did the theme to the original Halloween is not in a plain old for for your time it's in five four time it's an odd kind of time's signature was what drew you to that\nMy father taught me five four time uh when I was Thirteen he tried it on the I had a pair of bongos I got the Christmas I taught me five four on that and I thought it was unusual just straightforwardly unusual timing so\nAdapted that time's signature during the piano piece and their ...\nWas speaking to John ... the director of dozens of horror classics including probably some of your favorites Halloween to
