I I think it says a lot when you say that the minimum wages is laid down by Congress is almost irrelevant to the real economy because seven dollars and twenty five cents\nJust doesn't go anywhere in most states in most localities and yet to have Congress advocating laws that are essentially irrelevant to how people really live\nA is a remarkable in ... and notable state of affairs necessary Europe proponent of a living wage and I and I read that tweet from one of our listeners who said why have a minimum wage why not index it and essentially to a real life now what is the difference between a minimum wage and and what's become known as a living wage\nRight well MIT has a living wage calculator where you can go on there and type in where you live and it'll be allowed in number that's based on looking at the\nCost of local transportation food housing and other basic needs I looked up on the city I live in the district of Columbia they said uh the living wage there I was Seventeen dollars an hour but that's for a full time work\nAnd I want to point out that a huge ... additional problem in addition to the low wages in this country is the increase in security if work how many people are working part time at Walmart it's half\nOf their employees are part time workers and then there's the temporary workers in the subcontracted workers you know Amazon Fifteen dollars an hour is not going to apply to their\nA contractor says the increased ... precarious ness of work that that's also a big problem it despite are low unemployment we still have so many people working every day for poverty wages\nI'm Paul even though Fifteen dollars an hour is twice the current federal minimum as you mentioned we heard from a lot of listeners who say in this economic climate or even Fifteen doesn't go very far let's hear from some of them\nWhen all is higher than the minimum wage and I tried to workers but when I catch\nUp on land a minimum wage that's never know\nAnd as a college graduate with a bachelor's degree and student loans I already make Fifteen dollars an hour at a fulltime job and have to supplement with at least one part time job at all times\nI think there needs to be some consideration on regional differences because I can assure you that Fifteen dollars an hour in South Carolina goes much further than Fifteen dollars an hour in California\nI work another job besides my full time job and uh so I Am kind of like we can buy unfortunately I have lots of credit card debt and the result and uh actually like Eighteen dollars going out at twenty four a fulltime job would probably be closer to my but\nPaul we hear from a lot of listeners there who are living on minimum wage and for many many more this has been a big issue in Congress a workers who work for big companies can't afford healthcare don't have insurance wind up relying on state or federal public assistance\nTo make up the difference and that suggests that all of us in some way are subsidizing low wages\nYou're you're exactly right and ... and ... are your callers I mean\nActually if you look at cost of living data you see that in all fifty states or a single worker will need at least Fifteen dollars an hour to cover the basics and just a couple of years\nAnd in the high cost states the your your your listeners were flogging or workers with children will need even more than Fifteen dollars an hour we have a report on our website by my uh pinto PIN Tio on this with the with the numbers for all fifty states and uh\nIt really highlights how Fifteen is really a base\nThere like a you know you know in New York and New Jersey to this week we're airport workers are getting a raise to Nineteen dollars an hour\nIn hotel workers are are striking around the country in the higher costs cities demanding twenty five dollars an hour or so you know your workers or your your listeners are right about about about what you know as a practical matter if you do the math what would it ... individuals need to to to get by especially in the higher cost regions\nAnd as a result you know a lot of ... of of companies big and small are relying on our taxpayer funded safety net for support you know more than a hundred and fifty billion dollars a year a safety net programs go to a workers in low paying jobs and you know these are good programs and we should have them but we need\nYou know major employers to do their part to pay a decent wage of at least Fifteen dollars an hour and then to supplement that with a with work supports in order to help bring bring workers up to a a a basic level\nNow let's hear some of the other side of the Seth writes to us on Facebook when I worked for Walmart we were all excited when they raised our wages to ten dollars and fifty cents but then they cut ours to barely twenty hours a week then told us if we even had to have an open schedule we would get even less I'm skeptical of individual companies\nThat are raising wages and we received also a lot of calls from people who were concerned that raising the federal minimum wage to say Fifteen dollars an hour could wind up backfiring on workers\nI'm all for making you know Fifteen dollars an hour at the job I'm at now I work at ... or ... in the mall but I find that a lot of people\nAre a lot of employers if they're raising a hourly wage or just cutting down hours which in the end it either arrows I'm from the tree is a wage or in some cases you make ...\nI Am opposed to raising it to Fifteen dollars an hour simply because I don't think businesses will take that last they will raise the price is the standard of living raise and\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio joined the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

I I Want to talk about a fight going on in Washington DC where we happened to be in a one eight studios are WHM you enter the world [laughter] unfortunately increasingly so but there has been a very important wage fight going on on the local level not in Washington is a world knows it but D.C as locals know\nThere was a ballot initiative where voters in DC voted to raise the minimum wage for tipped workers a bar backs bartenders waiters and waitresses people who work in restaurants primarily\nAnd there was a big fight a lot of pushback it looks like grass roots resistance and then we found out that a lot of the money for the pushback was indeed coming from organizing interests for restaurant owners of the American restaurant association local chapters and others um voters voted to say yes you have to raise your minimum wage restaurants bars\nAnd now the city council here in the district of Columbia has decided that voters were wrong and they are in the process of voting\nThis very day to overturn the will of local D.C voters on this issue or what does this fight here in D.C say about the state of wages especially for tipped workers people who might get paid by their employer I don't know five bucks an hour because they make up the rest in in ones and hopefully five ...\nThe way I see it this week the living wage movement took three or four steps forward with the Amazon announcement on Fifteen\nAnd they took one big step back with the DC Council voting to repeal um that the will of the voters to eliminate and in a gradual way this sub minimum wage for tipped workers\nI'm sad really than minimum wage protect workers is two dollars and Thirteen cents since then stuck there for a couple of decades here in DC it's three dollars and eighty nine cents\nTechnically if you don't make enough tips to bring that a wage up to that the um the local minimum your employer is supposed to make up the difference\nThat pretty much never happens I used to work in the restaurant industry and I've talked to a lot of restaurant workers that pretty much never happens and so we have a workforce of restaurant servers primarily women many women of color\nOr at at jobs where people face ramping sexual harassment they're vulnerable because they're having to do whatever customers say to get those tips because without the tips they're back down to really a A N E L a wage that doesn't amount to anything so\nPeople in the district um voted to get rid of this two tier system um the industry launched an increase\nUp everywhere in the city saying save our tips to try to make people think that this had something to deal with banning tips it did not it was clearly beat beyond a local issue this was a national showdown between the restaurant industry and people who are trying to get a fair wage for this on their little sector of the workforce\nMichael Saltsman and what did you see at play here I think we're familiar with workers versus management in a fight like this uh the DC Council voting to overturn the will of the voters is is remarkable but what about the economics of it\nWell actually so I I think in this case you had a situation where the interests of workers and management were actually very clearly aligned I mean there was a sixteen hour hearing\nBefore the council voted on this this bill to repeal the initiative initiative Seventy seven I'm I was at the hearing I testified at two thirty in the morning it went until three twenty in the morning um and the number of employees who showed up to say\nThis is going to be harmful to us you need to repeal this far out numbered those where they're supportive and I just want to take a step back to I mean it was mentioned earlier that a living wage and in DC is is is Seventeen dollars an hour I mean tipped employees in DC uh according to the bureau of Labor Statistics earn with their tips about Eighteen Nineteen dollars an hour or so you have people who are\nAlready doing quite well and what happened a few years ago as a business and labor in DC came together and said okay we're we want to go to a Fifteen dollar minimum wage in regardless of what you think on the merits of that\nWe're also going to raise the tips may win among wage in that case up to about five dollars an hour and and they did that because they heard from tipped employees who said\nWe want to keep the tip credit we want our tips to count as income\nThere was one group of New York based group called rock that didn't like that and so they they came in and they had a lot of money that come in to try and put this issue\nOn the ballot and what happened was yes the restaurant industry um was opposed this ballot measure but you had a massive grassroots outpouring from employees hundreds of who showed up for instance to an event with council chairman Phil Mendelson to say\nWe don't want this and I think it's part of a bigger movement of employees that you say you say grass roots and I'm I'm sure that you're right but grass roots are astro turf we see so much grass roots in the area of wages and minimum wage is only to find out that the grassroots workers who are fighting against\nIncreases in wages are are backed by business entering so actually I I think it's I think that that talking point I think that's been used by proponents is is is a little bit um demeaning to the workers who who came forward um because of the testimony they gave it you know one forty five in the morning or the people who got up\nA at Franklin hall and said you know what this is going to be harmful to me this is going to be harmful to my industry\nDon't try and save me I'm not asking for it I mean I think that the the the the notion I think that these people are just doing that um because they're sort of put up to it or somehow that they're not real employees\nUm I I think is kind of insulting to what they're trying to do and Phil Mendelson that chairman Phil Mendelson to chair the DC Council made an interesting point um when he got us to talk about this which is a he said\nI have heard from countless employees who tell me this is not good for them I have heard from almost nobody who wants who wants to keep it and he said people can come to me privately they can email me this is not an issue of their owners being intimidated he said that the grassroots on this in support of it was silent he called them the silent grassroots and I think that's\nThat's indicative of where the passion was on this issue let's pull back from\nThe district the district of Columbia the local D.C back out to the nation at large and so many of you won a listeners\nHad been reaching out to us Nina posts on Facebook I'm In a precarious position if my wages go up I won't be eligible for Medicaid so it's a wash or worst for me we talked about free riders and how many workers who get minimum wage is wind up on public assistance\nAnd Randy in Tulsa emails advocates are correct Amazon Walmart McDonalds and the other giants can afford Fifteen dollars for a minimum wage but the local donut shop the mom and pop\nIt's just another blow against main street\nNo sir I Want to talk to you about income inequality and we're a minimum wage fits into this we hear so much about the growing wealth gap in massive income inequality in this country we talk about the shrinking of the middle class but at the low end of the pay scale can increases in minimum wage actually provide\nAny real equity or is it just a drop in the bucket in a world where the top one percent on fifty percent\nIt's meaningful but in some ways it as a drop in the bucket you know a couple of years ago two of my colleagues calculated that three men the three wealthiest men in America including Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos Warren Buffett and Bill Gates have combined wealth that is greater than the combined wealth of the bottom half of the country\nAnd today that's an understatement because Japanese as well as increased so much but nevertheless dramatize is just how extreme the wealth gap is and I think there's a lot of interest in\n'em adding to the fight for Fifteen efforts to look not just that the low end of the wage scale but also the top end what can we do to prevent these really obscene levels of income and wealth concentration at the top that are so damaging to our economy our democracy\nNot to mention just a moral outrage and in a country that that is so wealthy\nAnd so I'm really excited about a new tool we have for doing this this year for the first time in history publicly held companies have to report the gap between their CEO\nAnd their work or pay the numbers coming out are staggering at Walmart it's a thousand to one at at McDonalds it's three thousand to one and we can build on that information to incentivize companies to to narrow gaps and just the one quick example Portland, Oregon\nIntroduced the world's first tax penalty on companies that pay their CEO\nMore than one hundred times their median worker pay this year they're going to put the revenue from that into homeless services and it'll hit companies like Wells Fargo and\nAnd Wal Mart that do business in the city of Portland I think ideas like that are going to start to spread like wildfire now that we have this information about gaps within specific company\nAnd an interesting set of proposals at a time when populism is strong\nIn our political culture both on the left and on the ride and workers voices and income inequality becoming a much more important part of the conversation you certainly see a lot of pushback from corporate America I think Bernie would be down Alexandria a cast your Cortez in New York would they do this strong\n\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by

A. M. U. dot org and we had been hearing from so many of you want to listeners primarily women\nBut not exclusively Petra emailed to say I am so tired of people equating my anger with the insanity\nFriends laugh at my posted insinuate that I've lost it and you know what I have I have lost my inability to be quiet in the face of gross injustice\nAnd Joan emailed us I'm sixty five and I was in college with the first feminist resurgence is the world the usa ready for women's anger that's like asking African Americans when will the world be ready for their anger the answer never\nPower doesn't see without a fight don't even ask the question the question itself\nIs demanding and peg in Traverse City email this on a conservative woman that is angry that someone could be assumed guilty based on unproven allegations I'm angry at the assumption that all American women or antique having a pro choice liberal and progressive I'm a proud American woman who's also conservative pro life pro Kavanaugh\nNow Rebecca Traister you started to paint a picture of the history of women who've gotten angry and made their mark their anger is not always shown in the same form as somebody yelling in the face of a senator like Jeff Flake on live TV but anger nonetheless and Brittany Cooper you've written a book\nAbout finding your power in rage uh tell me a little bit about that theme in how the story fits into the moment [noise]\nA shore so part of what happens is that women are told 'em as many of your listeners say that to be angry it's to be irrational\nAnd I had a student when I was a graduate instructor confront me um and said to me that she loved to listen to me lecture because my lectures were filled with what she called the most eloquent rage ever and it was a wakeup call for me as someone who had to run away from the angry black woman stereotype my whole life\nBecause I didn't want to be discredited as a black woman moving through predominantly white institution\nAnd so my student who was a young black woman thought and be a kind\nOf authenticity and she helped me to realize that my anger wasn't keeping me from doing my job are showing up offering\nQuality lectures are material or material but that it was actually helping me to do a better job and so in that moment I made a connection that I've been encouraging other women to make which is ... knowledge that we have the right to our rage and some reject ideas that say that when we're angry about legitimate injustices\nThat this in some way make irrational or make far clean illegitimate and when we then begin to own that anger doesn't mean that we would come destructive or harmful it means\nThat we happen to the energy and power and we start to use that energy and power to build the kind of world we want to see\nAnd more women need to give themselves permission to do that I've given myself permission to do that I'm at in this moment I Am on the front lines of saying for women outrage have the potential if we own it and if we don't apologize for\nUs to change this very scary a trajectory of this historical moment we have a lot to be afraid about\nA we have a lot to be angry about opposite that anger is the catalyst for the able to do something about the things we see\nNow let's move from the Senate committee hearing room\nAnd the hallways around the Senate um and even the books that are esteemed authors have Britain onto the tennis court and the U.S open for another moment\nThat American shared within the last couple of weeks Serena Williams in her match against Naomi Osaka at the U. S. open here's a cut I'll bring you back there to refresher memory of anger on the court Serena Williams infamous exchange with umpire Carlos Ramos\n\n... shared this moment along with the rest of America us arena is a champion and one of the most famous black women in America somebody who got angry and somebody found who found that anger or weaponized against her\n[noise] Ah yes I think that what we saw in their response was everything that Brittany in Tribeca and I have been talking about it was interesting because\nThere are so many egregious examples of men behaving in the same way but not facing the same policing or penalties mean she she was a defined that was levied against her is the highest ever for a verbal abuse in the history of the u._s. open I Believe\nAnd so in that moment there were two very distinct sponsors of the responses of the people that really just wanted to see her in isolation acting\nWith this man but then there were people who really looked at that exchange within the much broader context of the power dynamics in the moment in history in the context and the legacy of discrimination within the sport that she has faced\nAnd so I think that one thing that has been unexplored in the bigger conversation about that is the central and pivotal role of title nine in understanding women as\nLeaders or as people who have the right to defend themselves or engage in public conflict\nUm what she was really doing was I'm asserting her right to defend herself and to have dignity in the moment not be accused the way that she was accused\nAnd with sports I think it's important to note that we now have not one but two generations of women so a generation of role models who have benefited from title nine and the lessons of title nine ... we tend to think of it as\nUm athletics but it is really about leadership and the ability to act together um in teams to manage conflict to make the nuance distinctions between being assertive and being aggression and be aggressive and being angry\nI think we're seeing the ... of of that now in our political life\nSo there were some pushback though to Serena Williams behavior on the court and the reaction to it even from within the tennis world a Brittany Cooper I I don't know if you saw Martina Navratilova as response to this arena Williams episode a couple of days later but she wrote an op ed after the U.S open and she said marching speaking now\nSaid yes women are treated differently yes there are double standards\nBut Serena was wrong her encore behavior was inappropriate paraphrasing just because men region umpires and act like babies on the court doesn't make it right and a champion like Serena should not emulated\nI'm Martina Navratilova was wrong\nOr she did this thing that women are conditioned to do which is rather than use it as a moment of solidarity she tried police arenas conduct\nI'm as a lifelong tennis fan I'm I Am livid but Martina Navratilova reminded me that until this moment most white women in tennis have not been allies of the Williams sisters\nUm do when I watch tennis with my friends were African American and us fans we often talk about watching these matches on you because of the micro aggressions that come from white women who are often knocking at the Williams sisters and having things to say but let me also add\nThat one of the things that was most infuriating about watching the way in which Ramos treated Serena\nWas that there was a broader context to her anger\nNot only did he accused her of cheating but this all came out on the heels of reports that members of the USDA had been showing up to her house\nUnannounced and testing her over and over again on grounds that maybe she was doping even though she has come clean on every drug tested even those statistics show that they were testing her double the amount that they were testing any other players on the women's side and so she had been subjected to repeated and dignity\nAnd then as the best tennis player of her generation and perhaps ever she has a referee\nWho accuses her cheating as he's won more grand plan that any woman other than Margaret Court and any woman in the open era and that is indicative of the kinds of theory that we are talking about the way that women are disrespected daily had\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio joined the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

Joshua Johnson we're talking about the power of women's anger in the current moment in America\nWhere I'm Talking with Rebecca Traister for New York magazine and the cut author of good and mad Bernie Cooper associate professor at Rutgers University and author of the new book eloquent rage and also ... director of the women's media center speech project and author of the new book\nRage becomes her now I read an email from Karen at the end of the last segment that said she was hurt disappointed and angry wounded about the treatment of Hillary Clinton in the twenties sixteen campaign and I want to go there because Hillary Clinton is one prominent famous\nWoman well known for navigating the shoals at how women are supposed to express themselves in public now Hillary Clinton has a history of being\nVery careful and very deliberate mindful of appearing angry or emotional she's been at it for thirty five years in America and in fact it was news in the two thousand and eight campaign I remember this when she shed a tear in New Hampshire one tier and it was at the top of CNN for like a new cycle and a half\nSaying that the twenty sixteen presidential campaign I'm Hillary Clinton in fact was was tone police listen\nI regret deeply\nHow angry [noise]\nThe tone of the campaign became [noise]\n\nNot your fault says one audience member when when Hillary Clinton very deliberately and that you know Hillary fashion says I regret how nasty the campaign became a ... just this moment has clearly struck a chord Rebecca Traister who's\nWatching here in the studio with me out on strike you [laughter] know she was off as she she was very very careful in her choice of words there to even as she was commenting on it I mean\nI think it was um it was ridiculous that this woman was called an authentic well being held to the standard\nOf care full control in her voice and her facial the parents and her body\nAnd her motive expression I mean the two candidates um that were her primary opponents for Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders could act in unhinged ways they could show up looking unkempt they could pound ...\nYou know they could turn red in the face and as men they could leverage this enormous tide of populist anger and that was a gender card nobody wrote about that as a gender card right there were all of these conversations about\nI'm Hillary Clinton as there often are with women because we associate gender with women and pretend men don't have a gender\nUm and and so they could do that and she couldn't leverage that political power and we saw that over and over and over again throughout the campaign\nRecord ... is so right about this and I'm In fact the thing that the irony of what we were told about Hillary Clinton both Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump or congratulated by the political pressed for their particular skill in channeling the anger of their supporters this was their gift they were able to give voice to this frustration\nAnd we were repeatedly told that some of the authenticity of Hillary was that she couldn't convey anger and passion and yet\nEvery time she spoke too close to a microphone somebody said you're yelling your shrill um she really got directives at one point Joe Scarborough she was giving an ... a a speech the night she won a primary and Joe Scarborough sad smile is if it was like some cat color on the street smile more\nUm she was told that regularly\nAnd I think that that's again an example of of not having that tool to wield she also has done remarkable writing and talking herself\nIn instances where I've interviewed her and she's written about it in our own\nMemoir of the campaign about the process of not using that anger she writes particularly about that second debate where Donald Trump came up behind her and kind of loomed behind her and how menacing and aggressive his body language was and how during\nThe debate a presidential debate she was doing internal calculations thinking can I turn around and confront this guy she said she thought about turning around and saying get away from me but that she was thinking no no no\nThat's gonna redound negatively to me that's gonna make me look bad it's gonna hurt me strategically and the debate and so she didn't and one of the things that that little story tells us is about\nHow much energy women expend\nModulating considering strategizing thinking tactically about how to use their voice how to suppress their voice how to channel their anger how to swallow their anger what to do in order to be rhetorically effective\nAnd and I think that that's something that that all three of us who are writing about and thinking about is the amount of time and energy women spend doing this kind of maneuver\nAre angry expression is now I Want to I Want to talk a little bit in the last ... section of the show that we have about where some of this anger\nGoes because this is a moment in America and let's be realistic moments have a way of fading they just do and and so I'm interested in where this goes when\nMaybe the cameras in all of the writers who aren't Rebecca Traister and Brittany Cooper are are not as interested anymore you know in a in a couple of years I think that might happen and I want to know where this goes now we've been hearing from so many wanting listeners I Want to play you another mash up of some of the women's voices who've been reaching out to us about how they're feeling\nMy name's Aaron I'm calling from Lancaster, Pennsylvania Sarah from Cincinnati when I let my anger above all over and I get really angry out loud it\nIt really doesn't do much good I find that if I express a strong opinion or even just a bit of discomfort with something I'm perceived as being angry are overreacting women yelling even in this day and age that very acceptable men don't seem to have that same problem and I'm\nStarting to feel like maybe it's not just a personal issue I'm dealing with with going to be nice and and uh and keep our mouth shut however\nI Am so angry and so angry right now maybe women all over the place you're dealing with it I'm turning my anger into action hasn't helped to feel like I'm not alone but still pretty discouraging I think that's what when they have to do we have to take that anger hold onto it and that's how we're going to take back this country\nWe're hearing from when he listeners women who it feels like there's a scene there are transferring\nSome of their personal rage I'm sure a lot of it's in in personal life not just political life or cultural life but into action taking action in the streets taking action maybe at the ballot box we got this tweet from Tracy in Jacksonville I'm One of the thousands of women using their frustration to run for office\nI'm running for the Florida House district Fifteen I Am focused on\nMy determination to be a voice for all and focus on issues important to Jacksonville families Tracey as one candidate who says that this moment of anger is very important for her motivation of Brittany Cooper I Want to talk about where\nThis goes in terms of maybe the midterms that might be the most immediate effect I'm I none of us knows exactly how that vote is going to turn out but it seems like any\nPollster or political analyst worth anything is looking down and what they call the cross tabs and noticing that women are mad women are going to vote and women are going to form a tidal wave in twenty Eighteen one way or the other\nAbsolutely and that is as it should be um I'm particularly heartened by\nUh the Stacey Abrams campaign down in Georgia we have the opportunity to have the first black woman governor of a state of a former slave state um the ... Presley campaign\nThey're all of these progressive campaigns that are being run and here's the thing we've been seeing that since twenty sixteen we had a wave of\nA progressive as sort of radically progressive black mayors in the deep south and so one of the things that I Want to challenge folks to do as we think in this moment is to actually look at what people of color are doing not just women but particularly black women in these elections the ways that we have that channeling our anger\nOn for decades and decades and that started with the way that we voted for Hillary Clinton in this most immediate political moment but to your earlier point about whether or not\nOur anger can be sustained on I think that I think that this can be sustained I think that we have to remember that the women's movement in this country do it goes through ebbs and flows that's really been a solid political project since uh depending on how you count eight thirty one or Eighteen forty eight\nSo we're we're two hundred years in a almost here and so I think you know I'm I think that there is uh\nHere and I think that as women see that on our power and our ability to frame issues the way that include them both American and take care of the most marginalized American um I", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Kathleen Dunn", "city": "Madison", "day": "03"}
