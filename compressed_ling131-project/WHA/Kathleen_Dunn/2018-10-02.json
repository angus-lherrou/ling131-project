let me get to some of your stories and comments one member of the one a text club who calls herself simply scared wrote\nI'm twenty eight and afraid of the dark it's a challenge to have sex with the man I Love without seeing terrible scenes in my head\nAnother listener emailed I couldn't listen to Dr Ford's testimony I was raped when I was Fifteen and never shared it the thought of listening to the testimony was too difficult for me to handle I Am proud of the women who are speaking out but there are others all around us who are silently coping\nBy the way we should note as we did at the top of the program a lot of what we are going to be discussing today\nHas to do with pretty Frank descriptions of sexual assault and harassment so if you'd like to listen to this program later on when you were more emotionally prepared for it away from the kids at a time maybe when you're ready to discuss it as a family you'll find the whole conversation on line at the one a dot org that's the words up the number one letter a dot org\nWithout another voice to the discussion joining us from NPR in New York is Marvin Gaye a member of the New York times editorial board Mara welcome to the program\nThanks for having me now on Saturday you wrote in the times and account of your salt and its emotional aftermath in part you wrote quote I never felt compelled to share my story before because of this so unremarkable so common because so many women have been through worse unquote\nAn unremarkable what made you think of what you had been through as unremarkable and what changed your mind\n[noise] you know for years and my friends and I have ten\nAnd colleagues as well just sharing stories swapping stories and you know in bars and and trips abroad of of ours sexual assaults of our sexual harassment\nAnd just knowing how many of my friends and have been through similar experiences somewhere on that spectrum I just you know as a journalist I never want to make it about me\nAnd so my instinct is to tell other people's stories and I'm hearing from some of my friends and colleagues\nDoctor for its testimony now I'm getting text messages about the kind of pain and they ran out of the pie TST it made me rethink my decision to to stay silent\nKen my own experience can you share with us to whatever extent you feel comfortable\nSure so um it was over a decade ago I was in college and um you know I I was at a party with a boy at who I'd had a crush on I guess for a long time I think um we both had um an interesting one another and\nWhen you drink a lot I was you know Twenty years old at the time um and he drink more than I did ah one thing led to another and we uh ended up back in his place and and we were having sex and that sex was consensual although I Would say that um it was\nA rougher frankly than I Would have expected it kind of took me by surprise\nAnd um you know suddenly all of a sudden we were actually having anal sex which I had not consented to\n'em and it was very painful and I I'm often to stop and I think eventually did I mean it felt like a lot longer for me at the time but frankly I'm you know I think ... frankly it was probably too drunk to got to know what was going on is what what I saw at the time\nAnd you know afterwards I dated him and I think now I Know that that's a very common experience but\nYou know at the time there was no nationwide conversation about these things so you really didn't realize how common that is and so I think I felt so much shame um in what had happened that I I just you know stayed silent about it until a couple of years later when I started talking to some friends\nAnd you know kind of realizing owning that experience for what it was um which which is really what helped me move on\nLast week professor Conan the Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont asked professor forward what her strongest memory was of what she accuses judge Brett Kavanaugh having done to her as a teenager here is part of what professor Ford said\nIndelible and they hit the camp this is the laughter fill up the uproar is laughter between the two [noise] and they're having fun at my expense\nProfessor can you explain for us from a neurological perspective what it is that certain aspects of assault stand out in people's memories perhaps by way of explaining what the HIPAA campuses and what it does\n[noise] um the hippocampus has a part of the brain involved in memory and um [noise]\nDoctor for it in her testimony talks about I'm being afraid she's gonna die or that he's going to kill her\nAnd the human brain has specific parts that are involved to encode fear and if you just think about it I'm\nI'm that's because fear especially in prehistoric times kept us alive um you don't want to see a lion and have to think oh is that dangerous or not should I run away you when people who can encode that ... that fear about lying and immediately react well escape and survive so I'm\nSimilarly and fear memories I'm like the memory of an assault on\nThe brain becomes hyper focused on specific details so it's really common to remember perhaps the color of the person's eyes or sound or the Muzak or like Dr Ford says the laughter because that even just hearing her talk about it really makes my heart clutch you know it's really emotional\nUm but forget other details like\nUh the house you were in or the neighborhood or the street um those aren't those are irrelevant in the moment the assault is happening um so I Hope that sort of helps explain it but it is you know brain operate\nKind of feels like when you're you know the way she describes the way he described it it feels like that experience you have when you're like watching a scary movie or you know you were walking through on it\nThat leaked out at you the kind of forced your adrenalin to rise that's what in codes that I Would have great example yes no more you said that a moment when she's mia Loren I beg your pardon Lawrence Taylor these moments than in code so intensely are there are ways to weaken the power of them in the mind or did you just kind of have to deal with them\nThose things kind of trigger those images that are super vivid how do you work through the ups or ten you\nThere are many many ways to work through those I'm\nTalking about it and getting support whether that's a therapist or a sub communities where a group or an ... a an informal group of friends can be and getting validation talking to the right people can be incredibly helpful um what we do in our empowerment self defense classes\nAre is help people find their voice and find their physical power a talk therapy can accomplish a certain amount but um as professor Conan will tell you\nThe trauma also lives in the cells of your body and um you need to have some kind of ...\nUm release of that and so mad at basically means so much is body so um we we do role plays of practicing standing up for yourself or asking for what you want and we also do hitting\nAnd um that can be that can really move the trauma through an out your body or not only reclaiming your power but you're also releasing whatever you've been through\nWe get to a few more of your stories Jennifer emailed my story involves a sexual predator who happened to be my boss ultimately I was raped on a business trip to get away I had to move to another state and begin

terrorists than toning we got many messages in our inbox as I said here's one more that came into us\nMy name is Linda and I'm calling from central Virginia forty two years ago I was raped by my brother and it was only last year\nThat I was able to acknowledge that and begin dealing with the fallout from\nI keep hearing people say well why on earth would she weighs thirty six years and it really happened it must be alive and I can tell you exactly why\nIt doesn't matter that we were victims\nWhen we are raped we feel wrong we feel shame and humiliation and embarrassment and we don't want to admit it to ourselves\nLet alone to anyone else if it was not a violent rape that left obvious marks it's easy to pretend it never happened and emotionally it feels like the right thing to do\nBecause you're so scared and so hurt and so is shaped\nLive thanks very much for sharing your story with us Laura geared love to get your reaction to that story particularly the shame the humiliation the embarrassment that comes\nAfter an incident like that after an attack like that\nWow and it's powerful and\nYou know [laughter] so I spent many years in therapy and not necessarily certainly not just because of of my assault a it was one of the things that many that that I doubt left but\nI have been so struck by by the number of friends and colleagues and acquaintances who have reached out to me after I shared my story and you know sharing things they haven't told anyone before I\nIt goes on and on and on and and I really am also a huge fan of brain brown due to social researcher yeah shame and vulnerability right and I I and I have become a huge believer that shame needs secrecy to survive\nOn and off huge part of the reason that I decided to share my story is selfish it's because I\nYou know I don't believe anymore at that the shame that I'd been carrying around should have ever been my own shame and so in telling my story you know I I was I feel a huge sense of relief I was able to to discharge that I'm into the public arena where I Believe that belongs\n'em and no longer hold onto that I feel\nFreer I feel lighter and hearing from others who haven't been able to kind of go there yet they don't have to write a piece of had it they can share it with a friend\nOr family member but hearing from them I I Believe that I I did the right thing at least for me because I'm the thing that I'm most emotional about now is not my own experience it's knowing how many of the people I Love and care about and know are in you know the kind of pain they're carrying around\nAnd that ah I guess for me that's where who I Am as a journalist meets who I Am and my experience as a human because I just it makes me very angry um and it it really watching\nYou know watching Brett Kavanaugh for me and for a lot of us was kind of the embodiment of that injustice and\nThat's that's where I think you know the real power in and sharing our stories and power numbers comes from Lawrence\nI just wanted to um that speak to what this\nWhat lives shared about her experience there are very\nHonorable powerful reasons not to tell I Am not in any way ever going to diminish someone who feels unable to tell or who makes the choice not to tell\n'em that it can be internal reasons like lives shared it can be ex journal reasons like I might get taken away from my family or I might lose my job um but they are all very real\nAt at the same time I'm One of the other things that live did not bring up is that\nWe have more control over our own experiences and how we shape it them and how we interpret them if they're solely ours and we don't have other people telling us how we should behave\nSarah emailed I went to a small liberal arts college where sexual assault was rampant one day I met up with a friend and he gave me some vodka and I don't remember much else my next memory was me face down pants down with my quote unquote friend\nOn top of me still inside me I never thought of him that way never consented and barely have the strength to get him off of me when I tried to tell some people what happened I was called a whore\nLucky because my rapist was apparently attractive to others and I was called a complainer\nAnd people wonder why survivors don't come forward\nPat emailed when I was Thirteen Years old a podiatrist began molesting me he was thirty one he told my mom he had some worked I could do for him if you check patients in nursing homes he took me to pornographic movie theaters he taught me what a glory hole was\nHe had a friend of his implant an IUD in me this went on for almost two years [noise]\nLauren let me stick with you for just a moment I Would love to get your reaction to a clip from White House adviser Kellyanne Conway who spoke this weekend\nThe salt to listen I feel very empathetic frankly for ... a sexual assault sexual harassment\nAnd rate that [noise]\nI ... I don't expect and judge Kavanaugh or Jake Tapper or Jeff Flake or or any body to the responsible for that responsible ... own conduct\nThat was Kellyanne Conway speaking to Jake Tapper on CNN learn what do you make it become\nWell first of all I'm Glad she came out as a survivor um you could feel the emotion in her voice with its aside or Kellyanne Conway we none of us have ever seen before um\n\nBut she seems to put the blame entirely on herself being responsible for your own conduct when we know that\nThe\nAggressor is the only person responsible for the harassment abuse or assault you can for where anything you want you can get his drunk as you want if there is not a rapist there you will not be raped I'm I'm Sorry that that she's\nCarrying that and it's a really common thing that a lot of people carry\nCarlos wrote on our Facebook page I'm fifty year old male survivor of sexual assault\nBy a man who was my mother's boyfriend at the time to this day and it's difficult for me to trust any man aside from my brothers because of this I rarely hug any one and I'm ... extremely protective of my daughters professor Conan would you react to that I Wonder what your thoughts are in terms of how\nThis might be playing out differently from meal survivors of trauma versus women who have been traumatized\nThank you for bringing this up because um [noise]\nOne of the things we haven't talked much about is that men are also victims of sexual abuse and assault um and that the effects on them I'm of developing anxiety phobia pie TST are similar to that that women experience after being assaulted\nAnd I think for men who are victims of sexual assault if it's possible there's more stigma there is even more stigma in terms of being able to come out\nUm and um be heard um so I so in terms of how this is playing out I Wonder how men are feeling in term of do they feel and they identify with Dr Ford or they feel like their experiences are being\n\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

photons too arrived from across the galaxy and then we carefully takes a detector into the coffee lounges and debate what we saw\nSo that connection is not obvious and so when I say the unspoken alliance between astrophysics and the military it just never shows up but in fact astrophysicist and then the earlier days ... have been fundamental to the growth of empires and the Gemini of nations\nIn particular the the need to navigate with precision around the world ... my my professional ancestors no new the night sky\nAnd to to know the night sky and on any level is to give you better advantage for navigating earth's surface\nBecause the sky what's different depending on where you are on earth and things rise of different times and sat in different places and so if you knew this you can know where you're headed where you're coming from where we're the trade winds are where the hospitals are where the Friendly's are and all of this can be established\nAnd there's no end of examples where this kind of information was exploited for the game of the nation who had control over it\nI should know we didn't have the conversation on this program for those of you who are more interested in this connection between science and the military\nAbout the origins of chemical weapons during World War one a good bit of that heritage traces right back here to American University which is the institution that owns WAMC which produces one egg you can find that conversation on line at the one eight dot org\nNew President Trump announced the creation of a space for us this summer a six to branch of the military to focus on the militarization of space I guess it will be a fifth plant since the coast guard is technically part of the chess which is also the topic of your book\nGive us a sense of it went off within there is a topic of the book give us a sense of what this space force would need to do have accomplish avoid to be in the best interest of the American people and humanity\nSo first of all just to to the space forces not a new concept and ah it it surely been around even before I remembered mentioning it in two thousand and one in a commission I served on\nA authorized by the White House to study the future of the u._s. aerospace industry which at the time\nWas had fallen they've fallen on hard times I lost a half a million jobs that his consolidation in the industry there's competition from Europe with Airbus and other places that were rising up like in Brazil has embraced Air Canada was making a regional jets\nSo there was a concern that well what happens if we lose this industry\nTo what impact would that have on our security on our transportation on our commerce\nYou order something from Amazon it's on your steps the next morning some airplane delivered it they're right or at least to the nearest airport [laughter] step doorstep delivery by a airborne craft is still to come\nI guess but so so you you ... when you\nLook at this problem you say All right uh what are you going to do about it and I said well\nMight we separate the concerns of the air with the concerns or space because these are the same companies aerospace companies that that became a word right\nAnd if you separated out in the military you would then sort of tidy the budgeting for what the needs are and you wouldn't have to compete within under one umbrella for very different needs\nUm at the time on this commission there was a four star air force general and the air force then and now controls space activities of the military\nIt's called the U.S air force space command and they said we think we got this we don't really need a space for as separate from what's already happening so I wasn't going to second guess the general but I was intrigued by that confidence that he had\nFast forward to today on the Trump announcement as well as the pants follow on announcement\nIt if you just listen to it it sounded very very sort of macho look how big my biceps is as I speak\nThat was very we don't want to just be there and we want to we don't wanna just leave we want to dominate you know there's a lot of this kind of language and that spooked many people typically sort of peace next out there who say oh my gosh what will just mean\nDo you think of that ad thing though I mean if the U.S has supremacy Gemini over space our aims you know as a western power might be a little more benevolent than say the aims of China or Russia or North Korea\nYeah sure I'm just saying one could have ... said exactly the same thing using slightly different words and it would have been less spooky to people who fear the future of what could happen if you quote militarized space as I was really referencing rhetoric not reality reality is\nA space for us what would that mean you would just take all the space activities that are already happening under the air force\nAnd slide them out under one umbrella once with a coherent umbrella\nAnd if you're going to do that uh I I Would throw in you know asteroid defense right why don't you you know put that in your portfolio while you're at it\nThat could be quite devastating to any place on earth where a bad asteroid strikes and then the limit it could render is all extinct\nAs one did sixty five million years ago with the dinosaurs and Seventy percent of all species of life on earth at the time and that asteroid was only six miles across an earth is huge relative to that it's a matter of the energetic and what it does to the climate and the atmosphere\nAnd the long term survive ability of of of the ... that requires the sunlight to feed it so so space force\nWould might include I by the way I Would also throw in your clean up the debris it's up there while you're in a U.S this space debris problem but so so here's the distinction I Want to make which ... which I don't I haven't seen the press or the public recognize\nSpace it's very hard and not particularly strategic to make space and at the repository of weaponry\nHolding aside the fact that that would violate a treaty to which we are signature and today more than a hundred countries or sign from Nineteen sixty seven that it's a peaceful use of outer space treaty has a much longer name that I always forget right those are those are the that those are the essence words from the title\nCommunity

I think really matters they want to know that you you really care and you're ... you're in it and you're\nYou're you have spirit energy that is spilling out of you that all your whole body mind and soul is ready to be given onto this grand adventure\nThat we're all part taking in in the exploration of space so I think if you convey that uh I don't know if it's a slam dunk but at least it's a um\nIt's a shot from inside the paint [laughter] want to stay in basketball analogy\nJay tweeted which do you think will happen first transplanting a human brain into a machine sassy I eat a robot body transplanting a human consciousness into a computer\nAh so first the human mind is really messed up we have a lot of evolutionary baggage that prevents us from making rational decisions as also we do some very beautiful things are art and music and the sort of thing\nTo put a human brain into a robotic chassis um when you could program the robotic chassis to have almost anything you really care about I don't see that as as as a thing that people will do and the other option was what to put put to to put our consciousness I look I think that'll happen either\nYeah well we don't really know what consciousness is\nAn evidence of that is how many books are still written on it that's evidence that usually you don't know\nWhat it is for example if you look on the shelf of books on gravity there's like three books we got grabbing\nFor not still writing books on its alone it just for the law you obey gravity so um but it is sort of uploading all of your electro chemical impulses into some machine to mimic that\nTo mirror that maybe that comes along with consciousness we don't know but I see that happening long before we would take a brain and sticking it out in the machine by the way speaking of transplanting brain what I really want is if we can't if we can't cure Alzheimer's and we can't cure a oh last\nAt least find a way to transplant the brain of an Alzheimer's patient into the body of I'm\nI'm not sorry the brain of an elitist patient into the body of an Alzheimer's patient and they get a full person out of that because one you you lose the body odor you lose your your mind\nThat this sounds very altered carbon even wants to a lot of mental exam is\nVery Frankenstein to ... I just said if you had goals if you can't otherwise I I bet we'll find cures for both of those before we learn how to transplant a brain but I think about that all the time\nCertainly helps them certainly hope so and wants to know do you believe in aliens\nThat's not a matter of belief is there's there's no evidence for life off the earth yet but we haven't looked very far or very much I'm Jill Tarter is one of my favorite quotes from hers is if you go to the ocean and you stick a class in and your scoop out some water and they analyze what it really carefully insect\nThere no whales in the ocean [laughter]\nNow you have an look there are so we've only taken a tiny scoop out of the galaxy and our search for life\nUh intelligent life uh for example um what we think of as intelligent life or any life at all in our backyard or or Mars and perhaps other places but anyone who study the problem is\nIn no way doubts the strong likelihood that there's life elsewhere in the galaxy and the universe is possibly teeming with\nAmy asked on our Facebook page will the human race cease to exist in the next thousand years based on the current environmental trends not considering a possible impact from an asteroid or other cosmic influence\nWe're pretty sure that nothing extinction level is headed our way that would take us out in the next thousand years and we know that because the more dangerous and asked\nThe bigger it is the easier it is to detect so so uh I I think we're good about that it's possible that a comic could come\nFrom out of nowhere because comments very long period comments\nThey sort of show up you know you don't have history for them and one could come in and take us out\nOr it would be really bad luck to you if that were the case but it I regardless you want to help the space program that can deflect these things and so I'm all for\nBuilding protecting having insurance plan that you put a little bit of money in for a to protect you against a devastating thing that it would be very rare\nSo but uh otherwise we could easily go a thousand years if we become wise shepherds of our power\nAnd over nature and we have the warnings are scientists\nI Wonder how what what the over under is on that I tend to be\nFairly hopeful younger people seem to have a very different grasp of the value of the earth that this is the one home we have than many of their parents and and forebears and I kind of you know today's generation gives me hope for dealing with some of the problems are climate faces but what about you\nYeah I'm hopeful realistically hopeful so but I'm I'm I'm ... I'm\nI'm cynically hopeful so here's how this works cynically hope yes so here so people don't act even when they're warned until it gets really bad and then they act\nSo all these this topic movies that show like look at Blade Runner right the woman ever get to that point this so this ... you know because we reach it or or or soil in green no because you reach a point where people say no this is to this is this I cannot tolerate any further on an e people\nI don't want to people so that really is too hot [laughter] [noise]\nRight right do you so you so we have restoring forces in the world\nThat prevent swing too low in in this regard and ... story telling 'em it involves a trend that never stops and goes to rock bottom and I've ... I've seen people bounce back societies bounce back ... people in power bounce back\nSo how long you're going to deny science until it really interferes with your health and your wealth and he said oh my gosh I think I like science again and then you put the funds back in and so that's why I think we'll be okay\nJared submitted questions through our app won a vox pop\nYou think that human beings are physically incapable of understanding the\nFundamental nature of the universe if not what's the timeline to solving say something like dark matter\nThe question Jared ... so I think about that all the time I lose sleep on whether or slightly rephrase the question I lose sleep over whether the human mind is smart enough\nTo act to truly understand the universe as it is\nAnd I worry that we may not be smart enough to even who what question to ask and this disturbs me because we know who defines humans as intelligent way do we do yeah who's to say that that is sufficient intelligence to figure out how the universe works\nSo so uh now dark matter dark energy the advantage to being modern human is that we can we can stand on the shoulders are those who came before us you don't have to invent calculus to solve the next problem somebody else did\nSo in a way we're assembling wrong by wrong a ladder of knowledge that looks over every next wall that we have confronted and so we were so ... ...", "show_name": "Kathleen Dunn", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "02"}
