on Todd's will like in Washington sitting in for Joshua Johnson well the report is in the FBI has submitted the results of its limited investigation into Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nThe

final vote on whether to confirm him\nIs expected to happen Saturday joining me to discuss the report and its potential fallout is NPR Justice Department a reporter Ryan Lucas Ryan welcome\nThank you so we have this report or will the Senate has the report now or do we the people have any idea what is actually contained within the four corners\nWell we don't have any sort of specific snow and this is certainly something that is confidential and not a something that is generally released to the public and there are no plans at this point according to the Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley for any of this to be made public\nA despite clearly a a fair amount of interest among Democrats to make this public and certainly I think among the Trump a chunk of the American public to to learn what's in there of what we do know is that publicly at least\nA six people have confirmed that they spoke to the FBI many of them are people who are friends of judge Kavanaugh's during high school that would be mark judge PJ Smith Tim gone debt and Chris Garrett\nA as well as one friend of a Ford's that's legal in Kaiser who all confirmed that they spoke to the FBI and then there's a second woman who made allegations of sexual\nRamirez and we know that she also spoke to the FBI now a NPR has learned um that uh nine people according to a to a an official nine people spoke with the the FBI in total um but again a lot of this is one that you know we don't know what all\nThe FBI was told in this uh and likely we're not going to get a full picture but what we do have so far as what a trim and Grassley has said and that is that there's nothing in there that the committee and the public of this one didn't already\nKnow so where is the report right now physically I mean how our senators looking at it because it's extremely sensitive every reporter in Washington wants to get a look at it in and every political operative does too\nWell uh the process for this is governed by a memorandum of understanding that uh dates back round a decade of but what generally happens is when the White House gets this background an information on a judicial nominees nominee that will send it over to a Senate Judiciary committee us generally held in the Judiciary Committee safe\nToday it's being held in a secure location in the capital and which senators can come down and look at it there are the space is basically working in shifts right now we're Democrats will get now are um to take a look at it and then Republicans and there are small handful of a staffers who have clearance to see this as as well but basically\nPeople are members are coming in getting a a look at the report they can get briefed on it but this is all happening within basically the bowels of the of the capital

for World Cup [noise]\nNeymar has got a goal or maybe your mind wanders back even further to two thousand one when Brazil was predicted to become one of the world's top economies by twenty fifty\nWords that Russia India and China wreck for short but there is nothing short of on the list of goals and ambitions these countries lay down and our second annual summit joining me now to talk about the\nOlympics the world cup one of the most exciting emerging markets in the world to Brazil was once heralded as Latin America's crown jewel\nBut then it was hit with a one two punch of a massive corruption scandal and it's stunning economic collapse now unemployment in Brazil is at Thirteen percent the country has sixty thousand homicides per year on average and its current president boasts of an approval rating\nOf just three percent all of that is backdrop to Brazil's upcoming presidential elections far right populist ... he's facing off against the leftist his rival Fernando ... died on Sunday and the lead up to the election has already been packed with drama including both in our owes near fatal stabbing last month\nAnd we're here to talk about what the election means for Brazil and how what happens in Brazil will reverberate across both America's\nMonica to bowl is he or she is senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for international economics\nShe's also director of Latin American studies at Johns Hopkins university and she she's here with me in the studio Monica thanks for being here thank you for having me Brian winter is editor in chief of America's quarterly and the vice president for policy at the American society and the counsel of the Americas\nHe joined us over Skype from Sao paulo in Brazil Brian thanks for being here\nHello Todd happy to be with you good to talk to you and ... is director of the Brazil Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center he's also with us here in Studio ... thanks to you for being here pleasure to be a well Brian you're the one in Sao paolo so let me give you honors here to start\nA let's start with the nitty gritty who is Jerry are both in our most Americans might not be familiar with him\nAs ... as a retired army captain\nWho has been in Congress for nearly three decades now I'm ... despite having sat in Congress\nFirst so much time and he he shows ... open loading for ah for the legislative body I mean he said over the years numerous times that the Congress is dysfunctional and it should be closed um he's also advocated torture\nOf his political or of leftists and and other\nPolitical opponents 'em and you know that method\nKnow lived here I mean he was not a popular figure but in the last couple of years because of this historic economic crisis that you mentioned those messages are resonating a lot more with people\nWhen they did in the past and now here we are with this presidential election coming up on Sunday and he has ten point lead an old over his nearest rival it looks like there will be a runoff vote which would be on October twenty eighth and that one is that one's a close call right now between him and and the guy who's likely to face\nWith this Fernando ... but it's it's just so strange for me to be here because I Lived in Brazil for five years and if it was not that long ago I was here from twenty to twenty fifty and this seemed like just such a strong democracy it seemed like a place that had come so far since the period of last\nMilitary rule from Nineteen sixty four\nIn Nineteen eighty five but being here this week and talking to people I mean I there's a lot of people who are ready to vote for both in our even if it does mean a return to you know the more authoritarian ways of the past year\nSome people [laughter] both wrote a Brian we're going to work on your sky blind a little bit uh we'll we'll get that cleaned up and will definitely come back to a Monica what about Fernando had died in in contrast he's not as\nFiery as ... and our with correspondent has been described by some as Trump being or maybe more akin to ... in the Philippines likes to waive guns around and say that drug dealers should be shot or threatens to summer summarily execute them what about his opponent for for a Fernando ... what do we know about him\nSo what we know about him um is that he's not a ... organic member of the Workers Party the P. T. um he's someone who sort of an outsider when you look at the composition of the bt far less so\nHe's not he's a moderate um but the leadership of the Workers Party of the PTA currently is very radicalized so it's very different\nFrom the time when former president Lula was in government for example from twenty three I'm twenty ten when the party really did take this sort of center left stance so the party at south now is very much hard left\nOn the candidate though is that um that being said that the real big problem in Brazil at the moment is that\nThere is a lot a lot of anti P. T. anti worker party sentiment so a lot of the vote that has been migrating too far right extremist boss and arrow\nUm is this anti PT vote so these elections are very strange because they have become elections about not who necessarily voters actually went to see as president but about who voters do not see as friends and\nWe're going to talk about corruption we're going to talk about graft we are going to talk about a failing economy because all of those things play and I think to\nThe idea that voters know who they don't want they don't want the people who were taking billions of dollars in bribes which has been a major problem we're gonna talk all about that Apollo let me turn to you what about turnout in this election Brazil has compulsory voting I don't know if that means that they get to a hundred percent but people do\nCome out to the polls what's the mood like among Brazilians are they excited to to sweep out the corrupt dirty politicians and get both in our in there or are they beaten down in in weary\nI think they're more weary than a decisive in terms of going there and changing things or the electorate is very divided normally uh eighty percent of the voters show up or we may have less of a proportion this time ah\nHow many voters will spoil their their vote will leave it blank will cancel do vote because that is important whoever gets a fifty percent of the valley devotes is elected president there is an outside chance that that could happen this Sunday\nOr we both are not winning more like the according to the late ... is that we go to a runoff\nBut the mood people are angry people are frustrated people feel betrayed by the political class in Brazil or regardless if they are less from the left from the rights of from the center people feel absolutely fed up with politics with politicians\nAnd that there is no alternative to because there is not going to be emitted very cool in Brazil and we're going to find our way through politics\nNow Brian I think we have your sky blind nice and clean now I'm both an hour oh has a history of violent rhetoric he's been photographed waiting machine guns around as I mentioned he he likes to fantasize about his opponents or or drug dealers are thieves\nBeing shot but there's been some actual violence in this campaign last month ... was actually stabbed at a campaign rally or what happened there and what's happened since how has it affected his standing among voters in Brazil in a way\nI mean it was adding all of us were paying to see a political violence at that level and I was personally awful for for both\nScenario he he almost died by his own account and and those are the doctors that treated him\nPolitically I think it's fair to say that it was helpful um because the plan by the more centrist candidates in this race\nWas to spend these last couple of weeks attacking both scenario as much as possible and on TV ads and elsewhere and and because of this attack against him and because of the resulting\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

T.\nThey go back to the impeachment of very sad as one major argument for why you know things that the Workers Party has been let's say unfairly treated in the way that the that that things have gone down\n[noise] Matt writes to us or on email I had a Brazilian friend years back who called he's home country the greatest country that never was meaning to Brazil\nHas had such riches in terms of natural resources but it is not had the government or the leadership to make it a competitor with the United states up Paolo Matt makes a good point Brazil was\nCelebrated as the rising star not only of Latin America of emerging economies around the world compared to India and China we mentioned at the top are now horrible recession horrible corruption what happened in Brazil where was the Brazil that that hosted the Olympics in was and was on the way up\nWell I think Brazil believe too much in the magic that it's a country predestined can be great\nAnd forgot to do the necessary things you do in order to build that country or one of the major betrayal is precisely the workers' party a party that was led\nBy a man born into poverty or that to build this very successful party on initially ethics in politics\nThere is this sense after Brazil a\nA basic ... riding a wonderful wave in international economics major producer of commodities had a wonderful moment Barbara too was reduced and that is what led to this impression that Brazil was unstoppable well a than reality hits\nA ruler made a very bad choice in his successor a and a a\nLot of a shot to came and the magic would disappear or what we have today is a consequence and this is what I think what they should be positive and all of this we cannot blame others for our problems\nThis crisis was produced in Brazil by Brazilians are and another thing that this poll that showed the positive\nIs the fact that the states in Brazil is basically broke\nAnd we have run off the money ah all that dream now has to be has ended and the nightmare has to be calling from ... from a ... reality ... basis where the government has run all the money we have to adjust the economy the measures necessary to do that are very\nOff an unpopular and none of the candidates have explain exactly why the holiday planned to come from the shoes now\nBryan winter you're with us from Brazil or I read an article Bryan that you recently wrote\nWhere you were asked by a friend I think to sum up Brazil in two sentences and I'm going to paraphrase a little bit your answer ultimately your conclusion was too many BS privileges for the elite not enough good leaders what exactly did you mean by that tourists conclusion well\nIf you look around right now at the field of candidates there's there's one thing that all Brazilians agree on which is that they find the candidates running for president to be an inspiring\nUm the vast majority of people here as we've said during the program I feel like they're voting against somebody rather than voting for somebody and the consequences of that is is just I mean it's it's stunning for somebody who lived here during that era when things were going really well which you mentioned Todd\nThis belief that people have in their system of government is just amazing and you know it's part of a global trend I mean we've seen this happen in places like turkey in Hungary and elsewhere around the world\nBut this democratic recession as some people have called it really is especially strong here and that makes sense because Brazil is taking a bigger beating um in terms of its economy and in terms of the reputation of its politicians because of this\nCorruption scandal than virtually any other western democracy in recent years there was a poll by the Pew Research center and twenty Seventeen that found that just eight percent\nOf Brazilians say representative democracy is a very good form of government\nThat was the lowest of thirty eight countries that that that\nYou surveyed ... and that just shows you the climate here\nRight now and the reason why many people fear that both denaro if elected would basically have carte blanche to take a you know hard right turn it could involve the curtail moment of civil civil liberties and and and other things I I in my time\nI'm this week um I've had meetings with people from civil society and the press and others who you know these are serious people not prone to panic or anything like that who are talking openly about the possibility of exile\nAnd this just blew me away I mean it it's a Brazil that I've read about in history books you know going back to previous periods of military\nRule Nineteen sixty four was the last two I thought that that was real Brazil that had been firmly relegated to the history books and\nYou know maybe maybe maybe they are maybe it is getting a little\nBit melodramatic in some quarters but but they're real fears and and and people are scared right now well\nBrian you mentioned a statistic that was disturbing only eight percent of Brazilian said representative democracy\nIs the best form of government now I'm an right to the point ... emails us why are we so concerned about the right versus the left in Brazil ... is another ... he's an air to wind up ... all these ... dictator wannabes\nWho are being resurrected in Europe and Asia and now in Latin America\nAll of them are loads for their corruption their narcissism\nAnd a total lack of democracy\nAnd Paolo in the United states it's been said more than once\nThat a ... is a Brazilian version a Brazilian analog of president Donald Trump

sound familiar to you I Want to go back to the history and just a moment but before we do I want to get to a moment in tribalism in politics\nWhere we are right now I Want to talk about Lindsey Graham Lindsey Graham back during impeachment was a member of the house he was an impeachment manager he helped impeach Bill Clinton and then what before the Senate to make the case as a prosecutor that Bill Clinton should be removed from office because at the Monica Lewinsky\nExperience I'm now Lindsey Graham is also made himself highly visible these last several weeks during the Brett Kavanaugh hearings he angrily defended Kavanaugh he said the other day in the hearings I think everybody thought I'm a single white male people want me to shut up and I won't shut up and he was red faced and he was furious on behalf of\nBrett Kavanaugh and presumably white men everywhere but contrast that with the Lindsey Graham of twenty sixteen and twenty Seventeen and even twenty twelve hears Lindsey Graham at a roast dinner and twenty Seventeen poking fun at Paul Ryan speaker of the house but making a point\nYou're forty six years you've been the vice presidential nominee of the Republican point here the speaker of the house the Republican controlled house you're smart you know the budget that words for\nYou have a good temperament disposition and the judgment of Solomon you are dead men walking as far as [noise]\nNow back in twenty twelve Lindsey Graham the same Lindsey Graham used to warn about the future of the Republican Party he would quit to me at any reporter who would listen we can't make angry white guys fast enough to survive as a Republican Party or the future meaning Republicans had to broaden their appeal to women to minorities to Hispanics\nFlash forward to the Lindsey Graham of this week I'm a white male and I'm not gonna take it anymore\nStunning what does this transformation Lindsey Graham hulk vacation in the Trump said EU about where we were in in in where we are yeah I mean it tells me that the divide is deepening any idea tells me that the\nThe lines that were kind of drawn to you that you saw in the two thousand election they say that we've lived with sense\nThey're only going deeper in the moment you talked about there in twenty twelve after the twenty twelve election\nThere was as you remember the certainly the the Republican sort of um establishment nationally looked at the Mitt Romney's last to Brock Obama included what Lindsey Graham did it demographically the way the country had been divided up for the last Fifteen or Twenty years was not going to work for them long term\nThey came up with that autopsy report they were going to change on immigration all this stuff\nDonald Trump comes along and violates every tenet of this of this autopsy and wins\nAnd I think it it's not just that he won the general election and that's a huge part of it but the fact that he was able\nTo sweep through the Republican Party is like the primaries like he didn't twenty sixteen\nTold Republicans like Lindsey Graham and of course easy to forget but Lindsey Graham did run for president in twenty sixty one of the sixteen or Seventeen Republicans who did and failed miserably and I think that's it I think that lesson there of going head to head against Trump of dismissing him completely at the beginning of that race Graham called him a kooky called him a bunch of things\nUm in twenty sixteen and then watching how within the Republican world how Trump resonated with their voters it told them boy there's something about our own voters our own party our own tribe\nThat we didn't quite understand maybe we didn't want to understand granted or than granted more than just name calling in a primary he told Republicans we are finished if we nominate Donald Trump that he is the death knell of this party\nSo what is Lindsey Graham thinking now is he thinking I have to win a Republican primary in twenty twenty in South Carolina where Donald Trump is popular so I'd better get on the Trump train and that's all there is to it the last the last gasp of the Republican Party\nHe is he converted what's he think yeah I mean look there's then there's all sorts of theories about this I don't know to give you a couple of them that that that that jump out at me one is what you're saying yeah he's got to worry about a Republican primary every Republican one of the lessons\nOf Donald Trump's rise and his enduring popularity with Republican voters one of the lessons\nTo Republican officeholders as you are taking a major major risk if you are seen as separating yourself from this president your neck primary especially if you're Lindsey Graham and you already have a history of sort of being a being antagonistic towards the right here and they're so grim has to worry about that there's also the theory that hey part of this is\nLindsey Graham trying to play the influence game if you if you're you know friendly to Trump in public if you sing his praises or if you change your tone on Trump the way he as if you're a golf with him maybe\nIf you're Lindsey Graham and you have some issues particularly on foreign policy and national security this is a way to influence them but I think one of the other lessons to is it is again Lindsey Graham looking at Trump than twenty sixteen and saying this is absolute political suicide for the Republican Party to go down this road\nAnd then seeing down from when the election I Know it was narrow but seeing the one I think tells Lindsey Graham and just brought more broadly tells Republicans that this tribalism is so much deeper than we realized it was and it changes what you're able to do and what you can do politically Kennett last\nIs the question given the demographics of this country Lindsey Graham I'll remind you one last time said himself over and over we can't make angry white guys fast enough we can't manufacturing and fast enough\nTo be a party the future I Wonder if\nWhen he closed his eyes at night whether he's changed his mind about that or not\nJames sent us an email I frequently have yard signs for political candidates in my front yard and because there are good candidates on both sides of the aisle I usually have candidates from both major parties and I am surprised at how often several of my neighbors expressed their genuine irritation with me that I can endorse candidates from both parties\nVery tribal instead of an evaluation\nOn the merits and in Steve you're not him because that does not sound surprising to you yeah well what he's describing his ticket splitting in political science they did the voters who go and they\nWere Democrat for president Republican for Congress they split up the ballot\nJust election two election that that the number of people out there who do that who split their ticket\nHas been shrinking shrinking and you're looking at single digits right now and that that is just the rise of polarization the tribal isn't All right let's get back in our way way back machine are red and blue way way back machine go back in history with you Steve corner you so much of what your book is about\nAh we talked about the speaker of the house Newt Gingrich who are on led to believe did not talk to you for this book although although he certainly could have\nA when he was a young rabble rousing congressmen\nWho was willing to defy the normal rules of congressional decorum in May of Nineteen eighty four he delivered an insult on the floor of the house to then time speaker from Massachusetts the legendary Tip O'Neill\nMy partner speaker as you pointed out to us again yesterday are in charge of this house if you are saying to me the urine postmaster isn't capable of delivering from one member to another the male and the system you run\nThen I think you may want to find a commission to look into the post office\nNow maybe a veiled insult there that might take a little bit of parsing but give it back story and why Newt Gingrich was slinging an insult at uh the well respected and legendary Tip O'Neill yeah there there in in hindsight now you look back Thirty years new player you may say well what was the big deal to\nDeal with Democrats had run the Congress at that point for Thirty years\nThey were seen as the permanent majority I mean Republicans weren't just the minority party they were buried deep they weren't even close you didn't go into an election saying maybe the Republicans will get it maybe they won't it was like maybe they'll get to a hundred Seventy feet or this or that that was how deep in the minority they were in here was Gingrich um who was in his third term from Georgia\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin

for you\nThe top Republican on the Senate Judiciary committee says the FBI has turned up nothing to corroborate allegations that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was involved in sexual assault in high school and another instance of sexual misconduct in college there is nothing in it that we didn't already know said Senator Chuck Grassley adding\nThere's also no contemporaneous evidence\nThis investigation found no hint of misconduct and the same is true of the six prior FBI background investigations conducted during judge Kavanaugh's twenty five years\nOf public service that was Chuck Grassley chairman of the Judiciary Committee I was quoting their ranking member on the Senate Judiciary committee Democrat Dianne Feinstein of California disagrees she says it looks to be the product of an incomplete investigation\nThat was limited perhaps by the White House Dianne Feinstein ranking member expect much more on this throughout the day on your NPR station\nI Want to turn back to Steve ... in just a moment but before we do a quick appeal for some help with the program in the works for next week here on one day we spend a lot of time yesterday to talking with women about how society views angry women and there's a broad range of opinion but most of the women were here\n... if you're a conservative woman tell us how your seeing this moment what have you got to say how\nDo

tell us your story eight five five to three six one a one a that's eight five five to three six one two one two will make sure to get your stories on the air part of the national conversation in the days ahead here on one day\nWhile we're talking for the most part about what politician said and did in the Nineteen Ninety so how do they define their ideologies for the American people it's not just Washington it's polarized we've been asking listeners for memorable moments from politics in the nineties and and here's one\nAnd the president is right\nIn many ways we are a shining city on it\nBut the hard truth is that not everyone is sharing in this city's splendor and gory\nThere is this fair Mr President\nAnd the faces that you don't say in the places that you don't visit\nAnd you're a shining city\nAnd I believe you're hearing from Mario Cuomo their former governor of New York maybe at the peak of his political career the shining city on the hill well here's what I was going for another moment or the moment that listeners sent us from ... the early nineties I take you back towards any overhaul [noise]\n\nSoon to be president President Bill Clinton June Nineteen Ninety two on the semi also remember him were sending off before that year presidential\nCandidates didn't really appear on nighttime talk shows at all so that was something new talk about how politicians grappled with media coverage during those years a Steve that was a moment not just because of the president appeared on our city hall but he seemed to offer an alternative\nTo gosh even Pat Buchanan speech there is a religious war in this country very stark\nVery serious and and a lot of Americans agreed with him here was Bill Clinton in sunglasses just having a whole lot of fun the guy you want at the party\nAlso the moment that was June Nineteen Ninety two when Bill Clinton did the Arsenio Hall's show Bill Clinton was actually running\nNot in first or second but in third place in the presidential race at that point versus what Ross Perot laced with Bush the incoming president in third place buried\nI was about twenty five percent was Bill Clinton and so they were his team he remembered the bill Clinton who emerged from the Democratic primaries in Ninety two had was thought to be an electable he'd gone through the scandal about Jennifer Flowers he'd gone through the scandal about avoiding the Vietnam draft he'd gone through the\nI didn't inhale moment that sort of hard in this image of slick willy the guy who's going to you know lawyer early ... scheme is way out of\nOut of everything and so they were trying his campaign was\nTo did change his image and he had this you know obviously winning personality and they wanted to showcase it and they wanted to get around\nInterviews with you know traditional news interviews where every question was going to be about gender flowers and the draft and all that so here was a way you go on a syndicated nighttime talk show like Arsenio Hall which was very hard at that moment you're showcase a different side of your personality\nAnd it was Ninety two it wasn't just arson you Ninety two was the year\n... media had been expanding in so many ways in that immediate expansion really met up with politics presidential politics I mentioned Perot who was running in first place at that point the entire Perot phenomenon\nToo on the CNN show Larry King Larry King and and Larry King would sometimes have politicians on and sometimes aging celebrities and they'd spend an hour and they take calls and Ross Perot was on in February Ninety two and he said you know if the if there are volunteers out there who will put me on the ballot in all fifty states I'll run for president as an independent\nIn just from that\nA movement sprung up organically across the country to do in Texas about two months later volunteers submitted two hundred and fifty four thousand signatures to get Ross Perot on the ballot and he was running in first place by June and he was doing talk shows\nClinton was doing talk shows there was a Clinton Jerry Brown primary debate on the Phil Donahue show the syndicated daytime talk show\n'em in George W. Bush this was a generational aspect to sixty eight year old George W. Bush the president running for reelection his spokesman said after Bill Clinton did the Arsenio Hall's show that night well\nWe won't be doing anything like that and Arsenio Hall went on his show the next night and just tore into Bush that went went after it was beneath the presidency yeah it was beneath the presidency to go on a nighttime talk show where people goof around and make a you know goof adolescent jokes that's not\nThat's not for a president and and Bill Clinton said Oh yes Oh yes it is said and by the end of the campaign that Bush wasn't do in our city oh by the end of the campaign but he was doing you know morning shows on TV in ... he was starting to sort of get the message um\nPoliticians now manage media in a very very different way now going on a late night talk show is par for the course because people want you to display your personality Brock Obama had\nA winning personality an affable nice guy and used it to great political effect everywhere from Jimmy Fallon to Stephen cold there there isn't a show that Iraq Obama didn't go on successfully\nUm Donald Trump in his campaign did the same as well because he's extremely comfortable on live television even if somehow less likeable than than maybe Barack Obama was but but the mores of how you reach the public has\nChanged just radically they changed completely since the moment when George W. Bush said we're not going to lower the presidency by going on or send your home and I think too you can you can draw a line between we were talking about Gingrich earlier\nIn the rise of Gingrich in that moment with O'Neill what that moment came from was Gingrich looking for a way around what at the time where the dominant sort of media platforms and they were just the broadcast networks and Gingrich\nThird term congressman from Georgia said I'm not going to be able to get my message out across ABC CBS NBC because they don't pay attention to me he CSPAN\nGive CSPAN was five years old in the early Nineteen eighties and he used the late night speeches and CSPAN to seek out find and develop a relationship with a new audience draw a line from that and how Gingrich or legal to build his career his rise in the house around that\nFast forward to Donald Trump or to down Trump to\nTelevision obviously a part of it but really in the campaign social media Twitter\nDonald Trump identified through Twitter away to go around not just the news media but the entertainment media is well that's that's so engaged in politics now into directly get his message across to voters to get around it I see what Gingrich was doing in the eighties with C SPAN and Trump was doing with Twitter\nAnd and I think there's a real common thread there well let's go back then in the way way back machine one more time\nTo Nineteen Ninety nine Donald Trump was people forget was involved with politics even at the time he flirted mentally and even in reality with presidential runs long before he was ever successful he went on meet the press\nBack in Nineteen Ninety nine and had some thoughts about somebody that we've already talked about Pat Buchanan the insurgent right wing politician in the Republican Party\nFor his ... I guess he's an anti Semite he doesn't like the black sea doesn't like the gays I I I it's just incredible that anybody can embrace this guy and maybe I'll get four or five percent of the vote and there'll be a really staunch right wacko vote", "show_name": "Kathleen Dunn", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "04"}
