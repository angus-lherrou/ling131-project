A. M. U. dot org and we're taking your calls and voice mails at eight five five to three six one a one a speaking of calls let's get to one now from Florida David is on the line Hey David what's on your mind\nHey Joshua how are you\nGood what'd you think could be a hearing last week\nWell the impact on the nation are you just said the impact on the nation that's a ... exactly what I Would comment on I feel that uh I'm actually glad that the um that the hearings were made a public because it allows us\nAs a nation to weigh in on what exactly is going on in Washington with our politicians and how they're making decisions\nFor us or with regard to these things so uh I think it was very important that we all uh chime in on what's going on in regard less of a or political or aspirations uh\nI myself have a they also at the alcoholism in my past ah I found a recovery in Nineteen eighty five I I understand the struggles of alcoholism but I also understood stand up\nUh in my youth when I struggled with alcohol as I grew into adulthood I uh was able to me I was able to hide or my drinking and justify my drink and this is a characteristic of alcoholics they\nAre very adamant about defending their drinking and also at the same time admitting that they do not have a problem so um\nI think it's very interesting for us to see um individuals or come to terms with their past and how it affects their future and how that affects the future of all of us\nDavid how ... how do you think is really how do you think this will affect the confirmation battle though I mean I hear you about these other conversations that need to be had in terms of whether or not Brett Kavanaugh makes it to the Supreme Court or not what impact do you think the last few days might have\nOne particular clip I saw on CNN was when I'm One of the senators was questioning him about er an FBI investigation\nAnd he refused to answer he fall silent he he he explained that he was hoping to what the committee or would a welcome however hit she personally would not comment\nOn whether or not he would accept an FBI investigation and it was very interesting to watch his wife or her response to him because when he was not answering that question she was staring at him very sternly and I always also wonder what exactly was she\nThinking when he refused to answer this question regarding an FBI investigations\nYeah you're you're right for you that your friend that question that's asked him in ...\nOh thank God we should be open to any possibilities\nYeah David appreciate your calling in thanks very much and that was the question that Dick Durbin of Illinois put to Brett Kavanaugh and he paused for a long time and then Chuck Grassley who's the chairman of the committee a Republican chairman of the committee jumped back in and then after that Rachel Mitchell question there for the GOP basically lost her job and then the GOP senator started jumping back and\nLet me get to some more of your comments David thanks very much for talking to us Catherine emailed\nAs a woman listening to Kavanaugh defend himself last Thursday I didn't find his presentation appropriate\nIt smacks of bullying and intimidation aside from that conspiracy theories like revenge from the Clintons aired instead of testimony is a major disqualify or in my eyes before we bring in our next guest professor fitzpatrick if I could ask you to respond\nTo Catherine particularly whether or not someone who began by making a partisan broadside can be trusted to sit on the Supreme Court at administer equal justice under law\nWell I'm you know I think we have to be realistic about all of this our Supreme Court justices come from the political world they work for president of one party and I'm often times or they have other experience in politics they are\nTo some extent partisan or in their outlook but they try to put that to the side as best they can when they get on the court\nAnd focus on the statutes the constitution the administrative regulations and I think they do a pretty good job obviously people's world view influences their decisions to some extent but\nI think we'll find that if judge Kavanaugh's confirmed he is a successful just as well liked by his colleagues just like Clarence Thomas\nFrankly a is today if you ask the justices if they like Clarence Thomas they they they will tell you I don't just like him I Love him so Sonia Sotomayor came to Vanderbilt\nLast year and talk to her students and she said that I Love Clarence Thomas and so I think we'll get beyond this um but they're certainly going to be some awkward moments for a year or two\nLet's get another voice to our conversation joining us now in Studio is Elizabeth why drove the presidents of the constitutional accountability center a public interest law firm as think tank based here in D.C Elizabeth welcome ... let me start with the question that I began with\nFor professors Rosen and fitzpatrick just your general sense of the hearing both the structure of it and the testimony as we heard from professor Ford and judge Kavanaugh and how that might affect the ultimate big decision about whether Brett Kavanaugh should become an associate justice of the United states\nWell I think you know harkening back to what the caller uh just uh your your um listener just mentioned about the\nPresentation that judge Kavanaugh I made and talking about revenge of the Clintons you know there's definitely been a divide between those who are centering Dr Ford and the other survivors of sexual assault and as we saw judge Kavanaugh's opening centering the political\nTalking about the Democrats talking about uh whether or not they should have leaked her letter and disregarded her request for an identity you know I think that uh whether or not you think Senator Feinstein should have\nTried to raise this another way earlier she was trying to respect that clear request for anonymity from\nThis traumatized survivor and maybe it's telling that Republicans would have just leaked it anyway and disregarded her request that Senator Feinstein was trying to give her the respect that she and her experience deserved and I think that trying to you\nGame like she came up with this decades long con to try to stop judge Kavanaugh from getting to the Supreme Court is frankly offensive it's offensive to her and her experience and to the many many many many others who have experienced sexual assault\nAnd have not come forward because of fear because of shame because they worried frankly that what we might see in this case would be true for them that they would finally find their voice and the courage to come forward and it would not matter\nI Wonder Elizabeth if there was any way around the politicking of this if it was just bound to happen no matter what I mean we've got a lot of comments very critical of the Democrats alluding to what you just kind of reference there\nOf emailed the Democrats are showing their ugly side and the people see right through their deception they should be ashamed but that would require morals which they lack\nAnd Joe emailed I'm a moderate conservative as are most of my friends we've discussed the catalog hearings and Democratic senators behavior extensively if the Democrats think their behavior will go unanswered I'm afraid they're mistaken this entire process needs to be overhauled\nWell I think that most people would agree that the nominations process for the courts both the lower courts and the Supreme Court is broken and you know it it's it's certainly a problem but I think that that's kind of a dodge you know okay let's talk about that but let's first talk about Dr Ford\nAnd are very credible testimony and allegations and what it means for judge Kavanaugh getting a job promotion to the Supreme Court\nI think it's very important to note this is not a criminal trial no one is at this point trying to hold him\nCriminally liable so it isn't a beyond a reasonable doubt kind of thing it said let's try to get all the facts which is what the FBI investigation shouldn't be doing and I think we'll get to that

Democrats are promising that if Kavanaugh is confirmed and they take the house they will hold impeachment hearings on the alleged misstatements in the confirmation hearings and they range not only from\nA his testimony involving Dr Ford and his college classmates insistence that he was a heavy drinker even though he says he wasn't and so forth but also about alleged misstatements and the first part of the hearings where he said he didn't know about a emails involving lower court confirmations or surveillance programs and the evidence suggests that he did\nSo regardless of whether the Senate chooses to decide that a small misstatement as evidence of a larger one the Democrats are determined to press these and they're not going to go way\nWho is your mom but tweeted sometimes the partisan lens is overrated I Am a moderate Republican women and so many women that I have known experience to solve like Dr for describes a friend from my church a high school friend a cousin a neighbor we believe her because we have been her\nPamela tweeted this is an impossible situation I feel deeply sorry for Ford is she was obviously sexually assaulted by someone and they spent her life trying to get over it I also feel deeply for Kavanaugh as I have a father and brothers there was no way to prove his guilt or innocence\nI should also note that we've been getting a number of voice mail messages about this from across the country and even from around the world already in Hamburg, Germany left this note in our inbox the\nKavanaugh hearings caught the attention of the German press to sue ... what do you decide the opinion though is uniform it's an absolute shock at the lack of respect being shown by the Republican Senate toward the Supreme Court and its own history as the world's greatest deliberative body\nThe shock is not at the partisan tones of the hearing\nThe right left battles are left right battles\nBut what's shocking is the tenor with which the Republicans have been speaking to the Democratic colleagues and the tenor with which the nominee himself used to address the Democratic senators Thursday\nAlready thanks very much for commenting to us in just by way of context to ... ... is a major paper in Germany if you remember\nOur conversations about the Panama Papers the big international investigative report about money hidden in offshore bank accounts to ... one of the major papers that helped drive that forward I Wonder professor for Patrick what's your take is on what all of this means for just America's image around the world how the world is reflecting on us because of the way we're handling\nThis well after our last presidential election I'm not sure image can get any worse um but uh you know I I think that it is a shame that the judicial nomination process has become so broken parties and\nUm and you know the Republicans are just as much to blame if the Democrats what\nJust passed away was unconscionable in my view and I frankly don't blame the Democrats for retaliated um with this nominee a and what's so uh I really think that in in order to make the system\nWorks better we're going to have to come up with some major overhaul and and I think the one solution\nTo kind of restore the dignity tore judicial confirmation process is it's a big change but I think it's necessary change I think we have to ask do we think Supreme Court justices should have life tenure\nIf they didn't have served forty years it wouldn't be Armageddon every time someone retires and there's a replacement if presidents had a knowledge that every two years they get a Supreme Court nomination we would normalized this process\nAnd it would become more I'm sane [laughter] I'm In law professors have been proposing this Eighteen year term for Supreme Court justice\nYeah time you're ... I've I've I've heard it was when I was just gonna ask you about that I've heard that suggested that if it was Eighteen years you know there are nine seats and your every two years basically your feet would come open kind of like clockwork\nThat this might not be quite so much like oh we're making this decision that will look like and our children and our children's children it would still be a big deal but you know Eighteen is less than thirty or forty the question is whether or not that's politically viable\nI Wonder if that just depends on whether we the American people are willing to pound the table and demanded until the large changes if not impossible to change the law it's just difficult but what what do you think\nYeah I mean I think that's probably going to be an unlikely a a\nProposal for the particular set it up right now um but you know I think that this isn't just about the Supreme Court in life tenure because\nI think it's about this particular nominee I don't see the issues around Brett Kavanaugh as being a case of quote unquote retaliation from the Democrats you know there are a lot of issues with this particular nomination I'm In addition to the fact that he would be taking over Anthony Kennedy's\nSeat on the Supreme Court Kennedy being the vote that basically has preserved meaningful access to abortion preserved major civil rights and protections and so on and so on you know\nBooks and readers in Wisconsin [noise] find out more at Wisconsin book festival dot org and\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

concerns that ah Richard raise that uh it went a little too too far I'm and returned out it's a question of of balance but I Would add also I think it's interesting that generally speaking a that a lot of the debate um\nPost a Parkland has focused on\nA these so called red flag laws or I'm\nA limiting the gun access to guns for people a domestic abusers you know the argument or the ... argument for for such a long time was that a\nGuns don't kill people people kill people and it seems that now rather than trying to revive a for example on assault weapons ban uh the assault weapons ban from the nineties\nOr people who are in favor of more um\nUh safeguards gun control are pushing on red flag laws are they're pushing on background checks and it seems like that's a potential uh common ground between people who are\nA very strongly support their Second Amendment or what they view as their Second Amendment gun rights and and folks who would like a um some more uh controls and safeguards speaking\nOf the end are a governor Larry Hogan of Maryland who's a Republican had an a minus rating from the national Rifle Association here he is endorsing a red flag law in this February\nFive said for years um that we need to do more\nTo keep guns out of the hands of the mentally ill\nAnd people with criminal backgrounds that's why we will push for an support what is known as red flag legislation\nIn general this policy would allow family members for\nLaw enforcement to petition the court for a lethal violence protective order issued by a judge which were prohibited individual from having any firearms or ammunition\nIf the judge has clear evidence that the family member foes was an immediate and present danger of causing injury to themselves or to others [noise]\nIndividuals with a mental illness should not have access to fire on various\nThat is Republican governor Larry Hogan of Maryland worth noting that he's a minus rating from the n._r._a. dropped to ... feet as a result of his support of these kinds of red flag laws Chris I Wonder what impact you think\nThat that kind of influence would have on more states passing these kinds of extreme risk laws\nI think it has a positive impact absolutely a and I think governor Hogan actually there is a he's doing the right thing and be you know he's a politician he has to be aware that that has an impact\nOn his NRA rating it has an impact on the rating that Brady gets them as well and I think it relates back to the initial point\nThat I made that as part post Parkland really there is a groundswell of activism on this issue a huge new\nSlate of polls that had been taken which show in every state across this country a vast majority well over fifty percent normally in the seventies or supporting exactly these kinds of measures\nThey're sensible measures they're pragmatic measures and they balance appropriately as the you know that second to none at Wright says of gun owners\nWest at the idea that we all want to be safe in our communities one of the most heartbreaking component says nine job is getting polling\nScope information that really yields two different things and I think it's really important to think about these laws in this context first\nAmericans overall when they ask about their fear associated with being shot one of the most profound quotes I got back from a recent poll is well most people think I have not been shot yet\nAnd and that is a very concerning thank the second is many Americans are actually ashamed\nAbout the epidemic of gun violence in this country and they want pragmatic solutions say certainly applied governor Hoeven forgiving the right thing here but I think he like many politicians are looking at what their constituents want\nAnd moving forward knowing that these are popular and populist positions to take\nA here you Chris in terms of the pragmatic argument but you know when it comes to gun laws their constituents in their constituents I mean Vermont has a good example of that I mean Vermont yes was one of the states to ban bump stocks as part of a larger package of legislation on guns this year back in April for months governor Phil Scott who's a Republican who had an a rating from the n._r._a.\nSigned these laws in these bills into law\nGo to Scott said he changed his mind about them after police\nFoiled an alleged shooter's plans to storm a local high school and basically kill as many people as possible now here is some of the sound from the signing ceremony as he was signing outside the Vermont state house he was being heckled by opponents to gun restrictions listen\nI support the second amendment [noise]\nAre we\nTurn really doing everything we can make our kids in our community safe\n[noise] got\nA point where our kids are afraid to go to school and parents are afraid to put them on a bus [noise]\nHer police don't have the tools they need to protect victims of violence or families can step in to prevent a loved one or take their life [noise] I Know Paul [noise]\nPart of the signing ceremony on the steps of the Vermont state house with Vermont governor Phil Scott who is a Republican Richard Feldman filled in what you hear that moment from the signing ceremony ... what does that tell you about the the nature of this debate in states across the country\nI think in many ways the pro gun community led by the national Rifle Association is somehow cornered itself by its own success\nOn the politics of this issue transcends the policy of this issue and therein lies so much of the problem in getting this to be focused in a way\nThat we can achieve results that work for everyone and we can but not when we focus on the politics but only on the policy we really have to well wind those two\nAnd dealing with the perceptions versus the realities in this society it's highly unlikely that anyone\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the

and Scott Greenberg or a few more different kinds of laws that we should touch on before our time is up\nWe should talk about the minimum age for purchasing long guns and rifles four states California Hawaii Illinois and Florida passed new laws that would raise the minimum age from Eighteen to Twenty one uh Florida State representative who ... who was a Republican\nSponsored new legislation on new gun control after the shooting in Parkland, Florida he had an eighth grade from the n._r._a.\nSerious speaking on WBFO our TV in Miami about why he agreed to raise the ...\nA determining what age someone can do something is a judgment call and we do it in in many areas of our of our law making and so I think was burned out on was the fact that you had an Eighteen year old who did purchase this weapon I think I think without that particular fact you probably wouldn't have seen that [noise]\nWhat about law abiding Floridians who are Eighteen Nineteen Twenty years old some of whom have gone and served our country and fought for our country overseas what do you say to those who feel like their Second Amendment rights are being for the world\nParticularly that group of people that you mentioned are covered in them all so if you have if you're a correctional officer if you're a parole officer if you're a law enforcement officer or or you served in the military society has already said that you're trained and can carry a firearm so this bill would not impair that even if those agents\nThat state rep Hosea reliever in Florida Republican state rep speaking to us for TV in Miami Chris I Wonder how you think it will play out with this law particularly because the n._r._a. is challenging it in court\nYeah stand are as challenging it in court I think a Marion Hammer has been a very effective lobbyists there for a\nAnd R A for a long time um had a suit filed within twenty four hours of that measure passing\nI think that it will certainly withstand judicial scrutiny from our interview 'em and the upheld and I think it's a natural reaction to that a mass shooting involving you know that are often\nUm with schools individuals who are within that timeframe\nOf Eighteen to Twenty one uh and I will note that Florida passed a package of laws at the minimum age being one all of which were a really designed to address the that type of issues that we saw\nA from Parkland at the age of the shooter obviously the fact that this weapon was actually kept in the home where he stayed on secured\nAnd that's why the extreme risk laws so important that we're seeing these kinds of package bills a reviewed and introduced that the most notable point for me is it passed in the state of Florida\nRat has long been one of the strongest a sort of incubator\nOf the ... legislative agenda and I think is very telling on obviously the reactions of Parkland and that that activism that took place immediately following a the Parkland shooting\nI Would like to come back to save storage and the moment but ... but by the way we did a program when we visited Salt Lake city\nAbout guns in the mountain west states and and the nature of gun suicide in the mountain west in which a state representative who joined us showed us want to be safe storage lockers it does open with your fingerprints I tried it it it works it's it's pretty fascinating you can find that conversation online at our website the one a dot org\nBefore we move on to other kinds of gun legislation Richard Feldman could I just get your sense in terms of\n... an hour raise real view on gun legislation ... has said that some measures like bump stock restrictions could be examined maybe through the administration's authority on a federal level rather than the state level\nOr we just shooting ourselves here should we just come out and just see the IRA is not in favor of any new gun legislation that could be passed on a bipartisan basis are we trying to make the n._r._a. more confused fuel and more collaborative than it really is\nWell first let's define something I'm always a little bit of a loss to understand when people talk about the alright ... member of the n._r._a. there five million\nThe board of directors is the senior leadership there the consultants there are many and our race\nThere's my uncle was a card carrying life member of the IRA and we'll show you his card on demand if you ask with great pride\nAs so many will myself included um but I I think we're talking about the senior leadership\nOf NRA here and um again when I said earlier an array finds itself institutionally boxed in a corner of if you're calling it gun control no matter what it is it could mandate\nThat ah when you turn Twenty one you're given a gun they're almost institutionally have to be against it because of the terminology and the political position of the terms gun control\nThey don't mean what we sometimes think they mean are they mean different things to different people at different times which\nYou know what I mean talking about Wayne LaPierre Oliver North of the leadership of the national Rifle Association what we hear you know from the big big Dana lash the main figures who speak with a national voice for the n._r._a. it's the\nYou know the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun it's those ads within the last to say you know they are coming for our freedom and they use their media and the n._r._a. as you know ... you know liberties last safe place that in our re that's who I'm Talking about\nWhat you're talking about that's politics\nThat's galvanizing the true believers that's about membership that's about fundraising that's about a organizing for the next a political event both sides to it and there's nothing unusual about that whether we're talking firearms or the environment\nOr any other hot button issues in America\nEverybody does it that way perhaps we see it a little more distinctly in the a firearm debate than others when we've been put on that side Scott well I just order sides\nI wanted to ah just ah to to add to that that you've seen on some of those issues issues you just mentioned and perhaps uh we're going to begin to see it on gun control as well that in cases where state legislatures are gridlocked and the power of a [noise]\nUm the gun lobby is such that uh that lawmakers won't pass anything [noise] um\n[noise] ah there is another outlet in many states and that's about an issue of Washington state will have a ballot initiative in November that would raise the minimum age to buy a a\nSemi automatic rifle to Twenty one uh Oregon people in Oregon in support of a similar measure came close to getting out on the ballot so we may see that I mean that's that was a pattern with marijuana legalization for example so that that might be a that might be coming in the future\nLet me get to a few more of your calls and comments we did get a call about state gun legislation in Missouri from a person who was working for a democratic state reps office this is what she lifted our inbox\nThis is Emily ... calling from Missouri state representative Tracy me craze office in two thousand sixteen Missouri has house fell six fifty six eliminating all permanent requirements for concealing carry in the state of Missouri leaving a loophole that allows domestic abusers to possess firearms\nSince two thousand sixteen there's been a bipartisan effort to close that loophole\nLeadership and the Missouri legislator will not news that spell or make it a priority to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers instead during the past session we spend our committee time focusing on bills that expand gun rights like house don't Nineteen thirty six known as the guns everywhere
