A. M. U. dot org\nLet's read one more eggs or from the book this is about something that happened to you and your mother or when you were younger not real far from here in Maryland and it is on page eighty one would you mind reading from it's about halfway down page of the ones that part to begins when we were half a mile from home\nSo almost the end of page\nWould you read that for us please a sure [noise]\nAnyway and offer ... when we were as well okay\nWhen we were half a mile from home a Maryland police cars stopped us just like when they stopped us in Mississippi set up in your seat kept ... kept both hands on the wheel and looked straight ahead\nYou took out your University of Maryland id and saw my red black and green African medallion into my public enemy T shirt you told me to set up keep my hands on the dashboard don't say a word\nOfficer knelt down and lifting your window when I saw your face so close to his gun I Want it to snatch it and watch it melt into black grits evidence police started approaching me more often and Mississippi I wanted to super power to melt every gun in the world and the black grits\nOfficer asked why we had Mississippi license plates\nBecause we are residents of Jackson, Mississippi you say I have a post doctoral appointment at the University of Maryland College park have done anything wrong officer\nWhen officer told you to speak up and claim your change lanes without signaling you kept your grip on the steering wheel and said I did not change lanes without signaling you spit up behind me so I signaled and changed lanes officer tried to laugh in your face if he asked for your license in registration\nIs that your main he asked you he needs to show some identification to\nYour hands came off just staring well and you pointed at officers face move away from my car you said that as much as he is Fifteen Years old he does not have identification may I have your badge number please I hated how it sounded when you didn't use contractions\nThe officer as both a bus to step out of the car we will not get out of his car you said louder this time\nWe have done nothing wrong my fist were bald up and I was engine towards the driver's side window you slapped me across much that's what the back of your hand and told me to be quiet and unclean from office right as another officer pulled up\nThe first officer who is now laughing walked back to the second offices car you eventually showed a second officer you license and your University of Maryland id\nOfficer looked at the id flip it over and told us to have a good night\nNever give them a chance to take a shot you finally said after we walked in the apartment and lock the door they will take it they will take it they will take it I Wonder why you said it three times and why you never told me to shoot back\nMississippi Marilyn it doesn't matter where the where you are they will shoot Joe Black but out of the sky every chance they get if you have a heart attack dodging bullets they hide their guns and say you killed yourself\nI hear you I told you and tried to make you laugh why didn't you just said don't instead of does not or doesn't and they instead of their though\nIf I did not know correct English is more likely that officer might have shot us you said oh you wouldn't I told you that for that matter because you were speaking correct English you looked at me like you were thinking you might actually be right key but in the long run correct English will save a black man more than it will hurt you\nWill correct English save you though\nI Do not need saving you said I'm not the one who was an endangered species I'm not either I told you I'm an endangered species would a lot of gas in my stomach I'll be right back that cop gave me to bubble goods you laughed and laughed and laughed until you didn't\nWhile I was in my room change and you told me to write about what I learned from the experience with the police I wasn't sure what the right because I wasn't sure how to live life in a way that didn't give them a chance to shoot us out of the sky\nIt seem like just driving or walking into a house or doing your job or cut it in a grapefruit was all it took to get shot out of the sky and the biggest problem was\nThey were just the only people allowed to walk around and threatening us with guns in prison if they didn't like our style of flying I loved our style or fly\nOut other eggs or for heavy bike here say leave and there is a lot going on to the eggs are but I think one of the census from the last paragraph struck me where you write I wasn't sure how to live life in a way that didn't give them a chance to shoot us out of the sky right is that kind of the crux of it\nYeah I mean that's a crust of a lot of uh the relationship are to talk about in his book with my mother um I'm also talking about a situation where we went to had to go to a new school and eighth grade was first time I've gone to school with white kids\nAnd um if you my best friends from a previous school were there and when my best best friend um took out a butter knife before school started and started trying to cut his grapefruit the same way you did every morning when we were at a school in Jackson and long story short you know the teacher uh eventually told and put the knife away treated a knife as if it was a gun\nOr we both got kicked out of school that day and we got what to buy our mothers and grandmothers\nAnd in that situation I learned that sometimes and often a mock communities um it was black mothers primarily who had to discipline their children for the failures of their teachers\nAnd so uh my mother would always say you know you have to fly right you know don't give them a chance but I'm saying as a Fifteen year old I said I'm not sure what not giving them a chance to look like\nEat in a grapefruit got us in trouble just now you didn't do anything we got in trouble later I Would take a library book out an elaborate without checking it out and I got in trouble so I just wasn't sure\nAbout this this a theory my mom had the you know you can duck them you can dodge them if you just anticipate every move and again anticipation is crucial but what happens to the home life when you spend your entire life outside of the home anticipating white supremacy and white power doing un that's the question I'm trying to asking this section and also in the entire book\nWhat did happen with your home life particularly with with you and your mom as you were trying to grapple with these things that she was telling you or the way of the world and you were trying to understand them how did that affect your relationship with her\nYeah one one way I think a lot of just traditionally American things happen I started to be resentful that my mother was telling me things some things that were raised some things that were wrong um she started to be a a a lot more active\nIn trying to police me as my body group um and I started to have lots and lots of run ins with cops are starting to get kicked out of school more [noise]\nUm but and we could talk about those things sorted we could talk about police but to talk about white people but we we couldn't talk about with things like sexual violence so we couldn't talk about with like domestic abuse she was in an abusive relationship I saw that relationship I reacted to that relationship I tried to fight and protect their front that relationship\nBut I Would never talk to her about that fight in our protection she saw me in relationships that were like difficult for me where I was being bad to myself well I was mistreated people emotionally we didn't know how to talk about any of it so while we're doing really good sort of at talking about how we survive outside of the house\nThe particular kinds of violence as they were happening in my house were completely um silent we never knew how to talk about it and so you know it took me until I was like forty to forty one years old to have the guts to actually write into some of what was happening in our house and try to connect that to what was happening outside of our house\nTo talk more about your literary style but I did want to point out one other aspect of the antics don't you just read\nWhere the officer looked at you and said who is that is that your man there's also this through line about people presuming that black boys are older than they are it was a factor in the shooting of to me or rice the young man who was shot dead in Cleveland, Ohio
