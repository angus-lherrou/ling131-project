A. M. U. dot org let's talk a little bit about your record at HUD be Sean Clark wrote on our website the one eight dot org what can one said holy on Castro actually did while at HUD how did he distinguished himself\nNow thanks for the question we had the most groundbreaking progress when it came to fair housing during my tenure at hug you know for years decades of\nA different democratic administrations have been trying to get done something called the affirmatively furthering fair housing rule essentially this was part of the Nineteen sixty eight fair housing act um that said the secretary of HUD had the obligation to affirmatively further fair housing the problem was that that had never been put into a rule\nOn so in twenty Fifteen we actually came out with this rule which put ... into the fair housing act by requiring cities that got\nA hug money basically taxpayer money to get more serious about ensuring they had equal housing opportunity in their community and I'm\nVery proud of it ah unfortunately that's one of the things that's been rolled back or through a secretary Carson and the Trump Administration a second thing that we did that I was just fantastic for the folks who are able to benefit from it was something called connect home um\nThe vast majority of people living in public housing don't have access to the Internet at home\nAnd we know that you're having Internet access at home today is not a luxury anymore it's a necessity folks that are trying to look for a job kids that are trying to do homework and so on and so we actually created a a\nA public private partnership with Internet service providers housing authorities nonprofits to expand to extend broadband access to families living in public housing\nDean tweeted as past secretary of HUD what do you feel is the best way forward for affordable housing and how is how you doing on this now\nWell I Wish I could say have more confidence in the direction of HUD right now um I think what you have over there is a whole bunch of\n'em a career employees that are dedicated to the mission that are trying to do the right thing but a political leadership that it's not that it could do the mission that wants to blame people for being poor secretary banker yeah which I completely disagree with I think they've taken them in the wrong direction\nI'm the best thing that can be done is is number one to invest the resources\nTo create more housing that as a formidable to the middle class and of course to low income individuals ah and\nUp and down the line from the ... the federal level state level and local level to do that and then also the ... work with the private sector in important ways for instance at the local level to figure out\nTo make affordable housing more develop a bull\nYou spent some time in Iowa you were in Des Moines last week supporting Democrats there who are running for office and we know that President Trump's trade policies toward China are really hitting some farmers in Iowa pretty hard last month I was agriculture secretary Mike nags spoke to CNBC about what impact that that's having at home\nWhile it's as we head into the twenty Eighteen harvest season for corn and soybean out here in Iowa this escalation of the trade conflict really couldn't come at a worse time so it is impacting our markets and that's impacting our farmers so ah are farmers to understand that there are issues that need to be resolved particularly what China\nAre but there is no doubt that the retaliatory tariffs are impacting our marketplace and that's impacting our producers negatively\nThat's Mike ... the secretary of agriculture in Iowa speaking to CNBC\nI Wonder if you've been hearing what you've been hearing rather from farmers and pork producers and others in agriculture as you're making trips through Iowa and and elsewhere are some of them okay what's the current state of relations the U.S China they understand what President Trump is trying to do and agree that they tend to be more posed what are you hearing\nHere a lot of concern a lot of worry and ah folks are also wondering what's the plan here\nOr you know I think a lot of folks are can believe that we can improve our trade relationship with China\nBut they think the president has gone about it are completely the wrong way in this go it alone style very radically starting a trade war that is going to hurt Iowa farmers they're also disappointed in their representatives are folks like Steve King right now that they felt feel have sat idly by\nA while the president has done this or David Young is another good example out there and so I heard a disappointment with the leadership of of uh of some of those Republican congressional representatives and also tremendous concern because President Trump is so erratic when it comes to China\nNow my neck has spoken positively about the newly renegotiated NAFTA agreements between Mexico and Canada what about the trade deals that the president has been making in his time thus far particularly if to become president and twenty twenty and I have to enter office with these deals as a starting point\nWe should always begin I'm from the premise that we want to ensure that our trade deals are good for American workers\nUh we also want to ensure of course that American companies who are engaged in trade are are treated fairly and uh that\nWe don't get taken advantage of and so I don't I don't think folks disagree with that I think what folks disagree with is how erratic Donald Trump has been and so you know in San Antonio we actually hosted in Nineteen Ninety two or Ninety three the signing of NAFTA\nAnd we know that there are states that have benefited more than others from NAFTA\nOne of the challenges for this president and the next president is to strike trade deals that can benefit as much of the United states is possible we've seen some of the benefits of of trade deals in San Antonio we've had additional investment\nUh from auto manufacturing a to a number of on to other industries certainly along the border of taxes logistics warehousing\nI'm so Texas probably has been the biggest beneficiary of that\nWe always need to look at our trade deals for perspective the American worker and how they can benefit\nWhat do you say the workers though who understand where President Trump is coming from who say you know I I appreciate the value of trade but I see what's happened in my town how many factories have closed how many jobs have been lost I see immigration increasing in the U. S.\nLike the rest of the world is siphoning off the best of trade and leaving people like me to kind of scoop up the drags and hopefully cobble life together what do you say that those folks in terms of the future of trade here [noise]\nUh what I say is that number one I'm\nYou know we need to make investments so that folks can be successful in this twenty first century global economy\nUm we have to be smart because I Do think we can improve these trade deals these relationships at the same time uh we're far past the point where the United states is just going to close its doors and not be part of a global trade relationship\nUm so the question becomes how do we ensure that you and your family are well positioned to thrive in this twenty first century global economy\nGive me one example of one of those investments you would start working on day one\nNo I I Would start working on um a essentially understanding in especially in these hard hit Midwestern communities\nUnderstanding the assets of each of those communities um your water the skills that we can invest in in folks who live in those communities what are the industries that may not be located there now that we can actively along with the private sector work on getting there\nAre and then how does that relate to to each of these trade deals and the thing is that uh what's missing from the Trump Administration is any kind of\nA thoughtful plan on these things in fact even with this latest a rebuke of NAFTA it seemed like they were rushing right through the finish line and just cobbled together whatever they could get at the end or it none of these things seem to have a plan behind\nA significant part of your story is obviously an immigrant story so I Want to ask you about immigration policy particularly because of the significant enthusiasm that Trump supporters have for his stance on immigration even if not on all of his policies you right in the book\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.
