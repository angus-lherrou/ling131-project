P. R. dot org and like us on Facebook at the ideas network\nHundred days and most people remember as a long weekend which is unfortunate that there's this narrative that is that has come up that is a race so many people that suggested there was like a small group of people who started everything who came in St Louis who organized everybody the organizations did that work and that's just simply not true someone I think about like how I use my platform of how I think about my work\nIs it I'm awful that I was one of many people in the book I highly so many people who were industry in St Louis who did incredible work for a home without you wouldn't there would be no protests are so that is important to me and then the second part is that I Know that the platform doesn't only exist for me that\nUh one of the important things about having the platform and access is that not only do I try to make sure that the truth is president everyone but I also know that I'm not the only person that can bring the truth so you don't know the people who said all the protesters every night or the\nThe people who got people out of jail or the people who helped organize some of the biggest actions that people how to spread across the country like you've never heard those names and in the book I Try and write about those people to you that I Know them because I was there we were in the middle of the street together\nBut this narrative that there's like a small set of people who like started every thing in the movement or that there's a small set of organization to like\nWhat the catalyst for the protest is just not a true narrative\nThere's always this tension with movements that\nHave certain people sort of leaders to become more prominent\nWas concerned about but who profits off to cause I mean there are some who would critique the book and the podcast as a way to profit off of black lives matter how do you respond to that and I also wonder if there is any plan to use any of the proceeds from the book to help the cause\nIs it's interesting I think I'm always shut you know I feel like a liver pretty public life and I'm always shocked um by some of the the way the question gets asked so like it's public that or a portion of all the proceeds went to sleep in a portion of all the pre order sales went to the end up ... pi legal Defense Fund that was\nPublic I did it 'cause it was important and\nIt was my way of saying that like I Want you to buy the book but the book also like I Want the process of buying the book to also do more work than just buying the book right so like that's I think about the book specifically\nBut in general this basic I'm mindful of this when we started camping zero which is like our our biggest project started twenty Fifteen a we actually didn't participate in the nonprofit funding like the nonprofit sort of race for funding specifically because of the question that you asked\nSo over the past three years we raised a about a hundred and sixty thousand dollars per year which is not a lot of money and the grand scheme of nonprofit than we did it so that\nWe could just raise enough money to do the work that we thought was important right so we created the first of the database of police shooting contracts at first a public database of use of force policies continue to do a lot of data work that hasn't been done before continue to support organizes around the country and really disagree projects [noise]\nNo I I Know paid staff I'm not a I'm a salary from this stuff so we try to do it is like\nWith just the bare necessities so that it's not this question of like profit ah\nIn with the cash you know like I could have the packets could have just been my voice but I don't think that makes sense so I invited Brittany Sam and Clinton being part of it they get paid as a part of the broadcast because I think that that makes sense um and it's not like some huge money maker but it does allow us to like be able to be in a place where we don't have to\nRely on a nonprofit a\nComplex to like fund our work to do this really well\nAnd you know it's like I ... the way that I exist in the world right now is like not necessarily a sustainable way I'm not by state allows me to like\nOh no no I mean like I don't have you know it's like a [laughter] now late at night and that's what I have a salary but um you know when I quit it was ...\nAnd it's like you know I'd defaulted on my student loans like he was a really rough um it was rough [laughter] only this only a couple of months ago was the first time I've actually lived alone since the protests have essentially been saying in the basement of a ... like my second parents after the past three years right so\nYou know so that's not us as you know wants to get married in the in the basement up there right second parents that's not the same as I say it but it's like it's the right way that I Want to be in the work right now right that like\nThere are these narratives of like oh I made it gives you ... dollars and it's like well now you see me on the news you hear in a pod cast you like see me out of an event that means a lot to you and like that automatically means of wealth to some people and that's just not\nThe case of that I've had high incomes and before you know that there was any income and wealth is pretty significant though\nUm some people have been like really confused by that\nLet's talk a little more about policing one of the members of the one eight text club writes police hold a significant position of power in the legal system they should be held to a higher standard than those without power but instead they are held to a lower standard and given special treatment and a free pass in our courts and society\nContrast that with another text club or who wrote as time goes on society will bring about necessary reform but to denigrate and disregard the entire police force as an institution is ludicrous\nWhat do you think yeah I think you know I think for for\n... two thousand years we slit people's arresting call their health care we literally drained people's blood down and we were like ... it's going to drain out all the impurities and people were like oh they their blood pressure they change it's like no they didn't have any blood rather than actually isn't a solution but we did it for two thousand years it was one of the most popular medical procedures\nBut it didn't work so the goal is to save people's lives it's like actually wasn't a good thing or if the goal was to like pretend that you were doing good and like this was excellent and I think about policing it's like if the goal is to stop crime or like to to do any of that work like it just isn't whether how no matter how you feel about the police that just isn't happening so\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W.

I can remember and now with us that and it's one of the reasons that I wrote the chapter was that I Know that we walk into every room bringing much more than we name and one of the things that I bring into every room is what does it mean to be worthy that if she could leave it feels like anybody could leave\nAnd I like that is something I've had to sort of work within an grow with as an adult to make sure that that doesn't hurt me or other people and that's important as we think about what it means to organize has had like we're all walk into rooms and meeting people where they are part of meeting people where they are as we know where we are and like I think that that has to be like a\nCore part of it that the part that you read about like how we remember pain and I remember a joy is that for so many people you think about like the constraints would a million people who grow up in marginalized communities where there's poverty race\nOr or any other aspect of it and they they they learn the constraints really well I Know I knew how much money we had as a family and I knew would pass home and not to ask why new\nLike when we didn't have toys how to make fun outside and you know about a lot of people talk about growing up poor but I said one of the hard part is like when we grow up and sometimes we still only see a world of constraint semi the constraints becomes so great and the way that we learn how to survive\nThat we can start to ... and things beyond and if we're ever going to win like it'll be like a deep imagination that gets us to the other side\nAnd like you didn't know that they're seeing the right in the left is it the right has always re packaging old narratives for a new time the left we're always engaged in the most intense make believe that like we're always trying to tell a story about a world that nobody's ever seen before but we know it's possible you've never seen health care for all but like you believe that\nYou've never seen a world where every woman has a right to choose like we believe that that's real and like\nHave to be really good storyteller by the future that you've never seen if you aren't able to tell stories about the world that you live and how you enter the world\n[noise] you also share fairly late in the book the fact that you are a survivor of sexual assault something that you write happen to you numerous times at a rather young age\nAnd you connect that with what you called the quiet quiet about the salt but also quite about your own identity and your sexuality you've been out for some time in the book you write in part quote\nI think about the quiet instead of the closet because I've never seen any part of myself from myself or others you go on to write quote but I grew up quieter about the parts of myself that I didn't think anyone would love\nThe parts that I had never seen loved in others unquote how does that interact with the person you became\nYeah you know one of the reasons I was important for me to be out and very very um [noise] I mean about for a long time but to be publicly out in a in a very ... way when the protests began with like I didn't want any kid growing up who was also gay to think that the only way to do this or it publicly with to to be in the closet and\nAh you know that chapter started from this tweet that I wrote a long time ago that was like just because you didn't know doesn't mean it wasn't real like I was in the quiet and not the closet\nAnd ah you know I I Walk into every room as a gay black man I'm like that is real to me it's important so there was no way for me to write a book about the work that we've done the work to all of us have collective with a social justice or the work that we need to do without talking about a mile an identity\nThat I wrote about the the sexual assault because it was re oh it's one of the things that I haven't really talked much about I mean it's in the book now so it's not just you know it's not something that only I Know\nUm [noise] but it was like sort of\nIt was free in some ways to finally just stay and like not have to tiptoe around and not be ashamed to say that this happened in and it was real and it was awful and\nYou know when I told when I when I finally taught a couple of years later and they realize that he had actually been sexually abusing like a whole set of kids who are even younger than me um\nTo like you know speaking up actually made a difference in other people's lives and like that was important\nUm but I had to like you know I write about in the book is I like my own relationship to my body I had to learn that had to learn what it meant to be in relation with other people and like it'd be one where we were ... years and we both have the same amount of power because that wasn't the first experience with my body right as I wanted to just give language to that\nHow far do you think that that outlook is actually goes I mean I I'm Out I've been out from most of my all your career if not all of my career\nBut I Know that there's you know there's this aspect of what I Believe is referred to as an implied attribute where it's kind of known but not experience so there's a difference between me saying Oh yes I'm active with the national lesbian and gay journalist association\nAs opposed to me showing up you know a picture of me at a bar with my shirt off making out with a guy in the corner like it's a whole different kind of being out because people are OK knowing it in the abstract but they don't want to know that you're actually like a gay person who does good things and that changes the conception\nDo you find that there's a line in terms of identity versus full identification like okay you know let's not say anything more about this let's not make them think any more about my that even they have to be\nHere you know like\nI think we have to complicate this idea of like what it means to show up and gave the bike and there's not one way right that there is not to waste to the gate and like\nThe wife of pride parade is really really little they're like yeah so like sometimes it is me wearing rainbow shoes right and sometimes it is me just like going on a date and like that and like those are both valid ways to jump in and the identity that I Am right\nUh so so yeah there definitely people who are frustrated me feel like I'm not gay enough in like\nPublicly as possible and like you know it's one of the things too that it's like well how much of my life dry leaves like other people can feel like it's real re\nSo like I Know that you know we're working with the research right now and trying to think about HIV testing that like one of the things that some new research suggests is that\nIt's not that people when people don't get tested it's not they don't care about their health or that they're necessarily afraid of their results but that\nOr did they actually nervous about showing up at a facility and in cities that are that function as small towns and they're nervous about seeing somebody they went to high school with seeing like somebody's cousin and a friend like that they actually are nervous about like what privacy really be private right and like how do you actually or how do you set up a testing mechanism that gets around that that to me it's fascinating\nAnd like so we don't quite work around that but like I have I don't feel like I Need to talk about every two seconds for people to be like they're actually cares about being gay right\nSo the other thing I'll say that there's some people who I can really homophobic but like me and that's now for that I don't want to be like a safe spot for your I hate\nYou also talk very frankly in the book about your bed for mayor of Baltimore your willingness to meet with President Obama and with the presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders you write that because of your willingness to engage quote\nThere were calls from within the protest community and from without accusing me of political grandstanding and labeling the a sellout unquote I Wonder how you are finding your way\nForward in these new endeavors whether it's politics hosting a podcast so in a way you are part of a media so to speak and reconciling that was kind of the social justice activism word that you're still ... involved in is that challenging to kind of have a foot in both worlds as it were\nYou know it's like a both and drape that like you know it's interesting is that all those people who who come in for for quote participating in the system those are the same people running for office today right those are the same people who like\nI tell them everybody to vote who tell people not to vote in twenty sixteen who said that you're wasting your vote who said that politics to matter and like why would you support I remember I support Hillary in the Washington Post and people literally when like you're wasting your employment I Can't believe you did that like president doesn't have any bearing this is just for show and it's like\nNobody is saying that now that is that what that was a wild statement of the day and it's wild to say today saying that people got a I it's unfortunate that like people getting it took all of the chaos that this president continues to\n\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public

season of your show where one of the characters his show runner who are I'm sure would kill to be unimpressed or talking about a ... a\nLittle bit it's it's strange and you know one of the things we wanted to talk about we're putting the season together is this weird moment we're in now of of the our tourist show runner which is really like a new development in the last ten years or so um\nIt it strikes me as very odd because I I don't think that I'm a a a brilliant genius who you know touches a show and turned it into gold and it all just\nYou know flows out of the pencil which is connected to my brain um ... it's a very collaborative process and we have people making a better every step of the way I have an amazing writing room\nThe cast brings so much the designs by leave they had all the uh directors brings so much to the episodes of the the story board animators the editors um it it it really it takes a village um so it's odd but yes I Am\nAnd talking about how I made the show because it's not have a TV show gets made at all and I think anyone who presents that as how a TV show gets made is trying to sell something\nBut then what exactly does the white board in the writers' room look like when you've got the word play the slap stick the ponds and the ... falls a overlaid on some of the deep dark themes that runs throughout the season and the show also has a memory yeah on memory his his mistakes\nFor him it's a very I mean in a lot of ways I think we write the show like a drama but we're a room full of comedy writers that we can't help but make it funny\nUm but we really are mostly interested in you know what is the character arc of the season what are the themes we're looking to explore what are the consequences of these actions you know we we take it very seriously um\nYou know but then in the middle of that we we remember like All right and this guy's talking octopus or you know we're we're exploring familial trauma here uh but also this woman is dating or a man that is clearly just a three small boys stacked on top of each other under trench coat like little rascals [laughter]\nUm so this is quite serious\nBut the stories themselves can be quite silly you know one way I think of it\nIs is retelling stories about real grounded characters in the crazy cartoon universe\nLots of animated shows have gotten made over the last Twenty years thanks to the success of The Simpsons largely but not shows as deep and as adult as Beau jak or who to whom do you think you owe your origins in television ... who do you see is your four [laughter]\nOh you mean by influencing yeah where do you mean literally the people who helped me have a television show\nNot I mean the shows that you watch or or even if you weren't that into them the shows that made it possible for a show like Bo jak to be such a hit with American Audi well I I think\nYou know the obviously the the the giants as The Simpsons and I think it would be disingenuous for me to claim that that show had had no influence on me\nOr my show or the success of my show you know one at one of the best comments I got on the the first season a bow jak if someone said it felt like a season long version of a sad episode of the Simpson [noise] um but also when I was pitching the show I I really wanted it to exist\nOutside of the the bubble um\nOr the perceived bubble of animated TV you know I said ah we're going to ... when we start season one you're gonna watch it and at first it's going to feel like a typical animated show like a a Simpsons or South Park\nBut then over the course of the season as you realize what's happening is going to feel more like a girls or even a Mad Men\nUm and and so I I wanted this to feel more like a drama the um and to really take things seriously a in a way that people don't expect the animation too even though I think a lot of animated shows actually do take things very seriously\nUm but but but those shows were certainly influences as\nWell at one of the main attractions of your show for me are the amazing voice performances that you have oh yeah well our net as Beau jak and he said there are credible princess Carolyn the sort of aging Hollywood manager producer cat ah and I met a lot of others to even have a Keith Olbermann in there at some yeah I'm\nIs one of the first people we cast [laughter] and I was cast her whale as a newscaster well uh we we had in the script to um you know a a a Keith Olbermann whale type and are casting director Linda ... said I think we can get Keith Olbermann to play this role and really and we call them like yeah sounds like fun\nUm and he's fantastic we keep bringing back season after season\nAnd you know what am I a first memories of making a show and realizing how fun it was going to be was we had Keith on the phone from New York and we had to do\nThen at the end we said we also get you making some whale noises and you know this is Keith Olbermann who I thought of as a very serious man are goofing around going\n[noise] you know making whale noises and I thought this would be a fun show I've [laughter] well\nOne of your other main characters is Diane a Vietnamese American voiced by actress Allison Aubrey who is phenomenal now you gave us late interview recently and also a Twitter thread which is which is the way you have to do with these days and you mentioned\nOne ramification of that choice casting Alison breeze Diane that you tend to avoid referencing her Asian American is in the show now deceased and that's changed Diane does take a trip\nTo the Vietnam of her heritage and and talks a lot about how that affects her um how did her casting come about and how did you begin to have second thoughts about it\nWell um we can is Alison ah in in the first season and we were about I'm a third of the way into the season when we cast and we've been working a with a different actress\nUm who had to drop out of the show all of a sudden because another show she was on got picked up and there was a contractual issue so she couldn't be lead on our show any more um and so we really scrambled and Alison came in and we thought she was amazing and she's going to a a great job ever since\nUm but more and more uh as I was looking around at the cast and and thinking about\nYou know how how the show was put together and and and the makeup of the cast it started to dawn on me that\nEveryone in our house was white and our main cast and a lot of the recurring people were we were hiring were white as well and this wasn't an intentional thing uh that I was doing as a racist man um it was just I was not paying attention and we were passing these characters one at a time\nUh and I realized that oh this is my I Need to start paying better attention to 'em and so you know since then we've tried due to cast a wider net and look particularly for for diverse voices\nOr try to have more people of color on the show but when it comes to Dianne specifically um you know I think there is a a real problem in this industry of casting white people in Asian roles\nAnd I was not a as aware of that when we first started the show as I Am now and so that's something that I Would do differently as casting a white person to play a prominent Asian character and you know as I said in these other interviews\nUm I think it's hurt the show because I think my own self consciousness has prevented us from telling Asian Stories I think because I guess I didn't want people to talk about this it felt like this is a mistake we made\nAnd if I can just you know avoid it or you know glide passed it then you know maybe this won't become an issue where this won't become the thing that I end up talking about in every interview and I think that was a disservice to the character um because I I think it ended up\nYou know we we ended up treating her as just like a white character or as a race didn't matter\nAnd it's it's difficult that our show because in some ways race doesn't matter because there was also talking ... you know in theaters and giraffes walking around so it's hard to say\nHow is an Asian American humans experience that different from a white American humans experience but I I think there are differences and I'm more interested in exploring them now and I feel like\nYou are listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin

card work in New York a decidedly low tech job but some productions refused to do without\nJoining us from NPR in New York is the owner of NYC cue cards while the fairest and he's worked three decades behind the scenes on shows including Saturday Night live while the fairest and welcome to one a\nMe Joshua thanks for it was great to be here how did you get into the cue cards business a while you know I went to uh Syracuse and I wanted to be a writer or major and writing and moved to New York and to you know my brother was working at started a lot of farmers receptionist\nAnd ah they knew that you car guy so he recommended me even though my printing was terrible and ah ah I got the job and I do know I Do to just get my foot in the door and to make writing connections and uh you know I did I did make somebody could actually that I wrote for ...\nMyself so I kept under the cue cards and I got really good at doing cue cards very quickly and ah you know cut to twenty eight twenty nine years later I own my own company I've been doing it for that long and running a lot of shows so\nClearly this was not the kind of writing that you had in mind but what was it about doing the cue cards that you liked\nYou know I I don't know I think one of the specially on Saturday Night live\nThe live aspect of it and being out there you know as close to the cameras as you can be without being on camera\nA and helping the actors and helping the guest stars or through the shows and through this hard show that the you know they'd probably a lot of them have never done live T before there was something very rewarding about that and\nUm I didn't crack under pressure and with the changes and all the stress that was involved with that and that was something that they the show noticed and uh you know I rose up pretty quickly in the ranks\nTell us about your company what shows does your company do cue cards for\nUh the ... are four main shows that are that are that tape all year our Saturday Night live\nUm the Tonight Show Jimmy Fallon late night with Seth Meyers and then we do Conan on the west coast as well those are four main shows um and then we will do some reality shows we do a master we do all the Project Runway that shoot\nAnd then we do to show any show that comes to that town that he's ... guards you know work on that as well\nWhat kinds of people do well at this line of for\nThe first thing we look for is neat printing\nNow my penmanship is fairly often um I think that was why when I was on a med school ... years ago people were like yep we've seen your handwriting [laughter] so I Wonder exactly what you're looking for in terms of printing I as a cue cards I've seen her all written in all caps yes\nCorrect It's you know it's it's a this is it's a it's block lettering it's all caps um it's it's really about the spacing between ... between the letters and the word in a space in between the words and the space in between the sentences\nIt's not something like I Can't just bring somebody off the street and say okay start doing your guards it's almost like you know you need I Need to train them for like two or three weeks\nI'm just to get them there's so many different little things you have to learn\nUm two or three weeks of raining yeah it it 'cause you 'cause it's it's not it's you can't just say you can't just tell them all the rules right you know what I mean I Can't just interview spared okay these are all the rules you need to learn memorized these new things come up every time there's new like\nEye is capitalized only in certain words it's not capitalized in drawing whereas where how to end the card a card should end on a period or ... or ... or a comma in if not that you know how to end it so that it slows the next car just so many different roles where you can only learn it by by doing it and practicing it\nWe're speaking to Wally ... and the founder of NYC cue cards the exclusive cue card provider in New York\nOkay so let's say you're working for me for you know late night with Joshua Johnson and I come out to do my opening monologue I've just hired your company and I said Wylie I'm really excited to be working for you guys let's start building this relationship\nTell me the kinds of things that you are going to want to know for me to figure out how to be a good cue card vendor for me\nAll right first thing I ask you how's your eyesight\nLike near sighted or glasses okay so your glasses were your glasses on the show where you were contacts are we're not we're either I don't really like contacts hourglasses okay so you're wearing glasses so you can see fine I won't have to if you didn't wear glasses and you want to wear contacts I could put your letters bigger so that you could see but that would also make less roads and the card\nAnd it would make it harder for you to ... to flow to the ... like if you're ... especially if you're telling jokes\nSo I Would recommend glasses or contacts for you if you know if you want to say you got to wear your glasses you'll be fine reading cards and then I Would just you know we would we would have Russell's ride would practice with you if you've never read cue cards before that something you'd want to\nNeed to think about if I'm reading cue cards from you or look\nDirectly at the cue cards don't look away because it'll then we'll look like you're reading the cue cards\n... how do you mean looking at a rally as well if you were doing a sketch they say you were doing a sketch with your band leader and I had cue cards near the bad leader and positioned in a way that you would want to play to those cue cards now if you were looking at the cue cards and then at the bandleader going back and forth between the card in the bed later\nThe audience would be like oh he's we obviously reading something\nBut if you just played those cue cards it would look on camera like you were talking directly to that person I'm ... directly above the camera above the camera above the cameras so yeah so I'll I we won't be depending on where you are in positions of the camera\nI'll make the cards the right the lettering the right side so that you look directly at that card it looks like you're looking right into the camera so\nYour cue card holders are kind of part of the technical direction the the blocking of a scene in terms of figuring out where the performers need to look to look proper\nThat's exactly right especially with Saturday Night live that's what I that's my main job but I'm there on Thursdays from Fridays that's all we do all day is block sketches and I'll be out there with one set of cards working with the actor's working with the host figuring out where I'm going to put\nThe cars and I work with the director of the stage managers well we're all kind of confirmed and I think I think I Need the cards here and then I'll ask the actors if they need an extra set somewhere else where I maybe didn't think of just want to make sure that they're covered where they're from comfortable\nSince you mentioned Saturday Night live what does a typical work week at SNL looked like for someone who's doing cue cards for that show do you just come in Saturday afternoon and scribble furiously unfilled eleven thirty five PM\nI Wish it were that a simple [laughter] now we we start on Thursday restart rehearsal is on Thursday and Thursdays a light day\nSo the music the musical group or interests for the first half of the day and then we'll ... we'll be in there about noon and will print well rehearsed maybe like three or four sketches and will only put one one set of each sketch because I have to figure out how many sets we need so there's no reason to print more and it\nIt will change from Thursday the sketches we do on Thursday we'll go through a rewrite session on Thursday night and most most of the time will be completely rewritten from Thursday Friday\nAnd then friday is the same process except we do about eight or nine sketches same process reprint put that on friday we have to do we have to make copies we call it do being the cards so it makes sense and then we I mean that we do that we don't have the without the luxury of waiting until Saturday to dupe the friday sketches because Saturday show day\nSo everything's print that I have about eight people there on friday just yeah basically writing all day I have the fun job I'm Out on the set blocking working with the actress having fun they're sitting underneath the bleachers from eleven o'clock to uh sometimes you know twelve or one o'clock in the morning just printing cards so long it's a long day for them\nWhat kind of person would want to take that kind of a job it doesn't sound like a very glamorous way to be near the TV business are you lower you mostly employing people who are looking for a foot in the door or do you have like veteran cue card writers working for ...\nThere is a little bit of both um mostly um\nPeople that are trying to get a footnote I encouraged that I I Try to tell them cue cards is not a career I I did make it a career for myself\nBut there's not much room if you want to do it great for your lives that's awesome but you should be looking to do something else I'm encouraging them I'm helping them I'm introduced and the people that want they\nThan in a career that they want to do mostly most of it's entertainment related but yeah you sit those long days or friday but that leads to Saturday where ever heard that they may come out from behind the scenes and never her sing with me 'cause I Can't\nI Can't hold for sketches at one time you know four sets of cars at one time so I Need other people out there and then that's kind of the fun part of it\nHow close up to Showtime safe for Saturday Night live how close are you writing after Showtime we", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Kathleen Dunn", "city": "Madison", "day": "11"}
