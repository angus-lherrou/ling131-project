Bush administration have tried to increase water deliveries to farmers and California's massive Central Valley project where water from snow fed reservoirs gets pumped south to arid farmland but those deliveries are perennially cutback due to attempts to protect endangered fish and throat\nThe president's order would speed up the current review of this as well as to other projects in Oregon and Washington if environmental restrictions are loose and there will likely be a pro long legal battle\nAnd one of the biggest champions of this latest plan is deputy interior secretary David Bernhardt used to lobby for the frozen ... west ones water district one of the largest and most influential water agencies in the west Kirk Siegler NPR News\nPeople in a mass caravan at the Guatemala Mexico border or using ropes and rats to travel across the nearby river after Mexico refused entry to anyone without a valid passport or visa others though are applying for refugee status in Mexico\nAnd Mexico is offering some uh forty five date visitor pass\nYou're listening to NPR News from Washington\n\nViolence has disrupted Afghanistan's long delayed parliamentary elections several people are dead many others injured after a suicide bomber attacked a polling station set up a at a school in Kabul today Jennifer glass has more from ...\nThe suicide bomber was trying to get into a polling station when he detonated explosives killing and wounding police and civilians it is so far the biggest single attack on the election\nThere's been a number of bombings and attacks around the country both the Taliban at Islamic state warn voters to stay away from the polls but Afghans have been defiant standing in long lines to cast their votes in a parliamentary contest that was supposed to be held three years ago it was far from perfect\nProblems with technology and logistics at polling stations opened late or not at all so the voting has been extended through Sunday at nearly four hundred voting sites\nFor NPR News I'm Jennifer glass in Kabul\nWas frozen food and packing\nCompany in Minnesota is recalling more than two hundred twelve thousand pounds of ready to eat pork and chicken products authorities say the meat contains vegetables may have been contaminated with salmonella and listeria\nUs agricultural department says the products were shipped from buddies kitchen and sold in Arizona California Georgia Illinois Minnesota Missouri and New Jersey the USDA says buddies vegetable supplier found that problem\nAnd he said so far there haven't been any reports of illnesses filed but they are urging consumers not to eat the products\nOn Janine hurts and you're listening to NPR News from Washington\n\nSupport for NPR comes from NPR stations other contributors include Sierra Nevada Brewing Company family owned operated and argued over since Nineteen eighty ...\nOn line over the air or in a bottle more FBI or Nevada dot com\nYou're listening to the ideas network of Wisconsin Public radio join the conversation by emailing ideas at W. P. R. dot org and like us on Facebook at the ideas network\nHey there everybody welcome to live wire I'm Luke Burbank how's it going hope you're having a good week and I certainly have a for reasons that I Am about to explain from the stage of the Alberta rose theater in Portland or to take a listen to this [noise]\n\nIf I seem a little\nCalmer a little more at peace a little more centered than normal\nStanding up here it's not an accident people I recently started meditating [noise]\nAnd it is changing my life technically I have not officially started the meditation\n[noise] but I downloaded a meditation apt to my phone [noise]\nWhich as you know is the hardest part about meditating I Believe the Dalai Lama\nSaid that\nThis is the first meditation apple I have\nDownloaded to my phone I'd like to tell you that but it is not true [noise]\nHave a folder on my phone that is just basically like the enlightenment and graveyard\nIt is full of meditation apps and breathing apps\nAnd various things like that that I have downloaded\nAnd never even opened\n'cause I like to hear about it or I I read about it on slate and I'm like this is the one that is going to change my life and then I downloaded and then it doesn't really changed my life even though I have been on this journey pretty much my entire life to try to find\nThe thing whatever it is it's going to actually make me feel some sense of inner peace and happiness like even when I was a kid when I was ten years old this was my little ritual I Would do my chores on a Saturday or get my allowance which was two bucks\n[noise] I Would ride my bike to the Jack in the box near our house and I would get a jumbo jak for Ninety nine cents\nAnd I would get some fries with the rest of the money I'm sidebar that was about Thirty years ago and three decades later he going price for a jumbo jak hovers around Ninety nine cents still [noise]\nWhich seems like a big red flag [noise]\nSo I gave my little food and I'd ride my bike home and I would sit on my bed which was all made in my little room that was all cleaned from doing my chores and I would get the food set up no take out\nThe first French fry and I didn't catch up now bite into it and then the moment that I was biting into that French fry I Would feel a total sense of calm [noise]\nThat would last for upwards of Fifteen seconds because then it was\nTo start thinking about the next thing whatever that was and even though intellectually even then I understood that this idea of having to have everything perfect even though I knew that was not like\nThe recipe for happiness I sort of have continued to live my life thinking that if I can just get everything perfect\nFrom the are Irish butter rose theater this week for a bank\nI'm your host we are here with George Saunders his latest book is Lincoln in the bar do this book is about Abraham Lincoln's son willy who passes away and he's in the bar do which is sort of a limbo I guess of sorts\nAnd a ... you said you had the idea for many years ago but then you started working on in earnest for about four years or so when did you realize you really have something\nYou know there's in the book one of the things I did was I I uh quoted from historical sources verbatim it was like plagiarized in Memphis is that it was an amazing part of the book yeah\nAnd so there was just an afternoon where I I had typed up all these historical sources cut them up with scissors was on the floor arranging it kind of feel like I'm just avoiding writing this is this is an elaborate we're doing a collage [laughter] yeah and then at one point it described his party that the Lincoln's head and\nIt was kind of his party that sent the sun into the death spiral 'cause it's very loud party in the White House\nSo um I was arranging these bits and suddenly\nThis magical thing happened every writer craves which is it's stopping writing and it started being event\nIt just it just felt wow that party has happened in front of my eyes so it was kind of the realization that even that weird thing that had nothing to do with me typing new tax was part of my uh attempt to emotionally moved to the audience and then I thought oh this is really weird and actually if there's a great feeling like you're being a little naughty\nAh like someone's gonna really hate the you know and and that's actually the feeling you want because if you can convert that person who says as his bunch this fake news you know or whatever is that\nTo be forty five minute timeout on those terms if you can convert\nThe skeptic then then you're really an intimate communication with your readers\nUm you obviously had to do a ton of research about about Lincoln as well and about the time and did you find out stuff about Abraham Lincoln that you had not previously no\nYeah I just fell in love with him I mean he's the one thing was that he was actually even though he was known as being ugly use incredibly attractive to women\nWomen ... all we know really really drawn to him very kind very tall kind of powerful guy and he he loves his wife so much so one of the ways he self gamed was to deflect his attention from young women he had a whole system will kind of\nYou know turning away from them in the name of not aggravating married not making your own happy so I thought that was kinda cool where do you find out something like that has made it up\nNo yeah I Know the new ... you are a master of George Saunders\nBut also you know the thing is I I I came to love about him and said here's a guy who's you know a he has no he's in the last four years of his life making incredible progress ... learning new stuff everyday\nKilling tens of thousands of young men with his mistakes you know and if you track those last three years he's somebody who just kept opening up an opening up and I think his I mean this is my interpretation but I think his eagle just really shrunk\nAnd he became so involved in trying to bring benefit for everybody else that I I mean Buddhism I Would say he's a ... and somebody who's a initially very large ego\nIn the in the face of this pain kind of shrunk and ah so to watch them at the end having realizations about race that we're still not quite you know we still haven't really internalize was kind of really moving you know\nWhat'd you say that stands in contrast to the current president\n\nWhen you're when you're going to weaken Peter under a softball question that's going to pop up well I actually\nI Do want to talk a little bit about that world with you because you wrote a piece back in June of twenty sixteen or at least that was one was published in the New Yorker uh Wendy presidential campaign was still in full swing and\nI still think it was probably for me maybe one of the more eliminating things about the the sort of rise of Donald Trump you went on the campaign trail and just talk to people at his various rallies um\nDid that then to make you less surprised than the rest of us when he actually won or were you a shock\nTo know I we weren't really shocked I I went before he was nominated and it'll alarming because mainly because of the extent to which I couldn't communicate with his supporters nice people we had a good time it's like a like a Jimmy Buffett concert helped music you know it's just [noise] within\nWhen you got right down to it that we we liked each other but we didn't persuade each other so I've I've come to think that when you look at\nLincoln ... you you really learn what we all know which is to be a human being as you get older the goal is to get more loving\nLess sure of yourself more comfortable ambiguity more generous you know Lincoln did the current administration it seems locked in this kind of incompetent mode of fearful mess and distrust and that's really weird it's really not what we're about as a country except\nSome thirty eight percent think it is so alarming you know and as an artist I think if you step towards everything with sympathy as your first move you actually get more information\nYou know and then when you get more information you're actually better adverse or if you have to be one so I I think is actually a time when people who are open minded in large hard it can do both things resist furiously and love uncontrollably and that's actually where we're going to get out of this mess [noise]\n\n\nWell now it's time for me to turn the audience against you\nWere talking to George Saunders now you you got your graduate degree in in literature when you were I think around thirty\nOf mines and worked in oil exploration I did\nYeah guys [noise]\nWhen did you when it's mine's moms oh they have got to get a bigger scientists that is so confusing and the fact that the two schools are next to each other\nWhen when did you sort of realized that\nYou are not you know oil exploration was not for you and were you in your heart a sort of writer at that time to just doing something you thought was maybe a job that you can make a living and\nI kind of realize that the first week of classes because I I had been a really bad student in Chicago wasn't going to go to college and they had these two teachers Linda Holmes who intervened and actually called the school and got me and so and I love them so much and I when I got there I realized that uh\nI had to not flunk out because I flunked out of there I was going to go back to the starting line in Chicago in you know ... circle the bowl so even though I could feel I wasn't good at it that's how you get this is a real turning point you've got to stick it out so I did and then I went to Asia I worked in the oil fields and I'm actually it was okay and I was writing a little\nAnd then uh I had a thing where I I was trying to do a Hemingway thing so I went swimming in Sumatra river after some drinking and ... and with no clothes did but you know that thing that'll sure are ah\nBut then I was swimming in it there's an oil pipeline along the river and on the river there like four hundred monkeys and I'm dog paddling there and I see them there are pumping into the water you know I'm like how I Wonder if that's okay [noise]\nWasn't and I got deathly ill for about three years uh\nGave up the job and came home and started writing [laughter]\nSo loud [noise] that is not where I expected that story to be going [noise] so this is what I tell my students you know swimming approve the river and you'll know [laughter] well yeah you you you teach\nYou teach a and the M. F. a program in Syracuse um and and I wanted to get your sort of take on on the state of things there are one is there a particular piece of writing advice that you find yourself giving to your students like more than any other piece of advice\nYeah so what I Try to tell them is that there's actually this whole beautiful thing called revision like radical revision that if you're trying to find your voice is your best friend you you aren't necessarily your totality when you just talk you know if if we both stand up there and just talk\nIt there's some indication if we are but when you go back and start trimming that talking cutting it down to its essence that's another way that you can you can weigh in so to me there there was a great line um I think Robert Frost said this at a public talk some student ask them a complicated question about this on it and he said young man don't worry work\nThat's pretty good now I tell a story and then was a process expert pulled me aside of the readings that he didn't say that he said he said he said don't worry [laughter]\n[noise] I like it better the way you having so yeah yeah do you feel encouraged\nAbout the you know next generation of writers I mean are they doing things just differently than than than your generation can conceive of because of the way that they've communicated with each other because of age you you feel a little\nBit of that but what what the best thing about my job is every fall and we meet a new group of young people and it just makes you realize that that ... talent is eternal it as an old person you you will get into that ... if you're you know if your mind as a singer it tends to tighten over time you know the [noise]\nThat a result of the monkey river that happened to\nWhen you but when you see these young people are like you know if I think if I ever find myself saying these kids today it's just my mind being stupid you know so I Am so cheered by by senior been traveling around the country to the generation the young generation now is unbelievable\nOn obstructed in loving up I'm very hopeful about the future\nWell I think they're in good hands with George Saunders teaching them charge thank you so much [noise]\n\nYour story right and you're like where are we and she's like\nWe're in a shopping center but you don't know where we are\nAnd now I like I appreciate and love that that's how you know that's what we had you know\nUm you you also have a you've written for television I Know that your pet projects there in development and you act as well ... ... is there one of these things that you like you feel like you have a sort of special aptitude for are you a standup comic who actually are you an actor who got in to stand up comedy\nI'm a human being whose so lost in this world I Will do anything for the appreciation of other people [noise]\n... ultimately comes down to [noise]\nI Know every single day I'm like should I just stopped doing stand up I I it's the most shallow for you know it's like a very sometimes is good and then like acting is something that's fun but I don't really think I'm not good honestly I don't think anyone's that good I think ten percent of people were act or good everyone else's again who can everyone can do that [noise]\nThat's just the fact that Daniel Day Lewis and then there's like All right everybody else you know what I mean [noise]\nI mean let's be honest\nI'm so acting as whatever um I really enjoy\nWriting but it's a lot of work you know one really wants to work that hard ultimately if I could do anything\nOn the door and I'd serve coffee in the morning and I'd pick up my kids from school and then like make dinner and then go back to the store and then\nYou know you know like you get your you know that's an achievable dream you know it's not I've been trying to buy this one place in my neighborhood and the guys like I Want seven hundred grand I'm like what are you out of your mind to seven hundred grand so you actually walk into the store or like a can I buy this story from you well first I met his wife and I realize they weren't doing so well you know what I mean\nShe was loose lips about it she shouldn't have been then I got the husband [noise]\nI got him on the phone wrote up a proposal that he's like why don't you come and have a meeting with meat comes in he tells me they're skimming off the top they're not even important talks so I Can't get a I went for a small business loan I Can't get a small business loan when he's telling me they're making two hundred and twenty grand a year but
