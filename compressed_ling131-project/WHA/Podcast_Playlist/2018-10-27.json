about to get\nEven better because we got a great show in store for you are theme on live wire this week is letting go we're going to be talking to Tommy Pico\nHe has a poet he wrote an entire book length poem about trying to let go of a relationship that didn't work out of also got ... he's a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist I he profiled is someone who had to let go of everything they've grown up with but when you hear what that was you realize they made the right call\nOr we've also got comedian Emily ... here and we have got music from Portland zone he Leo sequence letting go is something that I tend to have a hard time with it whether the topic is something really big or even something kind of small in fact on my way to record this episode of live wire I\nLike a little run in at the airport that I had a hard time letting go of I was telling our announcer Elaine ... about it at the beginning of the show on let's actually pick it up right there on stage at the Alberta rose theater in Portland, Oregon tickle us\nToday this very day I was in the airport was flying down here to do the show and I went through security and my bag was passing through the scanner and it got flagged\nThey made an announcement over the loudspeaker we needed somebody to look at this bag they pulled it out they took everything out of the bag wiped it all down and couldn't figure out why the scanner went off\nFinally the guy realized it was because I have a water bottle like a clean canteen water bottle and it had and I'm not exaggerating\nFive molecules of water still in it\nLike I had to actively dumped out the water but there was some residue in there and the guy said yeah you can't have that water wow and I looked at him and I said you know it for the safety of this flight I'm willing to dump out the water\nAnd I'm not gonna take it on a plane with me uh so where do I do that and he said security\nAre you can't do that on this side of security\nYou have to go back out to the other part of the airport dump pure water out all five molecules get back in line and then come back through security\nBut he said he said or you can just leave the water bottle here\nBut I just bought it it was like twenty dollars [laughter] I'm pretty sure this is a scam by the TSA to get free water bottles and free per plus over three ounces\nThere's always just like dead soldiers lined up\nPeople who didn't want to and I was like you know what I'm putting the system on trial I Am going to do this I'm going to take the water bottle out through security and come back and and I was like can I leave my bags or he was like absolutely not try to get my bags back get my water bottle go out\nFind a bathroom dumped out the five molecules of water wait in line comebacks are and the whole time I was going through security I just mean motive that this guy [laughter] like I Am not letting this go and I haven't\n'cause I'm Talking about on the show right now [noise] you know honestly though it's not even that guy's fault he's been the protocols the procedure you just doing his job and that's the part of my brain that I Wish would be able to identify\nOr you can you read something from metropolitan for sure or this is Tommy Pico reading from ...\nFrom nature poem\nI Can't write in nature poem because that conversation happens\nIn the hall of South American peoples in the American museum of natural history between two white ladies and buttery ... as they pass the display case of traditional garb from one tribe or another it doesn't really matter to anyone and that word natural\nIn natural history hangs also history also people's\nHangs as in frames it's horrible how their culture was destroyed as if it in some reckless storm but thank God we were able to save some of these artifacts history is so important when you look at this metal work I couldn't cry\nLook\nI'm sure you really do just want to wear those dream catcher earrings they're beautiful I'm sure you\nDon't mean any harm I'm sure you don't\nReally think about us at all I'm sure you don't understand the concept of off limits but what if by not wearing a hat dress and your music video or changing your mascot and perhaps adding point zero five percent of personal annoyance to your life for the twenty minutes at annoyance exists\nThe one hundred and three young people who try to kill themselves on the Pine Ridge Indian reservation over the past four months wanted to live like\nFifty percent more I don't\nI'm In natural ... river\nAnd I don't want to be seen by white ladies

this week we're talking about letting go and we asked the audience here at the Alberta rose theater in Portland or to tell us about something they've had a hard time letting go of and you end up ... you've been collecting those up what are you seeing a\nYou had a hard time letting go of four pounds of bacon in my freezer [noise] it's been there for years but managers special ed Fred Myers can't pass up a good deal deals with like four exclamation points after it [laughter]\nI can totally relate to that there's a part of my freezer that\nHumanize have not even be able to look upon it for the last six years it's frozen over I think there is some old drum sticks like not like the band was using but like ice cream cones oh there might be like a Trader Joe's Indian ... down in the bottom of it no\nIce cream would ever a fall into freezer disrepair in my house really yeah no I mean really you don't even need a freezer when you bring home ice cream and buy a house to get them to do you have one more yeah here's one from I I think than uh than in a has had a hard time letting go of over thinking\nIt took me twenty minutes to decide on this [laughter] [noise]\nI Hope it does in and is here with whoever spilled wine on their cars that would be a good combine\nThis is live wire radio we are talking about letting go this week what about the idea of letting go basically everything that you were raised to believe\nThat is exactly what a guy named Derek Black did when he decided to turn his back on wait for it the white nationalist movement it was a movement his father helped create\nHis journey of letting go is detailed in a series of articles in the Washington Post by Pulitzer Prize winning journalist ... now has turned those articles into a book titled arising out of hatred please welcome ... [noise]\nI Want to live wire thanks it's great to be here um how did you first meet this guy dark black\nSo I was writing about Dylann Roof for the Washington Post and Dylann Roof it committed to hate crime murder of about a dozen people at a historically black church in Charleston South Carolina\nIn Dylann Roof it spent time on this website called storm front and which I had heard of but I didn't know very much about so and trying to understand that the things that don't reflect been reading to sort of motivate him for this massacre I went on storm front and started reading this site it's the\nThe largest racist website in the world and has been for two decades running\nAnd the biggest threat on this website there were plenty of people saying you know horribly celebrate tore things about Dylann Roof but the biggest threat was about somebody named Derek Black and so I clicked on it and started to read it and learned pretty quickly that\nDerrick black was the rising air to not only this website but also to this movement in the United states he was the son is the founder of this message board the godsend if David Duke he'd been raised and\nDavid Duke for those of you who fortunately don't know who that is yeah you're lucky is a former grand wizard of the KKK\nYeah exactly and he had sort of made the sky dark black his protege and Derek being really smart and ambitious had been disastrously successful in mainstreaming a lot of these terrible ideas he'd been elected to office by the time he was Twenty years old he had a delighted\nTo what kind of office\nTo a Republican committee seats and Florida in Florida you have a\nIn West Palm Beach Florida which is a pretty diverse place uh\nLet me ask you a little bit about this sort of storm front thing and how are related to this movement between what a lot of people would call white supremacy or the idea of being a white supremacist and something called the white nationalism because\nI Would think those are the same thing but actually dark blacks dad was a big part of trying to move from white supremacy to white nationalism what's the difference\nSure uh they've worked really hard to change the language of this movement to try to sanitize it from a history of bloodshed but I think\nThe truth distinction that is helpful between white supremacy and white nationalism is\nWhite supremacy unfortunately is endemic to what the United States has been historically and is today and we're all still living in a country that was built unfortunately on a lot of white supremacist ideals white nationalist I think properly identifies\nA smaller group of people who are trying to separate races on two different continents as there and go off\nBut like the idea to was that this guy dark black his father founded this website and was trying to make kind of an intellectual argument like be this sort of thinking persons racist\nYeah I mean they he Derek father had also been the head of the clan for a decade in the United states and eventually decided it was more effective\nTo build a gigantic website and eventually to ban all slurs from that website there's no Nazi insignia no racial slurs what they've tried to do is instead of speaking all the time horrible things about people's color and Jews is instead they're trying to speak to unfortunately the fairly widespread\nAnd factually incorrect sense of grievance that exists in part of white America\nI'm this kid dark black and I just kind of a passive observer to this like his dad is starting this website and he he's going into forums on the Internet and popularized in his words like white genocide and things like that when did he actually start to realize that maybe this was not a good way to be living his life\nUntil he went to college and the ... in many ways had been indoctrinated with a lot of these ideas everybody who he lived with believe these things and had made it the costs for their lives and they pulled Derek out of the public schools\nAnd kept him sort of in the confines of white nationalism and that's where his childhood existed he was the keynote speaker at all these white nationalist conferences from the time he was ten years old so only in the first time that he got out\nIn to the people who are often the victims of his prejudices did any of his ideas to begin to shift and that was when he was Twenty one years old went to the best college and the cheapest college in Florida happened to be a super liberal place which Derek didn't quite realize until they got their hands\nPretty quickly on campus realize that if people knew who he was he would be ostracized uh\nAnd and shame pretty quickly so for the first year on campus he led the secret life where he would leave the dorms every morning\nThings that's supposed to really help with ADHD is regular exercise which was devastating news um [noise] so I joined a gym my gym membership came with a free personal training session and I was like oh well that sounds like that sucks [noise]\nAh but it was free so I went and I said listen here's what we're gonna do\nYou're going to show me how to use these machines without blocking my head\nAnd then you and I are going to part waves for the rest of our lives and he said I totally get it but first we do need to do a questionnaire about your fitness goals and I was like oh I feel like it should be clear\nFrom that last thing I said that I Do not have fitness goal [laughter] my fitness goal was to join a gym and I did that already so I kinda feel like taking the rest of the year off if I'm being on a [noise]\nAnd he was like it's not that big a deal I just want you to tell me what it is you're hoping to\nGet out of this and I was like okay I guess I Would like to improve my posture my stamina\nGeneral energy level\nYour goal weight and I was like oh I'm not a political\n[noise]\nAnd he was like you don't want to lose weight and I was like no I Do not\nAnd he got this look on his face that told me that what he was thinking was but I can see you\nUm [noise]\nJoking and it's nothing against any of you if you want\nTo lose weight there's nothing wrong with that I think I used to want to do that when I was younger and then what happened was I gained forty pounds and then I started making a lot of money and having a lot of sex and\n[noise]\nWeight is why that happened\nJust saying I don't want to jinx it [noise]\nSo I don't want to lose weight and he goes looking in the mirror [noise]\nThere's nothing you want to change [noise] I was like I don't know maybe like the person I'm Talking do right now\n[noise] to\nPut it this way he's very frustrated at this point let\nPut it this way if you lost weight would that be okay with you [noise] and at that\nPoint it was clear to me that he was not going to let me leave there in July admitted to him that I was flying from the Ghostbusters [noise] so I decided I throw 'em a bone I was like I'll give you this ever since I put on weight I've got a little bit more meat in my neck is made breathing a little bit harder than it used to be from certain positions when I'm lying down on the couch [noise]\nI guess [noise] if that improved I'd be fine with it [noise] and the oh my God\nYou guys who were still really if he was just like okay so we want to lose some weight and he wrote it\nDown because it was over [noise] it's crazy I'm Still so mad about it\nI'm mad at me\nRight because I missed an opportunity to just walk in there and be like oh yeah my goal wait\nI guess like this plus five\nHundred pounds but I only want to gain it from the waist up is that\nPossible I Want to be a perfect circle know neck anymore neck gone [noise] same size legs is basically I Want to look like the sexy green ... can you make that happen\nThen uh it's been a big year um I got married recently\nA hold your applause I didn't want to uh [noise] it was for health insurance [noise]\n[noise] I didn't even post about it on Instagram so I'm not sure it's legally binding [noise] um\nI met I met my husband online it's where I Do all my shopping I've Amazon Prime too so it was like two days so fast [noise] I'm just kidding\nIt took forever and I met a million monsters the worse it was like trying to beat Super Mario it was just like monster after monster or just like turtle mushroom wizard just like over and over\nAnd over again [noise] and so I eventually found the princess [noise]\nReaction I think I get is like when I introduced my husband and one of my friends and they find out that we met online there like\nYou met him online but he he's the normal and nice you\nWon the lottery I'm always like how dare you [laughter] I did online dating for years before I met my husband winning the lottery takes one day no skill\nThat analogy does not properly honor my resilience [noise]\n\nHow many men's\nOpinions I had to listen\nBefore I met him [noise] how many ...\nYou know [noise] I was just the one conversation but I had it a hundred times [noise] I guess about an end at the same way every time with me saying yeah I haven't seen that one either [noise] and\nOnce you get to the date before the date there's the profiles and the messages when you're a straight woman online dating you just have to read a bunch of personal essays by on accomplished men it's the worst book club you've ever joint [noise]\nSo no I didn't win the lottery that doesn't described my experience what happened was I ate at a restaurant that gave me food poisoning every day\nFor years [noise] and then one day I tried the pasta and it was fine [noise]\n\nAnd [noise]\nWhat I'm ordering now uh\n[noise] yeah I might get bored of this eventually but I cannot risk it on
