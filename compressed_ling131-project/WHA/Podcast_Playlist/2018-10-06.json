P. R. dot org and like us on Facebook at the ideas network\n\nWelcome back to live wire from P. R. I. repeal burger rose theater in Portland this week our theme is on the contrary and we are talking to rented Francis knew them and ... and other from the dinner party download radio show in pod cast as well as her new book brunch is hell\nOn this book is sort of a a criticism of brunch but really it's a celebration of dinner parties thank you um what are the\nWhat are the are the keys to throwing a good dinner party you whether you want it to or not you've kind of become the national expert on this topic because of your radio show in ...\nWe wrote the book on it now literally wrote the book on it well I mean the first real dinner parties is right there in the title is to have dinner and the party\nDeceptively simple the point is there should be no agenda at a dinner party you can have a boss at a dinner party it can't be setting up people at a dinner party a holiday party isn't a dinner party because there's an agenda there a dinner party is really we considered recess for adults this is a place which is made up of less than twenty five percent of your family because with\nWith more than that there's an agenda taking place uh we we save suggest\nMore than that and my mom's in the corner yelling that Tim Allen of our of our friends right so they we save save that\nFor ... for Thanksgiving and I go to separate thing um and so that's the rule number one is to have people in your home and asked them for nothing and just feed them um most of our lives we have to be a where employees were employers were in control or soccer coaches were doing all this stuff but this is the one place where you can let that go\nSo those are the like the the basic sweating out what elevates dinner party from just meeting the minimum definition of a dinner party to being actually a good dinner party\nOh well I mean a lot of things come conversation would be a great thing to have what you're trying to do is get stories out of people and we it's fascinating we actually have a quote from Alan Alda of all people who actually wrote a book about sort of the way people share information\nAnd industry when people tell stories their minds literally sync up their their brains to light up in certain ways so that it's almost like a mind meld with people so if you can get people to tell interesting stories you're actually sort of creating community and getting everybody literally on the same wavelength so why do you think\nThat the dinner party has declined in in it maybe not popularity in people's minds but certainly in frequencies yeah I think the rise of\n... and has made people more interested in cooking but also made people uncomfortable to cook and invite people into their homes or we suggest that only fifty one percent of the food needs to be made at home you need over half of just fifty one percent just over the finish line there to make it a reflection of you and needs to be your food\nUh that's one thing the vents who I think people are I mean we're in Portland we wrote this from New York in LA or ... or apartments are small and I think people are afraid to bring people into their homes they feel like it needs to be perfect I think that's a present things id and I think that people have\nBeen lulled into this false sense of security that brunch and restaurants are really going to bring them\nFull joy I got a couple of quick questions here um music at a dinner party\nOr I Am one of those people who will spend a day putting together like a six hour play list that I Want to just like Christian do with the scissors sisters cover of comfortably numb right is everyone's getting a little buzz yeah and then someone else wants to plug in their iPod\nAnd because they have jock jams on there or something is are you a bad host if you kind of rule your stereo within with an iron fist at your own dinner party absolutely\nNot a it's a musical dictatorship I absolutely for either urine controller you have any control over to one other person\nOtherwise it's an absolute free for all you know one moment you're listening to fly in the family stone another moment you're listening to ... which could be fun for the after party but not for the meal itself so you need to take control and I think you were wise to create a playlist beforehand and you can just set it and forget it\nWhat about children at a dinner party yours or your friends wanted to bring them there was an actual grown of\nThe [noise] pills are and\nAh we we do we have said as we said before dinner parties a recess for adults who are not adults children but\nBut it is very important first of all we looked at it and it is important to to ... in coal train them to the pleasures of the form of a dinner party\nI'm Glad to hear you say that Rico because even though on on one level it feels like it's for the adults maybe it's a little bit less fun if there's kids there I remember being a kid at\nLike dinner parties are for me it was like a lot of weird church potluck some prayer meetings but where you're a kid and you get to be around adults and observe them in their environment if you're a certain kind of get kind of ... I was that was\nSo the the catches here that they should be old enough that they can take care of themselves so that they can observe from afar the adult skin had I over time and the kids can have said the kids need to be just old enough that they can entertain themselves without setting themselves on fire or ... and and like going to the bathroom and they have to be able to hold their liquor [laughter]\nAt your heart is probably obviously the book is brunch is hell renting Francis new Enrico galley on everybody [noise]\nAlright Rico and Brandon your new book brunch as hell points out or what you guys see as the drawbacks of the brunch vacation of our culture and but what you don't really get into very much or the caloric repercussions of brushing it on the rag\nAh here's what we have done we have done some research on popular restaurant branches and how many calories those breakfasts and branches contain we're going to give you an ... number\n'cause you're the brunch expert ... you have to guess if that is over or under the actual calories in these breakfast liberty calling it caloric over under the couch\nWe view the did you get the mound gay mom [noise]\n[noise] it's like schoolhouse rock schoolhouse became ... and turned into a restaurant [laughter] [laughter] okay so this is the\nPhrase simple game I'm going to give you a caloric amount and you just have to try to decide and you've got to come to a consensus on this um as as the the authors of brunch is hell if you think it's over or under the Denny's grand slam okay one thousand calories over or under that it's more\nFor I have no idea calories ... like I don't really think about ... I'm Sorry for\nLike ... I don't even know infringing on everywhere are exactly right [noise] I'll say is it sounds higher than than a grand slam no I'm saying it's way\nToo over gradually so recall your opinion is a grand slam as more than a thousand calories that ran in your opinion is that it has less than a thousand calories sure okay I Will say that Rico's a hundred percent right and Brenda there were a hundred percent Ron yeah it is one thousand one hundred and eight calories fifty three point five grams of fat right [noise]\nHow about the jumbo Rudy Judy freshman fruity from I hop over or under Thirteen hundred calories\nRudy sounds healthy yes darling it says how sausage bacon and hang out and have come out and pancakes so the compost the vegetable yeah I've never\nYeah that sounds how the protein I'm going to say it's under\nUnder Thirteen hundred calories that is Brent in France as soon as official ... or the ingredients\nYou just said real has come out and they meet compose no no no it's a fruit component\nBut with bacon and and then you'll get some breakfast meats and they're making their sausage there's also ham I still [laughter] then I say that is again too low it's got to be more more calories than that\nAnd once again I'm going to say branch wrong ... yeah it has more than Thirteen hundred calories it as over it has fourteen hundred calorie and my God if you are looking for the diet choice the regular Rudy Tutti comes in at ... eight hundred and forty calories [laughter] how about the garbage plate\nA regional delicacy in Rochester New York one of the many places you can buy their new wrenches hell yeah\nHome fries baked beans French fries macaroni salad sounds healthy malice mustard onion and hot sauce must wow two slices of Italian bread with butter on it I feel your reading my journal is amazing\nOver or under seven hundred thousand calories\n[laughter] off one [laughter] as tough as a means and I'm going to say under I'm going to say I'm going to say under because the word salad was that\nWell and the opportunities came to me I was in my twenties like twenty five and one this big writing prize and I got to go to New York and meet all these amazing agents and editors and so it was kind of being offered to me on a beautiful plate but where I was in my life was in a place where all I felt was a sad\nQuiet stone my throat and I couldn't accept any of the offers and it was right there in front of me and and the thing I Know now almost twenty twenty five years later is that for some of us saying yes or accepting what's in front of you isn't easy\nBecause we don't believe we deserve it\nAnd it could take us years like for me it took ten to Twenty years for me to stand up inside the thing that was being handed to me was front of me and to say you know I might I might be able to stand up inside this too\nAnd so I'm kinda here to remind any of the rest of you that uh we all deserve a place at the table and it doesn't matter what shape it takes and we're not all going to look like celebrity culture\nOwn kind of beauty the weird kind of ... stars still shining the sky so I'm here for you [noise]\n\nIf you start or religion I Am signing on [laughter] I don't want to be the first here in the church of Lydia ... thank you so much for being on live wire [noise]\n\nLive wire is brought you buy Alaska Airlines as an airline that doesn't just lie lumberjacks into ... with twelve hundred daily flights in over one hundred Fifteen destinations in the U.S Canada Mexico in Costa Rica ...
