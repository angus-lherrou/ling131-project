Brian shaped me round they\nHave all these controls what she does and it makes when it's in these things to your reading electronics and looked like some of them still with some of them has a little bit crazy and they'd say\nSorry the idea that they are responding to say you don't have to be here and they respond to how much sunlight is coming in and how much hate and the shortest automatic ... so I can\nYeah let me do the modeling of a house there was an assumption that you close all your cousins you have in the morning that he likes his mouth of the end of the policy not many people do not come home in the evening and find it really ... the sun's been\nBluffing through the windows all day if you can get something that is programs and as the sun comes out they shelters from ethically

...\nNow a lot of it is called straight around ... measures full retail and offices but we'll see more of that technology rolling into the domestic sites as well [noise]\nWhat you feel that I have is flat roof and this is all pretty risque I mean just like a green roof so it's ... it's called the clocks on it\nBad Oh yes we can learn from that I saw the lightning\nBut\nI really don't know it's been through a hot summer as you can see the seat him which suffers but then sort of receipts are always coming back now that we've had a bit of a bit of rain\nOkay it ... it is a green roof but is also believe because robbing the water running straight through and the way\nInto the drawings and yet it will absorb some of the war and that is the sustainable Jay system in itself\nIs designed to\nPool that everybody will stores down from the ages of ... to\n... by very reinforce street\nWell roof is made out of the same sort of structure as the main building itself so you felt that strikes all lead to hold the extra weight so that's a ton of water it's going to be holding but also as the building could be votes in the habitable space in the future it needs to be built up a storm structure\nAnd what does that show that you'll storing a ton of ... what is it useful\nIt will hold it up then it will be allowed to really slowly so you can put a valve on it and it will release it certainly is permanent as if it was just a mild brain rather than a sort of flash flood but in this case they can do that to in storage to use the\nToilet and watching the ... of what you'd be burning of major news in the old\n... both sides are good and shit I moved here sometimes\nYes the the other dogs he delivers machine this as a solution to a typical office blocks so if you've been on the top floor enough is still in the summer it really gets lost his than anywhere else so we watch my company the vitamin who all during a test of one of their is they put they\nBlew roof on one of them they happen and they found that for this summer they haven't had to use on the air conditioning in the roof covered building while in the upper one controlling they call them so it was sort of the jokes at the time\nSo that was a really really big difference in terms of energy consumption as well while we've got a lot of office building\nHigh rises ... probably be useful for that what it\nIs whether you go full high rise or maybe the much broader approach we don't have to default to pitch groups the study something there was this little\nPain in the oh you do you go to a flat roof is going to lead the the technology has moved on a long way now we can easily get sort of your life expectancy on a flat roof\nAnd also start to build it up as a blue ... by putting the vegetation on top of it it's still too some hitting the roofs are safe and protects it so even let people know what but it must be wet well that's fine it's designed to for the wet but most of them says well you have a lot of exposure to sunlight close to tracking and the premise ... aging\n\nI think the difference in temperature surveying sunrise I'm coming down\nFishes like structure is timber\nAnd the insulation so that has the potential for the aging but not one of the problems with a rabbit construction and Elaine construction using less than two [laughter] so what they did have was they create this little exposed slob so it's in she likes it underneath the site itself is to some of us\nSay this but we finally going into cement concrete floor with them all in ... and ... is insulation\nYes all flows needs to achieve a sudden you value so so for months this woman dubbed with that but rather the cover over and lose the civil math the leading exposed and when it's so far degrees outside the home and have Twenty one twenty two degrees very comfortable and\nThey just took his own and win today uh yeah but it will retain that temperature Twenty one degrees so going to be unpleasant but yeah you might want to put a few more upset ...\nWell not when I say this is a very lightweight can construction you're sighing which is great in terms of using fewer materials box it's going to warm up very quickly in the summer and get too cold in the winter what to do about law\nThough because some of the building\nJust from the federal yeah any adaptation of flu and also in the ceiling mislabeled wishes she milk thick so that again providing more dense material to provide that some of them I didn't fly on the ceiling which is normally found in this little yeah and the ground yeah yeah and it's a natural breeding material as well\nAnd what about the whole thing because the rules are still going to tell us who paid\nVery well insulated so the build up the rules is on the outside wood fiber insulation\nThen between the thoughts is mineral fiber and then on the inside his poll insulation and they were ... so there's a line wishes to move back are full of a lot like traditional how she used to but again the potential would be overheating but actually that controlling it for the introduction of civil last\nSet of concrete basically just the ... when it's too hot and keeps ... when it's too cold indeed\nDesigned together we had ... and the data scientist but those had bunches of course in typing medics can help us create not necessarily high tech or are they expensive materials that the really low coast ideas that can allow more accessible than things that they perform in Boston wait\nThis is a Rocky Mount ... director of the Institute for phones architecture in Catalonia however such just focused on responsive buildings made from materials to react to changes in temperature just like living plants and animals they\nTake for instance hydro ... which is nothing to hide your in laws they are for you Michael ... is that they had been used for prototyping andme all day long and they have been also used by many years is\nGo for vacations and\nThey need to have a set and humidity in the plan so they don't dry out\nIt's not the sort of Joe ... is it a ... study\nUsually it's in the form of ... and these ... which means it's a very good friends with what they're they can absorb water and went absorbs water it's volatile mix bond so that we studied becomes kind of a bubble\nThat three things the water when they are exposed to high temperature than these will this thoughts of operates slowly\nAnd they said ... humidity conditions it's also\nDecreases that then but she was so this can happen for the blind in order to give humidity but it can eventually happen in the ... side of the building skiing and this kind of loud that we can control and we can passively cooled everything did of the building\nIn um called conditions\nAre you saying that the building which in its structure how space special kind of ... and you would fill it with wall shah and then it would respond to the house of temperatures true if I purchased cooling on that for cool the building down\nExactly it it functions basically as our body function when they sweat right so when they um high temperature outside or sort of operates and we sweat you know did to control our body temperature\nSo we are forcing buildings that they are able to have my illogical let's say performances as a bodies of living organisms have so they can sweat they can eventually faith or they can also Greece\nAnd they can do that in them lots more sustainable way because they can do that in a box of weight\nAnd have you looked shots the exterior infrastructure things like pavements things like roads\nYeah we have been working in the capital projects related to public space and dialing one of these includes accomplish by that these able to absorb seemed to\nAnd fit into the air and at the same time transformed up seal doing two sides and water that are major innovation coming from ... allow us to really rethink the says he is a far public space as a performer Dave ... says for days
