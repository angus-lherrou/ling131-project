the London School of hygiene and tropical medicine discovered Ebola and it's a leading global experts on pandemics I asked him about the risks they pose\nA condemn it could trigger a global recession it all depends how big it is of course and where it's will hit and we know that the Spanish flu a hundred years ago I'm reduced global GDP by about five percent speed trillion in these days we know that in Hong Kong a very short lived epidemic of SARS\nReally hit the GDP by about close to three percent but it was also an increase by two hunger base point in the country risk premium so that's another problem\nSo according to the the size of the epidemic we're talking about the damage in terms of trillions nothing billions\n[noise]\nThe failure to think beyond finance is the first lesson that has yet to be loans the second is that management and regulations focused on what was happening within individual countries are the bankers were operating system which Trump send national

commission on banking sets up by the u._k. government following the crisis\nI asked him whether this has made banking safe for\nOne reason why Britain had a particularly bad crisis was that we have these gigantic institutions doing on re high street banking which we all depend on small businesses depend on day today and all sorts of global investment banking and they got into trouble on on all those friends then the second heading was\nHow to make the banks more resilient in the sense of being able to absorb losses if we're more likely when the next crisis hits we recommended a kind of separation cooled ring fencing so this is the idea\nThat the ordinary high street banking retail banking current accounts I dropped it was called things which we all this individuals and small businesses depend on which a government can't let for life without titled calamity that those activities in major banks\nShould be in a self standing powder that bank separated from the global investment banking commodities trading derivatives exposures to other kinds of financial institution and all those other things it shifts the dial it increases the odds that you wouldn't imperil domestic banking from a global crisis\nAnd if nonetheless there is some jeopardy so that it puts you in a much better position to do with that crisis\nIn the u._k. despite the adoption of a number of so Jones recommendations banking has become concentration in fewer hands in the u._k. as in the U.S taxpayers' money was used to bail out the banks and to sweets in terms of a merger with bigger banks\nThe result was that the surviving banks could even bigger and competition was reduced the big banks are not too big to fail\nMean if they collapsed that would bring down the whole system lets

grow\nThat will tell you that they did the favor swallowing the weaker institution but there's really nothing natural and nothing efficient about the size and complexity of these institutions if they
