undergraduate days yeah so the economics or the searches\nThat wrote it better than the economy of the eighties nineties and the early to says\nThe financial crisis I like to the extent to which was being tortured universities was increasingly irrelevant\nWhen do you call them was head of graduate studies at University College London a top rated economics departments she saw how unhappy with students were with a mismatch between what they were learning and close what we're seeing on the news as opposed to banks and then the whole financial system began crushing down\nWe're all watching this and in some sense struggling trying to understand what was going on there was similar a sense of students being very perplexed and what they would come and say is can you help us understand what's going on\nWe're not learning to enact classes and they were right that we're not getting in their economics Tom says a set of tools that was helping them to understand the day by day dimension to the crisis\nAnd Christmas was a good sort of catalyst because at Christmas people are thrown together with their relatives and one typical question is well\nYour studying economics you can tell us about the global financial crisis and the students having to say well we're actually not covering that you're not classes\nThe fact that students around the world continue to be taught courses which seemed to weigh a financial crisis but it was actually raging all around them brought home to many out of touch the profession has become\nWendy colon is the most widely used university textbooks in retrospect she admits these books must stumped subjects that we should really important in terms of understanding the crash\nThings as basic as how finance works\nI can put my hand up\nWriting macroeconomics textbooks which we're addressing particular issues in the macro economy side or the one published in two thousand and six was all about inflation targeting and there was no section on banks all the financial system\nAnd this it was very typical of the way on that correct comics was taught in universities around the world\nAnd has that changed it has changed I write in your textbook that that really catches that in other words with my co author we felt really challenged and I think it was true not just about that of many others\nAnd if you're wondering why we should care about what's going on economics classrooms remember these are the people who graduate I'm\nGoing to steal the financial systems in which we will depend if they give bad advice and can wreck your economy\nThe growing frustration filled by students and their teachers around the world has given rise to a number of new initiatives to overhaul economics courses in one of these windy and many others of building a new free online curriculum known as cool this was a concern I feel passionate about\nAnd so I have to put my own hand up here I chose the court charity\nBut will it different curriculum being\nIn finance in so many other areas the person who pays the piper calls the tune bankers and politicians found it convenient to listen to those economists who argued for deregulation and who's morals allowed them to justify the housing bubble [noise]\nLesson monitors in comics professor at Stanford University in the U.S\nShe's frustrated by economists taking refuge in theory and saying what\nPeople want to hear well turning a blind eye to the bond even criminal behavior by bank because that can freshman financial stability\nThere is definitely a problem it is a very very shocking they remain really fantastic cut in the sense of how they explored the system but in the end ignoring the biggest elephants in the room and all the flooding incentives and all the deception and fraud and all the excessive endangerment\nSets in tire early unnecessary it's\nJust taken as a given it's just what they accept the system and does she think this is changed following the crisis\nWhat you hear is more and out you know very shockingly\nYou know stuff happens then you know we're doing our best and it's going to be sort of the big groups at crisis just wakes you up because you notice it and then he's like oh you know we really had terrible regulations before let's fix it but then the fix is really\nNot quite right but then you just kind of move on and say well I did my best can we prevent it stuff happens\nIt's not much of a comfort to think of the economists could be happy with the idea that stuff happens some things clearly going wrong for professor Joseph Stiglitz it comes down to the continued reliance record numbers on the totally unrealistic notion that the market is always right\nHe dates this right back to the founder of modern economics Adam Smith\nWere blinded by the same ideology that had blinded the central banks and other policymakers the blind belief that markets work well on their own unfettered markets will deliver for wellbeing for all citizens as been\nAt the center of might say conservative economics sings Adam Smith\nAdam Smith actually understood that wasn't true I think it'd be horrified at the abuse of his ideas he recognized that ah whenever businesses get together that conspire against the public interest to raise prices but\nAfter Adam Smith the conservatives I'd miss used his ideas\nEven more astounding was the fact that beginning in the Nineteen fifties sixties seventies and my own work in the seventies and eighties advances in economics explained why markets often don't work the reason the invisible hand offing seemed invisible was it wasn't there\nThe notion of invisible hand and supremacy of markets is based on the idea that if everyone buys themselves things in their self interest in trades freely without government intervention everyone will be better off\nJust Stiglitz won the Nobel Prize for economics by then to find some other ways in which The Simpsons about perfect markets offload the presumption that everyone has all the information they need to make the right decisions just isn't borne out by experience\nThe notion of asymmetric information is very simple ... just that somebody knows something that somebody else doesn't know and the banks obviously knew some things that others didn't know about their bad behavior the banks knew that they were engaged in market manipulation\nOthers didn't the fact is that the people who want to believe that markets were perfect close their eyes at in Dr needed their students the markets basically worked perfectly\nWider economists expects humans to behave like rational calculating machines despite all evidence to the country\nFor some this tendency indicates a key problem at the house of economics which is to explain human behavior as if it were signs only works if you mentioned all humans are the same responding in the same way an old contributions to the economy can be counted\nJournalist Katrin muscles book who cooked Smith dinner argues the traditional economic theories and methods only makes sense if you imagined humanity to be self centered so unlike humans is almost a different species in fact some economists have given the species imam homo economic us\nHome economic ... doesn't have any feelings at least they failings and not relevant to his economic decision making he's they're sort of rational fake calculating brain that is always acting additive self interest and all of a set of characteristics or characteristics that we have been told to view as a male\nAnd even more obvious it's sort of all the characteristics that economics guys to great lengths trying to excluded from these models like emotions family the faulty failings compassion and altruism\nAnd all of the things that we have been told that the something not economically round event is not anything that we need to studying economics they like sent to the same things that we have been torched view as female I notice the after the costs a lot of people are saying\nThis greed is good philosophy and is very narrow idea of what human beings are it's not good we need to bring these other values back and\nWe can't solve our economic problems without the courage to the U.S health with all that makes that human and failed economic models in economic theory that is actually based on that\nI agree with Katrin Schumann that people are simply rational ... mentions of what makes us human that this was an important reason why ... to see the crisis coming\nThey do not understand the Bruce collusion and trading testosterone that makes bankers appear to be on steroids even when they knocked\nMarket dream as right to highlight the rest of the factors that influence decisions she's expecting too much of
