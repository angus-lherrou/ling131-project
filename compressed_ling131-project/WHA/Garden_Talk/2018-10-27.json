dot com but number again ... eight eight for seven to thirty three sixty six\nThat the genesis we understand it osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis can you tell us what we're talking about here what is it to we have any idea what causes it um\n[noise] well it's a complicated question um I think we don't know with a hundred percent certainty what causes\nReally almost any form of arthritis we know that osteoarthritis or the the incidence of osteoarthritis increases as we age so I think aging plays a very important part of that\nBut we used to think about osteoarthritis as sort of wear and tear up the joints but it turns out that that paradigm is is probably not true I mean certainly aging and using your joints may increase the risk that you damage your joints but not everybody who ages or over uses their joints\nGet that kind of damage so we think there are probably a very complicated\nUm [noise] a matrix of of causes number one might be genetics we know that if you have a first degree relatives that has osteoarthritis you're at higher risk\nUm there may be some um association with other co morbidities with trauma early in life so if you had a joint injury that sets you up for osteoarthritis so the the causes may be a very varied and different in many different patients so\nI Know one of the controversies has been around exercise so you know do long distance runners have a greater likelihood of coming down with buffer osteoarthritis of the knees or the hips\nAnd it's my understanding it's not very clear but not every athlete develops arthritis but those who are engaged in sports like football where they're going to damage their joints they may be a greater risk\n[noise] yes that's true that's actually been some really nice studies of older runners um men and women in their sixties and really we don't see 'em a significant increase and osteoarthritis mostly in the knees that we look at it in those cases\nWill come back to the people's pharmacy I'm Joe breathing and I'm Terry ... if you would like to purchase a CD of this show you can call the eight hundred seven three two to three three four\nIt's shown number one thousand one

distinguished professor of medicine she's also chief of the division of rheumatologist allergy and immunology at the medical school of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\n[noise] doctor Janice we think about arthritis in terms of joint pain are there other areas of the body that are affected especially by the inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis\n[noise] absolutely and and when we think about rheumatoid arthritis we really think about it as a multi system disease it does not just affect the joints and sometimes patients are surprised about that\nUm many times a patience with rheumatoid arthritis will have involvement of their eyes and they'll have very dry eyes and many patients don't think to tell their rheumatologist about that\nUm and I think that's very important and and sometimes the dryness can be very very profound\nRheumatoid arthritis can also involve the lungs many patients with rheumatoid arthritis will have interest tissue lung disease or inflammation of their lungs for most patients it's not clinically important but rarely some patients can have very severe lung disease that can be life threatening\nUm it can involve the nervous system um it can involve the heart out and we know that inflammation in general\nCan lead to cardiovascular disease and that is true in rheumatoid arthritis and really other forms of autoimmune diseases such as lupus um that we often see an increased rate of cardiovascular disease even among young women\nAnd we have a a an email from Melissa who says I cured my mild rheumatoid arthritis by curing my leaky got so perhaps the digestive tract as involved as well\nThere's been a lot of interest in looking at um what we eat and are a sort of got micro Flora and whether that may play a role in body inflammation um I think we're not sort of there yet in terms of making recommendations but I certainly have heard these stories where people have\nShannon whether it's been diagnosed as arthritis or not and they change their diet and they feel better um and you can't refute that but what's behind that is not really clear\nWell this idea of leaky got is a little all\nIt sounds better if we say intestinal permeability it's it's more a more acceptable and to have the gastroenterologist I'll tell ya yeah we've seen this um eight eight eight\nFor seven to three three six six is the phone number to call if you'd like to join the conversation we go to Dallas texas Lucy welcome to the people's pharmacy what's this about swimmers need we heard of swimmers year but me\n[noise] [noise] yeah I uh I've enjoyed my entire life in college I'm going to college I have a\nFormal off right is and I said it's because of wear and tear of joining a brush stroke and I was five and now I'm having actually and my feet and I wonder if I ever logical off\nI don't know if that's really good but it's a chronic condition as you know the only thing I ever told me is\nPainkillers injections and ah as I Am planning for is for driving for over a decade\nDr Janice you want to respond to I'm Lucy at all when we can't diagnose of course we can't diagnose and of course we can't tell her what she should be taking but we might tell her what she should be asking her\nDoctors so it's interesting I I have to say that I've not heard of swimmers need but\nI think about swimming we think about it as being relatively safe form of exercise for people with arthritis and so it does make me wonder whether a there might have been you know obviously if you've been to a very avid swimmer and you know so I'm very regularly and maybe\nUm had some injury to some of the supporting structures maybe ligaments or tendons and sometimes\nAn injury to some of the supporting structures can lead to arthritis later in life and that and I think about this I'm Wondering whether that might have been the case um I I I think the question to ask the physicians that are caring for you would be\nYou know what form of arthritis are we talking about it sounds like it might be osteoarthritis but I Can't tell for certain\nUm and you're right that that the the alternatives 'em and choices for therapy are very limited so anti inflammatory other energies ... local injections but I Would say exercise and physical therapy might be very helpful\nThank you very much and good luck Lucy or here's a question for you Dr Joe's because what Lucy is racing is is intriguing to me and that is how do rheumatologist such as you and your colleagues\nDiagnose whether it's rheumatoid arthritis one of those other inflammatory forms of arthritis or osteoarthritis how do you figure out what's going on both test what else you do\n[noise] so actually blood tests are really not that helpful um we really talk to our patients I think that's the most important thing we do is we find out when did it start\nHow did it happen what has been your experience in terms of pain or stiffness do you have other medical problems that might predispose you to one or another form of arthritis so a lot of what we do is really talking to patients\nAnd finding out more about what's going on with them and then doing a physical examination between our history with the patient at the physical examination we're pretty close we can get pretty close to a diagnosis\nX rays sometimes MRIs and blood tests may I support our diagnosis but we're not going to make a diagnosis really on any tests\nAnd conditions we do have an email from Jean in Elizabeth West Virginia she wants to know if there's any connection between a past diagnosis every magnetic fever and rheumatoid arthritis now\n[noise] so I don't think so um rheumatic fever really um it's a very interesting disease that we're seeing more in the western world now we used to not see this very much but it's it's a\nIt's coming back and we've seen it a few times um patients with rheumatic fever I'm have a response to an infection a strict ... infection and they can develop an acute form of arthritis [noise] um and then often have a cardiovascular disease but I don't think that that's a predispose you to development of rheumatoid arthritis\nNo Lucy also mentioned that she'd gotten injections\nAnd I'm guessing that injections into the joint with something like a cortical steroid are not uncommon I Know that a lot of my tennis buddies who have injuries we'll get an injection maybe into their back maybe into the hip maybe into their knee\nI've heard that that can be counterproductive on occasion can you help us understand the the benefits and risks of a cortisone type injection into a joint\nThere's no doubt that many patients with arthritis will get good relief with a steroid injection and for some patients that can last a good long time so it's a very good option for many patients\nThe concern is is that over time often there's a sort of law of diminishing returns and so they last\nYou know they don't last as long as they did initially and so people get repeated injections there's some concern that repeated critical to your injections into a joint may increase the risk of the development of osteoarthritis the data around that are really not altogether clear\nAnd we go back to the phones in Aberdeen South Carolina Maggie welcome to the people's pharmacy your question please\n[noise] hello Hi I'm I guess I actually have two questions um\nBut first is because I had I of osteoarthritis uh do do you know genetic on both sides and I'm In my mid fifties I've had to hip replacements\nAnd looking at a potential for a knee replacement um fair Eddie Shore for osteoarthritis or is it just a degenerative disease that you can only really just manage the pain\nSo the simple answer is no there is no cure\nYet I think our understanding of the pathogenesis the disease has increased substantially over the last year and we're now identifying targets for therapeutics so I think that there will be at some time in the future I don't know when what we call it disease modifying drug for osteoarthritis but we are not there yet\nWill come back to the people's pharmacy I'm Joe breathing\nAnd I'm Terry ... if you'd like to purchase the sea did this show called eight hundred seven three two to three three for its show number one thousand one hundred forty you can also find it on line at people's pharmacy dot com\nTo people's pharmacy used brought you in part by brain gauge developed by you're a scientist at the University of North Carolina to attract brain health home research and clinical applications are available homes subscription options are also available online at gauge your brain\nDot com today we're talking about arthritis our guest is Dr Beth ... the ... foundation distinguished professor of medicine and chief of the division of mythology allergy and immunology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\nShe's also a rheumatologist with a UNC Thurston arthritis Research Center and director of the un see re mythology fellowship training program\nIf you have a question about arthritis or a story you'd like to share alliance or open at eight eight eight for seven to three three six six if the lines are full you can reach us by email we're at radio at people's pharmacy dot com\nThat Janice topical incense and fact in the U.S I think there's only one that's approved and that would be that close to al ...\nAnd what's amazing is if you go to Italy if you go to France if you go almost anywhere in the world can\nBuy them without a prescription ya so people who travel do sometimes stock up [laughter] [noise]\nYeah so they can actually be very helpful and as we were talking about before the break we know that oral and sets have significant side effects particularly on the gastrointestinal tract\nAnd particularly an older patients we like to use ... because they can be very helpful and really do not cause any GI irritation so in that regard I think they are very very helpful [noise]\nThey're very useful for um the small joints and but maybe not as much so for the large joins I think they're worth a try for patients because they really do have much less toxicity systemically than the oral drugs\nSo perhaps better for fingers and thumb than for hips or and knees are maybe in between\nRight the hips probably not so much the hip is joined us so far away from your skin yeah uh that I Can't imagine that the that the drug is going to actually get there\nPeople have told us that they're nice sometimes go a little better and even elbows\nBecause when you look at that warning in the prescribing information it makes it seem as if the topic goes are just as dangerous\nAs the morals and I don't get it it's interesting I don't think I've ever read the package insert for the topical so you know this is really it's interesting but I think again\nTheir prescription medicines you're going to have a discussion with your physician about you know your individual health care and I think most physicians\nWould say that in terms of the safety they're much more safe and in fact if you look at the guidelines from any of the major organizations regarding the treatment of osteoarthritis they are preferred particularly an older individuals because of their\nMore favorable toxicity profile\nAnd we go back to the phones Rick in Tampa, Florida what's your question please [noise]\nHello I read I like I figured I'd call I Want to go to the doctor if there's any reason a research in genetics on genetic markers which could a folk show medicine approach to treating it possibly even preventing arthritis [noise]\nSo there's been a lot of research looking at genetics and not data goes back a good long way and I think the [noise]\nYou know probably the strongest a genetic marker that we know of are the class to antigens a chili DR antigens in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis having said that\nUm as I mentioned earlier in the show the genes are such a small part of why we develop arthritis it's hard for me to imagine that engineering that on the front end is going to make a big difference in the long run so you know we've been looking at genetics probably good data for a good twenty five years and I think that\nThat's unlikely to be you know I'm a cure if you will well\nSpeaking of a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis you can turn it on television and see a whole bunch of commercials\nFor these disease modifying drugs or what we call the TANF walk or some of them you mirror being one of the classics and the most popular at the moment can you tell us a little bit about these drugs because they really have changed the game when it comes to rheumatoid arthritis\n[noise] absolutely and I think we're now in year twenty of the use of biologic demar it's the first one was the ... and you mentioned a Adam ... and there are many many other ones now you said ... what does that stand for Democrats or disease modifying anti rheumatic drugs\nUm and this is a unique class\nUm the biologic march that target specific compounds that we think are important and uh the development of inflammation and in the case of\nThese drugs are primarily targeting tea an effort to win a closest factor alpha\nAnd we know that TNN is an important a mediator of inflammation and pain and rheumatoid arthritis and these drugs have really revolutionized the way we treat rheumatoid arthritis\nNot only do they decrease pain and inflammation\nThey also prevent destruction of the joint and so\nYou know twenty five years ago it was not uncommon for folks with rheumatoid arthritis to develop significant amounts of joint damage really in a short period of time and now we know if we can identify patients early get them started on effective therapy we can prevent joint damage what's\nThe first therapy you would use for rheumatoid arthritis [noise]\nSo the first therapy I use is education I think people need to understand what their diseases what makes it better what makes it worse and the kinds of therapies that are out there\nBut the first line do more that we often use this method of ... which is not a biologic medicine it's an oral medicine or can be given up by\nIt has been shown to be very effective in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and we've known that really since the Nineteen eighties um but that's a ... we are you know sort of first line in rheumatoid arthritis\nGot to family members taking at my father for ... arthritis and my sister for her and the toward arthritis\nMhm absolutely there are though many patients who don't respond to meth attract said alone so combination therapies are often used after that if it's not effective or the addition of these biologic therapies um after that\nNow when you watch TV you see the commercials and they warn you about the dangers infections and fungal infections and they even mentioned lymphoma if I'm not mistaken a kind of blood cancer so um\nHow dangerous are they are I think back to the days of of cortisone in the fifties and how we thought oh cortisone was this revolutionary drug for rheumatoid arthritis and it came in kind of business and the bus\n[noise] absolutely but we now have Twenty years of good experience so um I think for certain the TANF inhibitors and other biologic drugs and there are other classes now\nCertainly increase the risk of infection and we worry about tuberculosis we worry about fungal infections and so vigilance about infections while you're on these drugs is very very important [noise]\nThe kids are story um is not altogether clear we know that patients with rheumatoid arthritis regardless of the ... of whether they've been on any of these medicines are at higher risk for lymphoma and leukemia so teasing out how much of this is the underlying disease and how much of the drug is unclear\nBut I have um [noise] you know a sense that the risk of cancer lymphoma leukemia solid cancers is actually not a significantly increased and there are now a lot of epidemiologic studies out there that are really supporting that but infection absolutely\nJoe emails to ask if women are more susceptible to rheumatoid arthritis\nThey absolutely are two to three times more susceptible to rheumatoid arthritis than men are and that's been clear for quite some\nTime what about osteoarthritis or women more susceptible to that [noise]\nUm I think it's pretty\nEven between men and women there may be times in the women's life so in the Perry menopause women go through a period where they're at higher risk um so during the life cycle men and women may have slightly different risk but I think overall um [noise] I think it's pretty\n[noise] back to the phones we go to Endicott New York James welcome to the people's pharmacy\nHello James\nI'm a question of do a meditation treatment that sixty six years old and then late somebody told me I knew I was treated me over a decade with the ...\nAnd then
