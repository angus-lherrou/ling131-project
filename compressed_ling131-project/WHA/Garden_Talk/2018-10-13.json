people with their yoga mats in their backpacks or on their bicycles and I think okay so this is a young person's thing but that's a misconception that\nThat's a big misconception there's so many misconceptions about yoga and one of the biggest misconceptions is that\nYoga and posture it's an honor I miss that somehow when people say I'm doing yoga it means they're doing postures and yoga is so much more than that I'm postures or just one of the elements of the yoga toolkit they're really for main elements in the yoga tool kit their postures which is\nWhat everyone thinks about and knows there's breathing which is hugely important there's meditation again very important and then there are principles in yoga that don't get recognized very often um and\nAs I've I practice and sixty four now and I've been practicing for more than forty years and it's throughout my yoga journey the principles of yoga things like contentment and gratitude and non harming have become more and more an important part of the practice\n\nWill come back to the people's ... and on Terry ... if you'd like to purchase a CD of this show you can call the eight hundred seven three two to three three four

F she is a yoga instructor therapist at Duke integrative medicine in Durham North Carolina she's co director of yoga for seniors teaching training program and co author of relax into yoga for seniors\nHer previous book was yoga sparks one hundred eight easy practices for stress relief in a minute or less Carol in a minute or less how is that possible\nGel if you can breathe you can practice yoga and if you're doing some mindful breathing that takes a minute I'm and there's so many things that that are can be a part of a yoga practice that you might not even recognize for example if\nUm if you let someone in front of you in line you know they're a someone that is a yoga practice that's I'm a practice of a party ... of letting someone else go first\nUm as I was saying earlier the principals have yoga being content looking at what's right instead of what's wrong these are all part of the yoga practice so this is what I outline and the books of their pastors breathing meditation\nAnd these little principles well the thing it's so interesting to me is that\nDuring the course of a day they're all kinds of little stressors and little interruptions and you're cut off in traffic or you know just all ... you know some political craziness that just happens and the idea of being able to take just a minute 'cause we're all in such a hurry\nTo sort of let that stress go through a yoga practice it sounds very appealing even for people who don't want to do poses\nAbsolutely and your example of getting cut off in traffic is a perfect one or Thirty years ago and I before I was a this deeply into the yoga journey if somebody cut me off in traffic my response\nUs my hand out the window and make a gesture I I'm embarrassed to say but I was young and foolish and that might have been what I Would do if somebody would cut me off in traffic today if somebody cut me off in traffic I might stop\nTake a breath and send that person some love and kindness I mean you on that person might be rushing to the hospital\nTo care for a a sick child you just don't know what their story is and the effect of the difference between thrusting my hand out the window and making a gesture\nAnd taking a breath and just sending a prayer for love and kindness can you see the difference in my own physiology\nHuge it's a huge huge difference in your reaction which is what you have control over and who knows even if they're just a thoughtless jerk they may need loving kindness as well\nAnd when the world being nicer place if we were all letting other people in line and uh sending people loving kindness instead of road rage\nCarol how did you get interested in teaching yoga for seniors\n[noise] my journey to teaching yoga for seniors are started in Nineteen Ninety nine I enrolled in yoga teacher training program it was a two year seven hundred our program\nA and it's part of that program we had to do some community service we had to do twelve hours of community service\nAnd for my community service I volunteered teaching yoga at the ... medical center where my husband is a cardiologist at Duke and I knew some folks there and they were very happy for me to volunteer there\nAnd this group was called um ... it was a gerontology rehabilitation program so they were mostly men because they were veterans there were some women in their sixties seventies eighties they had had heart attacks they had COPD the diabetes is where\nPeople dealing with some serious health challenges and I walked in you know as a newly minted teacher looking at this group of older men and I thought oh my God I'm scared to death I'm going to kill them I Can't teach these guys ... what am I going to do [noise]\nSo I observe their calisthenics they did as part of they did a aerobics and they did weight training in this part of that um calisthenics they got on all fours and they did something they called ... and slump ... Ben slump and the light\nWhoa home [laughter] that's what they\nCall that I've I've got to say that were on their hands and knees and they would arch their back up that was the hump and then they would make their spine curve down that was the slump\nAnd as a yoga practitioner and newly minted yoga teacher I realize well in yoga we call that cat cow and if they were doing that anyway if I taught at taught it to them I probably wouldn't kill them so I\nI saw that many of the things they were doing in their calisthenic program were actually based on yoga practice is so I took those than I knew they were already doing\nAnd I added the breathing and I added the awareness and instead of volunteering there for twelve years for twelve sorry for twelve weeks I volunteered there for five years because it was really transformative they\nWere so appreciative they would come back to me and they would say my doctor says I'm doing so well whatever I'm doing I I I I should keep it up um and it was it was really amazing and one of the things that I discovered um in teaching veterans was that it's not just what you do and yoga\nIt's how you do it that really matters and because these guys were were soldiers they are soldiers athletes in our culture tend to disconnect their mind in there\nBreak a block in in uh in karate if you were really thinking about how it might hurt you really have to kind of disconnect or if they do a marathon you really have to just sort of not um disconnect to a certain extent so some of these guys really didn't know how they felt and\nI look at someone who would be read in the face doing opposing nice how are you are you okay yes ma'am they had no clue so teaching them how to challenge themselves but not to strain\nTeaching themselves to back off a little that was huge\nOh that's great we go to the phones in Binghamton New York Virginia would like to tell us about practicing yoga as an older adult Virginia please tell us your story\nHigh tide Virginia go ahead I think I\nWas thinking I just I walked out of the ... she sort of like a good guy he said she was forty nine now\nSay Ninety nine\nYes she's the world's oldest living yoga and stuff

they are at the moment you can reach us through email radio at people's pharmacy dot com\nAnd Joe we have an email from Helen in West Virginia who says I've been practicing yoga for about Twenty years and I'm very pleased with several outcomes one is good posture I'm Still five foot seven the height I achieved in high school\nThe other is that my balance is very good I've had some close calls on steps and I've always been able to instantly correct\nAnd finally the meditation techniques I've learned have curb my anxiety many times and here's the best part and it's in all caps yoga feels good\n[laughter] that's wonderful and you know the the reason that people come back to doing something is because they enjoy it so to me that's that's a part of the reason why we do yoga is because it feels good we can be friends\nAre having these bodies these vehicles for our spirits\nThat's great ah we go to Dallas texas Charles welcome to the people's pharmacy\nHard thank you very much I'm I'm really interested in the program are started yoga when I was sixty two because I was having a substantial problems in my field for walking and surely\nAn Irish they're coming up in my book couldn't even touch my knees\nAnd if you're a judge or a or a doctor who showed up your own started doing some videos for folks who should try yoga and I enjoy your reserved\nFor ... and it's been unbelievable so were you able to walk without pain\nNot always when I Walk without paying a Malibu jumping jokes that I haven't done since high school\nOh that is good most thank you very much for us we we really do appreciate it Carol I'm\nWow well that's that's a wonderful testimonial and uh not just to you but also to your yoga teacher that is wonderful to to know that you found someone who um is clearly a very good teacher\nAnd we had a physician recommending yoga which is kinda cool 'cause I think a lot of times\nWe get into the mode of thinking oh well doctors are going to recommend medications non steroid all anti inflammatory drugs or perhaps recommend an orthopedic surgeon who do me a hip replacement her knee replacement so here's a physician saying hey let's try yoga first and it worked\nAnd that is that is great and part of the the reason why there's such a a moving the yoga community\nTo research the effect is because it will result in physicians making these referrals and because back pain is an area that there's very strong evidence of efficacy of physicians are referring people to yoga which is great\n[noise] we actually have an uh an email from Mary Kay ... once you compare tai chi and yoga for seniors\nWell there are many similarities in yoga tai chi both are uh what would be called a mind body activity in that I'm with tai chi and with yoga you cannot be watching television and do tai chi or do yoga\nOr you might be doing tai chi moves in yoga moves while you're watching TV or but you are you're not doing the practice so you have to be completely involved with what you're doing you have to be very present in both tai chi and yoga tai chi is a very slow\nUm\nMartial art where you're um you're staying very present you shift your weight from one side to the other so tai chi is often\nA recommended for older adults it's done and I'm Asian communities um and there's good advocacy for tai chi and balance one of the biggest differences with yoga and tai chi is tai chi as far as I'm aware it's always done standing\nWhereas yoga you're in many planes of action if people can get down and not from the floor\nThey can lie down and if they can't get down enough from the floor you can do yoga in your bad but you can do yoga prone so their movements that are done prone and ... on\nA there are also inverted movements so if you're physically able to be upside down you could do a hand standing yoga I'm not sure that there are any inverted movements and tai chi so that's a little bit of the the difference the planes of action\nOkay well we go to Ira, Texas Gayle welcome\nHi I'm so happy to talk Carol I took your training back at Duke a number of years ago that led to say Hi to [laughter] is that since that time I was open to yoga studio\nIn this small farming community almost on the Oklahoma border and I have people coming from great distances because there's not a lot of yoga around here\nBut it's so good to hear your voice again and I wanted to know that your methods and your book are being shared with my classes I Do a chair a yoga class twice a week and I've got a lady in there that eighty four\nBut the very best part of my yoga classes they all say is the ... and that's where they can just shut everything out let their bodies come to quiet and get some time just to themselves and I owe that to you\nWill do thank you so much for sharing this story for those of our listeners who don't quite know what you mean when you say cheer yoga can you explain\nWell we do a lot of the poses from the chair\nWe're sitting down we can do a lot of upper body where we stretch our orange and mixing round airbags like a cat cow we use the chair also to get down to the floor and there was a specific way that I was taught there at Duke to stand with your hands and that little finger on the place where the legs attach and\nWe practice that in standing they used the chair as they get down to the floor foot one day down than the other day on\nAnd I had one person who's now deceased and I taught them that her that that if they ever fell in their house to get to a place where they can pull themselves up and I was told that that he did that and and was able to do that before she passed and so it it helps throughout the life that that we have left and\nInquiring minds when a ... do you have any farmers and that farming community doing yoga\n[laughter] that was not good because I Do have a I have\nPer person down the road from me his name is Mike He has had a valve replacement and he came to yoga of course with the encouragement of his allies and they both did yoga for a while he's now in cardiac rehab and has said that you know he'll come back to yoga when he\nCan he's he's involved in that right now and even my husband who was a farmer\nDid classes when Mike was coming but you're right it's more women\nI encourage him in a because my husband is also a golfer and it helps with his shoulders and back when he gets a little bit stiffed um golf\nThanks so much for your call it was a delightful to hear from you Gail and I'm so appreciative to hear that the techniques that we've been teaching\nAt Duke are making their way out into the world because what my experience has been I'm working with older adults and people with health challenges is hearing\nFar too many times from people who say oh I went to a yoga class my doctor said let's go to yoga class so I went to this gym or this why or something and I I got hurt and the reality is that um [noise] if people are older adults or have health challenges\nI'm walking into just any yoga class may not be the most advisable thing you want to be working with a teacher who has been", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Garden Talk", "city": "Madison",
