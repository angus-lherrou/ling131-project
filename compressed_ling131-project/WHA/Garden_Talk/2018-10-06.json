I think that um\nThere's a lot of confusion around hormones in general and testosterone in particular\nAre there for a while there were TV commercials that were sort of highlighting low testosterone levels low T I think is the way they refer to them and then the FDA got very excited and those those commercials seem to disappear pretty quickly the FDA basically said\nDoctors do not prescribe testosterone two men unless they have a real serious condition\nJust having low testosterone that doesn't count and they are all kinds of warnings about heart attacks and strokes it'll just all kinds of scary stuff around testosterone\nI Wonder if you have any thoughts about testosterone supplementation for men especially if they have low T and then Terry has a question about testosterone supplementation for women\n[noise] sure well I think this is one of those situations where the pendulum swings toward testosterone and that away from it and in part I think that's in a context of\nOne of the biggest studies that was published on hormones this time for winning the women's health initiative\nSo let me talk about that for a moment then I'll come back to men because in two thousand to about twenty three percent of American women were taking hormone therapy\nAnd then when the results came out that synthetic hormones as studied in the women's health initiative weren't dangerous and provocative much of the time it lead to millions of women stopping their hormones and when you settled offing\nTheir hormones you mean stopping estrogen and ...\n[noise] that's right says synthetic versions so what was studied in the women's health initiative was primer and and pro Vera they're kind of I think of them as the devil we know so we went from twenty three percent taking hormones to five percent which I think it's too low\nOther thing that this did besides scaring millions of women and getting them off their hormones is that it made the FDA\nSo sensitive and so fearful of recommending hormone therapy without long term randomized trials to support the use of it and so I think we are now living in a post women's health initiative era where we don't have\nEnough options we don't have enough\nConsensus around safe ways to prescribe things like testosterone for men or even testosterone for women\nSo I think you know it's an unfortunate situation\nYou know I'm not as current with the literature on\nLow T and men and Andrew pause to use of testosterone therapy I certainly have patients who are on it um and my sense is often this comes down to a quality of life decision\nAnd I can tell you you know I'm not a fan of men frosting themselves an excessive testosterone that's never a good idea but for men who have a low level of testosterone and that's well documented and we're getting them back into the physiologic range\nI think there's a strong argument to be made for that approach\n[noise] let me ask you about testosterone for women because the FDA has pretty much discouraged its use and yet my understanding is that for some women really can make a difference for a low libido has\nThat been your experience and is there evidence that that's the case [noise] there\nEvidence so ... you know what I can speak to you from the evidence and from what we know from the scientific literature and then I can also speak to you as a clinician on the front lines who prescribes testosterone for women\nAnd so in the first category\nYou're right the FDA has really there is no FDA approved form of testosterone for women everything that's FDA approved is for men and sometimes we you know cut patches and do other things to try to make it work for women but the doses are very high and stuff but it just doesn't translate and this is based on\nA few randomized trials one that stands out in my mind is one from the Massachusetts General hospital by ... where she showed that women after hysterectomy and after having their ovaries removed\nThat's you know the political situation where you're estrogen Andrew testosterone goes down to a very low level in those women if you get them at testosterone patch they end up having sex about\nOnce more per month compared to women not on the testosterone patch so this study is what made the FDA turned down approval of the testosterone patch for women this was maybe ten or Fifteen Years ago and we've really not had a lot of activities since then [noise]\nNow the problem is just looking at how often you have intercourse isn't the best measure of a woman sexual experience\nAnd so this has been kind of authority tricky issue and clinically the way that I've dealt with it is to say to my patients you know what we're going to do first is we're going to get your hormones back in the balance starting first with estrogen and protest Ronan cortisol and thyroid\nAnd I'm going to see where you are with your libido if you still have decreased libido and I have ways that I measure that then we may want to consider adding on some testosterone cream and I tell them you know listen there's no FDA approved formulation for this so it means that\nWe're basically involved in the ... an experiment here but I can also tell you after taking care of twenty five thousand patients that I have a lot of patients who are on testosterone cream and say that\nLife it improves their sex life it improves their connection with our partner so that the potential risks\nAre worth it so those risks are things like\nLiver function issue so I follow liver enzymes every uh six weeks to twelve weeks on my patients who are taking testosterone there's also some very limited data that there may be small increased risk of breast cancers that we do everything we can from\nJuneau mixed testing to buy a marker testing to reduce that risk of breast cancer as low as possible but those are some of the risks and it ends up being a quality of life decision that we renegotiate every three to six months when I see them in office [noise]\nThere there may be some very specific situations where you would say well probably you don't want to take this risk or are you sure you really want to take this risk for example someone who is making her living as a singer\nI'm might not want to risk the possibility that testosterone would change her vocal Tambor\n[noise] that's right I mean those the voice lowering effect is one of those risks that as part of informed consent with testosterone therapy [noise]\nBut I can also tell you that with my patients I'm so careful to make sure that we're\nIn the middle of the physiologic range and so side effects related to um what I Would call ... symptoms so that's total medical language when translate it for you\nSo for patients who have a voice lowering effect that tends to be when you're a super physiologic so you have levels of testosterone that are beyond the normal range\nAnother um sign of having too much testosterone is increased size of the color is so you know we're watching for those things it's part of the informed consent but if you have a patient who's within that physiologic range the chance that is very low\n[noise] duck the Godfrey a lot of women are aware that they may experience some changes in sexual function around ...\nBut I think that most people have an idea that once you're past menopause you're not interested in sex anymore that's really not a reasonable assumption is it [noise] well\nThis is such a personal decision I Believe and I you know I'm careful not to take my own values and my own attitude about sex into projected onto my patients so certainly I have patients who go through metal pause and they have made the decision\nThat the shop is closed [laughter] but I Would say I would say that's the minority\n\nThem back to the people's pharmacy I'm Terry grading and I'm Joe grading to purchase a CD of today show or any people's pharmacy broadcasts you can call eight hundred seven three two to

about political problems that may not be suitable for young listeners many medications can interfere with libido and sexual satisfaction are people warned about such side effects when they get a prescription\nOur guest is Dr Sara got fried she's a board certified gynecologist with more than twenty five years of experience her books include the hormone killer the hormone reset diet and younger\nDoctor Godfrey ... you mentioned that when you went to your family physician with some of the problems that you're experiencing the answer was an anti depressant\nAnd you also mentioned that some of your patients come in with mood disorders and I suspect that a lot of health care professionals would prescribe an anti depressant for someone who complained of feeling down in the dumps\nThe only trouble with those drugs is that they have a fairly high rate\nOf sexual dysfunction\nA four men it may be an inability to achieve or gas and but that may be true for women as well and it may also lower libido so can you give us a your perspective\nOn many of the medications that are prescribed that have this perhaps unexpected and undone discussed I mean this is not something a lot of\nHealth professionals like to talk about oh I'm I'm prescribing you Prozac and by the way it might ruin your love life how do you deal with that\n\nI Love this question so I you know I I think if you look at the most unbiased data on antidepressants and their role in depression which you find is that they're often worse than placebo in terms of effectiveness for mild to moderate depressed\nThey you can make an argument to prescribe but\nThe majority of patients that icy have mild to moderate depression\nAnd I think they have no business being prescribed in anti depressant I think they ... they need lifestyle medicine they need treatments that are designed to help them with the level of inflammation in their body which is at the root of why they feel depressed\nSo you know we we live in an era with a broken healthcare system if I step back for a moment and I know because I trained within it so I'm trained as a traditional physician and it's a it's an era of a pill for every hill\nAnd I think we found that this strategy has failed\nWe need a different strategy we know that about Seventy percent of health care costs are lifestyle related and I think the mood is a really good example so if we just if we just look at the hormonal drivers of mood for a moment we know that about fifty percent of people who are depressed have high cortisol levels\nIs that being checked by every primary care doctor who sees a patient who complains of depression no we know that about twenty percent of patients with depression have a low thyroid a function and that is tested a little more often but\nYou know I I think it's to me it's crucial to do a root cause analysis when you have a patient with the mood issue and to look at what I consider and women at least to be the hormonal Charlie's Angels to look at cortisol to look a thyroid and to look at estrogen\nSo for so many women will for all within a surgeon is a master regulator and when you start to make less it beginning in your forties sometimes in your fifties it can cause mood issues and so to me the first treatment should be to get those hormones back in the balance not to reach for the Prozac or some other anti depressant\nSo you're right I mean I Wish that every patient was given full informed consent about the adverse risks of being prescribed in the anti depressant I think we\nUnfortunately just live in a time where the average appointment with a a doctor in the U. S. is seven minutes and it's often faster and quicker to prescribe the Prozac\nOr whatever ... whatever the new anti depressant is rather than to really get to the root cause\nI'm suspecting that you have a number of patients who have come in your office and after you get done talking with him and eventually they say well you I Am having some libido issues and and sex isn't like it used to be\nYou find out the yeah they're taking some ball to or they're taking so Alexa where they're taking lecture pro or filling the blank there were a dozen of them\nAnd millions or tens of millions of people are relying on these medications on a daily basis whether they're helpful or not how do you how do you interact with a patient who is complaining of sexual dysfunction but has been on an antidepressant for months or years\n[noise] well we know we know from the best statistics that went in for American women over the age of forty has taken anti depressant and that's the number is double in my practice so about half of my patients come in taking an anti depressant so what I Do is\nI'm not someone who immediately removed every pharmaceutical that a patient is taking I don't think that served them well but what we want to do is take a look at OK what's happening with your body right now what's working well what ... what some of the intelligent design that we can enhance what's happening with your hormones\nAnd could we start to naturally balance those hormones and once you start feeling better start to withdraw\nThat she can stop and not have dramatic withdrawal symptoms from there are others where that's far less the case such as looks pro\nAnd so I have a strategy that I use with balancing hormones and also you know not just the hormones but what's happening in terms of your nutrients are you eating the foods that support a good mood are you getting the exercise that you need which I think is one of the best forms of anti depressant\nI think of it not as you know some it's good for your heart but it's also incredibly good for your mood\nYou know what about your connection with others argue socially isolated purpose and meaning so it's to me it's a much broader context from which to discuss whether someone should continue taking an antidepressant and similar to what I said about taking hormones it's not a yes no answer it's more\nOkay you've been taking the symbol to for ten years how do you feel on it\nWhat were you like before have you gained weight what can we do\nTo support you better what are your goals do you want to get off of it you know not just going to project my own views about anti depressant on to all of my patients so that gives you a little flavor I Hope of how I approach this in my practice\nAbsolutely on ... you have mentioned root causes Nell assist so I'm guessing that all these things go into your root cause analysis [noise]\nYes definitely you know I I started with food [laughter] and it's\nI feel like food as such important information for your body I don't think of it as calories I don't think of it is you know fuel I think of it as information for your DNA tell us more about that if he would please sure\nWell you know I think if you look at an ancestral health perspective we had a certain way of eating in our paleolithic times that was a good match for DNA\nAnd what's happened in the past especially one hundred years is that the way that we've eaten has dramatically completely changed\nNow that's also along with the change that we talked about earlier with stress with high perceive stress and the two kind of are in lockstep\nSo I'm a big fan of starting first with someone's diet and that doesn't that it doesn't matter whether they're coming soon because of decreased libido or they're coming to see me because they want to reduce the risk of breast cancer or\nUm they're having menopausal symptoms and can't sleep at night it doesn't really matter what the chief complaint is what matters is\nYou know this kind of system space to Nelson starting first with food\nSo I Want to know where your nutrients coming from\nWhen are you eating what are you eating whom are you eating with and how can we take where you are right now and make sure that you're getting the nutrients\nThat you need the macro nutrients micro nutrients the copper zinc selenium magnesium all the things that she needs to be able to function at your fullest\nWell speaking of food and perhaps bring 'em in that same direction towards natural approaches we've interviewed herbalists an F ... bought and this and sometimes they talk about", "show_name": "Garden Talk", "year": "2018", "city": "Madison", "day": "06"}
