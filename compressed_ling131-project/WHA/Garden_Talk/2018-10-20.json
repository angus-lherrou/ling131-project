for decades people have been told to take calcium pills to ward off ... or osteoporosis more recently they've been told they need vitamin D supplements as well\nJust how well does such supplements work a study published in jama at the end of two thousand Seventeen indicated they're not effective what\nAre the experts think about this research to find out we turn to Dr Robert wrecker O'Brian professor of medicine and chief of the division of endocrinology a Creighton University school of medicine he directs the osteoporosis Research Center\nDr Robert cracker welcome to the people pharmacy\nProud to be with you\nDr wrecker you have studied bone and preventing osteoporosis for much of your professional career you are if I'm not mistaken endocrinologist by trade\nI tell us a little bit about your perspective on vitamin D and calcium and other minerals we know that they are absolutely essential for bone strength but this study that was published in jama not too very long ago\nChallenged a lot of people's thinking especially with regard to dietary supplements like calcium in vitamin D it was a mess\nOf randomized clinical trials and concluded that taking supplements don't do anything to prevent fractures compared to placebo why do you challenge that\nWell I tell them that are on the basis of first of all it's a meta analysis and in general I have skepticism about them because they tend to be biased to the no and this particular study examined do very large number of meta analyses [noise]\nUh I Can't even remember the number but it was in the in the range of something like forty or fifty and they were hugely different in their study designs\nAnd so I I really don't accepted meta analyses are are a problem because uh the study designs are always different you know and the different studies that are included in the case of nutritional studies it's particularly a problem\nBecause these studies are all double blind placebo controlled trials well that's the design that pharmaceutical companies use to test drugs for four years and of advocacy and safety [noise]\nBut in the case of the pharmaceutical agent the placebo group has none of the pharmaceutical agent on board but on the case in the case of a nutritional supplements and everybody has some of the nutritional supplement in question on board\nOr they'd be disease you can make 'em disease\nTo write I mean it's to their diet in other words we're all getting calcium and we're getting some vitamin D either from the sun or from food\nRight and so you don't have a zero placebo and you can't expect to be a linear benefit\nAh for something like this and prevention infractions from the lowest to the highest levels in the blood and some of the some of the studies for example in this in this particular meta analysis didn't even have measurements of certain vitamin D levels\nDunno all over the place in other words if someone didn't have baseline once and some of them didn't have a\n\nWelcome back to the people pharmacy I'm Terry grading\nAnd I'm Joe grading if you would like to purchase a CD of the show you can call eight hundred seven three two to three three for

pills or do you need to be drinking lots of milk what about vitamin D supplements how well do they work to prevent osteoporosis our\nGuest is Dr Walter Willett he's professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard th Chan School of public health\nAnd he's professor of medicine at Harvard Medical school his book is eat drink and be healthy the Harvard Medical school died two healthy eating updated and expanded welcome\nBack to the people's pharmacy Dr Walter Willett it's so nice to have you back on our air\nOh thank you and good to be back with your\nDoctor will it or we saw a study a last year that was published in the journal of the American Medical Association which was a meta analysis\nOf thirty three clinical trials they looked at supplements of calcium and vitamin D and whether or not that kept people from breaking bones they concluded did not make any difference what's your take on this research place\nWell this area of calcium and vitamin D and bone health is a really a complicated area and ah I think the Smith in Alice ... didn't really help us sort out the complexity and does far from the final answer on this topic [noise]\nAh there were several issues uh bought one very important issue is that the amount of vitamin D and the foreman which are the way in which vitamin D is administered can make a very big difference in results\nThat are this studied lumped together a randomized trials for vitamin D\nThat cater to vitamin D in different ways including giving it and one injection for a whole year a very large amount or sometimes so once every month and especially if a when given once you're in very large amount there is pretty strong evidence from a large trial that that actually can increase\nThe risk of fractures that's of course very on natural way of giving vitamin D traditionally record in the sun and get a little bit every day are much more sort of study form of it\nTotally understand why giving a huge amount all at once can be bad for you but there's some reasonable hypotheses why that could be a problem and the evidence suggests that it is\nIf you do look at the studies that gave a reasonable does more than the old idea of four hundred international units and David and I'm more constant way uh those uh do show some benefits of a vitamin team upon fracture risk [noise]\nAnother problem with this limitation of this analysis was excluded studies that were done\nOn institutionalized or individuals like people living in assisted living our nursing homes and um those ... there are people too it's true that there are levels of vitamin D may be on average lower because he may not cut out in the sun\nAs much but uh in those kinds of studies the quality of study can actually be higher because you have a better chance of making sure people received their dose on a regular basis and some of the trials were included in that ...\nThere was a ... large loss to participation or people are taking their vitamin D day so then and now she's become almost a plague basically that anybody with a guy who can connect with the Internet\nAh basically can do an American ally send your letters piling up with that analysis that I really I think misleading [noise]\nA good bit of news is that there will be shoveled quite large and I think pretty well done studies\nThat look a vitamin ... that will become they've finished already in fact a few months ago they're actively analyzing their data and so hopefully within the next year we'll have quite a bit more evidence on this important topic\nNow Dr we'll let you have\nBeen involved in literally hundreds of research studies over decades and a lot of your work has been in in the field of nutrition and I I've I've long wondered why it is\nThat some investigators think that they should treat nutrients like drugs and so you know you've mentioned these very large injectable doses of vitamin D fifty thousand a hundred thousand units and\nAnd then they ... they look in amazement when they go well that that wasn't helpful or maybe it was even counterproductive and you say well Mother Nature never intended us to get this gigantic amount of vitamin D all at once rather than the way it was supposed to be which is a small amount every day\nSo why do you think they even designed those studies that way\n[noise] I had a good question I I think maybe it's a little naive I'm at in some ways it's\nThat I wouldn't criticize people too harshly for doing those studies or just that they need to be very careful about the conclusions vitamin D is stored and if you could get the benefits from a single dose once a year that would be very nice\nBut I think the issue it turns out that that doesn't look like you're kind of there could actually be some harm but it's just if we'd generalize the findings from those kinds of very abnormal kind of\nTrials to conclude that vitamin D isn't in general beneficial ... that's the real problem\nThat you will let the other nutrients that was included in this meta analysis was calcium\nAnd you and we have talked about calcium supplements in the past but not all of our listeners have heard your ideas about calcium supplements so please tell us should we all be taking calcium supplements to keep our bones strong\n... another good question and again this is complicated because we know that vitamin or the calcium is absolutely essential at that\nKeeping our heart rhythm are orderly uh die as a critical part of bone composition and so we have to get some calcium so the issue is how much\nAnd we also know that like most essential nutrients if you get too much you actually can cause harm so uh it's finding that sweet spot audits are a real game\nAnd the amounts of calcium that we need our I think are not totally clear at this point in time but the way the amount of calcium requirement is set in the United states\nIs on the basis of very short term studies that last just two or three weeks basically looking at how much calcium can we sort of forced into the bone during a period of ... just a few weeks\nAnd that almost surely will give us a misleading answer because we know that you get some short term changes in bone density that do not reflect what happens in the long run that's very well established and so we have requirements that are set on these very short term studies\nAnd you get results saying we need for over fifty twelve hundred milligrams a day\nWhich means almost for sure you need to be taking a couple of servings of dairy products to get up to that level whereas the world Health Organization has a step back and look at the bigger global picture and they noticed what has actually been known for quite a few decades\nThat the countries that consume the most dairy and have the highest calcium and takes actually have the highest fracture it's in the world at northern Europe in the United states in countries that do not consume dairy\nAnd have a much lower calcium and takes the story of course are getting some calcium or they have the lowest fracture rights so we I think we can't conclude from that kind of study that\nA calcium and ... cause it's fractures but it does say pretty clearly that we don't need to have these very high and takes a calcium and Jerry to ... to be able to have low rates of fractures\nUK looked at the evidence and they came up with seven hundred milligrams of calcium instead of five hundred milligrams of the world Health Organization sued was adequate far below the U.S\nNumbers so whether we need five hundred seven hundred I think is uh that's probably closer to uh the correct answer not to twelve hundred milligrams\nAnd of course if we need seven hundred or you can get to that where if you're ever going to die without any dairy products at all but one serving of dairy would be fine and I think if you're concerned about calcium or five hundred milligrams a day dose could be a pretty good dose\n\nWelcome back

Carolina to track brain how available for home research and clinical applications online at gauge your brain dot com\nToday we're discussing the nutritional foundation for strong bones what's supplements might you need to prevent osteoporosis or or supplements a waste of time and money\nOur guest is Dr Walter Willett professor of epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard T H Chan School of public health\nDoctor will it is also professor of medicine at Harvard Medical school he's co author of eat drink and be healthy the Harvard Medical school guide to healthy eating updated and expand it\nDr Willett [laughter] you know the vitamin D story is so fascinating to me because the epidemiology and you are\nSort of in some respects you know the father of epidemiology and the twenty first century I mean you've been guiding so many um of your medical students and your colleagues in this field\nThe epidemiology suggested vitamin D is essential for so many things and yet some of the randomized double blind placebo controlled trials suggests that just\nAdding vitamin D may not be producing the benefits that we expect and there are a bunch of studies that are in process right now so we'll have to wait to see the results but if\nTaking vitamin D doesn't lead to the outcomes that we would hope for\nWhat does this say about sort of a natural process of actually getting sun exposure to boost your vitamin D levels it'll drive the dermatologist crazy but is it possible that the supplements won't live up to expectations\nOn get certainly possible that the ...\nAnd blood levels more reflect a sunlight exposure\nBut there are major problems were randomized trials when it comes to studying nutrition and ... this applies to some other areas as well but ah probably first and foremost that\nWhen we look at cancer this is a process that developed over many decades and most randomized trials go on for just three or four or five years\nAnd for looking at cancer cardiovascular disease or that's just a little tiny window in a in a process that goes on for for many decades and it's easily possible that we will miss some benefits there and just as one example\nThat uh most of the randomized trials of not showing the vitamin supplements benefits cardiovascular disease but\nFor the physicians health study this was one study that went on for twelve years\nIn a little bit longer for some people there was a significantly lower risk of a total cancer incidence we're taking a multiple vitamin supplements in that study but looking in that study if it ... it it only going on for eight years so that would not have been seen was a much benefit\nBut still an eight or ten percent reduction in total cancer incidence is actually pretty important and I would have been missed and every other study that's been done just simply on the basis of ah not being long enough so I think many of the trials are now I have\nA point of the problems is of course that and many of the trials even by four or five years many people are not no longer taking supplements so you're really not testing the hypothesis that people get tired of it you need a lot of commitment\nAnd the physician's self study was people who are really very committed they were physicians you never were long term studies were important and so that the long term study was possible\nAlso there's the issue that\nWhen we give nutritional supplement uh it's not like a new drug where the people getting placebo are not getting any of that drug\nBut in the context of a nutritional study\nAlmost everybody's getting some of the nutrient that were testing and so many people already may have sufficient intake that nutrient and adding more producers we expect no benefit if they already have enough\nBut it may be that there's twenty or thirty percent or even ten percent who are not getting enough and would benefit for more and that would be missed in almost every study that's been done because there's not enough statistical power to pick up a benefits in a even a fairly substantial sums up [noise]\nSo all these problems of direction of the study compliance or here instead of taking the supplements and then the fact that in the background many people are already getting enough of what's being tested all those factors go together to make it really\nDifficult to do is strong studies in giving a supplement a in a randomized trial context\nDr Willett it's clear that a cancer development is a long term process the development of heart disease can take place after many years osteoporosis is also something that doesn't happen overnight it it builds up gradually\nWe recently like yesterday I think got an email from a woman named Mary who said\nThat she um has been diagnosed with osteoporosis she broke her shoulder and that's what led them to their diagnosis Seventy nine years old and vitamin D three level is sixty three she says I'm assuming she actually means or twenty five I draw the line and Mindy\nAnd she says I Can't take the best spots in each that my doctor has prescribed they just make me\nI Do to improve my bones\n[noise] well it's really hard to be specific about any specific guys share and it goes situation of course in ... we'd want to know a lot more about a person that low blood levels ... grams per a leader is pretty good vitamin D level\nAnd it's it seems probably unlikely that more vitamin D is going to be beneficial and of course calcium intake is a\nNecessary one would want to know if a person is getting adequate calcium from their diet and if not at\nModest supplement that\nMight be good or changing a diet is another possibility and for going to have some dairy I lose a lot of evidence suggesting that yogurt is a pretty good for him to get the dairy\nSome of these drugs do have access to the young and can't tolerate it but I think when we're really need to look at the overall picture about one factor that is absolutely important and comes through in every study is that physical activity helps build up bones and reduce fracture risk it reduces fracture is\nBoth by reducing the risk of falling through improving muscle strength and also bones respond to the mile stresses of physical activity\nBy essentially getting stronger so the one thing that surely should be part of the package for everybody is to incorporate a physical activity\nAnd that but it's important to remember that it's really stressing the bones\nSo that out walking around or jogging or jumping will help your legs and help prevent hip fractures but that won't have the upper arms\nOr that her body and the arms so uh it's important as as we get older to include resistance training\nThat gives a little bit of a workout to all the bones in our body and you can do that with some rubber band kind of a simple exercises you don't need to even go to a gym to do that but with some but simple strength building as a as lots benefits and refresh reduction is truly one of those and often ignored\nYou pointed out that it's important to get enough calcium in your diet and you mentioned the benefits of yoga but what about people who don't tolerate milk even yogurt they may be lactose intolerant perhaps they're allergic there's there's quite a few of them now where else in the diet do they get their calcium\n[noise] we'd get calcium through a lot of different foods but should a green leafy vegetables are particularly\nGood source whole grains have a modest amount and with a a diet that is what we think is sort of healthy Mediterranean diet with\nWhole grains fruits and vegetables or a a maybe a little bit of cheese or yogurt or if you're a ... if you'd like to us intolerance you usually tend to have some cheese and modest amounts\nWhich is an option but you can get quite a bit of calcium without any dairy products however if you're concerned a modest calcium does I think it's reasonable ... supplement uh like five hundred milligrams\nA day to a ... to the background that that will usually get people up to her at least around eight hundred milligrams", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Garden Talk", "city":
