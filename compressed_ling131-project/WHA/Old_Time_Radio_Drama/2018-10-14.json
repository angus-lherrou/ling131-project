Lionel Barrymore where the mainstay of Dr killed their each week on radio\nThat led to some serious trouble well at least you know I was telling the truth about the headaches Aspen I knew that anyway question there's no other Craig can be convinced\n[noise]\nAll right gentlemen I Believe you're clinics report and your own opinion but boy is suffering from hyper oh yeah and the stigma autism so where does that with us well for\nOne thing was the great means he did have that age in school and that means he was telling the truth about his reason for playing\nHockey All right I'll buy that too but I'm not the drawing officer gentlemen I'm investigating a fire that caused a man's death and a half million dollars lost and that's something else again while the rest of the story could be true you know a lot of things could be Dr Carroll down but I work on probabilities\nNow is the boy hadn't been present the number one probability would be accidental calls so far we found nothing to back that up and throw them all Eddie was present so the first probability is that he said it accidentally\nChecking you may have said it deliberately\nDo many ridiculous he doesn't show one I was I accept the Jenkins boy story I'm forced into a line of investigation I don't believe it's a moment awesome criminal intent by persons I'm known probably the collection of Jordan who's been done before in this case it doesn't make sense\nThe gasoline warehouse wasn't enjoyed for enough to pay for the fear in the building but the maximum importing company next door was only that isn't where the fire started it's worthy or the voices\nTactic you into your stubborn man [noise] alright\nSuppose I say I don't give some thought to that angle to start at least I don't know whether you thought of this at the bars on the level is the only witness and the Austin is if there is one has already committed one murder right I should have thought that the boys' room or to God I just I Will be\nWomen get someone to relieve you and meet me up in ...\nI I like to play and when you get that Oh yes yes bring that monkey wrench\n\nDr Gillespie thanks for backing me up with the greatest after now\nWell you'd already done your neck a dime response or both boys so what else could I Do know sentiment then but thanks anyway ... founder they still doesn't mean that I'm Still on the theory yours above the pot\nAnd my only the area that any Jenkins is telling the truth of fires Craig business I'm a doctor\n[noise] I'll get\nKilled in a way that you can I ask what do you mean you have an option right man get many daddy now I Know he was telling the truth I don't know if\nSomeone just tried to kill him\n\n[noise]\nWhen he returned to the story of Dr killed there in just a moment [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise] oh me continue the story of Dr children already where the larger ... larger doing [noise]\nHit the more ... than I should I think he'll drink anymore yeah all of the better\nGimme weaken discontinued a tour of all I'm now ...\nNow I asked him are now what is it hot tea and good for you come on try All right I think we caught in\nTime back to last but yeah but ... ... women yes sure where did this box of chocolates I'm from well jeep was\nDark I don't know [laughter] some messenger delivered at the desk I'm In the lobby and they send it up I didn't know he wasn't supposed to have candy nobody shutting knocking I don't know what was going to affect them like the tall right away and well what else\nWould have suspected that the moon name on the box of gold card or anything\nHow many chocolates did eat well a tree I guess that's how many ... still owe me I didn't talk to one myself which is lucky for you call it it wouldn't hurt me none right you know what are they viewed eaten any of these\nOne of the day going down right now is the Jimmy hill I imagined Craig wanna see them to ... you hold them in your\nPocket yeah you're right we got there\nWell I guess we've done about all we can live with a moment ...\nStay with them or do you park until I can get a relief nurse alright you stay too I'm In and keep your eyes I'll get your guts your boss only if it's none of my business which is about oh I never heard of no candy making no patient that's no probably not because it's very seldom that you find candy loaded with ...\n\n... not a single identifying mock of any kind of on the box it's a common brand can be bought in any store in New York City\nAnd when there isn't much to work on well what about the messenger mystic grade the boy who delivered the candidate Austin oh there's a chance there of course but it's been one he wasn't in uniform wasn't the regular messenger in other words so\nYou know Mr Clegg being diagnosed hesitant orange of similarity to being a detective who may be right Dr Gillespie I take it that the symptoms glue you got 'em and I try to find some logical explanation for The Cosby I ended up yes that's pretty much the way I work too well there's another similarity Mr Gray\nMedicine we also use your theory of probabilities you know start with the most probable cause and eliminate possibilities one by one All right\nGentlemen All right there's no need to be against the wall high see what you're driving up good\nI'm ready to accept the Jenkins boys story all of it after what's happened now idea of who were not to agree with you in fact I guess I owe him an apology\nAll right and I think we can safely assume that whoever tried to poison the boy also started the fire is the probability seem fairly strong on that assumption we don't have any leads on the poisoning and I doubt if we will have\nLike we do have an angle on the fire now that that is story is admitted as evidence you mean that are funny boy she thinks he can identify that's right tactic there I\nShould be able to supply that voice for identification by tomorrow afternoon\nI'm no\nGosh I'm kinda scared Dr killed there\nThat guy down on you said he did I don't want to train and then fight as well as nothing be scared of Eddie and the sooner each book where he belongs to the sooner you will be safe but meeting them face to face maybe I'll do it again try to kill me I'll worry he was\nIn fact I doubt that you'll really meeting face to face just as Mr quake was bringing the knock him his voice yeah but how can you do that you can't just bring Scott and\nWe all come into the less famous Greg let me get this anyway I think a political tape recorder Eddie I told you was probably thinking of voice instead of a man asks and I'm not even sure that's\nThe right voice I guess I can ... [noise] ...\n... ... founded ... that lovely glad when this thing is straightened out so I can go back to resemble business as a practicing medicine I'm with you there Dr Gillespie month now it if\nThere are several voices recorded on this take one of them may be the man you heard in the White House just before the fire or maybe not but listen carefully and tell me what you think you understand Yes sir go\nSpend reasonable amount\nTime not insurance companies again in ... [noise]\nI guess my function Mr every time there's a majestic my primary function\nIs doing their job was to fire them I Know his voice on the line okay\nCraig my final argument on\nOn when he was well I understand it do you do what you called applied to the same one that you're sure and that is to start to think\nWow that whose voice was it an end was insured with us max and max and importing company [noise] so what's the next ... calling the police and then go pick him up as simple as that\n\nSupport for W.
