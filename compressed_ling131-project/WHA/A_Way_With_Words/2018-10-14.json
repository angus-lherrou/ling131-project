about language\nEight seven seven nine to nine nine six seven three or send us your questions in email that address is words that we were\nRadio dot O. R. G. O. your way with words Hi who's this\nThis is Barbara Murray and I'm calling from Curtis by the the California\nWell hello Barbara nice to talk to you Barbara what's up\nHigh speed to talk to you guys to what can we do for you well um I have a question\nAbout a phrase that my mom always used and I never heard anyone else use it and it got to be kind of a family joke so now when we use it only use it like in a in a joking kind of way because we thought it was such a silly phrase\nSo she would always say whenever she thought we were going someplace like I grew up in northern California in the bay area so like when we had to go over to San Francisco\nAnd she knew it was going to be crowded and she would be like oh I really don't want to go it's going to be a mob scene and so that was her favorite she would always call things that she didn't even know for sure but anything she thought was going to be crowded and she called it a mob scene and\nMy kids picked it up and it just became a family joke so now when we talk about going anywhere where like oh God should we go it's going to be on biopsy\n[laughter] why why not just because it's employed so often to me it always\nSounded like I didn't know where she got the phrase I never heard anyone else say it and it ... like it sounds vaguely sinister but the way she said it didn't really sound scary but I always pictured like the scene in the old Frankenstein movie where the the crowd is joining the castle with flaming\nTorches [laughter] pictures when she said mob scene so I just you know I wanted to know what was the real origin of the phrase due to other people use this did she make it up\nOh no it's been around for quite a while since since at least ah the late Eighteen hundreds mob scene and it referred to kind of the kind of seeing that you're talking about just it comes from the world to see\nIt or in a whole bunch of ... going on stage you know they're big climactic crowd scenes yeah yeah ground only\nSomehow the the word mob makes it sound more horrible or bigger\nOne has developed nuances over the centuries sense of frustrated popped into the English language depending on contract so sometimes mob automatically imply violence or danger yeah\nYeah which which it was not in her case it was just me and she wasn't I Would not say that she wasn't any scientific says agoraphobia she just didn't like to go any place that was crowded ... even though she constantly had to and so she would just always use that phrase and like I said now it's a family joke\nI Love the word mob too because it comes from the Latin mobile a bogus which means the ah the changeable\nCommon people the FAA fickle common people in the mobile oh hey like mobile it's related to mobile and move and the ... as soon as he was like vulgar or\n... owners are in common or ... yeah exactly say ... yeah so\nThe mobile a vogue us was was the uh the common people to the crowd that would sing ... one day in crucify him just\nA mob isn't necessarily bad it's just a whole lot of people\nAnd disorganized ... will you never called soldiers on parade a mob because they're in writing and rose rode\nWreck they're very organized whereas a mob is just a bunch of people milling around right wing maybe\nPart of what my mother didn't like was just a whole ton of disorganized faithful\nYeah I'm picturing all the extras\nKnow saying peas and carrots peas and carrots or whatever it is a name to simulate crowd noise steamboat [laughter]\nWell that's great I just you know as I said I have really never heard anyone else use it and I didn't know if she had made it up or if it was a real thing and I just I Love that it's become a joke thing it's really one of those I rolling thing now\nYeah ... yeah\nI think she would be happy to know or carry it on for her\nAnd now I'm going to think of her whenever I hear that\nTerm get well my mom with a great person was great yeah Barbie thank you for your call we really appreciate it okay you have a great day Bye bye bye\nWe've talked about this on the show before how words that are now ordinary were once condemned is horrible I'm yeah I'm mob was one of those words so it earlier Seventeen ten Jonathan Swift and other people described the word mob as terrible it was a shortened form of Latin phrase\nAnd he said it's the result of a natural tendency towards relapsing it's about Barry which delights in modern syllables this criticism of shortening words which is perfectly ordinary way to make new words in English and at least three hundred years old\nAnd a long tradition a natural tendency towards relapsing into the bar parity but it's not human condition [laughter]\nIf he had pearls he would have been clutching them right [laughter] eight seven seven Ninety nine nine six seven three\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nGiving up on something then you throw in the towel alright an expression that comes in boxing I think just throwing his funds to yeah that's\nWhat I was going to say that check up this find your check in the ... is an earlier term that also comes from boxing that means the same thing I'm going to check up the sponge\nSo he no longer going to wipe out the blood on the matter whether what the brown no longer going to participate in writing journalistic endeavor you're done check up the sponge done ski so go do something good in the ... I don't know [laughter] eight seven seven nine to nine nine six seven three hello you have a way with words\nWe cook avoiding fragrant yellow occurring and we show you basically the toaster spice coming up this week almost radio from here in town on the ideas that one\nYou're listening to a way with words the show about language and how we use it on ...\nAnd Martha burn it a while back we had a conversation with a young woman in Florida\nWho naturally use the expressions yes ma'am and no sir and some people thought that was a little strange a little affected but it was just the way that she taught right and that reminded during the Hickey from Austin, Texas\nAbout an experience that she had in ninth grade in ... Ohio which is about fifty miles outside of Cleveland she wrote to us\nI was a very quiet girl shy and slightly backward but I was smart and in what was then called advanced classes\nMy dad was in the military and we moved around a lot so I was really quiet and shy for that reason our home and family was Mississippi\nShe goes on to talk about how one day early in the school year her English teacher asked her a question and during the answered yes ma'am\nHer teacher was indignant and said you do not said ma'am to me it is disrespectful do you understand\nEnter into automatically responded yes ma'am [laughter]\nAnd she goes on to say remember I'm from Mississippi and in that day not saying that could get you a wooden spoon to the back side we were born sing it before we said mama and daddy but the teachers saw it as smart alec in in her defense sometimes kids would say yes ma'am or something like that sarcastically\nAnyway her teacher ended up sending to rent it to the principal's office\nAnd she goes on I had never been there before I was embarrassed shamed and mortified what had I done my first year and I'm In trouble two weeks into being there\nThe principal read the note listen to me talk and proceeded to tell me here in northeastern Ohio we speak standard English we do not slur our ours we do not stretch out our words we do not see certain things they are not correct\nI was sent home with a note from him to have my parents sign it and come have a talk he made arrangements for me to have speech therapy what I was mortified\nFortunately though she writes my parents fell out laughing I never did do therapy I graduated with high honors from that school system after changing schools two more times in four years I didn't think it funny at the time but I can look back over fifty years later and laugh\nOh I'm not going to live on\nFor her\nI knew you would be not about function is not alone is not an area that requires doesn't require better than I was gonna say the same thing I Am not to the funny stage yet [laughter] I Want to go to ... marching on her behalf\nCalled me up for her because she said yes man right or and she speaks with the Mississippi accent yeah bless her heart oh I'm sure she's not the only\nPerson with a story I notion that we get emails and calls about that yeah I grew up speaking French in Maine and we're told the English speaking schools that they couldn't speak to people who had their hands smacked for speaking Spanish at the religious schools\nBut not at school yeah I just finished reading about code talkers the Navajo and um they were forced to go to the English speaking schools where they were spanked if they spoke Navajo to\nHoping attitudes are changing yeah during the thanks for sharing that story yeah just to underline a dialect isn't a thing to be corrected it's a thing to be cherished well said eight seven seven nine to nine nine six seven three email words labored radio dot org hello you have a way with words\nHi this is that taking I'm from Idaho and again I had a question about the ... language okay um I had a brother in law passed and I don't I I had kind of drug into the whole batch culture around guy to hell in Idaho has a very large act\nCommunity mhm and so um [noise] I find it pretty fascinating that language is\nUm consider quite ancient uh is not related to any of the countries around ... am I in Spain and France So\nI Wonder what your cake was on edge\nWell that's the best nutshell description I've heard of basking in a while [laughter] pretty much it it's what's known as a language isolates do you notice expression\nYes I I look at yeah gotcha\nSo language I flew the one that does not connected directly to the languages around it and it is believed that bask predates the Indo European languages that it was it was a language spoken before\nThe people who brought all the Indo European languages into Europe before they arrived and or a little bit about its history because there are few ah inscriptions on grave sites um a lot of the place means give us clues to it\nBut the strong evidence is that it is not directly connected to any of the romance languages although it did borrow from Latin it's not connected to any of the Germanic languages other than maybe few words that have traveled from the genetic languages into French and men in tobacco and things like that and so it's it's it's a very interesting thing it is about\nSpoken by about seven hundred thousand people give or take although almost all the speakers of bilingual and there are numerous dialects of it I think there's four major dialects bask\nAnd uh it's just a very interesting curiosity this remnants of another time and I'm not much is known about it and where it comes from although it's it's heavily studied because it's so interesting then until unconnected to the languages around it\nConnected to the shelter at all or say I heard that that people were somehow connected with the ... maybe the Welsh his own Irish\nThere are some people who've tried to\nPropose that theory but it doesn't withstand scrutiny some people have looked at genetic similarities between certain bodies of people um and things I found something they were again generally it falls apart there are superficial similarities between all languages in the world and what you need is a consistent similarity across multiple\nFeatures of the language for example where you would expect the verbs if one verb is similar between languages we expect many of the verbs to be similar between languages if there's one word for say a relationship term like\nFather or mother rudest expect many other relationship terms to be the same and it's just not the case so I Believe the evidence is because there is no connection to Welsh there is no connection to the Celtic languages um it's not related to Cornish it's not related to the other languages spoken in France that aren't French and and so forth\nOut yeah it's a very interesting very interesting which was and the people themselves I think are very interesting what their or in one sense here of trying to ... um he'll ever was ruling on Spain had bar\nThat's a really common story across cultures it's not just Spain\nBut even in France some of their regional languages were stumped out by this French need for to establish a nation state with a French identity that was built upon the language and sensitive on French is the common language so by looks booking and Brittany are all but gone\nUm it's unfortunate but I'm having the United states as well and Canada and Australia and\nThe China just happens pretty much anywhere we're a nation sees its identity has been firmly attached to one language\nThey almost always put in a program of stopping the other languages\nFast food is really good and you have your relatives treated you to any\nOh yes they they have my sister has come up quite the cooks really Boise has what they call a vast lock and they have a cultural ... too but there are many bars and restaurants in the Boise area that are preserving the\nThe heritage foods as well so yeah it's pretty interesting\nYeah will Peggy thank you for telling us about all that we appreciate your calling well yeah well thank you for having me on the air that they take care Bye bye Bye bye bye\nEight seven seven Ninety nine nine six seven three\nWere talking earlier about using the term Georgia's an adjective meaning something really great\nAnd I wanted to mention that I had a lightbulb experience uh back when I was learning Greek and realize that the named George comes from Greek words that literally means farmer or earth's work or you think about geo\nIn George being related to a geo in English you know geo political or whatever and a ... or ... in in a Greek meaning work\nAs in ergonomics used the latter part of that name so it's an earth worker a farmer\nSuper interesting or does a measure of some kind
