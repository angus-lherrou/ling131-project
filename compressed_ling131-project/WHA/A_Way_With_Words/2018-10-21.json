the show how can we help you\nThe phrase that my grandmother used to use a she grew up in North Carolina and she would say crazy as a vet sea bug\nCrazy is in bad shape and now crazy that\nThing because it was never like if someone made her laugh she wouldn't say oh you know some people say oh you're so crazy or something like that she would never use it in that way it was if somebody was doing something that she thought was stupid\nOh man she would say that part of it is crazy over this [laughter]\nAnd I I haven't heard it much um I spent some time and when I was a child in North Carolina I heard it there but as far as north I've not heard it even from people who've come from the same region\nUh-huh and have you heard the term Betsy bug it all\nNow I have no idea I Know I should I should look that up more but I have no idea what a bad thing [laughter] well\nWe can tell what a bet you I guess it's um it's a kind of beetle it also goes by the name patent leather beetle which kind of gives you an idea it's it's kinda\nKinda bad as big as your son and and black and shiny sometimes called the horned beetle but it's also called abet sea bug or a best bug or a Bessie bug\nAnd um you see this phrase crazy is Betsy bug or different variations of that uh throughout the south and\nNobody really knows why a ... might be considered crazy except it does make an interesting sand is kind of like you know when you disturb it it makes is kind of\nLike a little running cat when you when it gets annoyed with you know like\nThat kind of a you know kind of a fuzzy you they're pretty sizable and I'm In this beautiful black patent leather looking thing\nI guess that's why it's crazy because other bugs don't talk to you [laughter]\nYou don't really see them swarming\nI'd only seen them you know just wandering around kind of well maybe maybe you're right\nI read his thing [laughter] so that's where there were there ... and that's why I wanted that that's why I said it wasn't when she knew there was quite the opposite when she was just wonderful\nI always say I'm going to be I was really bloody recall ... spoke with us today thank\nYou sound like I'm so happy live folk\nAnd with both of you okay for work and how can listening as well thanks ally but I actually\nHello you have a way with words\nA little joke from Wilson, Wyoming Joseph welcome to the show how can we help you I have a question about from par or under par when it's used as a Gulf term on her ... a viral thing for states that you want to find yourself\nIn almost every other endeavor that I think they're under our is not something you want to find yourself being\nRight right right All right so we can explain this there are two different\nScales here two different measuring scale and so what do you need to remember is that each sport has its own way of considering something really great score are really good score for example if you got to sixty nine in golf that's usually pretty\nAll people but not a very good games you get a sixty nine of baseball people like for during\nYour [laughter] having to learn and ready to go to a store [laughter]\nSo we're talking about different measuring skills for each part of life not just sports and a golf has this really interesting thing where they start with a an agreed upon number so let's say sixty nine and you go a little bit above her a little bit below but that number is considered standard are par the number that a professional\nProbably could reach on this course ... given sufficient time and expertise and and some experience on the court so so golf is a skill that low to high and so with low being better and so many other things most of the rest of the things in life\nAre the skill as high tolo was hiding butter and so it's just that court so we're still talking about part of being standard average or this\nThis police that we're going to compare ourselves against it just to golf new low score and everything else almost you need a high score for teaching the sub par that we use in everyday life actually doesn't come from golf it's just golf borrowed its power from regular English and the regular ... to standard usage of par\nWere part of the number that you're going to try to beaten do above them so it's a path\nJustice thank you for your call we really appreciate it\n[laughter] but I already have our\nLanguage has its ... but sports always just as extra Moore's seems to go one more beyond ordinary in making the language its own for each individual sport\nRight and adding to our language right and then and then it's like when you're back yeah oh yeah turn it the feedback loop continues to go back into the mainstream language\nWe should say that part comes from the Latin for equal and I thought you know you're on a par with somebody you're equal with him eight seven seven Ninety nine nine six seven three\n[noise]\nSmith from rancho pallas Verde California wrote to us with a family word uh her daughter pips you enjoy jazz recordings she especially loved the singer elephants Gerald\nComing up this week I mostly radio from here in town on the ideas that\nYou're listening to a way with words the show about language and how we use it I'm ... and nice to burn it\nWhen's the last time you really listen to silence\nI've been thinking about that ever since reading a passage from a book by Paul Goodman called speaking in language here's what he has to say about silence\nNot speaking in speaking are both human ways of being in the world and there are kinds in grades the beach\nThere's the dumb silence slumber or apathy this sober silence that goes with the solemn animals face the first will silence of awareness pass cheering the sole wince emerge new thoughts the active silence of alert perception ready to say this this\nThe musical silence that accompanies absorbed activity\nThe silence of listening to another speak catching the dressed in helping him be clear the noisy silence of resentment and self recrimination loud and sub vocal speech but selling to say it\nBaffled silence\nThe silence of peaceful accord with other person's or communion with the cosmos\nAnd I was so struck by that passage I just keep thinking about it because it really lays out lots of different kinds of silence mhm and when do we ever get to hear silence to begin with\nDrew silence not jazz less noise right was pilots right\nI don't think we do one of the things that I have read about in the last couple of years is the parts of speech that our silence\nWhere we think of language is being but talking part of the language is also the part where we stopped talking it's also the part where we leave a space for ourselves or for others to pick up a thread or to continue the conversation that silence is just as important as the other end says\nMhm yeah when I Do improv it's you know one has a compulsion to keep talking but sometimes the most powerful moments are when you're completely quiet\nYeah that compulsion to keep talking is deal cop and journalists tricked right where you sit quiet for just a minute [laughter] hurt by the interviewee is going to feel like they have to fill it\nRained things that they shouldn't have said right the term for that in art is horror vacuum of a fear of of the vacuum you don't have to say that I appreciate silence I'm a guy who wears ear plugs when I work and when I sleep I like quite a lot I mean a lot along but\nI'm also a guy who on his podcast player app\nSets it to take the filing for gas politic and fit more and somebody listening [laughter] you actually speed up the ... I don't anymore I used to do that because uh it's you have to give it a hundred percent of your attention when it's a really fast right there I used to but now I think which helps quite a bit you can take\nFor every ten hours I listen I can take out about an hour of science depending on the podcast wait you take out your automatic playing it quickly it\nAutomatically removed the silence when people pause orders or break between segments or that sort of thing\nOh man I guess it depends on the topic what parts\nFriends can mimic unfortunately So Paul Goodman silence and his book speaking of language that's assignments that I really want those are the moments that I really appreciate how rare they are have is going to say even in a church which we think of as being assignment place distilled hum of the air conditioning and the cars outside and\nThe kids in Bible study right or even at a funeral or someplace like that there's music playing in the hallway and quite whispered conversations there's no real silence\nMhm yeah I guess that's what meditation is all about the right to ... through your mind\nWe'd love your thoughts on assignment as a part of communication and language he seven seven nine to nine nine six seven three email words it we were radio dot\nOrg hello you have a way with words Hi Hi this is\nA will calling from Lexington, Kentucky and I had a question about I'm washing machines and dishwashers\nYeah sure it will get the repair guys out and we'll get that sorted\n[laughter] actually is a bit of a more of a nomenclature question though before we moved into the the new house that we have here we did not have one of the automatic dish washing machine\nWe were just doing things by hand so I was calling it the washing machine for a while which apparently is reserved for the call was washing machine\nSo I was just curious are two things one why does the clothes washing machine ... the official moniker a washing machine whereas the dishwasher has the specific to it and why couldn't call the washing machine the clothes washing machine\n[laughter] right\nBecause it's it's usually uses a washer the washing machine and very rarely do you throw in the word closer laundry when you're talking about the device I think we can start some of the south for you All right\nMore importantly to settle a bit of a disagreeing with my uh girlfriend here is it appropriate to call their clothes washing machine or is that\nNot allowed oh are you both from Kentucky\nI Know we're both from Ohio originally we've been in Kentucky about two months now so we haven't quite picked up the way they speak here but we both move around quite a bit a guy who got some time in Los Angeles she's got some time in Japan of all places\nOh let's let's set that second part aside for now my wife and I do like to interfere with marriages as much as we can [laughter] for sure look kind of a linguistics at first so first thing you've got to understand is that the machine the dish washing machine\nReplaced people who are already known as dishwashers so we called the dish washing machine the dishwasher because the people who used to the job are also known as dishwashers there's a clear like very long separation between the people dishwasher and the machine dishwasher\nAnd actually you can see this happened with the word computer we have this device on her desk now called the computer the people who used to do that kind of really complicated math\nWere also noticed computer so this happens again and again an English where the machine that takes over the human job thing gets the human name so that's part of the reason why interesting yeah it's part of the reason why the dishwashers called the dishwasher the other thing is that in washing machine that word washing referring to the task of cleaning clothes are doing the laundry\nIs centuries old uh centuries older than any other kind of\nHow ... form of any word related to washing like we have long needed to launder are close and we have called them the washing or the laundry for very long time so Washington mean washing clothes\nHas been ensconced in specialized as to where the linguist might use special like this one particular kind of washing since the fourteen hundreds\nSo wow All right now because washing when you say I'm going to do the washing most people prop\nThat you were talking about the laundry in the u._k. they might actually think that you met the dishes which is interesting\nThat you know staying and I think the other thing that's going on here too is the dishwashers weren't part of the everyday household right in this country until the fifties right now and the washing machines were little or well the word torture\nMeaning machine dishwasher due to the Eighteen\nSixties right right but I mean in in somebody's home right\nEveryday use of it yeah you had industrial dishwashers a rational dishwashers right [noise] so it really worth talking to kind of a quarter of events here which kind of use became more common sooner than the other ones the kind of\nTakes the mantle as the definitive meaning for that word and you find that again and again in English where\nSomething kind of wins out and so for example in the U. S. football one out of the meaning for American football and in the world football one out meaning soccer and just they become the defendant ... football although there have for centuries been many other kinds of football\nBut if you say football people in their mind they think of the one specific more common kind of ... who are you are form\nOr yeah so have we preserved peace in your household I guess that's the bigger [laughter]\nAh I think so but um are you able to call it a cold water or is that those were done well\nYeah you can but why\nI'm going to just to be that their customers made me to read from older but\nI think the one who loves the laundry and presses the button you call it whatever they said well you're doing the laundry you wherever you want them all she used to watch all the whatever she wants\n[laughter] about them just buy a ticket and thanks for your call\nAll right thank you Bye bye bye good clean fun on this show eight seven seven Ninety nine nine six seven three\nOf the conversation we had about the use of the term gypsy and a lot of people find that offensive I to the Roma people\nWe talked about the gypsy robot which is a tradition on Broadway where um it's among musicals when I'm On opening night a Dell select the person in the chorus who's been in the most Broadway courses and they get this special road that's passed around\nFrom theater to theater or an actor to act and it's called the gypsy rose yes well it was called the gypsy robe but the Irish bell from New York City wrote to point out to us that the actor's equity association has changed the name", "year": "2018", "show_name": "A Way With Words", "city": "Madison", "day": "21"}
