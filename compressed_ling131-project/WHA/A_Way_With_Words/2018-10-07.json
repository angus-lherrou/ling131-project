grandparents Martha Barnett\nA compound word consists of two words that are put together to express one idea like the word house boat just made up of two words house in those same was steamboat and both of these specify a particular kind boat but there are few compound words in English that weren't differently\nA scarecrow for example is an a type of crow and pick pocket isn't the type of pocket and worst like scare crowing pick pocketing belong to a small category of compounds that name people and things by describing what they do\nAnd the interesting thing is that centuries ago there was a real fashion for forming words like this and it was a whole lot of fun like a quake breach can guess what a quake breaches I'm somebody who is shaking in their boots\nEric coward or ... what about a settled on who the bad words writer [laughter] well somebody who's a full who silly enough to try to saddle a goose authority that experience but he's not so easy\nAnd Brianne Hughes is a linguist who

W H y W O R D Hi you have a way with words\nAfternoon church retreat\nHarry welcome what can we do for you\nWell I've been interested in a word you know it's it's had various meetings and you know usually thought of it is a fishing term\nAnd then in in the hobbits congressman logical for years and now in the last year or two you know if I took a political fact\nRecently the speaker of the house to work in a certain describing a some more [laughter] you know I don't know\nReally you know this is happening\nOK okay this is good you've you've really hit some nice um mile markers on the progress in the inter relationships with a different kind of trolls that we have here let me see if I can add a few more a mile markers to kind of this map\nFirst the ... troll is ancient to go back to least old Norse in a variety of different forms referring to some mythological creature often ugly often vaguely magical often I think that you didn't want to encounter think of um [noise] the the trolls and like oh it was a bill to go to ... where there was a troll under the\nBridge near the beach yeah ah\nSo did the troll goes way back by leader and it's a separate instance of it and it has nothing to do with the mythological creature\nThe French came up with a troll meaning to bomb casts about or to kind of scan for something or to slowly look for a thing and we borrowed that troll into English and we use it primarily or did in fishing where you\nYou dangle debate over the side and your boat slowly goes down to stream or across the lake and you try to attract fish to the slowly moving bait and you bring them in that's troubling\nAnd so we fast forward to the Internet I'm very early on in the history of the Internet is a big social phenomena people started\nDoing what we now call trolling which is saying outrageous things\nSometimes that they didn't believe in order just to get a rise out of other people to get their goats so to speak or just to bust their chops\nAnd missed trolling comes specifically from the fishing kind of trolling which is you throw something outrageous out there on the Internet and see who bites maybe it's going to be a newbie who doesn't know that you're a big jokester maybe it's going to be somebody on the other side of the political spectrum who you just know is going to be ... at the mouth just this thing that you've said that you don't even really believe in\nBut obviously people know about the mythological shows up very soon people who do trolling which has comes from fishing were called trolls with the idea that they were\nUgly undesirable beast that I'm more causing all this mayhem and you didn't really want them around out that while I was a man the language borrows words don't stay themselves they they transform they modify and when we have\nSimilar words a lot of times those meanings intersect and we borrow from both streams in order to make a new stream\nWell that is absolutely fascinating I recognized the language static and expect that [laughter]\nSo the Internet trolling where you just say outrageous are dumb things on purpose in order to irritate her aggravate other people dates to at least the early Nineteen nineties a lotta times people will credit\nOf the news group all folklore urban but I've actually found it earlier than it's ever was ever mentioned in that news group in other places in use net in the in the news groups\nWhat what's wrong cable TV with some regularity\nYes well it's mainstream now I'm not surprised that you heard it on cable news or ... feet on the news here it's utterly mainstream because the Internet as mainstream and move we've been an Internet Society for going on Thirty years now\nRight and as you said the speaker of the house he used the term right it's it's striking to me that it goes from the fishing trolling idea\nBut also incorporates the they'd creepy guy under the bread yeah that's what I picture when I have Internet trolls you know I think if somebody coming out from the dark nether regions\nThere's this there's this incredible period there where they think is important to Harry to\nWhere the fishing trolling first became figurative and non fishing related in other ways\nBefore I arrived to the Internet idea of trolling so you can see people trolling for dates ... going to the mall and trolling for trouble or trolling for information\nAnd there's another kind of correspondents here with the people that people often bring up which is trolling T. R. A. W. L. which is another kind of fishing we throw it a wide net and see what comes in and so that further kind of pollutes our understanding\nOne has been fairly well research I find some new things every time I looked into it because new things to digitize constantly and we have a pretty firm understanding of where this comes from now both thank you very much here yeah thanks so much for calling for she ate it caused again sometime I Love your show thank you very much to spend my\nCollege aged seven seven Ninety nine nine six seven three\n\nTo tell us their terms for\nTaking a path without really taking your band is sort of like a navy shower GI shower yeah yeah or just ... possible ... um we got a tweet from someone named true blue who said we call it bathing up not an entire bath just important parts\nAlso leaving home without meeting and putting unclean closes called putting icing on gingerbread\n[laughter] icing on duty but I like that okay I'm not quite sure didn't find by itself right yeah\nYeah but if you're putting the icing on you're putting on your clothes\nYeah [laughter] talk to us on Twitter WMA y W O R D\nHello you have a way with words\nYeah Hi this is Jeffrey calling from Gainesville, Florida Jesse welcome thank I grew up in northern Minnesota\nAnd there are there was this phrase that I heard and I haven't heard it anywhere else um and it was constructed like they say oh for an average did so for example they say oh cute or\nOffered night or over gum and uh so I was just wondering I'm like I said I haven't heard it anywhere else so I was curious where that came from how widespread it is and if there's any other adjectives that are used in that construction\nOh I Love it oh so it's O O T H O four F.
