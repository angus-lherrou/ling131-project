R. G. hello you have a way with words\nHi how are you I Am character France and I am in San Diego California Welcome to the show what can we do for you\nAm so everybody here in college I was an English and theater major and I always found something curious and Peter you hadn't bottom line is if it's just one person talking and for two or more it's called the dialogue\nBut then there's even a cycle or something like one we'll and bicycles for chew and in classes it's a national model and by with Monaco and by football so why aren't they monitor cycles and die cycles and why is there this mano die a unit by situation\n[laughter] model die a unit by switching ration okay the world is complicated thanks for calling [laughter] let's get to the heart of this right first to die or indicted\nEthics to die for peace X meaning to\nInstead it comes from a ... because they're actually is the word duo law which is a conversation between two people which which is a companion to monologue\nSo it's it may be misunderstood and if in theater they only minute for two people I'm fine that's fine a competition for two people but in the larger world outside if either dialogue can be any number of people it's not specifically just two people\nWrite some Greek for through like diagonal yeah exactly\nOr Diana I'm so that solves dot the other thing is I think the larger question if I can rephrase what you're asking here is\nWhy do we have all these prefix does that mean the same thing why do we have died and\nDuo and by and it ... it's because of our language is a much Heinz fifty seven English basically is what it is we get so many of our words\nSome of them were created directly in the modern era from Greek and Latin some of them came to us inherited through French or German some of the ones that we have now\nLook like they came to us directly from Greek and Latin but they actually traveled to like three other languages to get to us and they still retain their ... and so forth so every single word has its own story you can kind of glum them altogether and say oh well here's the reason why some words have died and some have by\nBut there's no one universal rule for all of them are a lot of his ... really to the whims the whimsy in the piece of the people who coined scientific words for example it's just they felt was superior\n[noise] ... yeah but modest cycle instead of you in a cycle maybe maybe the\nWord for it yeah probably but I used to have the I have actually written a six foot in a cycle I had to be lifted up to the ball who to put it under me I was holding on to the basketball [laughter]\nFor a second I was thinking of measurements I was thinking like appendages when you said six but you know cycle amount at work Six Flags on their hands [laughter] [laughter]\nOh that's super interesting thank you for all that I just like it's just weird right but I guess English language\nIs weird but I Will tell you I I've shared this resource on the show before but I totally think you're the person for this and probably a lot of our listeners to there's a website called ... dot org you know the ... and the suffix plus the insects those three together the categories ethics F. F.\nI. X. E. S. dot org ... Michael ... Michael I'm winning in the u._k. together his work is fantastic and explains each of these ... officers so forth in in detail and talks about where they come from why we use them and some words that have them\nI think what I'm hearing my evening on your weekend right [laughter]\nI can hear that voice [laughter] All right I think at the lazy or always style or not for me [laughter] get some sleep now [laughter] you okay\nBut I you know I'm looking the Oxford English dictionary mano cycle is a word yeah it was rare back to Eighteen sixty nine at least you know same thing in a cycle [laughter] just wins\nSometimes where there's more than ... for a single item or yeah had a gory one prevails and it becomes the ensconced term\nEnglish words arm wrestling\nEight seven seven Ninety nine nine six seven three\nMore and more of in the coming years is ... oh I've heard this yeah sure I remember what it meant so I saw it in your double time dictionary on our website what does it mean\nSome of the style G. S. O. L. A. S. T. A. L. A. G. I. N. A.\nRefers to a form of psychic or existential distressed that's caused by environmental change or a change to a place that you know well and have taken comfort and it was coined by\nAustralian philosopher Glenn Albrecht in two thousand three is is like ... but it also combines the words solace and desolate\nAnd the idea is that um say your your town was destroyed by wildfire\nMore um or your your home in Appalachia was destroyed by a strip mining mhm or you you see an environmental situation that's getting worse and worse maybe the Arctic melting or something like that ...\nIs the term that more and more people in the field of a philosophy into psychology or using\nSo it's the loss of something that you won't sought solace and yes exactly and so the the feeling that you get on these things start to disappear\nYeah particularly in your environment I guess it could be like um you know you go back to your own\nNeighborhood in the buildings are gone right now right what's going to do a lot better now another Starbucks yeah sell us down to\nEight seven seven nine to nine nine six seven three\nOh you have a way with words\nHello this is Monica I'm calling from Tallahassee, Florida\nI monitor welcome to show\nThink about it to be here [laughter] I'm so recently I was reading bedtime story for my kids and\nYou know we check out a lot of books from the library and I make an effort to check out books that represent a lot of different cultures 'cause I Want to expose them to a lot of different kinds of people and\nUm you know I was reading this book called fluffy and the Fox and it got me thinking about how does one read in dialect that is not your own dialect um [noise]\n\nScreen all of the animal or you can watch them over the air them anytime anywhere\nYou're listening to a way with words the show about language and how we use it on grandparents\nAnd Martha Barnett born in London in Seventeen Seventy two Luke Howard was a shy chemist who was also really fascinated by weather and particularly by clouds\nHe wanted to organize how we understand and observe the ever changing formations up in the sky and he wanted to do it in a way that was scientific\nAnd Eighteen oh three he self published a pamphlet that he called on the modifications of clouds et cetera\nIn it he proposed the classification system for clouds and he drew on his school boy Latin\nAnd came up with the main categories which were serious strata and chew meal is now serious comes from the Latin for hair tens real strategy is comes from the Latin for layer and cumulus is like a pile you know like accumulate\nAnd this new way of looking at clouds in these new names in this whole new language for talking about something that everybody had always seen but never really classify that way it hit a nerve in the popular imagination and Luke Howard became this reluctant scientific celebrity\nIs not quite sure was championed by some of the greatest minds of his time especially the influential German poet gr to gr to win so far as to write poems based on those names\nAnd some people criticized Howard for using Latin rather than everyday spoken English and gr to wrote a passionate response or on Howard's half\nAnd he argued that those Latin cloud name should be accepted in all languages they should not be translated because in that way the first intention of the inventor and founder of them is destroyed\nAnd he even went on to send Howard gushing fan mail which is kind of hard to imagine today\nThe story of all of this is told by historian Richard hamblin in the book the invention of clouds how an amateur meteorologist\nForged the language of the skies and in fact if you go to his home in London there's a historical marker that says Luke Howard neighbor of clouds lived and died here are all of them may not clouds\nIt'll be all dream of when we come up with a word we won the acclaim recognition that knowledge right going to be part of history right and he got that ... is your fan yeah I Know I'm like ... eyes with heart the letters to Howard\n[laughter] yeah forget the house [laughter] I\nNever knew that story I just I just thought some scientists came up with these names but we still use them today\nYeah absolutely and they're not in talked and other languages are they are modified to fit the different languages of big bird actually I don't\nKnow that there's a pretty clear system of classification of clouds and I don't know\nIt's always I like how it plugs into the development of meteorology as a as a science where we started to realize that some of those old solves about the red sky or what I had a little bit of truth and we could look at the sky to see what was going to hospital a little later with our weather\nExactly trace the sky with a painters fresh the wins around using little rushed talking about serious clown yeah and what I also love about\nA way of using language to impose order on something that didn't seem to have any order it seems that Luke Howard was with someone who who saw differences in clouds in South patterns and indeed um began meteorology that way\nI have often thought that if there were another species on this planet had the same kind of active intelligence as humans that they might actually called us a word that means the class of fires\nBecause that is so much of what humans to resort organized we classify and if you think about our primary behavior a lot of it has to do with the things that we say the things that we produce how we organize ourselves in our communities it's about\nSetting these boundaries and then this is a box and all of things have just type go in that box\nHeat right the class is higher so I really liked that and of course the language is key to that right in ... making sense of the world we love language and if you come across it passes the talks about language in a way that you really enjoy we want to know and we want to share it with our other listeners centered along\nEmails words at ... dot org and you can link to it on Twitter at W. A. Y. W. R. D. hello you have a way with words\nHello how're you doing great how are you and who is this this is Robert Gray I'm from Dallas texas high Broadway show high ride lie a family has some cute little things but my favorite and\nI'm from California are born and raised in Arkansas and she's\nThe safest thing every time something with like weird or not ... or whatever a like an accidental the road or or like a tree limbs fall off of the tree or does she said don't that just ...\nAnd I always wondered where or if that came from because she died I never got to ask or were um she got started with it but I've heard it all my life uh-huh what other kinds of like a car accident or or someone would pull out in front of my uncles she never drove\nBecause I'm ... back into the garage wall and got out of the card says I'll never dropped again don't they just ... so it's just the way she always threw it into a ... something just wasn't quite right\nOkay yeah\nAnd I got a lot of carving got I got a lot of aunts and uncles but none of 'em ever knew where she got it from her she made it up or what but it sounds like something somebody would you shouldn't do that just ...\nYou know why that happened you know or something mhm\nYeah and indeed that's the case it seems to go back to perhaps college playing in the U.S from from the late Nineteen centuries and not\nThe full phrase just the verb to frost right one read that full phrase it does or doesn't that just execute was kind of a template for a whole bunch of other verbs little filling that acts\nYeah that that ... Shakur irritate you are just kind of take you back\nMhm 'cause there's two old meanings of one is to anger somebody is to frost them as to anger than the other one in surprise shock them and everything about the same age ...\nAnd there are not here versions I don't know if she ever used that that a dumb down does\nThis is a woman who had a Bible under her arm twisting hostile cameras very\nBaptists so I think it probably use that word is used to be one last week she switched frost I guess I don't know\nThere's there's um an expression doesn't that just chap you're behind I'll use the word behind and there's a whole roster that just trust your behind also yeah very hard severe anatomy\nOkay well that's very rewarding to know the you know there is a real meaning behind it\n[laughter] rod thanks so much for calling me really appreciated called against\nOh thank you for much ever greater ... thanks rides of I think here\nAnd it seems like he would be more likely to say don't that rather than doesn't that right\nI think it needs to sound super informal in Africa see\nYes that frost you do that for us [laughter] eight seven seven Ninety nine nine six seven three\n\nWe were talking earlier about Luke Howard the Englishman who founded modern meteorology by starting declassify clouds\nWith different kinds of language with with Latin words\nAnd uh his influence extended not only to gr to the poet as as I said but to the painter John Constable\nAnd Percy ... Shelley the poet all these people were inspired by this whole idea of classifying a clouds and Percy ... Shelley wrote a poem called the cloud and it's long so I'm not going to read the whole thing but I'm getting read the first stanza which will give you a taste of it\nI bring fresh showers for the sting flowers from\nThe seas in streams I barely light shade for the leaves when laid in their new day dreams\nFrom my wings are shaking the abuse that wake in the sweet buds everyone when rocked to rest on their mothers breast and she dances about the sun\nI wields the ... of the lashing hail in white and the green planes under and then again I dissolve it didn't rain and laugh as I pass in thunder\nAnd it's so beautiful and rhythmic in so much imagery and and should be a poem that's taught when you're talking about personification in English class it's really a lovely upon that goes on and\nOn and that's ... and the problem was called at the clouds the clouds thinks birth and it was beautiful call us eight seven seven nine to nine nine six seven three\nI have a way with words this is Mike Mike from Green Bay welcome to the show what can we do for yeah\nI was just talking to a few days ago with my dad you're talking about got it from drinking colloquial wisdom was that we both grown up with\n'em throughout the generations of one that we found that we both knew was ... and it's a term that we both know in our front groups for a unfinished beers that you find when a party a picture cat out that it's only half for these they all left the ... year why aren't you finish your viewers", "year": "2018", "show_name": "A Way With Words", "city": "Madison", "day": "28"}
