I felt like to write those big rich scenes I just needed to let it wrapped in a more additional way\nYeah that's great you know would be a great time to have you read an excerpt from Manhattan beach and if you could set it up that would be great\nSure I mean I'll I'll start by just saying there are a number of worlds that this book includes and I write a lot about people at work\nAt the Brooklyn Navy Yard with ship building deep sea diving a merchant sailing and even sort of criminal activity\nA Anna is determined to become a diver and there were many civilian divers at the Brooklyn ... takes her a long time\nTo get herself into the water there are many obstacles against her so Anna is wearing a two hundred pound diving sued known as the mark five is excruciating to wear on land because all of that those two hundred pounds are bearing down on you [noise]\nUm but she she has it on and she's now descending into the water for the first time\n[noise]\nHolding the curls rails of the diving ladder she began taking careful backward steps finding each wrong with the metal tip of her shoes before arresting her weight their\nWater contract it around her legs with cold energy sucking the wrinkles in her jumpsuit pinching lead to her again ice cakes nudge at the dress soon the water was at her chest then lapping the bottom of the face place\nAnd it took a last look up and saw bass come and moral watching her from the ladder to more rungs and she was submerged the green brown water of wall about bay visible through her for windows no sound but the history of air\nOn the last of the ladders fourteen rungs she paused to increase her air supply sure enough the dress inflated slate\nOn her legs she felt for the descending line swung her left leg around its manila court and let it slide to her left glove she drifted down the weight of the dress ... her toward the bottom the water darkening as she left the surface behind\nThat last her shoes ... the bottom of all of that day and I couldn't see it just the ... of her legs disappearing into dark she felt a rash of wellbeing\nWho source was not instantly clear then she realized the pain of the dress had vanished the air pressure from within it was just enough to balance the pressure from outside while maintaining a negative buoyancy I holding her down\nAnd the weight that had been so punishing on land now allowed her to stand and walk\nUnder thirty feet of water that otherwise would have said that her out like a seed oh\nThat's great thank you so much so didn't you also talk to the first female US Army deep sea diver\nYes she her name is Andrea motley Crabtree\nEven though she did not die well first of all no women do for the navy until the seventies and she was the first for the army and she didn't die until the eighties but even she wore the old mark five because they would still use it as a way of training people\nUm and she was enormously helpful she was really good at talking about the sensations of being in the water and especially of being near enormous ships um what that felt like how they sort of vibe rated or almost seemed to Hama\nUm and then she also talked about the sexism that she encountered and diving which was profound and ultimately ended her career although she's far from better and remembers diving with great joy I'm and great vividness a it's a tough world for a woman\nYeah and that that sexism in diving God that is explored it in your novel yeah I I'm guessing that your research did not include listening to X D.C.'s Nineteen eighty album Black Sea over and over you know the cover though with the band members direct on a vintage diving gear or did it\nYou know I I'm I'm already sad about missing that because that would have been to a point of connection to the to a visit from the gun squad\nIt would've been yet since I was so many great rock and roll pauses yeah so you did so much research and I've read that you ... tons of research for this book I could tell them you can tell just by reading the book and in the of knowledge moments you write that if nothing more\nCame up the endeavor than the pleasure of having researched it I Would count myself lucky and I get that joy of research from you from what you just said how much you enjoy doing it but\nThe library lions refuse any longer to guard people who believe that wisdom lies and books

much more gravity Hassan than my inner voice you've got to get a can of Goldsmith inner voice tap\nFor reading [laughter] seriously [laughter] that would be good were there any things that you think are missing from the book like if you could go back and updated or their quotations that you'd like to add things that you said ... we should put that in\n[noise] I missed everything yeah everything [laughter]\nOf the percentage of books in the University of Pennsylvania library where I teach and spent a lot of time researching [noise]\nThere are shelves and shelves and shelves of them I think I only got through a few show so [noise] but it's very much like the city itself I mean how can you describe city\nNew York city it's impossible most of the history in New York City that's being made perhaps at this moment as I said you're speaking to you will go on record\nYou know it made me think that that really history in fact is impossible\nAll history historical writing historical narratives our affection and in this sense this book is a great failure to describe the city how can you describe a hundred years of New York\nIn a thousand pages\nYeah yeah you're capturing moods and moments which are the things that will resonate with readers it's kind of almost the secret history of New York city I Would say one of the things you said it's an impossible task how can you describe New York city so is that the reason why\nYou wanted to do it this way like use appropriation take words that already exist in and use them rather than create your own original writing on this because it's it's just something that can be done\n[noise] well I mean I'm not a historian I'm a poet and my poetic serve always questioned the validity of of my own words as opposed to others you know this book is an autobiography of mine but I didn't write a word of it but then again I wrote every word of it\nI can read this book and I can cry in certain sections because I'm from New York I've never lived anywhere else I find that book to be vastly sentimental and all about myself\nSo how can you write a book that you didn't write and have it be\nGoldsmith as a poet critic and the author of\nNew
