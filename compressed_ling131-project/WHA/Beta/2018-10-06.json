her work from the Gilmore Girls\nThe woman behind those distinctive\nBut you haven't forgotten about making albums\nWorld on [noise]\nIt was a concept that slowly\nGathered itself over the last few years and I think the song or the or that title in of itself is the beginning of a feeling that something needs to change you know that uneasiness\nAnd I I think that as time went on yes all those all those thoughts came into my mind about the earth about life as we know it yeah and you\nYou have this great quote that I read about troubled on the outside can be reflections of troubles on the inside you talk about that [noise]\nYou know it's it's funny because as a songwriter there's a there's an intuitive part to it that I Know sounds a little bit like mumbo jumbo but it's it's\nWe have earthquakes out here in Los Angeles and and um they always say that the cats can feel the vibrations of the earth I think that dogs can too and they start reacting before the earth before we can feel the earthquake and I I feel like as songwriters were\nFunny creatures if we're paying attention we can feel the rumblings of things before they hit us and it seems that we're we're in a really interesting time\nIn um humanity in this country a very difficult time you know and it at a time of of decisions of deciding you know like the one side of the last time that I wrote for the record is called how much is enough\nAnd I thought that this was a good question that it deserved a song and how much is enough we all have to figure that out for ourselves in in a we have to ask that question I think to a lot of areas of our life\nOr our lives are not just our political scenario here but also how much is enough for me personally of [noise]\nCan I take how much information can I have coming at me at any given time\nYeah and the interesting thing about that song is about that of course is the single and there's a music video and it seems to me a lot of the songs deal with the damage we've done in that we continue to do to our natural landscape but how much is enough seems to be an attack\nOn our media landscape by thinking especially if the lyrics or\nSome on keep standing\nWe're not supposed\nThey break down the middle east\nVideo for the pharmacy headlines like a wise man than I have in our business do you see how much money off it isn't a cap on contemporary media not\nAn attack on contemporary media I think it's it it really is a question that I think everybody has to answer for themselves I think you have to how much can you take how many lives can you take\nAre you going to find the truth do you have to find a truce for yourself in your life first before you can\nFind the truth for larger situations for instance you know when I was a kid growing up in Los Angeles the air was really bad 'cause we had we didn't have unleaded fuel at that time yeah and um there's a lot of smog a lot of pollution and thank goodness that there were people in the state that lobbied for cleaner air\nAnd regulations that have helped the cars the fuel everything become cleaner because when I was a little kid I Would have to lay down because my chest would hurt you just be out playing as a kid and it was so smoggy and so bad\nYou'd have to lay down and you know I realized maybe in other areas of the country the air never got that bad because people were growing up in cities and maybe when their emphasis is on you know jobs and and money\nMaybe they don't understand they've never lived through the air quality being so bad that you have to lay down because your chest hurts and I think we have to be gentle with each other because I I don't know at any point especially on social media I don't know what someone doesn't know\nYou know and I think we have to gently bring each other along because people are fighting for what they know is right and what they think is true but maybe we have to give this time and find out a little more about the the situation before we\nYell at each other in cowardice on the Internet\nYet that's a good way of putting it yeah well one of my favorite songs on the album is the opening track walking trees\nAnd shaking from your home and dug in in [noise] you'll keep on lying to you think it's true\nI'm listening to this cruise crowded by the crowd would you beginning to believe you can see\nWhat inspired you to write this on the body well I'm going to live up to er live down to my California upbringing but as I was making this record this was one of the last that I wrote as well and um I was passing this tree every day going to the studio and we were going through a really bad drought in ... in California\nAnd it just seemed that this tree will grouping was and I and I started reading about trees and how they help each other\nWith their roots underneath the ground that can reach out to a dying tree and helped other tree and it was funny because as soon as it started raining in the eye he seemed happier [laughter] and I think I was imagining him also looking at me or I I imagine the situation kind of have taking a little pity on the on the human\nOwn thoroughly around for you know maybe a third of my lifetime and they\nThey're also worried and they're going through what they're going through down there\nYeah yeah and would it be nice if they could be a little more calm if they had more perspective that they could be you know up at the height or if they could live\nTwo hundred years or a hundred and fifty years and and have that perspective and so they're kind of trading places the tree and thinking I'm you know we are in a funny predicament is human and um we are kind of like walking trees that's kind of\nThat's what he would call me from you know there's that there's a walking tree again\nA lot of walking shame [noise]\nDream a lot of the songs on the new album have this very big very industrial drums down for example the title track\nWorld on sticks the drum intro has this dystopian feel to it and yet they're off Luke these very beautiful very lush string arrangements how many of the songs to me it kind of feels like you've\nCreated this running thread a sonic cognitive dissonance over the course of the album on on the one hand the bombing problems conveyed this fear in the ... or you get the ... give us hope and optimism is is that fair to say on my reading too much into this\nNo I think that's absolutely right [noise]\nAnd I think that's the teetering on the drums pulling it and when I when I first started this record I asked ... when he determined that I don't know how\nDecade I hadn't played drone performances and then I I wrote edited to those performances and one\nContracts did make the move from analog records to digital CDs and you make the argument that compact discs have more interesting contracts the vinyl ... why do you say that\nThere were more to mess with CDs being a digital format\nThey allowed you to do things like mess with the track numbers you could emphasize silence a little bit more because they just they held more stuff so you had more white space to work with and one of the things that they messed with is called the pre ...\nBasically what this says is that if you take a CD with a pre gap track on it you can actually rewind it back beyond zero zero point zero zero and find a whole nother song or to\nOne of the most famous hidden tracts appears at the end of nerve Anna's iconic Nineteen Ninety One album never mind can you tell me about this hidden track\nOr yeah or unless nameless uh basically it you know it shows up at the very as at the very end of the album and around us specifically designed in such a way that it would sound like the end of the record ... there'll be ten minutes of silence and then all of a sudden\n[noise]\n\nLived with his last\nMission is allowed free says off track it became the high water mark it was the one that really made the concepts of hidden tracks something that a lot of fans and it just because it was such a popular album and because it was a relatively novel trick is to say that\nI don't think it was intended to be anything more than just the thing that Nirvana finished his album off with it just happened to become much more of a cultural phenomenon because Iran as a whole became a cultural phenomenon\nI'm guessing that since nowadays we consume so much of our music digitally the hidden track is pretty much extinct or is it still around or maybe it's so it's around but it's so well hidden we just don't know\nThe hidden track has been replaced by the bonus track these days when it comes to streaming it's harder to catch someone off guard with with a piece of music\nSo I think that while the hidden track is less relevant than it once was I think was streaming it's harder to hide something that spot of fi than it was on a plastic desk\nClaiming again blaming again\nSmith is the editor of medium language ...\nYou can find out more about Ernie
