when The Simpsons wasn't the pop culture I find that it is today but you have to go all the way back to before December Nineteen eighty nine when the show debuted\nMike wiesner remembers like back\nThen and The Simpsons came along and when they called me I said why are you calling me and they said\nBecause everyone else has turned the job down my we took the job is right around The Simpsons and he's been Frankie yelled jokes per Springfield eons for more than half his life he joined us today to give us the inside scoop on what goes on behind the scenes and we explore the history of cliffhanger endings\nWith binge watching the cliff hangers are handled the exact same way and they are in network television because you get that conclusion immediately which in some ways can make the cliffhanger even more intense [noise]\n\nBut let's get things started to have some Washington\nOh tested a rising star among young literary fiction writers I caught up with her during her Milwaukee tore strong Boswell book company for her novel my you're relaxation it was a ...\nLittle test was every bit of smart captivating and funny in person as she is on the page she joined WPRI as Milwaukee's studios to talk about her book [noise]\nMy year of rest and relaxation as a novel about a young woman in her mid twenties living in Manhattan in the year two thousand and two thousand one she has a strange project that that she's set setting off on and and that is that she'd like to sleep for a year\nShe has this idea that if she can sleep for a long enough her cells will have regenerated the number of times it would take for them to have forgotten whatever trauma or memory they they had been storing and her body and mind\nSo um she's she's doing that this year of hibernation and attempt to start herself over\nYeah and I can really relate to this idea of hibernation because\nOf my history of depression which was ratified the time I Would spend living in Winnipeg, Manitoba Canada because the winters are brutal it gets colder than foot Gary on Sundays colder than Mars and so I often thought geez it would be really nice to\nTo hibernate and ... and ... you skate from reality until winter's over is is this idea of hibernation and sleeping as an escape is that something that that resonates with you\nI Wish that did more because then maybe I Would sleep more\nBut I'm a little bit too high wired to take on this kind of project and I think you know people have asking me like well why did you write this book and it's kind of a fantasy projection of a fantasy self that could sleep um because I've always been kind of an insomniac and I'm always really really tired\nYeah why did you decide not to name your protagonist\nFor a bunch of reasons I think you know my general rule is I like characters with names I named can do so much\nWhy did you choose set up a graph it occurred to me maybe three quarters of the way through this book that was really deep for me in the writing this book was a ... different levels of experience and how much we are not in control\nAnd life in contemporary civilization would have us think that if we just make all the right decisions and impress the right people and get the right education show up and do the right thing everything will work out fine\nWhich is ridiculous and I think a really dangerous\nI was thinking about how much this character seems to be disconnected from herself in the most spiritual way and and I had some compassion for her and her quest to reconnect through sleep somehow I find this deeper person within her\nBut inevitably there are certain things that we can't control whether it's karma or nature but\nThen would Joni Mitchell ... beat the laws of man but they enter laws of spirit and the outer laws of nature and no one can\nSo France captive name of course has morphed into the adjective Kafka esque David Lynch his name is led to the adjective Lynch in I personally think it's not too soon to start thinking about turning your last name into the adjective mosh vegan or Las Vegas mhm if you prefer what do you think do you have a preference first of all do you prefer ...\n... what about mosh Maggie's must reduce or maybe that would just be the language marsh fag ask yeah that's kind of cool okay so awkward\nBut ah yeah well we we can work on that but you do you have any thoughts about what mosh but I guess with me\nIf people are trying to can it it would probably be um the particular stripe of dark comedy that that my books exhibit\nYou know yeah I actually wrote I took the liberty of writing of putting together a definition of it's run by you and I drew on various sources including your good friend Christie ... McKenna her definition of Lynch in because I ... I got a sort of a lynching park and I run a bio yes okay [noise]\nLas Vegas up or relating to the fiction about ... ... dark comedy in which characters are riddled with existential insecurities under consequently searching for other ways of being other worlds other towns other cells\nSeem to beauty and ugliness is another key component of the mosque Vegas style\nSummer I like you said that these were I like that so I said I didn't talk for the Merriam Webster I better run take another few passes at at first so yeah I Want to Egypt or the the word of the air sort of the euro votes as much as I say oh God\n[noise]\nOh just ... the author of mind your own you liked\nStation one reviewer says it may be the effects of central novel not written\nPeople find out more of us to do\nI've got the plot for your next episode we've had great what is it and he goes Lisa is sad\nIt didn't seem like a great use of the enemy medium the animated Mike reefs joined us to talk about working as a writer for The Simpsons that's next I'm Doug ... you're listening to a beta on Wisconsin Public radio [noise]\n\nAppointment with Public Radio's Babe Ruth family dog\nOkay time do you like free [noise]\nFor Kaine town do you have the time it is [laughter]\nWell if you like the kind of like I like that as this is veggie feed data with the Idaho cheese growing up in one of the ideas [noise]\n\nSupport for WPRI comes from the ice age trail alliance the volunteer member based nonprofit builds maintains in protects the one thousand miles ice age national scenic trail with funding from donors ice age trail dot org\nSupport also comes from S.

[laughter]\nYou know when we're rewriting the scripts there's six seven eight writer sitting in the room and we go we needed a joke here everyone just start throwing out jokes and if something makes more than half of us laugh it goes in the script and then we have a table reading where the cats reads the script out loud and again\nA line has to get a laugh from everybody who's sitting there listening to it and two months later we see the show in rough animated form and we have about forty people watching the show and the joke has to get a laugh again it always\nHas to get a result nobody could ever say I know this is funny even though it's not getting a laugh that never works at the show and sometimes sometimes they're right you know my biggest regrets over the years are jokes I almost killed because I thought\nThis is not funny and then we put it in the script and it got a huge laugh or somebody will even say oh that's my favorite joke and I I feel terrible about that can you give me an example yet any Simpsons junkie we'll know the joke where\nHomer is about to lose his dental plan and he finds out leaf in these phrases yes and so Jake Hogan Wally ... wrote the script where for\nThree pages descriptive just\nWe need a dental plan lays the needs braces needed dental play at least needs braces over and over and I didn't think it was funny and my partner algae didn't think it was funny and we're about to cut it and\nJay in Mali the writer said you got to give this a shot we think this was really going to work and we read it out loud with the cast and oh my God it not only killed then but\nIt is that you know the joke the fans it's it's one of the favorite jokes in since since his three and we couldn't see it out and I did not see it on the pay basically to save\nYeah again he's he's running up against this criticism but he knows as well as anyone\nHe hasn't done a pool and three years okay so yeah it's kind of a non issue in that sense\nYeah I mean we can undo the patch and I've got to say\nFor Twenty years I was all I Would only hear from India and I would ask the question I I was always curious about I go are you offended by a ... for Twenty years I Would hear the answer he's the only Indian on television people were very happy to be represented\nAnd I think I Know every time this is in the papers someone\nComplaining about it there's a raft of letters from India and saying I like a pool I like them he talks like my father\nI like a ... he's a he's a stereotype but so is everyone on The Simpsons I don't know why we should get a free ride so\nIt's not a cut and dried issue I definitely agree it's offending some people but I don't know how many Mm yeah and and how many how many is too many how many do you have to offend\nI think we should just interview with attack I Would assume that you do you have an idea for attack that we can go out on\nHow you can't afford me no I mean that that the actual writing it yeah but you're still waiting just off the top of your hat now [laughter] I Know everyone I should buy the book by Frank build confidence so first we have a commercial then we had yeah we'll put a commercial in here and then we'll come back and play your little tag about buying the book\nIs by the book and if you're too cheap to buy the book and\nGod Knows I Am following me on Twitter at all on me on Twitter I had my Greece writer I give you one good joke a day just like the Jimmy Fallon shower [laughter]\nMy increases the author of Springfield confidential jokes secrets and outright lie from a lifetime writing for this\nWe'll find out more about my WPRI dot org slash\nAnd let us know your comments or questions maybe your favorite joke by sending an\nWNPR dot\nCom it's a really write history with angry because they're a serialized version of storytelling\nHang on I don't have\nI'm done Gordon you're listening to date on what's on public radio\nSupport for WPRI comes from the University of Wisconsin survey center a resource for data collection and study design the U.

Dickens fanatics\nAnd not not only Dickens fanatic but Dickens copycats he created he's he just enjoying created this genre\nPartially because he was paid for word so or he wrote and the more often he did the more he would get paid yeah but it got to a point where he would get fan mail if people begging to keep their characters all his character is alive or people would start you know fights because they wanted to be the first one to read the story they'd have water cooler talk\nBut one of the more interesting things is how many copycats emerge during that time there were hundreds of writers who are producing and they just try to ride on his coattails the best they could\nWell yeah and and didn't want to ... stories cause a riot\nYes so this is according to a story or in a magazine and I could not find the original article itself I Believe it's in it was either New York the New Yorker where she talked about this time where people were trying to find out if this character named now survive in this was a big cliffhanger\nSo they waited on the shore for the barge to come in with the latest edition\nAnd then to be the first one to read it they you know started a physical injury encounter so they could find out if she survived and I'm Sorry to say she didn't\nUh do you have a great line in the in the video version of your story\nSo the use of cliff hangers became not only popular but kind of essential some Victorian scoff calling them addictive which yeah they are\nBut they also give kids opium for headaches so they're not one to talk [laughter]\nThat's great so [noise] so let's talk we talk a lot of about ... parents but we haven't really talked about this kind of obvious question about the origin of the name I'm guessing they're not named after a guide and cliffhanger who was dangling from a cliff and have the sudden epiphany about what a great way to keep people hooked various entertainment products us would be or were they\nThey were not although it's funny you know there is actually a GI Joe character whose name is cliff hangers and that's what he does he hangs off cliff really [laughter] yes [laughter]\nSo the actual the route is it's debatable um there are a couple of situations where an actual dangling off the edge of the cliff was used as a cliffhanger which is kind of where the where it comes from doctor who has used it in the past\nUm perils of Pauline which was a serialized film series so basically took the ... story telling of the Victorian era and moved it to film on screen kind of precursor to a television", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Beta", "city": "Madison", "day": "27"}
