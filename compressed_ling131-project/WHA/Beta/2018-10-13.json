not making movies chances are he's making art\nFrom over overturned it for free from her ... kind of ... mustache guy editor back and forth very promoted to prepare for me and then I turn into her and get our favor and see how much\nDoes the gang of bad taste and joined us later when I got here it was so familiar to me because I grew up watching American TV shows and reading American book\nIrish comedian and podcaster main pagan coming up [noise]\n... one of the world's most claimed to tarts over the course of forty\nElton John and orange on\nHis latest album called songs of\nForty two to two thousand [noise]\nThe album features protest songs ranging from World war two and now we both feature several guess\nFemale basic to\nMark says the roots of his activism dates all the way back\nBecause back when I was I think in second or third grade and they cancelled the soupy sales show heartfelt letter [laughter] I organized a a a walk out of from my second grade class\nI was a little mystified about the workings of power somehow I thought that my teacher could make soupy sales go back on the air it wasn't successful but that didn't stop me after super ... cells there was the Vietnam War\nSo you've done a lot you're not the kind of guy who's content to sit on the sidelines what inspired you to create this new album songs of resistance Nineteen forty two to two thousand and Eighteen\nWell it was immediately inspired by the election of Donald Trump I was actually working on a different record with my band ceramic dog at the time [noise]\nSomehow we met after Trump's election and I said\nWell we change the direction in that al ... and I also decided to do another one as well or I guess the thinking was for us that the world could live without another recording of songs about me fighting with my girlfriend for another few years while we dealt with these more pressing problems\nI've read that one of the inspirations for putting this album together for creating it was that you noticed that there were all these dedicated political movements but they didn't have a musical component can you talk about that\nI had noticed that like long before Donald Trump's election\nI Would go on demonstrations and people chant the same half a sentence slogan again and again and no matter how much I agree with it after a while I find that you know whatever we're marching to create a I might die of boredom before we ever achieve that [noise]\nSo at the same time there's this we in fact have this wonderful history and heritage of of a musical tradition of not just protest music but resistance music\nYeah the big full actually ... it comes from a song called I think up to our next and the big muddy\nAnd which was actually something that's kind of rare which is a U.S the second World War protest song ... against the arbitrary authority of this cabinet and orders his soldiers in a training exercise to cross\nA river called the big money even though it was too deep and they were carrying heavy equipment and several of the soldiers drowned this was\nA song from that area Pete Seeger in the sixties updated it and use it as a metaphor for the increasing us involvement\nIn the Vietnam War were up to our knees\nWere up to our waste to our next and the big muddy and the big full says push ups\nI kept those lyrics the big fool says push on\nAnd I'd change the subject to climate change the\nWhat you want people to take away from listening to science resistance\nI Hope to listen to it and and like it I Hope people will feel empowered to do the process that I've done which is to go to the past and go to the music of the past go to the history of the past\nLearn it we'll see what their take what's useful and use it now\nAnd that goes for that goes for the music of the past it also goes for lessons we can take away from the politics of the past this record was inspired politically but by the idea of a popular front\nThat's how the laughing fight against fascism was one and that needs to be remembered now but now that people work were able to work together to defend something that was very important and still is very important\nMark ... as a musician and the man behind the album songs are resistant Nineteen forty two to two thousand [noise]\nWe'll find out more about mark at WNPR dot org slash state\nThere was a real art school in

John Waters has been called all kinds of names throughout his career public trash points of view\nThat because John his famous and infamous for his trans recipe cult films movies like multiple maniacs ... female trouble waters is also an artist\nThe Baltimore museum of art is hosting a major retrospective for their local boy makes good or bad for both [laughter]\nIt's called indecent exposure and features ... art eating photograph sculptures videos that he's made early Ninety nine a word of warning some of our conversation contains mature material\n\nSo John you took photographs was real film and you took these photos of images on the television\nYeah without stopping to freeze framing it or anything yes in the beginning they weren't digital and digital doesn't work I still have tried it off the TV for ... doesn't work right why not just doesn't look right to me it doesn't have a\nAmateur kind of feel it doesn't look like an early underground movie it doesn't look like somebody knocking [laughter] and made a piece of art in the middle of the night and my clothes theater or they put the print on themselves without asking are hijacked the projection of\nMan that element of centrifuges missing yeah but as you mentioned you're basically putting together story boards that tell a new narrative or else you're composing a new movie from sometime joined images from other directors images\nYeah completely and it's like a ... I think up the narrative of each piece before I ever do them\nSo I guess you could call it the dreaded conceptual [laughter] and then I have to find the images for each thing to be able to tell the story\nSometimes it doesn't work and I take those images and keep them or I have many many little envelopes of different subject matters or background or anything and then and then I write with them and I edit with them with those pictures to tell her new stories or something I took that didn't work\nMight end up you know ten years later and another sequence that I'm using to tell another story\nCan you describe an example of one of your favorites my little movies works that we can see in your new exhibition\nThere's a murderer Elizabeth Taylor for Facebook to her stitches kind of look like\nMy moustache I Know I I had a pack on for a flight so most of us our me ... and then I turn into her and get our face forever\nAnd she had a moustache so it's it's kind of morphing other images into a completely different narratives on numbers in the original movie\nAnd do you have a title for that one that one is called face left I think oh there you go ... and then I have another one cents on the left her and it's from a really innocent child's movie like the ...\nSupport for WPRI comes from you W credit union connecting members to financial planners who are dedicated to delivering personalized wealth management and retirement solutions you WC you dot org your best interests always comes first\nMost pornographic in a completely understand why you don't see one thing that's a G. rated movie\nI'm curious about why you felt compelled to start creating final I was part of the motivations the fact that when you do that you're in total control whereas when you're making a film you're working with all these other people at so collaborative\nOh I mean uh anti fine art yes it's very different when you know you watch a movie or you see artwork or you see a movie and your wife yeah you more you watch a movie and see an art peace\nBut I was trying to tell a story in a much quicker right talking about the high concept you know it is like two frames yeah that's it\nBut it's also something that you are going to look out forever every avid hang in your house so it's very different from even a cult movie people might have seen it ten times they don't look at it every single day of their life and they look up from their bed or something\nSo I tried to imagine that two pieces\nPieces that wouldn't always be something that people would want to hang over there so far 'cause my collectors they understand that I'm satirizing the whole arc business in the first place\nIs there a difference between the kinds of reactions are trying to get from the people who watch her films versus the people who experience you're fine art\nCompletely I I'd never mix them at all I even where I think up my photographs as a whole different place somewhere I ride my movies are shows OR Books will so what's the difference it's different because the art world they only obscenity left a celebrity and I hate celebrity artists to so\nBasically I Try to the base that and and ruin my celebrity but at the same time I've never given an article on like say people magazine or something where I routinely do you know oppressed for the movies\nAbout my art career really I like to keep them very very separate many people that are fans of my movies probably don't even know I have that even though there are for art books out about my work\nI guess it gets less and less like that but still I'd like to keep it separate because I think it is a very separate thing I think it up at a whole different place I still collect art I still go to art galleries all the time and it's just as important to me but it's it's different\nWould it be fair to say that you're still going after shock value of trying to surprise people\nAll contemporary art is made to wreck what came before so there's always a little bit of shock value or in contemporary art and I have a piece in the show that says contemporary art hate you\nBecause it does and people have great fear of contemporary art and so it can have you and you have to love it for it and then the hate can't hurt and then you buy it and then you put it on your wall I think it'll be on the southern been one of the most famous collectors areas after how did you build this great great collections she said I just bought what I hate it [laughter]\nAnd not by email and there were different terms you know like a liberation and yet shock value was a term that I guess I paid too much attention to it was to suddenly say something very surprising about ready to get people's attention to what you're saying and that was the name of my first book yeah so I did pay attention that day and English class\nObviously for sure it was my grade school had taught shock value maybe they didn't I just don't remember but anyway in an essay for your your exhibition catalog Jonathan decaf says that quote of all the autobiographical themes that pulse beneath the surface of water says art the most central has to be a square and is and what would you agree with that sort\nOf yeah but even though I have a piece to say gay is not enough because any more it's not it's a good start but certainly I I'm against separatists I'm of any kind I think people should come in come out [noise]\nGet an operation to be a different sects and decide that I Want to go back to another one I I'm for I'm for mixing everybody together I I I don't\nCry the gay bars are closing because I think if I was young I don't want to be segregated separate is not equal everybody all the cool kids want to hang around with each other and they don't care anymore so I I think that I'm against separatists them\nBut certainly clear on us in the way that you can be straight and be clearer in a weird way if you don't fit in and you're bizarre and uh and that you have very very different tastes style so yes I Would say that it has some in there that I use for humor but I wouldn't say it's a gay art show\nYeah do you have a favorite example of how your quickness plays out in your art in the exhibition\nWell there's one I don't know if this is Michelle are not as cold boys be where I think it is I'm not sure and it's all pictures from sex education movies about warning kids not to hit strike because gay men were picked him up and the actor in it looks exactly like me Mm interesting callers really before\nThen people are gonna think people would think oh it's usually like that you\nWant to know but they could tell us from the fifties adjust oddly does look like me it's called boys for where\nJohn Waters film director and contemporary art major retrospective others

cool for reasons that I don't think they're very ... like my mother thinks she's super cool because if it's loud noises made in rapid succession she can and some quite quickly in her mind\nLike a knock on the door and they do do do you like for [noise]\nThe they've got a [noise]\nOr if there's a machine gun fire on TV [laughter] and she's like three eleven and to [noise]\nThey looked at in the room in our face it as if we're going to be like oh my goodness [laughter]\nOnly because my dad at the kinds man and he loved her so much he sometimes takes like a fake minutes to pretend he's a kind of stuff and noises in that [laughter]\nIt was three and a man who\nWonders how do you do that in\nOf the what is that I just thought about like\nI Know I can just do it I don't know how am\nThat comedian maintain [noise] as you may have bigger do maintain a lovely accent\nShe's ... she's the author of maimed in America essays by a girl from somewhere else [noise]\nGlamour magazine wrote that if Tina Fey and David the dares had a daughter she would be made picking [noise]\nMade is a big fan of the multi persevering so I asked her to assume that there is some alternate universe in which Tina Fey and David Sedaris are in fact names parents\nMy mother would be like maybe twelve years older than me via mattered ordinary you know when people are like my mom's my best friend yeah I Would love to be best friends or Tina Fey and but also maybe I Would get to live with David Sedaris and his and partner Q.\nI Do not know them personally but I read all of his work and I love the phone to their relationship so maybe I could like how David pick up the trash from the like\nEnglish countryside and he would make me delicious meals and I'm sure my life would be way better than it is now where it's just me and my dog fighting over cheerios and my heart [laughter] excellent\nAnswer and I but I I imagine that at this very moment some crazy Canadian interviewers asking the other made about some alternate universe in which Tina Fey and David Sedaris or not or parents yet you're you're originally from ... in county court and that's where you began your comedy career you even had your OWN TV program maybe against\nFancy middle why why did you decide to move to New York city\n[noise] well yeah I mean I have had a great life in in Ireland I laughed I think as thirty one and I left because\nUm I suppose like you mentioned they had a TV show and I wrote a book and everything what I was there but island is very small and I think I kind of ran out of opportunities a little bit and because aren't into small and you know lots of reasons I think I was drawn to come to New York which is still you know\nA big comedy center and it's like to have romantic idea of kind of being a rice here in New York City\nSo I I really moved for the same reasons a lot of immigrants leave which is an opportunity\nAnd that this is a good time to talk about this maybe in America it's not only the name of your book of essays it's also the name of this podcast about immigration that you know what what inspired you to do this obviously part of it would be the fact that you're an immigrant yourself but I imagine there's more to it than that is under\nYeah for sure when I first moved here I think I was really drawn to other immigrants because I think when you're new in a place and you're trying to find your face you know the other new people like they're great comfort to you and guides and also just from like storytelling point of view if you leave one place and\nStarted a whole new life in another country that instantly there's a story there isn't there like there's a journey\nSo drawn to immigrants kind of adventure of that\nAnd I suppose you know so many comedians have podcasts [laughter]\nUm but I never wanted to do and I certainly had offers before I never wanted to do on that was just like comedians talking about like how they got started in comedy or whatever I think that's ground as well trodden I'm sill one strange thing about like you know I live in New York and\nForty five percent of New Yorkers are born in a different country but like I don't hear it them I only hear I'm American voices on you know a lot of a lot of media like podcasts and TV and radio\nAnd say how to because I like how the platform where immigrants got to tell her own story and so that was kind of my that was kind of my motivation I didn't realize [laughter] you know my um my son my producer we're kind of coming up the idea and working on us\nTo add to that hasn't Fifteen and then it got picked up in the summer of two dozen sixteen so you know I didn't realize than how immigration has always been such a heated\nPolitical topic in America yeah Bush it obviously ramped rice up with them you know a president that was elected on an anti immigrant tickets and then somebody who's gone after you know the administration has gone off to immigrants in such a\nKind of brutal away I didn't know that was going to happen when I started to do the ... do you have a favorite guests that you've had on your podcast well somebody's story really stuck with me with ... ah his name is Mohammed does that but like\nEveryone just cause and do they cause in his school it was like fifty Mohammed so he's a luggage salesman here in midtown in New York and he is also a Syrian asylum seeker and the reason I liked him\nAnd I liked just spending time with him was because well actually kind of reminds me of one of my own because it also because yeah even though he's like the same age and the bus there's just something about him that reminds me of my uncle I think it was kind of he makes like dad jokes and I I mean [laughter]\nBut the thing that was kind of ... you hear all about like Syrian refugees and Syrian asylum seekers and\nCurrently Syrians I'm banned from entering the U.S\nAnd then you meet that that and he's just like you know a chubby guy and his parents to use\nI spoke to my was an older it's either we end up in the refugee ... and it was not going to be one visa officer didn't speak English at me and swim ...", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Beta", "city":
